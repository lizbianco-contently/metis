Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from North Dakota \nand also say that I hope we can make some good sense out of this budget \nresolution. It is not the first time we have had a budget resolution, \nbut I hope we can show that we are exercising leadership in getting one \nthat makes sense.\n  I rise to speak about something that I hear more about at home than \nany other subject. It is astounding, frankly. I was home last weekend, \nhome prior weekends. I hear more and more on this one subject than any \nother, and that is Social Security.\n  People in Montana walk up to me and say: Senator, please save Social \nSecurity. Don't adopt the privatization plan. It doesn't make sense.\n  In my experience as a public servant, I have never experienced such a \nbroadside of reaction on Social Security compared to any other issue I \nhave ever faced. It is that great.\n  Let me tell a little about what I think Montanans are really \nthinking. Here is what Montanans are telling me about Social Security.\n  A man from Helena, MT, put it this way:\n\n       I have been an employee and employer for 55 years. The \n     Social Security system is the only solid, dependable program \n     that I and everyone I have been involved with can rely on.\n\n  Laura from Baker, MT, says:\n\n       It seems to me that our Social Security system has worked \n     well for many, many years. I cannot understand the \n     President's desire to reform it.\n\n  Well, when it comes to trying to understand why the President wants \nto privatize Social Security, Laura is not alone. Let me talk a little \nbit about the President's plan to privatize Social Security and what it \nwould mean in practical terms.\n  The first thing we have to do is to put aside the notion that \nprivatizing Social Security has anything to do with strengthening \nSocial Security and preserving Social Security for the long run. It \ndoes not. Privatization has nothing to do with preserving Social \nSecurity for the long run--nothing.\n  In fact, it undermines Social Security. Social Security's actuaries--\nthese are the Congressional Budget Office folks, and we all agree they \nare totally nonpartisan, straight shooters--agree that privatizing \nSocial Security does not improve the solvency of the Social Security. \nIn fact, they believe it makes it worse.\n  Bobby from Eureka, MT, put it this way:\n\n       I strongly oppose President George Bush's proposal to \n     privatize Social Security or any part of it. I feel this is \n     only the first step to dismantling Social Security all \n     together.\n\n  She is concerned about the first step to dismantle Social Security, \nand there is a real basis for her beliefs because the private accounts \nhave nothing to do with solvency. Many of us are wondering whether \nBobby might be right.\n  We have to start with the proposition that President Bush is looking \nsomewhere else besides private accounts for the real answer to \nextending Social Security solvency. To be candid, none of us know \nexactly how the President wants to pay for extending Social Security \nsolvency.\n  He hasn't given us a specific proposal. In the State of the Union \nspeech, however, he mentioned five possibilities. What are they? One \nwas limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Another one he mentioned is \nindexing benefits to prices rather than to wages. He also mentioned \nincreasing retirement age. Further, he mentioned discouraging early \ncollection of Social Security benefits. Five, changing the way benefits \nare calculated. All of those options the President has mentioned have \none thing in common: they all cut benefits.\n  Even if we do not know for sure how the President wants to cut Social \nSecurity benefits, the administration has not been all that subtle \nabout their druthers. For months, President Bush and many in the \nadministration hinted that their preference is one of the plans put \nforward by the President's Commission on Social Security. What is that? \nThat plan would divert Social Security payroll taxes into new private \nsavings accounts. As I said, that has nothing to do with solvency. I \nwill come back to that later. But that plan would also deeply cut \nSocial Security benefits for future beneficiaries by changing the way \nthe benefits are calculated. The President's plan would cut benefits, \nin the President's words, by indexing benefits to prices rather than to \nwages. What does that mean? What is the effect of that? Let me explain.\n  Under current law, when the Government calculates a worker's initial \nSocial Security benefit, the Government adjusts the worker's past \nearnings for the growth in wages and the economy. Under the President's \nplan, the Government would adjust the worker's past earnings for the \ngrowth in prices, not in wages but in prices. What is the effect of \nthat? Most people don't realize it, but wages actually grow faster than \nprices. Wages actually grow faster in the long run. People see prices \nrising all the time, but folks do not always focus on how much their \nwages increase. Wages generally keep up and surpass the increase of \nprices. On average, over time, wages grow faster than prices. Why is \nthat? That is largely because workers today are more productive than \nworkers used to be. Workers today produce more than workers did years \nago. Economists call that productivity. They are more productive, so \nworkers today demand higher wages. They are more productive, so they \nhave higher wages, even after adjusting for inflation. Even though \ninflation goes up, workers are more productive, so wages rise faster \nthan inflation, even though prices are going up. So adjusting the \ninitial benefits to a growth in wages makes sense. It is current law. \nIt makes sure Social Security will replace roughly the same share of \nfuture retirement incomes as it did for previous generations of \nretirees.\n  What does the Commission plan to do about that? Their plan to move \nfrom wage indexing to a price index means initial benefits for retirees \nin the future would gradually start to get smaller and smaller than \nthey would under current law. Because these reductions in benefits \nwould accumulate over time, each new group of retirees would get that \nmuch more of a cut in their benefits relative to what the current law \npromises them.\n  This chart shows the story. It is very illustrative. I hope people \npay attention to this. I daresay that every American concerned about \nSocial Security would take a good long hard look at this chart and they \nwould realize the deeper problems in the President's proposal. This \nchart shows under current law--talking about what the law is today--\nsucceeding generations of retirees can expect Social Security to \nreplace a relatively constant amount of their income. This yellow line \nshows for people who start to retire today--when they retire, their \nSocial Security benefits are going to be about 40 percent of their \nprevious wages. As wages go up over time and people retire, they get \nabout 40 percent of their wages just before they retire. That is called \nreplacement income. That is the law, and it stays at about 40 percent \nout into the future.\n  On average, Social Security promises to replace about 40 percent of \nincome year after year, represented by the yellow line. If we adopt the \nCommission's plan, what happens? That means the share of income Social \nSecurity replaced would go down. That is the red line here. So over \ntime these cuts become very deep. For workers now in their midthirties, \nbenefits will be cut by about 25 percent. For somebody born about now--\none of our children or grandchildren--benefits will be cut in half. You \nsee this red line comes about half of where the yellow line is. So \nsomebody who enters the workforce about now, under the President's \nplan, when he or she retires, is going to receive almost 20 percent of \nwages, not 40 percent. That is a 50-percent cut. So a person would get \nmuch less under the President's plan in the future.\n  I am looking at some of these pages on the floor. When they work, and \nif this plan goes into effect, their Social Security benefits will be \nhalf when they retire compared to what it would be today under current \nlaw if they could retire. I don't know if they would want that.\n  If the Commission's plan had been in place when Social Security began \nto pay benefits in 1940--reverse that. Say the President's plan was in \neffect then; benefits for average earnings would be 60 percent less \nthan today. If the President's plan had been in effect in 1940--I was \nborn in 1941--then the benefits I would receive today, or anybody my \nage, would be, under the President's\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nplan, much less than I would get today if I retired. How much less? You \ncan tell by this chart. Today I would get about $1,278 a month. Under \nthe President's plan, if I retired today, and this were in effect since \n1940, I would get $515 a month. Let me state that again. Under current \nlaw, a worker with average wages who retires in 2005 will get about a \n$1,278 monthly Social Security check. Had the Commission's plan been in \neffect since 1940, that average worker would get only $515 a month in \nSocial Security. That is $515 a month instead of $1,278.\n  Remember, this is kind of a startling statistic. For one-fifth of our \nseniors, Social Security is their total source of income. For 20 \npercent of seniors today, Social Security is all of their income. So no \nmatter where you live, this is what you get in Social Security. If this \nplan had been in effect in 1940, seniors would be receiving $515 a \nmonth now, a lot less than they receive. That kind of cut in benefits \nwould mean that a lot more seniors would be living in poverty. Had the \nCommission's plan been in effect since 1940, 7 million more seniors \nwould be living in poverty today. Today, about 3.6 million seniors are \nliving in poverty. That is not good. That is bad, but that is a fact. \nIf the President's law had been in effect since 1940, then 10.5 million \nseniors would be living in poverty--more than three times that.\n  Someone might say: This isn't going to happen to me under the \nPresident's plan. Why? Because I am not going to participate in those \nprivate accounts. I will stay away from that. I will just do nothing \nand keep my payroll tax, which will still go into the Social Security \ntrust fund. I don't have a private account, so this should not affect \nme. Then I won't have my benefits cut.\n  Guess what. That is not right. Under the Commission's plan, the \nPresident's proposed plan, these cuts would apply even if you did not \nchoose to participate in private accounts. That may not seem fair, but \nthat is a fact. These are the cuts you get irrespective of whether you \nparticipate in a private account. It makes no difference whether you do \nor do not participate in a private account.\n  Another question people might ask is, Will these cuts apply to people \nwith disabilities, to survivors? To be candid, none of us knows for \nsure, but the Commission's numbers show that savings of people with \ndisabilities and survivors were included. That means they are going to \nget cut, too. We are talking about widows or orphans here. Listen to \nthe words of Linda from Great Falls, MT:\n\n       My father died when I was 13 years old. My mom went to work \n     as a bookkeeper making a little over $200 a month. Our entire \n     lives changed, and without the assistance of Social Security \n     benefits, I would never have been able to attend college.\n\n  Social Security is a vital lifeline for millions of Americans. We \nhave to be very careful about how we change it. In addition to the cuts \nabout which I have been talking so far, the President has a plan. It \nincludes a second set of cuts; that is, a second set of cuts for \nanybody who signs up for the privatized accounts. Remember, I talked \nabout the first round of cuts and benefits. There is a second round.\n\n  Under the plan, when workers retire, the Social Security benefits \nwould be further reduced by, first, all of the contributions to the \nworker's private account. That amounts to an additional reduction in \nbenefits. Then there is another reduction, and what is that? That is \nthe interest that those contributions would have earned had they earned \na 3-percent rate of return above inflation. Some people call it a \n``clawback.'' I call it a privatization tax.\n  This next chart, number 4, shows the story. It shows a case of a \ntypical worker born in 1990. So a person born in 1990 retires in 2055. \nI suppose that would probably apply to a lot of our younger people. \nAfter all, this has been pitched for our younger people. Under current \nlaw, that person would get $23,300 each year from Social Security. So \nunder current law, someone who is born in 1990 and retires in 2055, at \nage 65, that person will get about $23,300 in benefits from Social \nSecurity.\n  Let's talk about the cuts. The first cut under the President's plan \nis in benefits, due to changing from wage indexing to price indexing, \nas I mentioned earlier. What is the effect of that? That would cut a \nworker's Social Security payments to $13,104 a year. That change \nalone--cutting all benefits of all retirees under the President's plan \nby moving from wage indexing to price indexing--means the benefits that \nperson will receive in 2055, born in 1990, would not be $23,000, but a \nwhole whopping roughly $10,000 a year less, a cut down to $13,000 a \nyear.\n  Then there is a second cut. That is the cut due to the privatization \ntax. That would cut a worker's Social Security benefits further. How \nmuch further? Down to a mere $3,276 a year. Just think of this for a \nminute; suspend judgment and let this sink in. This is what is \nhappening under the President's plan. Today, that person would get \n$23,000 in Social Security benefits. The first cut applies to everybody \nin the President's plan irrespective of whether you have a private \naccount. So everybody will get a cut by $10,000 a year, down to $13,000 \na year. What about those folks who say: Gee, I am going to beat the \nsystem and I am going to divert 3 or 4 percentage points of my payroll \ntax into my private accounts. I am going to beat the system.\n  Wrong. What is really the fine print of the President's probable \nplan? What is the effect? It is a further deep cut of another $10,000. \nSo the benefit that a person is going to receive is going to be not \n$23,000 but, rather, only $3,000 a year. The proponents tell us that: \nGee, if they keep their private account, that will be made up by the \nincome they will get from the private account, earnings they will get \nfrom the private accounts.\n  Let me just say what the Congressional Budget Office says about this \npart here, the red part on the chart about earnings. What do they say? \nThey say workers with average earnings will be back to where they were \nin this middle bar, up to close to $13,000. So that means that after \nall the shouting, workers who are now 25 to 35 years old will have \ntotal retirement income cut--Social Security benefits plus income from \nthe private accounts--total income cut by about a quarter below what \ncurrent law promises.\n  Think of that for a moment. What did people think when they learned \nabout all this? Some know about this, but a lot do not. Do you want to \nknow something, Mr. President? I found something very startling about 2 \nweeks ago. I hope you will listen to this point because it is pretty \nimportant. The point is this: I asked a Senator on the other side of \nthe aisle about 2 weeks ago: Senator, I wonder, does your side \nunderstand the fine print of the President's proposal? Does it really \nunderstand it? His answer--this was a private conversation--his answer \nwas: Not really.\n  I said to the Senator: Do you mind if I explain what it does, what \nthe practical effect of all this is? I do not want to be pedantic about \nit.\n  He said: Sure; what is it?\n  So I explained all this to him. He was amazed. He did not know all \nthat. I take him at his word. He said most of the other side did not \nunderstand it. Maybe he was being very generous and actually they did. \nBut I was startled by this conversation. He said most do not understand \nit.\n  Second, it was a revelation to him when I explained what it actually \ndoes.\n  I mention all this because I think it is important for the facts to \nget out. Facts often speak louder than words. I hope the facts get out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator has used his allotted \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I may have a few more minutes, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield another 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I repeat, workers 25 to 35 years old will have total retirement \nincome; that is, Social Security benefit cuts, plus their income from \nthe private accounts--that is income, not the principal reduced by 3 \npercent--cut by about a quarter below what current law promises. Those \nwith average earnings born in this decade who retire at age 65 will \nhave their total retirement income cut in half--again, their total \nretirement income cut in half. For those who participate in private \naccounts, their total income will be cut in half. That is all based on \nCBO's assumption that the private account will\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nget a rate of return of 3 percent over and above inflation. It could \nget more, but it could get less.\n  Let me remind people that what goes up may also come down. In the \nlate 1920s in America, people might have expected their stocks to go up \nat least 3 percent a year after inflation. As this chart shows, stocks \nwent down nearly 90 percent between 1929 and 1932. From its high in \n1929 of 381, the Dow fell to 41 in 1932.\n  Under the President's plan, what would happen to your Social Security \nbenefit if the stock market crashed? You would still need to pay the \nfull privatization tax on all the contributions to the worker's private \naccount plus 3-percent interest above inflation. That is even if you \ndid not earn that much. Under the President's plan, you still have to \npay all that.\n  So under the President's privatization plan, your Social Security \ncheck will be reduced by more than what you have put in your private \naccount. The only thing that would be guaranteed would be this little \ngreen bar at the end of $3,276 a year. I challenge anyone to explain to \nme how they can live on $3,276 a year. Under the President's plan, that \nis all you would be guaranteed. Under current law, you are guaranteed \n$23,000. If the stock market crashes and you are in a private account, \nyour guarantee will only be $3,000. Come on, I do not think people want \nto do that. I do not think Congress wants to do that.\n\n  As Frederick from Great Falls, MT, asked:\n\n       [I]f the bottom falls out of the market, who takes care of \n     them then?\n\n  Some say we cannot sustain Social Security's current promises anyway. \nBut the Commission's cuts would be deeper than if we did absolutely \nnothing to Social Security. If we did nothing to extend the life of \nSocial Security--and no one is recommending that--but if Congress did \nnothing--again, no one is recommending we do nothing; we have to do \nsomething that makes sense--if we did nothing, then according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, in 2052, we would still be able to pay 80 \npercent of promised benefits. In contrast, under the Commission's \nplan--that is the President's probable plan--benefits would be cut \nbefore 2052 and benefits would be cut deeper than that in 2052 and \nafter.\n  This chart puts it together. For that typical worker born in 1990, \ncurrent law promises Social Security benefits to be $23,300, as I \nmentioned earlier. But even if we do nothing--again, I do not advocate \ndoing nothing; we have to do something--Social Security would be able \nto pay that worker $18,100 a year. The Commission's plan would cut that \nto $13,104, and the President's privatization tax cut would cut the \nguaranteed benefit to $3,276. In all likelihood, the worker would get a \ntotal package of benefits--their Social Security plus their private \naccount--in the neighborhood of $13,104.\n  We do not know how much the rate of return is going to be. That is \nwhy it is red with a question mark. It could go up; it could go down. \nIt has to be a high level annual rate of return to equal, frankly, what \none would get in total benefits, even after the cuts. As I said, this \nchart puts it altogether.\n  That is why the President's privatization plan does not make any \nsense. From the perspective of typical beneficiaries, it would leave \nthem worse off than if we did nothing. Worse off than if we did \nnothing--let that sink in a little bit. The President's plan would \nleave people worse off compared to if we did nothing, at least over the \nnext 40 to 50 years, through 2052. That is roughly the next 60 years--\nworse off. That is before we take into account the $5 trillion in new \nborrowing that the President's plan requires in its first 20 years. I \ndid not talk about that.\n  Let me summarize. We have demonstrated conclusively why people would \nbe worse off under the President's plan than they would be under \ncurrent law. Now we add another huge problem with the President's plan. \nWhat is that? That is the $5 trillion of new borrowing the President's \nplan would require in its first 20 years; $5 trillion of additional \nborrowing. We are already deeply in debt.\n  Jack from Kalispell, MT, wrote me of his suspicion on this:\n\n       President Bush is proposing a gimmick to take attention \n     away from plans to reduce future benefits. I believe the \n     Federal Government should solve its own solvency problems \n     and either stop borrowing from the Social Security trust \n     [fund] or actually pay back its loan with market rates for \n     interest.\n\n  Jack may have a point. The private accounts are a gimmick, and the \nbenefit cuts are bad enough that anyone associated with them might want \nto divert their attention away from them.\n  The reason why the cuts are so deep is because the Commission's plan \nwould place all of the burdens of securing solvency on benefit cuts--\nall of the burden of solvency on benefit cuts, all of it, all. Within \nbenefits cuts, the Commission's plan would place all the burdens of \nsecuring solvency on today's young people and future beneficiaries. He \nis passing the buck. First he says, OK, all of the solvency solution is \non the back of the beneficiaries in terms of benefit cuts. And the $5 \ntrillion, who is going to pay for that? That is going to be young \npeople in future generations, future taxpayers. They are going to have \nto pay back that $5 trillion. That is the effect of switching from wage \nindexing to price indexing, and I do not think that is fair.\n  Look at this chart again. The President's plan would change Social \nSecurity from a guaranteed $23,300 in earned benefit to a guaranteed \n$3,000--23 down to 3, plus a gamble. That is a benefit you would get \nfrom the President's plan. You are guaranteed $3,000 and you are \nguaranteed a gamble. It may pay off and be big. The gamble may not pay \noff. You may lose your shirt. No wonder people wonder whether the \nPresident's plan is more about, as Bobby from Eureka, MT, put it, \n``only the first step to dismantling Social Security altogether.'' She \nis concerned about that. When you look at the effect of the President's \nplan, you begin to think that maybe Bobby is on to something here.\n  That is why Democrats have called upon the President to disavow his \nplan for private accounts funded out of Social Security. We ask him to \ndo so, why? Because we want to make sure these private accounts are \nnot, in Bobby's words, ``the first step to dismantling Social Security \naltogether.''\n  Democrats want to address Social Security's solvency. You bet we do. \nThere is a problem here. It is not a crisis. It is a problem we should \naddress now rather than later. We want to strengthen and protect Social \nSecurity for the future. We do think there is a problem. But in order \nto do that, we need reassurance that the changes we agree to will \nstrengthen Social Security, not dismantle it. The President needs to \ndisavow privatizing Social Security. That is a necessary first step. He \nneeds to state he does not want to dismantle Social Security and has to \ndo that before we can agree on how to fix it. If he makes that \nstatement, boy, you bet there would be a big rush in the Congress, on \nboth sides of the aisle, to fix the solvency problem in Social \nSecurity.\n  That is the problem Americans worry about, solvency of Social \nSecurity. That is their concern, so let's address their concern.\n  Mary from Belgrade, MT, summed it up pretty well. She wrote:\n\n       The American Social Security system is one of the most \n     cost-effective pension plans ever devised. It costs a \n     pittance to administer, it is thoroughly honest, and it works \n     flawlessly. ``Privatizing'' it will almost certainly ruin it.\n\n  Privatizing will almost certainly ruin it.\n\n       It would add hugely to the crushing burden of national \n     debt, it would mean smaller retirement pensions for millions \n     of retiring Americans, and it would cost 20 to 30 times more \n     to administer. Congress has a duty to the American people to \n     protect this popular, inexpensive, highly effective program. \n     I implore you, Senator Baucus, to tell the President you \n     oppose privatization, and to legislate only a plan that will \n     fix long-term problems without changing the basic structure \n     and function of our Social Security system.\n\n  Nobody could have said it better. Mary knows what is going on here. \nShe figured it out. I think a lot of Americans are also beginning to \nfigure it out. And when more figure it out, we have no choice but to \naddress solvency and to take privatization totally off the table.\n  Mr. President, you can help us a lot if you were to make that \nstatement.\n  Mary has it right. We need to get beyond plans to privatize Social \nSecurity. And once we do, we can get about the business of ``fix[ing \nits] long-term problems'' and securing it for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n  That is why I will support the amendment by the senior Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his additional time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might have 1 more minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional minute off the resolution to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, that is why the senior Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, is going to offer an amendment on Social Security \nlater this week. It is why I urge my colleagues to support it. We want \nto keep Social Security, in the words of that man from Helena, as ``the \nonly solid, dependable program that [we] can rely on.'' They want to \nkeep it. They should keep it. We want to keep it. It is ``the only \nsolid, dependable program'' seniors can rely on.\n  We want to keep it, in the words of Laura from Baker, MT, a ``system \n[that] has worked well for many, many years.'' And we want to keep a \nsystem that can work well for ``many, many years to come.''\n  I very much thank my good friend from North Dakota. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 25 minutes.\n  I rise in support of the budget resolution that is before the Senate, \nand I support the leadership of our new chairman. He has shown \ntremendous leadership on a very tough issue.\n  This budget is about the future. It is about our children and our \ngrandchildren, as is Social Security. I was pleased to hear the Senator \nfrom Montana admit we do have a problem with Social Security. We have \nsome Members who apparently do not think there is a problem with Social \nSecurity. I would like to go back to Social Security perhaps at a later \ntime.\n  We have before us a budget resolution. We have to keep in mind that \nthis budget resolution is about numbers. We are not getting into the \nspecifics of the program, even though we are going to see a lot of \namendments on the floor today that are going to be dealing with \nspecifics of the program. In reality, this is about numbers. It is \nabout the top numbers and how the numbers are allocated among the \nvarious committees. But the real decisions about how those dollars are \ngoing to be spent will rest, in some cases, with an authorization \ncommittee, or it may rest with the Appropriations Committee.\n  If we look back historically at the budget, particularly in the last \nfew years, the growth of the national budget, as reflected in the \nbudget resolution, has been greater than what the growth of the economy \nhas been. This budget is an attempt to reduce the rate of growth.\n  There are some people who are going to try to characterize that as \ncuts, but if we look at the total figures in the budget, what we are \ndoing is reducing the rate of growth. Even if we look at what we have \ndone to reduce the rate of growth in entitlements, which has covered so \nmuch of the discussion throughout the budget debate, the growth in \nentitlements is greater than the growth in the economy.\n  So we are talking about reducing the rate of growth. I believe this \nresolution represents a courageous balancing act in trying to bring \nsome sanity to the budgeting process, some fiscal responsibility.\n  We are funding our social and military priorities. The total \ndiscretionary budget authority for 2006 is $834.4 billion. Most of that \nis defense spending. We have about $438 billion, or something like \nthat, that is set aside for discretionary spending in that area. The \nresolution is consistent with the President's request, plus a generous \nincrease for some educational programs, particularly Pell grants.\n  The resolution assumes full funding of the President's defense \nrequest, which is supporting our global war on terrorism, restructuring \nour U.S. forces, which I believe is badly needed, future threats, and \nraising the quality of life for our men and women in uniform. We have \nsome tough decisions that have to be made when we are allocating these \ndollars, and they do have an impact.\n  The resolution funds important existing commitments--certainly the \nreconstruction of Iraq. Nobody can deny the importance of that. We did \nnot step away from that. That is an obligation we have assumed, and it \nis important we finish the job.\n  We have a $50 billion reserve fund put up in this particular budget \nto begin to address the needs of our men and women in the military.\n  In education, I mentioned the Pell grant increase, increases in \nhigher education, No Child Left Behind--the increase in Pell grants of \n10 percent or $417 million; we have a $5.5 billion reserve account for \nthe new Higher Education Act, which is money that is going to be \navailable when the HELP Committee acts.\n  The budget features sound and vital mechanisms for fiscal restraint \nand budget discipline, which is something we have lost here in the last \nfew years. I think we have to regain that. It is important that we do \nsomething to reduce deficit spending. This is something that will \nimpact our children and grandchildren, if we do not begin to address it \ntoday. And the sooner we address it, the better off we are going be.\n  If a business is having financial problems or any entity is having \nfinancial problems, I think everybody recognizes that if you wait until \nthe last minute to address those financial problems, they get \nunsolvable. But the earlier you address those problems, the better off \nyou are.\n  We do have some Social Security problems. My feeling is the sooner we \nbegin to address them, the less the pain is going to be. There is going \nto be some pain, but the pain is going to be less. If we wait until the \nlast minute, the pain is going to be unbearable in Social Security.\n  We have the same thing with many of our other entitlements programs. \nThis budget begins to set discretionary budgets for 2006, 2007, and \n2008, which is something that is enforced with the 60-vote point of \norder. It is a way of expecting a higher threshold if you want to \nincrease spending. If we begin to mortgage the future of our children \nand grandchildren, then we are going to require a higher threshold in \nthis Congress to be able to do that, which means the issue has to be \nthat much more important in the minds of Senators and the Congress.\n  We establish points of order against new direct spending totaling $5 \nbillion in any of the next four 10-year periods.\n\n  The resolution continues sensible mechanisms for nondefense spending, \nadvance appropriations, and pay-go, and it contains recommendations for \na review of Federal agencies and their performance to eliminate or \nreduce wasteful, duplicative, inefficient, outdated, or failed \nprograms. This idea in particular represents a growing sentiment within \nthe body. I believe it represents a growing sentiment that we are \nseeing throughout the Nation. We have seen some efforts to try to \nrestrain spending in high priorities areas in this Congress, such as \ndefense. We are preparing to go through the BRAC process where we are \nlooking closely at defense installations to see if they still meet the \nmission of a modern military. We need to have a similar type of \nscrutiny in the nondefense programs, to see if they continue to meet \nthe mission the Congress intended of them when they first passed the \nlegislation. That is being provided for by GPRA, which stands for \nGovernment Progress and Results Act, which measures how agencies do. \nThe President has taken this and modified it to prevail as sort of a \ndetailed roadmap through what he called his PART ratings, which is a \nroadmap I think Congress should pay more attention to.\n  So he is looking at some accountability within the agencies. Again, \nwe are not talking about anything more than just a reduction in the \nrate of spending as far as the total budget is concerned.\n  This budget represents a landmark attempt to do something about \nentitlement spending. The first attempt was 19 years ago when there was \nan attempt to rein in entitlement spending in a budget resolution. So \nit has been awhile since we have looked at these. In the meantime these \nprograms have been running on automatic. They have been spending more \nthan what has been happening in the growth rate of our economy. Over \ntime we are going to pay for it. It is going to be our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The resolution includes instructions to produce mandatory savings of \n$32 billion over 5 years. This is a very important provision that is \nbeing wildly\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nexaggerated. We have to keep in mind that mandatory spending is two-\nthirds of our total budget. The total budget is running at 2, a little \nover $2.5 trillion. Figure it out. We are only talking about $32 \nbillion over 5 years. If you want to average it out, it is a little \nover $6 billion a year out of this 1 year's budget of over $2.5 \ntrillion. So many of these provisions I think are being wildly \nexaggerated. Mandatory spending would still increase from $1.5 trillion \nin 2005 to more than $2 trillion in 2010. That is a growth of $500 \nbillion in 5 years.\n  So even though we are cutting back on the rate of spending growth, it \nis still increasing every year, and it is still increasing at a rate of \n$500 billion over a 5-year period of time. Some people in this body say \nthat is too many cuts, but I look at these figures and I wonder who \nthey are kidding.\n  The doomsday cuts in this resolution barely add up to a moderate \nrestraint of the stratospheric growth of these programs. Many people \nagree that entitlement spending is swallowing the budget and we must \nlook seriously at our long-term fiscal health. The Federal Government \nconsumes just under 20 percent of our total economy, and entitlements \npromise to grow and consume a larger and larger portion of this sizable \nchunk of our gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office, \nfor example, estimates 65 percent of Federal resources by 2015. We had \ntestimony in the Budget Committee from the Congressional Budget Office \nwhich said these were not sustainable--a personal view. I have to \nagree, when you look at 65 percent of Federal resources by 2015 as far \nas entitlement growth is concerned, that is a serious problem, and this \nCongress needs to face up to it.\n\n  Despite the unanimous agreement that we must do something about it \nbefore our grandkids have to bear our policy burdens, I hear nothing \nfrom the other side except more money, more and more and more. I don't \nhear any suggestions on what their budget proposal is. They want to \nraise taxes, they want to increase spending. That is the only plan we \nget out of the other side. In some ways there is an analogy on Social \nSecurity. The other side is continuing to criticize Social Security, \nbut they don't--and some of them, like Senator Baucus of Montana, agree \nnow that there is a problem with Social Security, but there is no plan \nthey are putting forward. The President has courageously stepped \nforward and suggested some plans to protect our children and \ngrandchildren. They are very modest. He has done that with the budget. \nHe is doing that with Social Security.\n  Last week's markup I thought was very revealing. We had numerous \namendments for additional spending in the Budget Committee and the \npromise of an alternative budget they said through amendments. That is \nhow they were going to make their budget heard. It is easy to pick out \na budget through amendments, but I would like to see a total budget \nplan presented by the other side if this budget is so bad. But nothing \nhas materialized except more spending and the reductions of the \nenormously successful tax cuts. And those tax cuts were successful. \nThat is what has created the economic growth we are seeing today.\n  I had some experience in the House being in the minority which the \nother aisle finds themselves in, and we had the courage to step forward \nwith a total budget and to make tough choices. We were challenged by \nthe majority, by the Democrats in the House at the time I served on the \nBudget Committee, to come up with our own budget, and we said, yes, in \nfairness of debate, we ought to have one. So we did put forward a \nbudget, a total budget about where we wanted to see the country be in 5 \nyears, even in 10 years, and we compared that with the majority, the \nDemocrats on the House side during those early years, and as a result \nof that, I think we established some credibility.\n  My challenge to the other side is, you need to come up with your \nbudget. You need to make the tradeoffs. Just submitting amendments here \nand there and picking at certain parts of the budget for political \nreasons or because it is an easy program to pick on or whatever is not \nthe way to put together a budget for this country. So I challenge the \nother side to come up with a total budget and see what their ideas are \nand what they are going to do to protect the future generations of \nAmericans, our children and our grandchildren.\n  This resolution makes a minor adjustment to the explosive growth of \nMedicaid. You would think the sky was falling, and here is the percent \nof adjustment--.007 percent of Medicaid over 5 years. That is all we \nare touching. Now, there is still a huge increase going on in Medicaid, \nas far as I am concerned. We are just reducing that growth from what \nhas been projected out so that there is a .007 percent of Medicaid \nbeing impacted over 5 years, which is a reduction. It appears to me \nthat the only option that would be given from the other side is a tax \nincrease without smothering growth and solving the underling problems\n\n  The clock is ticking. The Budget Committee testimony by the \nComptroller General of the GAO revealed estimates that our Nation's \nunfunded promises over the next 75 years are $44 trillion. In the \nentire history of the Federal Government we have raised a total of only \n$38 trillion in revenue. That is astounding testimony. We cannot wish \nthis away. We cannot rely solely on economic growth. And we cannot tax \nour kids and grandkids into oblivion to solve these problems. Annual \nmandatory spending is on autopilot, rarely undergoing the kind of \nexamination we give to the issue of steroids in Major League Baseball, \nfor example. And this is much more important.\n  CBO's baseline projects net mandatory spending will grow at an annual \nrate of 5.8 percent over the next 10 years. That is $5.4 trillion in \ntotal growth above 2005 spending levels. This resolution offers a \nmodest reduction in the rate of that growth--a courageous and important \nstep in our thinking around here.\n  The resolution offers a very good start. If someone has a better \nplan, again, not just a series of constant amendments but a budget, we \nwill be here to discuss it.\n  Provisions to protect the taxpayer and promote growth are in this \nbudget.\n  The resolution includes assumptions focusing on preventing \neconomically damaging tax increases. The President's tax cuts, which \nwere passed by this Congress, have helped the economy grow. They have \nincreased revenues, and not only to the Federal Government. We can see \nthat happening in our States. In my State of Colorado we are beginning \nto see a change in revenues.\n  Provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Package Reconciliation \nof 2003 are set to expire after tax year 2008. We need to address that.\n  The budget assumes we will continue the tax cuts that stimulate the \neconomic development that ended our Nation's short recession. Without \nthis budget, capital gains taxes would jump from 15 percent to 20 \npercent. If there is one tax reduction out there that has been an \nincentive which stimulated the economic growth, it has been capital \ngains. We saw that happen during the Kennedy administration. That is \none of the tax cuts President Kennedy advocated when he was in office \nto stimulate revenues in the Federal Government. We have seen that \nduring the Reagan administration. I have seen it happen in the State of \nColorado. When we had capital gains adjustments, we saw the revenues \nimprove, as far as State revenues. We have seen it happen again. When \nwe dropped capitol gains rates, we saw the tremendous impact it had on \nthe economy which resulted in more revenues to the Federal Government.\n  Without this budget, taxes on individual income would jump from 15 \npercent to as much as 35 percent. Incentives for small business owners \nto invest would be set to expire in 2007. Without this budget, it would \ndry up. Not extending these tax cuts is like declaring economic war on \nsmall businesses and investment.\n  One of the important things we did was focus on small business. That \nis where most of our economic growth is. We helped them write off more \non their expensing. There was a dramatic increase in what we allowed \nthem to write off on expensing. That is one of the things that helped \nsmall business and contributed a lot to our economic growth.\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\n  In my view, small business is the key to our economic growth. \nReconciliation instructions in this budget direct the Finance Committee \nto produce more tax relief--$70.2 billion over 5 years. That means more \neconomic development, more investment, more savings.\n  We do not tell them how they are going to meet these things, but we \nput the dollars in there and we direct them in that direction. \nPersonally, as many colleagues, I would endorse a larger number of tax \nrelief provisions because I believe it is more money in the hands of \nbusiness owners, more money in the hands of consumers, more money in \nthe hands of parents and investors. It stimulates greater growth, \neducation, savings--prosperity at every economic level. Not \nsurprisingly, it will likely increase revenues to State and Federal \nGovernment.\n  The $70.2 billion is a compromise number. We have already worked on \nit. Many of us would have liked to have seen over $100 billion. We \nthought that would be more appropriate to keep our economy growing. But \nworking with the Members of the Senate, the budget chairman, to his \ncredit, has come up with what I think is a reasonable number. It is a \nnumber I can support, which is a little over $70 billion, holding down \nthe tax burden.\n  The budget promotes fiscal health and economic development. It holds \ndown the rate of growth in spending and protects the most important \nnational funding priorities we have. It extends expiring tax cuts and \nreconciles tax cuts that have a known stimulative effect. This budget \nprovides new disciplinary tools for spending restraint. It leads to \noverall deficit and thus debt reduction.\n\n  The mark will cut the deficit in half in 5 years, relative to the \nsize of the economy. Under this resolution, the deficit will fall to \n2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2007; then, as we move on to \n2010, reduce it down to 1.3 percent.\n  Our annual deficits compound our existing debt burden and, long term, \nthere is no greater threat to Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, \neducation--and the taxpayer--or other priorities, than the swelling of \nthe public debt. It is something we must begin to address. I think this \nbudget begins to address it in a serious way.\n  Several years ago I offered the American Debt Repayment Act. It was a \nsuggestion to the Members of Congress that we ought to look at our \nnational debt the way we would the mortgage on our home. We ought to \nput a plan in place a commitment to begin to pay down that debt.\n  This budget we have before us attempts to put in place a plan that \nwill aid us in getting us out of the deficit, in a position where we \ncan begin to pay down the national debt. It is clear if we leave it to \nthe designs of Congress on the floor, things get out of hand and more \nspending happens. But if we have a plan on how we are going to pay down \nthe debt, it gives some parameters. This budget provides somewhat of a \nplan. Congress repeatedly shirks its responsibility when it comes to \nthe debt.\n  So I commend the chairman for doing something in a serious way to \ndeal with our deficit and the debt. Maybe it is time for me to \nreintroduce the legislation to tie our undisciplined hands. This \nresolution before us represents a good start, as I said, in restoring \nsuch discipline.\n  There is one other thing. We have had some comments here about Social \nSecurity and I think Members are beginning to realize we do have a \nproblem with Social Security. Like the budget, this debate on Social \nSecurity is very important to our children and our grandchildren.\n  I think we have to keep in mind that what the President is suggesting \nis not a mandate. If you are under 55 years of age or younger, you \ndon't have to get into private accounts if you don't want to--personal \naccounts, if you don't want to have them. I prefer to refer to them as \npersonal accounts because what we are doing is we are giving individual \ntaxpayers a choice. People who are going to rely on Social Security \nwill have a choice as to how they would like to structure their \nretirement account. We don't mandate them to do anything.\n  Do you know what. If we put in place personal accounts, I think the \nMembers of this Senate, particularly people who are opposing personal \naccounts, would be surprised how many Americans would flock to it. I \nbase my observations on what has happened with Federal employees and \nState employees. Try to suggest to the Federal employees that somehow \nor other they ought to participate in Social Security and give up their \nown retirement plans. It would not be very popular. They have a choice. \nFederal employees have a choice, as Members of Congress have a choice.\n  They have a choice. Do they want to put their money in the stock \nmarket? They don't invest in individual stocks. It goes into a fund \nthat is managed, and these professional investors manage that stock \nfund. It goes into a bond fund and professional managers manage that. \nOr it goes into Treasury notes. Those are the choices Federal employees \nhave.\n\n  Why can't ordinary Americans, everyday Americans who are out here \nworking on Main Street, why can't they have the same choice as Federal \nemployees? One concern I get from State employees in Colorado is: Don't \nput us in the Social Security system. We have our own retirement \nsystem, called RA. We have a choice, as State employees, where we want \nto put our money for retirement, whether we want it to go into a stock \nmarket fund or whether we want it to go into a bond market fund or \nwhether to put it in some type of Treasury note. They have three \nchoices. That is what I understand the President is talking about.\n  When given the choice of whether they want to go into Social Security \nor they want to go into a similar fund, what we are talking about with \npersonal retirement accounts for Americans, there is a general \nrejection of that idea. Employees on the Federal level, employees on \nthe State level, don't like that idea because they know Social Security \nperforms so poorly, and when they are given their own choices as to how \nthey want to invest their money for their own retirement plans, they \ncan do a better job than the Government can do. That has been reflected \nin history. That has been reflected in the experiences we see \nthroughout the States as well as at the Federal level.\n  Members of Congress have the same choices as Federal employees. \nDuring the Presidential campaign we heard the candidates talking about: \nThe American people should have the same choices as Members of Congress \nhave in retirement. We can go ahead and give them that.\n  I think this is a good budget. I think it tries to address our budget \nin a responsible way. So I urge my colleagues to join me in passing a \nbudget. We need to pass a budget. That is the responsible thing, to get \na budget passed. Then we can continue the debate. I think this is an \nimportant issue and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nresolution. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend. I might say, in regard \nto the recent statement by my good friend from Colorado with respect to \nprivatization accounts--with all due respect, I want to point out, I \ndon't know if he is quite accurate. I would like his response to this.\n  Isn't it true, though, that today Federal employees have both Social \nSecurity and private accounts? In addition to Social Security, that is, \nyou have your Thrift Savings Plan. Federal employees have the Thrift \nSavings Plan, and they also pay into Social Security, which is not the \nPresident's program at all. The President's program is to take money \naway from Social Security and put it into a personal account. Even with \nthe so-called personal account, they wouldn't be able to keep it, as we \nwould our Thrift Savings. They have to give it back to Social Security. \nIt is not even apples and oranges compared to the President's plan, it \nis watermelons and peanuts.\n  There is no comparison. The fact is, again to make it very clear, we \nFederal employees have both Social Security and the private accounts, \nseparate, outside Social Security. We get to keep all we put into our \nprivate account because that is our money, whereas in the President's \nplan, money is taken away from Social Security into a privatization \naccount and the person who\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nhas that account is not able to keep very much of that money. So, as I \nsaid, it is not apples and oranges, it is really watermelons to \npeanuts. Isn't that accurate?\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Montana for his response. I \nappreciate his clarification as far as Federal employees. But the point \nI would make is in the State of Colorado, our employees in the State \ndon't pay into Social Security. I think a lot of other States do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might respond?\n  Mr. ALLARD. If I can finish, the point I want to make is we do give \nchoices to Federal employees in their retirement plan. We do it through \nthe 401(k). We give choices to Members of Congress. We give choices to \nour State employees who do not participate in Social Security. So why \ncan't we give choices to Americans out here on Social Security? We are \nnot mandating them to do this. We give them that choice and give them \nan opportunity to do that.\n  In my view, by giving them an opportunity to do that, actually who \nyou help is the disadvantaged. The people who are better income earners \nare able to utilize individual retirement accounts and 401(k) accounts \nand get the revenue back and do that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have 4 minutes, Mr. President. I don't know if I will \nbe able to use my 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I guess the Senator understands my point, though. And I \nthank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say with respect to State plans, most State plans \nhave both Social Security and private plans, but there are a few States \nthat do have only private plans. That is because in those few States \nthey are so lucrative, the employees have a good deal compared with \nother States. But most States by far have both. Colorado is the \nexception, a State that has one, the main point being we are talking \nabout choice, Thrift Savings, and choosing different kinds of \ninvestment equity that is in a private account today for Federal \nemployees outside of and in addition to Social Security, not carved out \nof Social Security. We are talking about a carve-out. So it is totally \ndifferent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was frankly astonished to hear the \nSenator from Colorado say that Members of Congress and Federal \nemployees have a choice not to participate in Social Security. That is \nnot true.\n  Since 1983, under the new Federal retirement system, FERS, the \nFederal Employees Retirement System, all of us are in the Social \nSecurity system. Members of Congress don't have a choice, if they have \nbeen elected since 1983, as to whether to participate in Social \nSecurity. The Senator from Colorado is flat wrong, absolutely wrong. I \nhave heard this on talk shows around the country--that Members of \nCongress don't participate in Social Security. I want to make very \nclear that this Member participates in Social Security, and every \nMember elected sense 1983 participates in Social Security. Anyone \nsaying something else is flat wrong. It is incorrect and not even close \nto being right.\n  Let us be very clear. Federal employees didn't have a choice as to \nwhether they participated in Social Security. I don't know where the \nSenator from Colorado got this idea. That is just not correct. Under \nthe Federal Employees Retirement System, since 1983, Federal employees \nhave participated in Social Security. That is a fact. It is important \nfor people to know that.\n  The Senator from Colorado also said other things that I think are \nincorrect. The Senator from Colorado said the tax cuts produced more \nrevenue. No, they did not. That is factually incorrect. Here is what \nhappened to the revenue since the tax cuts. The revenue as a share of \ngross domestic product plunged. It didn't go up, it went down.\n  It is amazing to me how facts don't seem to matter when ideology gets \nin the way. Somebody once said everybody is entitled to their own \nopinion, they are not entitled to their own facts. The facts are that \nthe revenue of the United States plunged to the lowest level since 1959 \nafter the tax cuts. That is a fact.\n  Here is a second fact. With the tax cuts, the United States suffered \nthe worst multiyear revenue drop since World War II. That is a fact. \nRevenue did not go up, revenue went down.\n  This is Federal revenues in trillions of constant 2000 dollars. \nRevenue went down 18 percent over 3 years with the tax cuts. Tax cuts \ndid not generate more money, they generated less money. That is a fact.\n  When I hear the claim that this budget before us is fiscally \nresponsible, that is just words. What are the facts? The facts are, \naccording to their own calculation--this is from their own budget \ndocument--the debt goes up each and every year of this budget by over \n$600 billion. It goes up $669 billion this year, it goes up $636 \nbillion next year, $624 billion in 2007, up $622 billion in 2008, and \nup $611 billion in 2009.\n  They say they are improving the deficit. No, they are not. This \nbudget before us makes the deficit worse by $130 billion--worse than if \nwe just put the Government on autopilot and made no policy changes. But \nthis budget does make policy changes, and the policy changes that it \nmakes makes the deficit worse, makes the debt worse in 5 years by over \n$3 trillion of additional debt when we have already got the debt that \nis running away from us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered 144.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that 75-year solvency has been restored to Social \n  Security before Congress considers new deficit-financed legislation \n          that would increase mandatory spending or cut taxes)\n\n       On page 57, after line 2, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . POINT OF ORDER TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST.\n\n       (a) Point of Order in the Senate.--It shall not be in order \n     in the Senate to consider any direct spending or revenue \n     legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit in any \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) Exception.--The point of order established by this \n     section shall not apply if 75-year solvency has been restored \n     to the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Trust \n     Funds as determined by the Social Security Administration \n     actuaries.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote \n     of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.''\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment that I send to the desk is \nthe ``Save Social Security First'' amendment. It acknowledges that we \nhave a challenge in Social Security. Clearly we do. It says what we \nought to do is make Social Security a priority.\n  It says simply this: Before we have any new tax cut, or any new \nmandatory spending, it should be the policy of the Congress to restore \nsolvency to Social Security. What this amendment says is no new tax \ncuts, no new mandatory spending, unless they are paid for, or they can \nachieve a supermajority vote in this Chamber.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It is about priorities. What is most \nimportant? Is it more important to have new spending in other programs? \nThis amendment says no. The priority ought to be to restore solvency in \nSocial Security. Is it a priority to have more tax cuts? This amendment \nsays no. The priority ought to be to restore solvency in Social \nSecurity.\n  This amendment says simply no new mandatory spending or new no tax \ncuts until Social Security is solvent, unless the tax cuts for the new \nspending are paid for or unless they can get a supermajority vote in \nthe Senate. You could have new spending or new tax cuts if, No. 1, you \npay for them or, No. 2, you are able to get a majority vote. If you \ncan't do those things, you can't have new tax cuts and you can't have \nnew mandatory spending unless we achieve solvency in Social Security.\n  For all those who have given speeches all across the country and all \nacross their States about Social Security first, this is a chance to \nput their votes where their speeches are. This is a chance to say, yes, \nthe priority ought\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nto be restoring solvency to Social Security. That ought to come ahead \nof tax cuts, and that ought to come ahead of new spending unless those \nthings are paid for. If you pay for new tax cuts or pay for new \nspending, that is fine. If you can get a supermajority vote, that is \nfine. Otherwise, we have to restore the solvency of Social Security \nfirst.\n  There is no question we have a problem in Social Security. There is \nno question at all. Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office tells \nus that in 2020 the Social Security trust fund will go cash negative; \nin 2052, Social Security will only be able to meet 78 percent of its \nobligations.\n  Clearly, there is a problem. The big driver to the challenge of \nSocial Security is the demographics of the country.\n  Here is what happened. We have about 40 million who are eligible for \nSocial Security now. By 2050, there will be twice as many.\n  That is the demographic challenge that we face. It is not just Social \nSecurity. We face it in Medicare, we face it in Medicaid, and, in fact, \nthe shortfall in Medicare is eight times the shortfall in Social \nSecurity.\n  When we look at the President's budget plan, what we find is instead \nof making it better he makes it all much worse.\n  Why do I say that? Because this chart demonstrates clearly where this \nis all headed. The green bars are the Social Security trust fund. The \nblue bars are the Medicare trust fund. The red bars are the President's \ntax cuts, both those that have been implemented and those he has \nproposed.\n  This shows very clearly that right now we are in the sweet spot. \nRight now we are getting more revenue from the trust funds than we are \npaying out. But as those trust funds go cash negative, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts explodes. The result is the country goes right \nover the fiscal cliff. We are running record deficits now. We haven't \nseen anything yet. Under the President's plan, the deficits and the \ndebt explode, and they explode right when the trust funds go cash \nnegative.\n  The President has indicated that he believes there is a 75-year \nshortfall in Social Security of $3.7 trillion. That is based, by the \nway, on a very pessimistic forecast of economic growth. That is based \non a forecast that says economic growth for the next 75 years will be \n1.8 percent or 1.9 percent. Economic growth in the previous 75 years \nhas averaged 3.4 percent. This whole forecast of Social Security is a \nvery pessimistic forecast.\n  I must say I have great doubt about the accuracy of the underlying \nforecast. But based on that forecast, the President says there is this \nlooming shortfall in Social Security. Interestingly enough, the cost of \nhis tax cuts over that same period are three times as much--$11.6 \ntrillion compared to the $3.7 trillion shortfall he says exists in \nSocial Security.\n  When the President sent up his 2002 budget, he told us at the time:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  That is what he said. That is not what his budget says. His budget \ndoes precisely what he said he would not do. His budget takes every \npenny of Social Security money that is available to pay and uses it to \npay for other things--$2.35 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Just follow this for a moment. The President, on the one hand, says \nSocial Security is short $3.7 trillion over the next 75 years, but he \nsends us a budget that takes $2.5 trillion of Social Security money and \nuses it to pay for other things.\n  How is that consistent? How does that make any sense, on the one \nhand, for the President to say we are short $3.7 trillion in Social \nSecurity over the next 75 years, and then he sends us a budget that \ntakes $2.5 trillion of Social Security money and uses it to pay for \nother things? That is a contradiction of staggering proportion.\n  Interestingly enough, I asked my staff to figure out how much money \nthe President is taking out of Social Security over the next 10 years \nand then tell me how much his tax cuts are over that same period. \nInterestingly enough, here is what they came back with: The President \nis going to take $2.35 trillion of Social Security money over the next \n10 years to pay for other things. The cost of his tax cuts over the \nsame period are almost the identical amount, $2.6 trillion.\n  The flaws of the President's Social Security plan are very evident, \nif you study the details. With the Nation already in record deficit, \nwith the debt skyrocketing, the President says: OK, Social Security is \nshort of money. So in my budget I am going to take even more Social \nSecurity money and use it to pay for other things, despite having \npromised in 2002 not to do that.\n  Then the President says, in addition, I want to take even more money \nout of Social Security to establish private accounts. How much? Over \nthe next 10 years the President's plan takes an additional $754 billion \nout of Social Security, in addition to the $2.5 trillion he is taking \nfrom his budget to pay for other things. He takes another $754 billion \nto establish private accounts. But that is just the tip of the iceberg, \nbecause the 20-year cost of the President's plan is $4.4 trillion. Not \nmillion, not billion, trillion: $4.4 trillion.\n  Where does the President propose getting that money? He proposes to \nborrow it. On top of our already record deficits and debt, the \nPresident proposes borrowing another $4 trillion.\n  Now, the problem with all of that, of course, is, where is he getting \nthe money? Where is he borrowing it? Increasingly, he is borrowing it \nfrom foreign countries. The foreign holdings of our debt have gone up \nalmost 100 percent in just the first 3 years of this administration. \nAnd it is rising very rapidly as we go forward. The President says, Go \nout and borrow even more.\n  Here is what is happening to the publicly held debt of the United \nStates under the President's policies. When he came into office we were \n$3.3 trillion in debt. By 2015, under the President's policies he will \nhave nearly tripled the debt to $9.4 trillion.\n  Social Security is perhaps the most important legislative enactment \nof our time. Social Security has lifted people out of poverty. Two \nthirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of their \nincome. Let me repeat that: Two thirds of retirees rely on Social \nSecurity for more than half of their income; 31 percent get at least 90 \npercent of their income from Social Security.\n  I will never forget going to a community forum in a small rural town \nin North Dakota. An elderly woman was in the front row. She had a \nlittle note pad. On that note pad she had written out her budget for \nthe month. That woman had about $800 of income a month. That was her \nonly income. She had scrawled in a shaky hand on that note pad where \nthe money went. She had her rent; she had her prescription drugs; she \nhad her food costs. After she was done with rent, utilities, \nprescription drugs and food, she had no money left.\n  She said to me, Senator, what will I do if my prescription drug costs \ngo up even more? She was paying, as I recall, out of her roughly $800 a \nmonth in income about $200 a month in prescription drugs. She was \npaying, as I recall, $250 a month in rent. She said, What do I do if my \nprescription drugs become even more costly?\n  She was in that category of the 31 percent that get at least 90 \npercent of their income from Social Security; 33 percent get 50 to 89 \npercent of their income from Social Security; 36 percent get less than \n50 percent of their income. So almost two-thirds rely on Social \nSecurity for more than half their income and almost a third get 90 \npercent of their income, or more, from Social Security.\n  This is not something we can be gambling with. For those people, \nSocial Security is their lifeline. We know that nearly 50 percent of \nbeneficiaries would be in poverty without Social Security. With Social \nSecurity, 9 percent of seniors live in poverty. This is according to \nthe Social Security Administration. Without Social Security, \nthey estimate 48 percent of seniors would live in poverty.\n\n  I want to go back to the question of the whole basis for this \ndiscussion and debate on Social Security, because it is all based on \nassumptions. It is all based on forecasts. And the forecast is for \neconomic growth of 1.8 to 1.9 percent for the next 75 years. Economic \ngrowth over the previous 75 years was much higher than that, 3.4 \npercent. The components of the economic growth are two: one is \nproductivity and the second\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\ncomponent is new entrants to the workforce. The reason they are \nforecasting such lower economic growth for the future is because they \nlook at the demographics of the country and they say we are going to \nhave a real slowdown in new entrants to the workforce.\n  The other component of economic growth is productivity, and they are \nassuming productivity will grow at a rate of only 1.6 percent for the \nnext 75 years. That is a very pessimistic forecast. It is much lower \nthan the productivity gains we have been getting over the last 15 \nyears.\n  The green bars on this chart show the level of productivity growth we \nhave been achieving over the last 15 years. From 1990 to 1994 we were \nat 2 percent. From 1995 to 1999 we were about 2.5 percent. And from \n2000 to 2004 we were over 3.5 percent productivity growth. But the \nwhole basis for these forecasts is that somehow these people that write \nthese forecasts say the productivity growth in the country is going to \nplunge to 1.6 percent. I don't believe that. I think that is overly \npessimistic.\n  I believe part of this Social Security debate is based on a false \npremise, a premise that the economic growth of the country is going to \ncollapse from what it has been over the last 75 years to a rate of half \nas much.\n  With that said, there still is a challenge in Social Security. Even \nif these forecasts are all right, there is still a problem. The problem \nis largely one of demographics. The President's plan is to dramatically \ncut the benefits. In fact, he would cut the benefits by moving from \nwage indexing to price indexing. Out in the future that would reduce \nbenefits from what are currently provided by 46 percent.\n  Now, the President says, yes, that is true; I do have a plan that \ncuts the benefits dramatically. But, he says, I also have a plan to be \nable to set aside in private accounts, personal accounts or individual \naccounts, money that could be invested in the stock market. That money \nwould be in your name. That money would be able to grow perhaps more \nrapidly. That is the bet that he is making.\n  The problem with the President's plan, one of the problems, aside \nfrom being financed by massive debt, is the way these private accounts \nfunction. These private accounts function in a little different way \nthan I have heard the President describe them. Under the President's \nplan, there is something called an offset. Let me explain how that \nworks.\n  Under the President's plan, if you set aside $1,000 for 40 years and \nyou have 6\\1/2\\ percent rates of return during that period, you would \nhave $92,000 in your account at the end of the 40 years. Let me repeat \nthat: If you put aside $1,000 a year for 40 years and you got a 6.5 \npercent rate of return every year for those 40 years, you would have \n$92,000 in your account. That sounds pretty good. Under the President's \ndescription, that is your money and no one can take it away. That is \ntrue as far as the prescription goes.\n\n  But what the President has been leaving out is that his plan assumes \nthat the money to establish your account was loaned to you by the \nSocial Security trust fund and they expect to be paid back with \ninterest. I have not heard the President ever describe his plan in \nquite that way, but that is how it works. Yes, you have this $92,000 in \nyour account, but they are expecting you to pay back to the trust fund \nall of the money they theoretically loaned you, plus interest. So at \nthe end of the 40 years, you would owe back $78,000 under the \nPresident's plan.\n  Now, you do not owe it back out of your individual account. Here is \nthe twist to it. They assume they have loaned you this money for your \nprivate account and they expect to be paid back. But they don't expect \nto be paid back out of your private account. Instead, they expect to \nhave a further reduction in your already reduced traditional Social \nSecurity benefit. So you have already taken a reduction in that \naccount, supposedly made up for by these individual accounts, but a big \nchunk of what you have in your individual account you have to pay back. \nAnd you pay it back not out of your individual account but you pay it \nback out of your already reduced Social Security benefit.\n  Under this scenario, at least you would be ahead of the game. That is \nassuming you earned a 6.5 percent rate of return on your private \naccount. But what happens if you do not earn a 6.5 percent rate of \nreturn on your private account? What happens then? Then the story is \neven less appealing. Because under that scenario you would have $64,000 \nin your account--not $92,000--but you would still owe back $78,000.\n  For those who are listening to this in somewhat incredulous \ndisbelief, I am not making this up. This is how the President's plan \nworks. I have had his people spend hours with me. I have asked them \nabout it, I have quizzed them about it, and they have assured me this \nis how it works. Yes, you put money into your individual account. Yes, \nhopefully you have a rate of return on it, but--and it is a big \n``but''--you owe the money back because theoretically that $1,000 a \nyear was loaned to you from the Social Security trust fund and they \nwant it back. And they want it back with interest.\n  So, if you set aside $1,000 a year for 40 years and you only earn 5 \npercent on the money, you would have $64,000 in your account but you \nwould owe back $78,000--the $1,000 a year plus a 5.8 percent rate of \nreturn on the money they loaned you. That is a 3 percent real rate of \nreturn plus inflation. The Social Security Administration calculates \nthat at 5.8 percent, you would owe back on the $1,000 a year they gave \nto you. So, under this scenario, if you only earn 5 percent in your \nindividual account, you owe back more than you have in your account. \nAnd again, you do not pay back out of your individual accounts, \nalthough they assume that is where the money was loaned to you; you pay \nback by taking an additional reduction out of your already reduced \nSocial Security benefit.\n  When people find out that is the way this works--I have had dozens of \npeople who were very interested in this concept of the President.\n  When they find out how this thing really works, they become less \ninterested.\n  Let me just conclude as I began. I am offering an amendment which is \nat the desk that says, simply, let's put Social Security first. Let's \nsay no new mandatory spending and no new tax cuts until Social Security \nis solvent, unless those who want more tax cuts or more new spending \npay for them or unless they can get a supermajority vote here in the \nSenate. If they do not pay for them, if they cannot muster a \nsupermajority, then let's not have new mandatory spending or new tax \ncuts until Social Security is solvent. It is a very simple amendment \nthat says, what are the priorities of the country? Are the priorities \nnew tax cuts that are not paid for or new spending that is not paid for \nor is the priority to restore the solvency of the Social Security fund?\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to try to reframe \nthe issues which are before us because a lot has been said by the other \nside that has gone unrebutted, and I think it needs to be responded to \nbecause some of it, I believe, is bad policy and some is just \ninaccurate.\n  The representation that the Senator from Colorado was inaccurate in \nhis statement relative to what has happened to taxes is also \ninaccurate. The statement of the Senator from Colorado was correct. \nSince the tax cut was put in place, yes, there was a falling off of tax \nrevenues during that period. It was primarily driven by a recession, \nwhich would have been a much more severe recession. And there would \nhave been a much deeper drop in revenues had the tax cuts not occurred.\n  That recession was driven by two primary elements. The first was the \nbreaking of the bubble of the late 1990s, the largest bubble in the \nhistory of the world, the Internet expansion bubble. The second was the \nattack of 9/11, which was a terrorist attack, which contracted the \neconomy as a result of America adjusting to that. And, of course, we \nhad to spend a lot of money to get ready to deal with this terrorist \nevent, and that was money we had not expected to spend.\n  But since those tax cuts have been put in place something very \nsignificant has happened. There has been an increase of revenues. The \nrecession was shallower than we expected. As a result\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\nof the tax cut being put in place, people, therefore, received more of \nan incentive to go out and work harder and to invest more of their \nmoney. Rather than having the Government make the decision as to where \nmoney was being spent, people were making decisions where their dollars \nwere going to be spent.\n  As a result, we had a more efficient economy and jobs have been \ncreated. In fact, we have seen the largest expansion of the economy \nsince the early 1990s in the last quarter. Today we are at a historic \nlow in unemployment. Today revenues are going up, and they have gone up \nfor a number of years.\n  This chart points it out. Last year revenues went up by 9.4 percent \nat the Federal level. That is a pretty big jump. The next year--this \nyear--it is expected to go up by 7.6 percent. Next year it is projected \nto go up by 6.5 percent; then, 6 percent; 6 percent; 5.5 percent. These \nare very significant increases in Federal revenues, and they are a \nfunction of the fact that we have in place a tax law today which gives \npeople the incentive to go out and be productive.\n  Two specific revenues which have jumped dramatically are revenues \nfrom dividend income and revenues from capital gains income, both of \nwhich the rates were cut--dividends to 15 percent, capital gains to 15 \npercent. What was the practical effect of that? If you listened to the \nother side, you would say the wealthy in America got a huge tax cut. \nWhat actually happened was the Government of America got a huge tax \nwindfall. Items which were not being taxed before, such as capital \ngains assets--assets which had appreciated and which people were \nrefusing to sell or convert or trade because they did not want to have \nto pay taxes--suddenly people were saying: Well, let's sell that stock. \nLet's sell that piece of real estate. Let's sell our small business \nbecause today we will pay less in tax.\n\n  So assets which had been locked down from which the Federal \nGovernment was getting no revenue suddenly were being sold. As a \nresult, we had a huge spike in revenues from capital gains. Not only \ndid we get the spike in revenues, we saw those revenues reinvested in a \nmuch more efficient way because the dollars that came out of those \nassets which had been sitting there were now cash in people's hands, \nand they had been put back in the economy in a more productive way \nbecause that is the way a market economy works. So we got a double \nbenefit. We got more tax revenues as a result of that tax cut, and we \ngot a more efficient marketplace. As a result, we have gotten more jobs \nand more productivity as a nation. That is all a big plus.\n  Now, the 1930s economics that the other side subscribes to--which is \nthat you can simply tax your way to prosperity, that Americans really \nshould not own their own assets, that the Government owns your assets, \nthat we here in the Senate have a better way of spending your money \nthan you have--that philosophy has been proven to be not only \nunconscionable but counterproductive to a strong economy in this day \nand age. Yet we see it restated here over and over again with amendment \nafter amendment from the other side of the aisle which simply says: \nLet's tax people more. Let's spend more. We know how to spend your \nmoney better than you do. We're just going to raise your taxes and then \nput it on our special little project. And we are going to put it here \nor put it there so we can put out a good press release. Well, the \neffect of that, of course, is to stifle the economy, to stifle \nproductivity, to reduce the creation of the job atmosphere in this \ncountry.\n  What this President understood--as we headed into a recession, which \nwas not of his making, which came out of the 1990s bubble, which came \nout of the fact that we were attacked on 9/11--what this President \nunderstood in this timeframe is, if you reduce taxes, you create an \nincentive for people to be more productive. If you say to people, you \nspend your money rather than having the Federal Government take it out \nof your pocket and have some Senator here in Washington tell you how to \nspend your money, that dollar is going to be spent more efficiently and \ncreate more jobs.\n  That is exactly what has happened. Not only has that happened, but \nthe Federal revenues are going up as a result of it, and they are \nheaded back toward what the historic level of revenues is in this \ncountry, somewhere around 17.9 percent of gross national product.\n  We do not have as a nation a problem that the American people are \nundertaxed. Show me an American who is working today who is earning \nincome who feels they are not paying enough in taxes. There are very \nfew who fall into that category. Most Americans pay a fairly heavy load \nin taxes and a fairly reasonable load in taxes. They do not need to be \nhit with more taxes. Yet as we go through this budget, the only \nsolution we hear from the other side is: Raise taxes and spend more \nmoney. Raise taxes and spend.\n  The first amendment out of the box--a tax-and-spend amendment. We \nhave a list of tax-and-spend amendments that came out of the Budget \nCommittee that added up to $220 billion in new spending that the \nAmerican people were going to be stuck with and $240 billion of new \ntaxes they were going to be stuck with.\n  Tax-and-spend--oh, that is a wonderful policy. The only problem is, \nit creates a fairly significant burden on the American people after you \nraise the taxes. Americans would rather spend their own money than have \nus spend it for them, quite honestly. We already spend enough money. \nThis budget will spend $2.6 trillion. Now, even in the hallways of the \nDemocratic caucus that has to qualify as serious money. That is a lot \nof dollars to be spending. And where does it come from? Well, it comes \nfrom Americans, Americans who are working.\n  This budget will spend $100 billion more this year than we spent last \nyear. Even in the hallways of the Democratic caucus that should be \nserious money. You can run the State of New Hampshire for 20 years with \n$100 billion--20 years. You can take all the revenues from all the \npeople in the State of New Hampshire and wipe them out for the next 10 \nyears in order to pay for this year's increase in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That is a lot of money, but it is not enough for the other side of \nthe aisle. No, no, no. They have to raise taxes. They have to increase \nspending because they have to put out their press releases to say that \nthey were concerned about this group or they were concerned about that \ngroup.\n  Well, I have to tell you, a $2.6 trillion budget shows a lot of \nconcern for a lot of different groups. What we should be concerned \nabout is the American taxpayer. So to make the representation that \nsomehow the American people are undertaxed and we need to raise taxes \nor that somehow we are not generating significant revenue increases in \nthis economy as a result of having cut taxes is simply inaccurate, in \nmy opinion.\n  Now, to move on to this specific amendment which raises the issue of \nSocial Security, the practical effect of this amendment would be to \nessentially say the Federal Government can do nothing until it solves \nthe question of Social Security--that is the practical effect of this \namendment--unless we had 60 votes, which around here is pretty hard to \nget for anything. We can't even get judges through. I can imagine what \nwe would do trying to get the Government to run. We can't even get \njudges appointed without using 60 votes. So it is pretty obvious that \n60 votes is a very high threshold and essentially saying we are going \nto stop the Federal Government's progress in the area of giving tax \nrelief.\n  Interestingly enough, it does not say that the Federal Government \nwill not continue to spend dramatic amounts of money. It is basically \npointed at tax activity. It says new entitlements, but we all know it \nis not the new entitlements that are the issue. The expansion of the \nold entitlements is the issue. So it has a little bit of a \ndisingenuousness to it in that it treats tax policy and then spending \npolicy as dramatically different by essentially saying spending policy \nis OK, that is exempt, as long as it is on the book, but if it is tax \npolicy and it is on the book and comes to an end, as it does under our \nrules, we will treat it differently.\n  But independent of that, the practical effect of this amendment would \nbe to bring the activity in a number of areas of governance to a halt \nuntil Social Security is determined to be solvent. This would be \nphilosophically\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nmaybe a nice approach to take, but the problem with it is, from the \nother side of the aisle we have had no proposals--no proposals--to make \nSocial Security solvent--none, zero, zippo. In fact, the other side of \nthe aisle continues to refuse to engage in discussions about whether \nSocial Security should be made solvent, which the President has \ninitiated. They have essentially said: I'm sorry. You are alleging \nthere is a problem. There is no problem. And we are not going to allow \nyou to move forward even if there is a problem.\n\n  So it is a little disingenuous, again, to take the position we should \nsolve Social Security's problems before we do anything else as a \nGovernment and at the same time not be willing to put on the table any \nproposals to address Social Security's problems or even admit that \nSocial Security has a problem, which would be the implication of the \nSenator from North Dakota in that he said that the scoring of the \nproblem in Social Security was inappropriately arrived at because it \nused too conservative a number. I presume that means if a more \naggressive number had been used, he would deem there was less of a \nproblem with Social Security and maybe there was not a problem. Maybe \nthat would solve the amendment if--maybe we could score ourselves out \nfrom underneath this amendment, actually, as I think about it.\n  But independent of that, it does set up a conundrum that it \nessentially demands a solution to a problem which the other side claims \nis not a problem and will not allow us to move forward to a solution \non, which in the parlance of American politics I think is called catch-\n22. You cannot solve the problem because the problem is denied to \nexist, but you do not move forward until the problem is solved. It is \nan amendment that I believe has serious questions on that score.\n  But independent of that, moving on to the question of how Social \nSecurity is structured and the problems which Social Security faces, \nthis representation that the Social Security system is solvent through \nthe year 2040, 2036, 2052--whatever the number is that people arrive \nat, depending on what assumptions are made--is theoretically correct \nbut practically unsustainable because Social Security has no assets. \nThe assumption that Social Security is solvent through that period \nassumes that Social Security has assets which are physical, but the \nonly asset that the Social Security Administration has is an ability to \ncall, to make a put, to be more accurate, to the American taxpayer to \ncover bonds which have been put into the fund.\n  So once the cash that is being paid into the Social Security system \nfalls below the benefits which are being paid out--and that begins to \nhappen in about the year 2018--once that occurs, then there are no \nassets which the Social Security Administration can call down from like \na stock in General Motors or a bond in--I don't know--some county in \nAmerica. They do not have anything they are going to be able to \nconvert, any asset they are going to be able to convert to cash to \ncover the difference. All they have at the Social Security \nAdministration is the ability to say to the American people--\nspecifically, our children and our children's children because those of \nus in the baby boom generation will be retired at that time and getting \nthe benefit; we will not be paying the taxes--to say to them: You are \ngoing to have to pay more taxes.\n  That is the only asset they have, the ability to say to the American \npeople--working Americans--that you have to pay more taxes in order to \npay for the obligations that were incurred years ago by Social \nSecurity.\n  So, yes, theoretically, they are solvent because there is this \ntheoretical obligation that has been committed. But as a practical \nmatter, the effect of that obligation is you are going to demand a much \nhigher tax burden on working Americans. What does it work out to? We \nhad testimony in committee that that works out to a doubling of the \npayroll tax on working young Americans. That is what that burden would \ncost in order to maintain the alleged solvency. You can get there, yes, \nbut to get there, you have to double taxes on working Americans. That \nis what you have to do. Nobody will admit to that. That is what we are \ngoing to do to our kids--stick them with this huge tax bill on the \nallegation that that is an asset they have to cover that is in the \nSocial Security trust fund and allegedly makes it solvent.\n  The practical effect of that is it will cause our children and our \nchildren's children to have much less of a quality of life than we have \nhad, because they are going to have to pay twice as much in payroll \ntaxes. They are not going to be able to send their kids to college with \nas much ease as we have been able to, although it has been difficult \nfor many. They are not going to be able to buy that first house. They \nare not going to be able to increase their education or do a lot of \nthings with the ability we have had as a generation, because they are \ngoing to be paying so much higher a tax rate in order to support our \nretired generation. It is so intuitively obvious by looking at this \nfact that you have to wonder why everybody on the other side of the \naisle is burying their head under this issue. The people who are going \nto create this huge tax burden for our kids are all around this room. \nIt is everybody over 50 years old, and it is the largest generation in \nAmerican history. It takes the American system and turns it on its \nhead, because for years we had a pyramid system where more people paid \nmore into Social Security than was taken out. By the time the baby boom \ngeneration--my generation--retires, that is not going to be a pyramid; \nit will be a rectangle. We are such a huge generation and so many will \nbe retired that we are going to overwhelm the ability of the young \npeople in this country to support us, unless we address this issue \ntoday.\n  It is like that advertisement you used to see on TV for an oil filter \nthat said: You can either pay me now or pay me later. When you pay me \nlater, you are going to replace the entire engine; today you can just \nput in a new oil filter. That is the way the Social Security system is. \nYou can ``pay me now or pay later'' when the baby boom generation \nretires, which will fundamentally undermine the quality of life of \nyounger workers. It will affect their benefits so much. You are going \nto have to raise younger people's taxes so much.\n  The unwillingness of the other side of the aisle to face up to this \nissue is, in my opinion, a failure on their part to address their \nresponsibilities to people who are governing this country today. Yet we \nsee amendment after amendment such as this one, which is an attempt to \nbasically gain political cover on the issue. What we don't see from the \nother side is a willingness to step up and address the issue. Show us \nyour plan. You have castigated and vilified and basically attempted to \ndestroy the capacity of the President to address this issue time and \ntime again. You have said he has been dishonest in his presentation and \nthat his positions are going to harm America and older people in this \ncountry, when he specifically said, of course, it will not affect \nanybody over 55 and that it is voluntary.\n  Yet have you come forth with a plan, proposed a plan, or suggested \nany remedy at all? No, you have not. You put out these amendments, \nwhich are for the purpose of political protection. You should be \nashamed of yourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am glad to see my colleague show such \nspirit. I must say I disagree completely with his characterization not \nonly of my amendment, but of our position on this issue. Look, I think \nit is very clear. The President came to the American people and said \nthere is a problem in Social Security. I happen to agree there is a \nproblem. My colleague must have missed part of my speech. I made it \nvery clear, although I believe the basis of the assessment of how \nserious the Social Security situation is is based on a very pessimistic \nforecast of 1.8 or 1.9 percent economic growth for the next 75 years--\n--\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield so that I may agree with him on \nsomething?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would love to have the Senator agree with me, but not \nright now. I want to complete my statement. Then I will be glad to have \nan exchange with the Senator, for whom I have regard, and I even have \naffection for the Senator.\n  I say to my colleague, we do have a difference and it is a very \nimportant\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\ndifference and it deserves to have this kind of spirited debate. Let me \nsay that the President said there is a problem in Social Security. \nAgain, it is based on a forecast of 1.8 or 1.9 percent economic growth \nevery year for the next 75 years. Economic growth for the previous 75 \nyears has been not 1.9 percent but 3.4 percent. I don't believe this \nforecast is accurate. I don't believe it is correct. I still believe \nthere is a problem in Social Security and a challenge. The problem is \nthe one the Senator from New Hampshire outlined. It is a demographic \nproblem.\n  Now, the Senator also said there are no assets in Social Security. \nThat is factually wrong. There are assets. They are Government bonds, \nbacked by the full faith and credit of the United States. The United \nStates has never failed to meet its obligations. Does anybody believe \nthe United States is going to default on those special issuance bonds \nin the Social Security trust fund? I don't. I believe the United States \nis going to keep its promise. The Senator is correct, however, that to \nredeem those bonds, it is going to have to be done out of the current \nincome of the United States. That is the place he and I agree. That is \nthe place he and I might agree that we do have a challenge in Social \nSecurity, and the sooner we face up to it, the better. That is a place \nthe Senator and I agree.\n  Now, with respect to the amendment I have offered, the amendment \nsays, what are the priorities? The Senator indicated that my amendment \nsays you cannot do anything in the Federal Government. No, it doesn't \nsay that. The amendment I have offered says simply you cannot have more \ntax cuts or new mandatory spending unless you pay for them. That is a \nnovel idea around here. I must say my friends on the other side who say \nthey are conservative have run up the biggest deficits and debt in the \nhistory of the country. They are borrowing more from abroad. They \nincreased holdings of U.S. debt by over 100 percent in 4 years. I don't \nknow what happened to my other friends who used to call themselves \nconservative. There is nothing conservative about borrow and spend. We \nhave heard them hurl the epithet across the aisle that we are tax and \nspend. I would rather pay for our bills than be in the position of the \nparty across the aisle, which says put it on the charge card, shove the \nbills off to our kids, because that is what they are doing. They are \ndoing it in this budget.\n  When my friend describes this budget as fiscally responsible, that is \nnot what his own budget document reveals. It reveals that this budget \nincreases the deficit over just putting the Government on autopilot. If \nwe put the Government on autopilot, we would save $130 billion over \nthis budget. More than that, the debt of the United States, according \nto their own calculation--this is their budget document. This is from \npage 5 of the budget document. It shows the debt going up each and \nevery year by over $600 billion, if this budget is passed.\n  They say they are cutting the deficit in half. How is it, then, that \nin their own budget document, the debt goes up $669 billion this year, \n$636 billion the next, $624 billion the next, $622 billion the next, \nand $611 billion the next?\n  Where is the cutting of the deficit in half? I do not see it. I see \nthe debt going up, up, and away under the budget they have brought \nhere. There is nothing fiscally responsible about it.\n  Now, the Senator accused us in the committee of offering over $200 \nbillion of spending. Boy, that sounds bad, doesn't it? The Democrats \nwanted to increase spending by $200 billion. Yes, we did. Absolutely we \ndid. Do you know why? Because we wanted to pay for the war. They do \nnot. They want to kind of kid the American people: You can have the \nwar, but it does not cost any money, or at least it only will cost $50 \nbillion next year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says they are not being straight with \nthe American people as to how much this war costs. It would cost at \nleast $200 billion more. So you know what we did? We put it in the \nbudget, and we paid for it, not just put it on the charge card, not \njust dump it on our kids. We said: Yes, there is a cost, and we will \npay for it.\n  That is honest budgeting. That is telling the American people the \ntruth, instead of this endless borrow and spend that our colleagues on \nthe other side have fallen into. Borrow to solve Social Security, \nborrow to pay for the war, borrow for tax cuts, borrow, borrow, borrow, \nrun up debt, and borrow the money from China and Japan and South Korea. \nIf you want to get spirited, I can get spirited, too, because I think \nthis is a reckless course for the country--reckless. We have a massive \ndeficit and the President's answer: Borrow more money, spend more, \nborrow more, and go hat in hand to China. We have already borrowed $200 \nbillion from them. Go hat in hand to Japan. I do not know of any \ncountry that strengthened itself by borrowing hundreds of billions of \ndollars from every country all around the world. But that is the \nPresident's plan, that is the President's strategy, and it ought to be \nrejected.\n  I notice my colleague from Michigan is in the Chamber. I yield 15 \nminutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his outstanding leadership on this issue. I join in his \ncharacterization of this entire budget resolution as reckless and out \nof touch with the lives of the American people.\n  While I disagree with the chairman, I first want to say I appreciate \nthe way he has conducted himself with the Budget Committee and the \nresolution. I appreciate very much his giving us the opportunity to \ndebate all of these issues. But I could not disagree more with the \ncharacterization of what is going on or with what is happening in terms \nof playing politics.\n  I start by saying that this amendment puts Social Security first. It \ngets our priorities straight. Second, Social Security is our money--\nyour money, individual money. Each one of us pays into Social Security. \nIt is our American insurance policy so that we know we have a sense of \ndignity and a foundation for retirement. Then if we become disabled, \nthere is a disability policy or, Heaven forbid, a worker loses their \nlife, something is there for their family. It is your money. It is my \nmoney. There is not a penny of the general fund. This is our money that \ngoes into Social Security, and we are saying we want to keep it secure.\n  The American public is counting on us to keep it secure for the \nfuture. And we are saying, with all the talk about Social Security \nthese days, it is time to step up and to fix it and to put Social \nSecurity first.\n  I also say to my chairman, it is so easy to demagog on tax cuts. It \nis so easy. It is the easiest thing for an elected official to do: \nDon't worry about paying the bills; don't worry about how the schools \nare; don't worry about enough police and firefighters; don't worry if \nyou cannot drink the water or breathe the air let's just talk about tax \ncuts.\n  You know what, we know it is your money. For those watching, it is \nall of our individual money, but we also know something else. It is \nyour schools. It is your roads. It is your health care system. It is \nyour military fighting so courageously for us overseas. It is your \nveterans who are coming home. It is your communities asking us to \npartner with them so they can provide jobs, economic development in \nyour communities. It is your debt--the largest deficit in the history \nof the country. You could wipe out every penny of nondefense spending, \ndiscretionary spending, and just about pay off this debt this year. It \nis astounding.\n  This is reckless, it is irresponsible, and to demagog, always to \ndemagog, and say, Do you want to keep your families safe? Here, have \nanother tax cut. And by the way, you are not going to get it, but the \nmost blessed in your community will. To say we are not going to focus \non schools, we do not care about opportunities for the future, to say \nwe do not care about keeping ourselves safe or creating jobs is just \nplain reckless and the ultimate in demagoguery.\n  When we had the largest budget surplus in the history of the country \n4 years ago, I joined, on the Budget Committee, with our esteemed \ncolleague from North Dakota to support a reasonable future, to Take a \nthird of that surplus and put it into tax cuts focused on middle-income \npeople, small businesses, to drive the economy. Let's do tax cuts, I am \nall for it, and I have\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nvoted for many. But let's also take a third of that and take care of \nSocial Security. We could prefund the baby boomers' liability coming \nand take care of Social Security for the next 75 years with just a \nthird of that. Then how about taking the other third to make sure our \nkids have world-class schools, to make sure they have the technology \nthey need, to make sure they can afford to go to college, to make sure \nour communities have the police and firefighters so when you dial 911, \nyou are going to get the fastest response possible. And, by the way, \nlet's make sure my city can talk to your city and the next city through \nan up-to-date communications system. And let's make sure that our \nseniors have a quality nursing home and can get the dignity of home \nhealth care, that we are focused on health care, both for those most in \nneed and vulnerable, and to support those providing that health care in \nour businesses.\n\n  We have a lot of work to do. We have not only an aging population, we \nhave an aging infrastructure. Not only individually do we need a face-\nlift, but our cities need a face-lift--water systems, sewers, roads, \nand bridges. It is reckless for us, in defining priorities of the \nfuture of this country, not to be responsible in addressing each piece \nof it.\n  There is a lot of demagoguery going on around here, and unfortunately \nit is because the easy way for an elected official is not to pay the \nbills but to talk about tax cuts.\n  Let me suggest something else. I agree with our esteemed chairman \nthat the bulk of Americans are not getting the tax cuts they need. They \nare paying too much in taxes. Why? Because the tax cuts that were \npassed are not going to them. They are going to the most blessed, the \nwealthiest among us. I do not begrudge people working hard and doing \nwell, but I think they ought to pay for schools as well, and security \nand roads and health care, the military, war, and the veterans. We all \nhave a stake in America, and we all have a responsibility to do our \npart.\n  What I see is the overwhelming majority of the people in my State are \ngetting a twofer. They sure are not getting these tax cuts that are \ntalked about. They are not going to them. But they are going to pay \nmore for schools, get less quality, and have fewer police officers. \nThere are fewer police officers today in most of the cities in my State \nthan there were on 9/11/2001. What is with that? So my folks are going \nto have to pay more for their kids going to college because we are \ncutting support for the colleges and programs for folks to be able to \nafford to go to college. They are going to have to be taking less in \nthe way of services that are basic services.\n\n  We are talking about basic quality of life in America. Everyone else \nlooks at America and wants to be like us. What we are seeing in this \nbudget is an effort to roll us back. We don't want to be like China, \nwhere they can't drink the water. Our quality of life has been the gold \nstandard for the world. We have a responsibility to do the right thing \nand to have a balanced strategy that strategically focuses on tax cuts \nto move the economy forward, investments as well as the responsibility \nof paying down this debt and securing Social Security for the future.\n  How many people here would take the tradeoff of saying we are not \ngoing to fund health research? It doesn't matter who you are, you can \nget cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, a multitude of health \nconcerns and diseases in this country. Research will make the \ndifference. Who would say that research into health, into cures and \ntechnology for the future is not important in the greatest country in \nthe world? Yet all the demagoguery on tax cuts is about removing \nrevenue so that down the road the answer will be: We would love to do \nthat, it would be great, but we are really sorry, there is no funding. \nThat is what this is about, and it is wrong. This is about a balance. \nWe need to work together to get it right.\n  This amendment begins to get that right because it says we are going \nto put Social Security first. The President is going all over the \ncountry talking about Social Security and what needs to be done. We \ncould start by a value statement about what is important to us. We \ncould start by saying over the next 75 years, we will take a look at \nthe costs of tax cuts that have been passed--$11.6 trillion. I \nsupported some of those that go directly to our small businesses, to \nour families, and to stimulate the economy. But the overwhelming \nmajority of this goes, again, to those most blessed who have benefited \nby the greatness of America in our infrastructure and our opportunity.\n  If we just said, instead of $11.6 trillion over 75 years, how about \nwe take 3.7, about a third of that--just a third of it, about 30 \npercent of that--and we secure Social Security for 75 years, and then \nyou can have the rest? You can have 70 percent of it. But let's secure \nSocial Security first. Social Security is a great American success \nstory. Everyone is benefited by it. Even those right now who are doing \nvery well, who knows what will happen in the future?\n  I remember folks from Enron sitting in my office, folks who had been \nwiped out, who said: Thank God for Social Security. I never thought I \nwould need it, but it is the only thing I have left.\n  Social Security is meant to be there as security for our families--\nfor everybody. It works.\n  What we are saying is, if we want to talk about a solution, we don't \nhave to ask folks to pay more in payroll taxes, folks who are already \nbeing taxed too much and are being asked to have their services cut. We \ndon't have to cut benefits. We can say it is a priority for the \nAmerican people and we in the Senate are going to make it a \npriority for us. That is what this amendment does.\n\n  Social Security is a great American success story. Prior to Social \nSecurity, 50 percent of the seniors in this country were in poverty. \nToday it is 10 percent. That is worth fighting for. That is a success \nstory. Again:\n\n       Honor thy father and thy mother.\n\n  It is not just words. We should act on it. This budget does not, in a \nnumber of ways, act on that premise.\n  It is also important, again, to note that Social Security, in fact, \nis more than retirement. It is our families' insurance policy. It has \nworked. It costs a half a percent to administer, it has been there, and \nit will be there if we do the right thing. But it is important to know \nabout not only the retirees but the disabled, and there are survivors \nbenefits. How many folks who work here in the Senate have a story to \ntell about survivors benefits?\n  My husband, at 10 his father died. He was the youngest in the family. \nHis mother was older and not well. He survived on Social Security and \nwent on to college and was very successful because of our country's \ncommitment to each other.\n  I happen to believe caring about other people, caring about \ncommunity, is a good thing, not a bad thing. Social Security represents \nwhat is best about us. Creating a system that we all pay into, you work \nhard all your life, it is there at retirement or if you need it in case \nof a financial disaster in your family; it works. Other countries look \nto us, to this great system of Social Security.\n  There is no way the President's proposals do not undermine this \nsystem. You can't protect people 55 or older or the disabled, the \nsurvivors, when you take an insurance system and begin to pull out \ndollars. I don't care how many times they say it, it is not true. You \ncan't do that. We know that. Regarding Social Security, if we go the \nroute of what the President is talking about with privatized accounts, \nwe know three things will happen. We are going to drastically increase \nthe national debt, which is already the highest in our Nation's \nhistory. We will have high administrative costs--instead of a half \npercent to administer Social Security, we will see anywhere from 10, \n15, 20 percent or more. And the folks, by the way, you would pay to \nadminister the accounts are some of the folks we are seeing here at the \nCapitol now who want very much to make the change. And deep benefit \ncuts, there is no way to avoid benefit cuts under the President's \nproposal.\n  So we are saying this doesn't work. We don't like this. What we have \nis an alternative. We have the power to put Social Security first in \nthis budget. We have the power to do that. That is what this amendment \ndoes. If you don't want to see increased national debt, you don't want \nto see higher administrative costs, or deep benefit cuts, join our \namendment. Our amendment is the responsible approach, unless your goal \nis to eliminate Social Security. If the\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\ngoal is to unravel Social Security for Americans, then you will not \nsupport this amendment because this amendment is about fixing Social \nSecurity for the future, securing it for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say to the Senator, would she like additional \ntime? I would be happy to yield her an additional 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate that very much, but I notice a colleague \nhere as well and I would not proceed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say, it would help us because I need to visit with \nthe chairman of the committee before the next amendment is offered, in \nthe spirit of not surprising each other.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to proceed for a moment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate that. I know we have important matters to \ndiscuss on the floor. Let me take the final few moments and speak about \nthe realities of Social Security and what is happening now, what we \nknow to be true about the facts. There has been a lot of misinformation \nabout the situation with Social Security, in terms of its financial \nsecurity. I think it is important. We all can have different opinions \nand views and thoughts about what should happen, but we should not have \ndifferent facts.\n  The folks we all rely on, as we know, really have no philosophical \nposition. These are the number crunchers whose responsibility it is to \ntell it to us like it is, the Congressional Budget Office. They tell us \nthis: The Social Security trust fund can pay 100 percent of its \nobligation until 2052. Beyond that, if we do not do anything, and we \nneed to, they can pay about 80 percent, maybe slightly less, of all the \nbenefits that are currently in law.\n  We know we have a cap. We know we have a problem. The President's \nproposal does nothing to fix this.\n  It actually makes it worse. It makes it worse by adding to the \nmassive debt. It doesn't add anything to the trust fund and, as the \nSenator from North Dakota was indicating, the accounts are not even \nfully given to the individual.\n  There is also a lot of misunderstanding of even how that would work. \nI would welcome anyone to go to either my Web site or to a number of my \nDemocratic colleagues' Web sites where we have a calculator on the Web \nsite where you can put in your date of birth and average yearly wages \nover your lifetime, and you can find out for yourself how you would do \nunder the President's proposal. But the reality is we do have a gap. We \nknow that. That is why this amendment is so important.\n  This amendment basically says that in order to address this gap in \nfunding that comes after 2052, we want to put Social Security first \nbefore extension of or any new additional revenue losses, before new \ntax cuts or any new mandatory spending, that we secure Social Security, \nthat we close that gap for the next 75 years, that we put it at the \nfront of the line before we talk about revenue spending on new things, \nthat we put it at the front of the line.\n  If in fact this issue has such a high priority for the President, \ntraveling around the country for 60 days to 60 cities, all the effort \nand debate going on, you would think we would have universal support \nfor this amendment; that it would be a bipartisan vote for this \namendment. The only reason not to do it is if you do not support Social \nSecurity. If you do not support Social Security as it stands as an \ninsurance policy, then you won't like this amendment. You will not want \nthis amendment. If you prefer to privatize the whole system, then you \nwon't like this amendment. But if you support Social Security as being \nthere for all of our families, if you believe, as I do, that it is a \ngreat American success story and we should celebrate it, strengthen it, \nand secure it, then this amendment is the right amendment for you.\n  I will go back to the very beginning and say this is always about \nvalues and priorities. In fact, the budget resolution is our value \ndocument. Just as looking at our own personal checkbooks tells us a \nlittle bit about ourselves, looking at the budget resolution of the \nFederal Government, tells us something about all of us and the people \nwe represent.\n  Right now this budget resolution is out of balance. This budget \nresolution is reckless because it adds to the national debt. It does \nnothing to pay down in a real way the deficit that doesn't even include \nall of the expenditures. And it is out of touch with American families. \nIt is plain out of touch.\n  When we are talking about a third of those cuts being in education \nand workforce development and vocational education, we are talking \nabout massive cuts in Medicaid to our families and our children and our \nseniors in nursing homes, this does not represent the values of the \nmajority of Americans. We need some balance. That is not reflected in \nthis budget resolution.\n  I will go back to the final point, that this is about values and \npriorities. As an example, if we were to look at the next 75 years and \nthe costs without new tax cuts that are being proposed, the current \ncosts of the tax cuts for the next 75 years, it is $11.6 trillion, and \nto save Social Security is $3.7 trillion.\n  I would say to ask those most blessed in our country, receiving the \nmajority of the benefits, to be willing to share in some way and to \nleave Social Security secure is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded \n3 minutes off the time controlled by the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I want to make sure that is all right with the minority \nmanager.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me be clear. The Senator is asking for \na unanimous consent on----\n  Mr. SUNUNU. For the timing of the next amendment to be offered. I \nthought I might be speak for up to 3 minutes to ensure that everything \nhas been----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will take 3 minutes of the \nmajority's time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no problem with that. Could I extend that \nunanimous consent request and indicate that after the 3 minutes of the \nSenator, the Senator from Florida be recognized for 20 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly to the concerns \nraised by the previous speaker, and in particular the three grave \nconcerns with regard to Social Security. I take issue with those three \nitems. The first one of the three items was that any Social Security \nreform proposal, modernization proposal as envisioned by the President, \nwould result from massive amounts of debt. That is wrong in part but, \neven worse, it is misleading.\n  The reason to take up Social Security reform legislation, which I \nhave introduced in the previous session and will introduce again, is so \nwe avoid $12 trillion of unfunded debt that our children and \ngrandchildren will be stuck with if we don't act now.\n  To suddenly say we can't deal with Social Security because we are \nworried about debt is simply a smokescreen, and it is a smokescreen \nthat refuses to recognize the reality that under the current structure \nwe have a huge unfunded debt our children and grandchildren will be \nstuck with.\n  Second, there was a suggestion that personal accounts for younger \nworkers, an optional system of personal accounts would result in huge \nadministrative costs.\n  This is absolutely ridiculous, and every bit of evidence from any \nsimilar plan, similar account, similar fund argues against such a \nsuggestion. The Thrift Savings Plan, which is probably the best model \nof the kind of personal accounts envisioned by the President in \nlegislation that I have introduced, has 3.5 million members. Under \nSocial Security, there would be significantly more than that. The \nadministrative costs are less than two-tenths of 1 percent.\n  So to suggest that administrative costs would be exorbitantly high--I \nsee\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nnumbers of 1 percent or 2 percent thrown out--is wrong. There is no \nevidence, no model to suggest that would be even close to the truth. \nThird, the suggestion that any kind of a personal account proposal \nwould require deep benefit cuts is again at best misleading, but at \nworst it is an effort to scare retirees and those who are near \nretirement. It is simply wrong.\n  I have introduced legislation which is scored by the Social Security \nactuary that makes the system solvent, is scored as bringing the system \ninto balance permanently and has significant personal accounts and does \nnot require benefit cuts.\n  There are a lot of proposals out there that involve changes to the \ncurrent system, or even changes to benefits for, say, those at the \nhigher income level, but to suggest that deep cuts are required is \nsimply misleading the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15----\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have a unanimous consent in place that the Senator \nfrom Florida be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sorry. I apologize. I ask if the Senator from Florida \nwill yield to me for purposes of making a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I so yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I didn't realize there was a unanimous \nconsent in place. I apologize.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today Senator \nGraham or his designee be recognized to offer an amendment on Social \nSecurity, the text of which is at the desk; provided further that at 3 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Graham \namendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Conrad amendment \non Social Security, to be followed by a vote in relation to the \nRepublican Social Security amendment, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Nelson of Florida Social Security amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Stabenow amendment on first \nresponders. I further ask unanimous consent that all points of order be \nwaived with respect to the Social Security amendments; further, that no \nsecond degrees be in order to any of the five amendments prior to the \nvotes.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that all debate time until 12:15 be \nequally divided between the chairmen and ranking members, or their \ndesignees, and further that debate from 2:15 until 3 p.m. be equally \ndivided in the same form, and that any quorum calls be counted against \nthe statutory time limit with time divided equally between the two \nsides. Further, that all votes after the first be limited to 10 \nminutes, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided after the first.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, let me just say I will be \nconstrained to object until we get the actual text of the amendment. I \nunderstand now that we don't have the text of the Republican amendment \nor at least that we can't be certain that the text we have is the \namendment that would be offered, so we need to get that before we could \nagree to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object to the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is constrained to object until we reach that \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \npending amendment be laid aside for the purpose of offering an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send to the desk an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 145.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n reject any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n                       massive increase in debt)\n\n       On page 65, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act by 2042 would \n     result in deep benefit cuts; therefore Congress should take \n     action to address Social Security solvency.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, let me read the amendment to \neveryone because we have just changed the amendment that had been \nprinted that I intended to offer. I have added some additional \nlanguage.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act by 2042 would \n     result in deep benefit cuts; therefore Congress should take \n     action to address Social Security solvency.\n\n  That is the amendment offered as a sense of the Senate. We have heard \na lot of debate on Social Security. As a result of having 10 town hall \nmeetings in my State over the last recess, the people of Florida heard \nwhat the administration's proposal was, to take up to 4 percentage \npoints of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax against an employee's \nwages and instead of allowing all of that 12.4 percent tax to pour into \nthe Social Security trust fund, to allow up to one-third of it to go \noutside of the Social Security trust fund in the so-called privatized \naccounts, with the result, combined with the change in the formula as \nproposed by the White House that future Social Security benefits would \nbe calculated increases each year not according to what has been the \ncase since the beginning of Social Security, according to the index on \nwages, but instead targeted to a lower index, on prices.\n  So the combination of taking a third of the Social Security tax out \nof the Social Security trust fund plus a changing of the payment \nformula was going to cause cuts in benefits, with massive borrowing to \nfill the hole.\n  Why cuts in benefits?\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would be happy to yield to the Senator, but \nI have been waiting for the last hour and a half and this Senator wants \nto speak his mind. Then I will be happy to engage with the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. This would be for the purposes of renewing a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If it is a unanimous consent request, I yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I renew the unanimous consent request which I propounded a \nfew minutes ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Florida for his courtesy.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is a pleasure to always accommodate the \nleadership of the committee. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the \nleadership of the committee. Perhaps we might come to a resolution over \nthe amendment I have just offered because this amendment speaks truth.\n  Let's go back to where I was in the explanation. We are going to have \nbenefit cuts certainly by virtue of the change in the formula. All of \nthe Social Security actuaries will tell you if you change the index \nfrom increases in wages to prices, for a young worker today, by the \ntime they retire, their Social Security benefits are going to be cut \nalmost in half. Second, if you are taking all of that Social Security \ntax revenue out of the Social Security trust fund, since the trust fund \nis a pay-as-you-go kind of trust fund, you have to fill that hole with \nsomething. That means you are going to have to borrow additional money \nto pour into the Social Security trust fund to fill the hole. The \nSocial Security actuaries have estimated that is $4.9 trillion over 20 \nyears.\n  Members of the Senate, right now the publicly held national debt of \nthe entire country is $4.3 trillion. We are talking about a system, a \nscheme, a proposal, that is going to more than double the publicly held \nnational debt over the next two decades if adopted.\n  It is most appropriate that we start this discussion of the budget \nresolution\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nbecause the budget resolution is a lot about borrowing. It is a lot \nabout massive deficit financing. And now the administration has a \nproposal that would add massive additional borrowing to the present \nnational debt.\n  When I came to the Congress in 1978 and was put on the Budget \nCommittee as a freshman in the House of Representatives, back then we \nused to call it fiscal conservatism when someone would want to balance \nthe budget, when someone would want to get the revenues and the outflow \nor expenditures in sync. What we had 3 years ago was more revenues \ncoming in each year than we had in expenditures, and the difference was \na surplus. But 3\\1/2\\ years later this is where we are: Massive \nspending and less revenue.\n  The deficit in this next fiscal year--you can take your choice, since \nthis budget has now become a political document instead of an economic \ndocument, whether you think it is going to be $390 billion, which does \nnot account for all of the realities of the additional spending as well \nas additional tax cuts, if enacted, or it is going to be more like $434 \nbillion of deficit spending. That is a concern.\n  Every time we talk about the budget--as a matter of fact, my maiden \nspeech on the floor of this Senate--and I waited appropriately for \nabout a month before I made a speech back in 2001--my maiden speech was \nabout the budget and wanting to have a fiscally conservative budget. \nBut we have gone the other way since January of 2001. So we talk a lot \nabout the annual deficit and adding to the national debt, and now it \nhas gone haywire. It is out of control.\n  Now we have a proposal with regard to Social Security, not even to \nspeak of the merits that you already heard in the discussion here, a \nproposal that is going to add massively to the debt of the United \nStates. This is not the fiscally conservative nor prudent way to \napproach a budget. So I have offered a sense of the Senate:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act by 2042 would \n     result in deep benefit cuts; therefore Congress should take \n     action to address Social Security solvency.\n\n  Now, why 2042? I could have used the year 2052 because the \nCongressional Budget Office has said it is the year--2052--when Social \nSecurity will have to cut its benefits down to something like 73 cents \non the dollar. But the Social Security trustees say that date is 2042. \nThat is 37 years from now. Why is that important? It is important to \ngive us a marker at the point at which Social Security cannot pay 100 \npercent of the benefits.\n  This is quite in contrast to what we faced when I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. For there, in 1983, Social Security was about \nto run out of funds within 6 months, not in 37 years, not in 47 years. \nIt was about to run out within 6 months. And do you know how we solved \nit then? A Republican President, Ronald Reagan, and a Democratic \nSpeaker, Tip O'Neill, got together and they said: We are going to solve \nit. We are going to solve it in a bipartisan fashion. We are not going \nto play ``gotcha'' politics. We are going to create a bipartisan \ncommission. As a result of that commission, we are going to go out and \ngive support in a bipartisan way. We are not going to use the results \nof that against anyone in the next election.\n  That was one of the finest hours in a success story of the Government \nof the United States, when within 6 months of Social Security being in \ntrouble, running out of money, in 1983, as a result of that agreement, \nSocial Security was made solvent all the way to the middle of this \ncentury--pick your date, 2042 or 2052, depending on whether you believe \nCBO or the Social Security trustees.\n  So that is why we put in this sense of the Senate the date 2042. And \nthen we say something that we all acknowledge, that, indeed, Social \nSecurity does have a solvency problem. We state the outside of when \nthose deep benefit cuts would occur. According to the Social Security \ntrustees, those benefit cuts would be 27 cents on the dollar 37 years \nfrom now. But then we say Congress should do something about it and not \nwait until then. We say Congress should take action to address the \nSocial Security solvency. Now, I do not know how much more \nstraightforward we can make it.\n\n  When I would go into those townhall meetings--and people had read a \nlot about this in the papers, and they had heard a lot about it on the \nnews--and I would explain to them what I have just explained, in some \ncases people were aghast. I think in the morning papers we see \nchronicled on the front pages the new results of additional feelings of \nthe American mood about this. People have been very much helped by \nSocial Security, and they do not want to see benefit cuts.\n  In the 70-plus years that this system has been in existence, it has \nnot been an investment program. It has been a social safety net \nprogram. Indeed, in 1950, 40 percent of our senior citizens in this \ncountry--over a half a century ago--40 percent of them were living in \npoverty. Today, only 10 percent of senior citizens are living in \npoverty. A major reason for that improvement in the condition of senior \ncitizens is the fact that they have something to fall back on; that is, \nthey are guaranteed Social Security benefits.\n  In an ideal world, if you are a retiree, what would you like to have? \nYou would like to have one-third of your total income, as a retiree, to \nbe on your pension plan. You would like another third of your income to \nbe from your savings. The remaining third you would like from Social \nSecurity.\n  But what happens if you were an employee of WorldCom, as some of our \nFloridians were, or an employee of Enron, as some of our Floridians \nwere, or an employee of Eastern Airlines, as some of our Floridians \nwere? They do not have a pension. And what meager savings they had are \nnow eaten up. The sad truth is that too many senior citizens in this \ncountry today, in the year 2005 in fact, are subsisting, existing on \ntheir Social Security benefits.\n  Now, we have to stand up and stand right by our seniors. So that is \nwhy I offer a commonsense sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for what \nI believe is a really important amendment because it sets the terms of \nthis debate on Social Security. What is the intention of the Congress \nof the United States? Are we going to embrace a plan for Social \nSecurity that involves massive new borrowing, massive new debt, and \nsteep benefit cuts? Is that the answer? Or is there another way?\n  I believe, and I have stated publicly, there is a kernel of a good \nidea to what the President has proposed. I know many do not share that, \nbut I do think there is a kernel of a good idea.\n  I also believe we have a challenge in Social Security. I do not \nbelieve it is as acute as the President has presented it because I \nthink the forecasts that it is all based on are overly pessimistic.\n  They are saying economic growth in America for the next 75 years is \nonly going to be 1.8 percent a year, when in the past 75 years, \neconomic growth has been 3.4 percent. I don't buy it. I don't believe \nit. I think they vastly underestimate the productivity growth of the \nAmerican economy. In fact, productivity is a key component of their \neconomic growth estimate, and productivity growth has been far in \nexcess of what they are saying productivity growth is going to be for \nthe next 75 years. First of all, I have very little confidence in any \nforecast of 10 years, much less a forecast of 75 years.\n  With that said, the amendment of the Senator from Florida says, yes, \nwe should move to bring solvency to Social Security, but we should not \ndo it by massive new borrowing, and we should not do it by steep \nbenefit cuts. That is what the President's plan is. The President's \nplan is to divert money out of Social Security. That is on top of what \nhe is doing in his budget because, remember, in his budget he is taking \nevery penny of Social Security over the next 10 years--$2.5 trillion--\nand using it to pay for other things. This is after he says there is a \nshortfall in Social Security.\n  In the next action, he sends us a budget to take $2.5 trillion in \nSocial Security money and use it to pay for something else. He says, I \nam not done; I have another idea; let's take another $750 billion out \nof Social Security to start private accounts. But that is the tip of \nthe iceberg, because the $750 billion of additional taking from Social\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nSecurity to start private accounts is just the first 10-year cost. The \n20-year cost is $4.4 trillion. Others have estimated approaching $5 \ntrillion.\n\n  I have taken a somewhat more conservative estimate. The President \nsays, Borrow every dime of it. When we already have record deficits, we \nalready have debt that is growing out of control. He says, Don't worry; \njust borrow more money.\n  That is a reckless course. Why is it reckless? Because much of this \nborrowing is coming from abroad, coming from China, Japan, and South \nKorea. We have increased the foreign holdings of our debt just in the \nfirst 3 years of this administration by almost 100 percent. It is going \nup geometrically every year.\n  We have seen two warning shots about the danger of doing that. First, \nfrom South Korea. They said, Gee, we are beginning to worry about \nloaning so much money to the United States. We are going to diversify \nout-of-dollar denominated assets. What happened? The stock market \nplunged 170 points in 1 day. The dollar went down again. It already \nwent down 33 percent against the Euro in the last 3 years.\n  We have a problem. The problem is that if there was a precipitous \ndrop in the dollar, the policy options open to this country would be \nvery severe. It would require a dramatic increase in interest rates, \nsteep cuts in spending, dramatic tax increases. That is what is known \nas the perfect storm. That is the risk being run by this reckless \npolicy of deficits and debt and deficits and debt and borrow and spend \nand borrow and spend, which, for some reason, our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have gotten into as a pattern of running the fiscal \naffairs of this country.\n  The deficit has skyrocketed during this President's term, and here is \nthe course he has us on. Publicly held debt, $3.3 trillion when he took \noffice. They are now saying $9.4 trillion by 2015. The President's \nanswer on Social Security is to cut the benefits dramatically--26 \npercent by 2042, 46 percent by 2075. That is at the heart of the \nPresident's plan: to cut benefits steeply, and then to establish these \nprivate accounts by borrowing trillions of dollars.\n  Here is how the private accounts would work. I find people are really \nstunned when I explain how they work, because this is not the way the \nPresident explains it. The President says you can put aside money in \nyour private account and earn, potentially, a higher rate of return. As \nfar as he goes with that description, it is accurate. But he has left \nout something very, very important, because he assumes that money that \nis in your private account was loaned to you by the Social Security \ntrust fund, and they expect to be paid back. They expect to be paid \nback with interest.\n  Has anybody ever heard the President describe the plan in that way? \nThat is how it works. I have spent hours with his people and they have \nassured me that is how it works.\n  Here is an example. If you set aside $1,000 a year for 40 years and \nyou earn 6.5 percent on that money, at the end of the period, you would \nhave $92,000 in your private account. That sounds pretty good. The \nproblem is that they assume that thousand dollars a year was loaned to \nyou from the Social Security trust fund, and you owe it back with \ninterest. If you pay it back with 5.8 percent interest, which is what \nthe actuaries say would be required, you would owe back $78,000. But \nyou don't pay it back out of our private account under the President's \nplan; you owe it back by further reducing your already cut Social \nSecurity benefits. That is how it works.\n\n  What happens if you don't get a 6.5 percent rate of return? What \nhappens if you only get a 5 percent rate of return? Guess what? Under \nthat example, you would have $64,000 in your account, but you would \nstill owe back $78,000. I know when I describe this to people, they \ncannot believe it. I thought the President said, That is your account, \nyour name is on it, nobody can take it from you. That is true, but he \nhas left out this little additional fact: He assumes in his plan that \nthis money was loaned to you by the Social Security trust fund. That \nthousand dollars a year, which came out of your Social Security payroll \ntax--the theory is--would have been in the Social Security trust fund \nearning a rate of return there. So their assumption is that you owe the \nmoney back, but you don't pay it back out of your individual account; \nyou pay it back by taking a further reduction in your already cut \nSocial Security benefits. That is how it works.\n  I will tell you, people are going to be mighty surprised to find out \nthat is how it works. That is not the way it has been described. That \nis not what people have been told. They have been told that is their \naccount, their name is on the account, nobody can take it away from \nthem. All of that is true, but it leaves out something. It leaves out \nthe rest of the story. The rest of the story is, yes, but you owe it \nback. That money was, in effect, loaned to you by the Social Security \ntrust fund. So goes the President's theory. Therefore, you have to pay \nit back to the Social Security trust fund--the money loaned to you--and \nyou have to pay it back with interest.\n  Unfortunately, if you don't get a higher rate of return on your \ninvested assets, you could wind up owing back more than is in your \naccount. That can very easily happen because this assumes you have a 5-\npercent rate of return on your investment.\n\n  I wrote an op-ed piece with Senator Lindsey Graham of the other side \nof the aisle saying there is a bipartisan approach to Social Security; \nwe do have a problem; we do have a challenge; we ought to get together \nto solve it; and the sooner the better. I believe that, and I am \nprepared to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle to do \nthat. But I am not prepared, and I will not be part of a plan that \ninvolves massive new debt. Count me out. I will fight that with every \nfiber in my being because I think it is reckless for the United States \nand the economic security of the country.\n  With that, I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan. How \nmuch time would the Senator like?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would appreciate 5 minutes to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 5 minutes. If the Senator would like \nmore time, I am happy to yield additional time as well.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Let's say 5 minutes, and we will see.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this time off the resolution or the \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Michigan is offering an amendment at \nthis time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield her time off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 147\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from North \nDakota for his incredible leadership on this issue and speaking about \nwhat is responsible and what should be the priorities for our country.\n  I understand the senior Senator from Iowa is also waiting to speak. I \nappreciate him allowing me to offer this amendment first.\n  As we are talking about priorities, of course our first priority is \nto keep Social Security secure for the future. Putting Social Security \nfirst is one of the very first amendments we will be voting on today. \nBut we also have another priority which is to keep Americans safe. And \nthat is what my amendment will do.\n  My amendment will restore the $1.6 billion in cuts to first responder \nservices that are included in this budget resolution as proposed by the \nPresident. It also will put $1.6 billion towards paying down the \nnational debt. These are two worthy goals: pay down the national debt \nand restore the resources we need at a minimum to keep us where we are \nin terms of the resources for our communities to keep us safe.\n  I am very concerned that 4 years past 9/11/2001 when I visit my \npolice chiefs around the State of Michigan and I speak with fire \ndepartments and first responders, almost all of them tell me they have \nfewer officers today than they did on 9/11/2001. I think the public \nwould be shocked to understand that. I know I was shocked. They expect \nmore from us than that, with all of the alerts and codes and concerns \nthat have been raised--and legitimate concerns that have been raised--\nabout what is happening in terms of terrorism, to know that we have \nfewer police officers on\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nthe streets now than before the attack on 9/11 is simply reckless and \nirresponsible.\n  I am very concerned that we are seeing cuts in a number of very \nimportant programs.\n  I am told I need to send the amendment to the desk. I apologize for \nnot having done that sooner, Mr. President. I send the amendment to the \ndesk, and then I will continue. I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nLevin, Mikulski, Kerry, Corzine, Harkin, Biden, Pryor, Clinton, and \nAkaka as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Levin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 147.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the American people from terrorist attacks by \n  providing the necessary resources to our firefighters, police, EMS \nworkers and other first responders by restoring $1.626 billion in cuts \n   to first responder programs, including, $298 million to the State \nHomeland Security grant program, $79 million to the Urban Area Security \n   Initiative, $226 million for firefighter assistance grants, $486 \n  million for the COPS program and $537 million for the Byrne Justice \n    Assistance grants. The amendment is fully offset by closing tax \n  loopholes that will generate $3.2 billion in revenue, half of which \n  will be used to restore the $1.6 billion in first responder program \n cuts, and the remaining $1.6 billion will be put towards reducing the \n                                deficit)\n\n       On page 3 line 10, increase the amount by $451,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 11, increase the amount by $1,145,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 12, increase the amount by $850,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 13, increase the amount by $521,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 14, increase the amount by $285,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 19, increase the amount by $451,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 20, increase the amount by $1,145,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 21, increase the amount by $850,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 1, increase the amount by $521,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 2, increase the amount by $285,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 7, increase the amount by $1,626,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 16, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 17, increase the amount by $572,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 18, increase the amount by $425,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 19, increase the amount by $261,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 20, increase the amount by $143,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 24, increase the amount by $226,000,000.\n       On page 4 line 25, increase the amount by $573,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 1, increase the amount by $425,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 2, increase the amount by $260,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 3, increase the amount by $142,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 7, decrease the amount by $226,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 8, decrease the amount by $799,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 9, decrease the amount by $1,224,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 10, decrease the amount by $1,484,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 11, decrease the amount by $1,626,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 15, decrease the amount by $226,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 16, decrease the amount by $799,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 17, decrease the amount by $1,224,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 18, decrease the amount by $1,484,000,000.\n       On page 5 line 19, decrease the amount by $1,626,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 15, increase the amount by $603,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 16, increase the amount by $49,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 20, increase the amount by $275,000,000.\n       On page 16 line 24, increase the amount by $196,000,000.\n       On page 17 line 3, increase the amount by $83,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 16, increase the amount by $1,023,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 17, increase the amount by $176,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 21, increase the amount by $297,000,000.\n       On page 23 line 25, increase the amount by $229,000,000.\n       On page 24 line 4, increase the amount by $178,000,000.\n       On page 24 line 8, increase the amount by $143,000,000.\n       On page 30 line 16, decrease the amount by $451,000,000.\n       On page 30 line 17, decrease the amount by $3,252,000,000.\n       On page 48 line 6, increase the amount by $1,626,000,000.\n       On page 48 line 7, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am so concerned about this. I \nappreciate being reminded that I needed to send the amendment to the \ndesk. This is so serious.\n  This morning I had a meeting with our city council members from \naround the State of Michigan. I hear stories about the fact that one \npolice department cannot talk to the city next to them or, in some \ncases, the police department cannot talk to the fire department. The \nwhole question of communications and interoperability and the training \nthat is needed to go with that is absolutely critical.\n  This is not the time to be cutting first responder dollars to our \ncommunities. We ought to be, in fact, increasing those dollars because \nwhen the terrorist experts talk to us, they do not say if we are \nattacked in the future, they say when we will be attacked in the \nfuture. So it is absolutely irresponsible to be cutting the dollars for \nour local police, fire departments, and emergency responders. We need \nto make homeland security a priority. That is what my amendment does.\n  I remind my colleagues that 2 years ago, we received a report that \nwas authored by a blue ribbon panel chaired by former Republican \nSenator Warren Rudman. Their findings were daunting about the \ninadequacies in our homeland security efforts. They indicated that we \nneeded a total of $98.4 billion over the next 5 years to truly be able \nto tell the families we represent that we have done everything possible \nto keep them safe. But instead of adding those dollars to make sure the \nradio equipment is there and the officers are there and to make sure \nthe training is available, what is happening is we are seeing a $1.6 \nbillion cut. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n  We should not be ignoring this panel's recommendations. We should, in \nfact, be following them. As I said before, after 9/11, I did meetings \nall around Michigan. To a person, I was told that they did not have the \nresources they needed, and then coming back to them in the last year, I \nhave asked, How is it going? They said we are worse off than we were \nbefore, which makes absolutely no sense.\n  I will add one important point, given the current situation as it \nrelates to violence in our courthouses, that we should recognize is in \nthis budget cut. The Byrne grants, which my amendment restores, can be \nused to hire, equip, and train additional law enforcement personnel in \nour courthouses. With the recent tragedy in Atlanta, GA, now is not the \ntime to be cutting resources to our courthouses. All we have to do is \nlook around, look at the headlines day after day, watch the news on \ntelevision, listen on the radio and we know there has been a series of \nongoing violent efforts in our country. Now is not the time to be \ncutting back on police or fire, whether it is to prepare for a \nterrorist attack or to keep our citizens safe today. When the President \ntalks about overwhelming cuts, basically eliminating the COPS Program \nwhich has been so important in putting police officers on the streets, \nthis makes absolutely no sense.\n  I have supported funding for our military men and women who are \nserving us so bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan because we said it is \nimportant that we come together and provide the resources that are \nnecessary. We have done that on a bipartisan basis. We need to do the \nsame thing for our men and women who are on the home front who are \nworking hard every day to keep us safe. That is what my amendment will \ndo.\n  I would like to provide several examples of the deficiencies the \nIndependent Task Force on Emergency Responders detailed in the Rudman \nreport:\n  On average, our fire departments have only half the number of radios\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nneeded on a shift, and only enough breathing apparatuses for one-third \nof their firefighters.\n  Police departments across America do not have the protective gear to \nrespond to a weapons of mass destruction attack.\n  Our public health laboratories lack the basic equipment to respond to \na chemical and biological attack and most report that they are \noverwhelmed with testing requests.\n  Finally, our first responders do not have the equipment they need to \ndetermine what kind of hazardous material they may be facing.\n  Why have we ignored this panel's recommendations? The \nadministration's support for first responders has been on a steady \ndecline. For example, last year funding for Michigan's State Homeland \nSecurity grants program dropped from $47 million to $29.7 million, In \nthis budget, the administration eliminates the Law Enforcement \nTerrorism Training Program, cutting another $400 million from our first \nresponders.\n  I have spoken with police and fire chiefs across my State, and to a \nperson they all tell me that they have fewer police officers and \nfirefighters on their forces than they did before 9/11 because of \nfunding cuts.\n  During a series of 11 meetings in the summer of 2003 I met with first \nresponders and community leaders in Michigan. They told me in no \nuncertain terms that they are woefully underfunded and underequipped. \nOver the last year and a half, they have continued to remind me of that \nfact. The situation in Michigan is of particular importance to me but \nthis is not solely a Michigan problem. This is a national problem and \none that has been ignored for far too long.\n  My amendment would restore the cuts to the first responder services \nin the President's Department of Homeland Security budget. The \namendment is fully offset and will also help reduce the deficit. The \namendment is paid for by closing tax loopholes that were originally \nincluded in the Senate version of the FSC/ETI bill, but were taken out \nin the final conference bill. Closing these loopholes will generate \n$3.2 billion in revenue, half of which will be used to restore the $1.6 \nbillion in first responder program cuts, and the remaining $1.6 billion \nwill be put towards reducing the deficit.\n  The assistance to firefighters grants, the State Homeland Security \ngrants and the Urban Area Security Initiative are critically important. \nAlso important are the COPS Program and the Byrne justice assistance \ngrants. While some may not think these services help keep our homeland \nsecure against terrorism, I believe that every police officer we put on \nthe street with the proper training is one more set of eyes that could \nstop a terrorist attack from ever happening or respond to one, God \nforbid we are attacked again.\n  The President's cuts to these programs not only impair our ability to \nprevent and respond to terrorist attacks, but are a more fundamental \nassault on the safety of our communities.\n  These programs help in unexpected ways. For example, Byrne grants, \nwhich my amendment restores, can be used to hire, train, and equip \nadditional law enforcement personnel in our courthouses. With the \nrecent tragedy in Atlanta, GA, now is not the time to cut the resources \nthat keep our citizens safe.\n  The COPS Program has brought results in Michigan and the rest of the \nNation. COPS grants have put more officers on our streets and in our \nschools to make our communities safer. These officers have helped \nreduce crime throughout the country. According to the Department of \nJustice, every $1 increase per resident of COPS grant funding \ncontributes to a decline of 10 violent crimes and 27 property crimes \nper 100,000 residents.\n  When it comes to providing funding for our military men and women in \nIraq and Afghanistan, we have provided the resources necessary. \nUnfortunately, we have not done the same when it comes to protecting us \nhere at home. When it comes to protecting our communities, we should \nnot be penny wise and pound foolish. Therefore, we must strengthen our \nresolve and do whatever it takes to keep us safe.\n  Can we tell our fellow Americans that we have provided our first \nresponders with the equipment and training they need to respond quickly \nto a terrorist incident and prevent loss of life? If we cut $1.6 \nbillion from the men and women on the front lines of our homeland \nsecurity, the answer must be no.\n  I remind my colleagues that when you call 9-1-1, you do not get \nsomeone at the Homeland Security Department in Washington, DC. You get \nyour local police or fire department. Local police and firefighters are \nready and waiting to try to stop a terrorist attack or help save lives \nif one happens.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, I believe we are not doing \neverything we can to keep our country safe.\n  I urge my colleagues, before they vote on this amendment, to ask \nthemselves are we doing enough here at home to keep us safe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 144\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to respond to Senator Conrad's \namendment, the pay-go amendment he brings up as it relates to fixing \nSocial Security. But before I get into my remarks, I wish to call \nattention to some points raised by Senator Conrad. I do not dispute \nanything he said, but I would like to give some refinement of some \nstatistics he has given.\n  Recently he spoke about the decline in the value of the dollar. His \nfigures were accurate, as far as the decline of the dollar. But also \nwhere he starts, there has been a decline of the dollar, but I think we \nought to point out to the people of this country that from 1995 until \nthe year 2002, we had a 50-percent increase in the value of the dollar. \nWhen we go back to 1995, the middle of the Clinton administration, we \nwill find that we had a dollar lower in value than presently. Then we \nhad the increase in the value of the dollar, and now we have had a 30-\npercent decline in the value of the dollar. The value of the dollar \nstill is much higher than it was in 1995.\n  Another point I wish to make is on his dissertation on the estimate \nof the trustees of what the growth of the economy, of the growth of \nproductivity will be over the next 75 years. He would say that over the \nnext 75 years, the growth of the economy, as the trustees put it, at \n1.6 percent is too pessimistic, and consequently maybe the situation \nover the next 75 years of the Social Security system is not as bleak as \nthe trustees might be led to believe. That is because he would point \nout that the average productivity of the economy over the last 40 \nyears, from 1960 to the year 2000, was 1.76. So the point being made by \nthe opposition is that the growth of the economy has really averaged \nmore than what the trustees say it will over the next 75 years, so \nsomehow we might not have anything to worry about.\n\n  If you take subsets of the years from 1960 until the year 2000, you \nwill find from 1960 to the year 1975 we had a growth of productivity of \n2.4 percent. But if you look at the period of time from 1975 until the \nyear 2000, you would see that productivity growth was 1.38, to compare \nwith what the trustees had used for the next 75 years.\n  So I don't think it is right to point out what the trustees have used \nas a figure because, compared to the last 25 years, it is not \npessimistic whatsoever. You could even make an argument that maybe it \nis too optimistic.\n  As we listen to these figures, I hope there will be an effort on the \npart of my colleagues to study these figures and not just to take these \ncharts at face value, because they may not tell the entire story.\n  Having pointed that out, I would like to speak about the amendment of \nSenator Conrad, not reinstating the pay-go rules until Congress \naddresses the Social Security issue. Stop to think what sort of \nproposition this really is. The amendment says we should not do \nanything else to deal with overspending by Congress until we address \nthe Social Security issue. Unfortunately, no one I am aware of who \nsupports this amendment has a plan before Congress to fix Social \nSecurity. So we have an amendment that says, in a sense, don't do \nanything until we fix\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nSocial Security but those who support this amendment don't have a plan \nto fix Social Security. So, as I see this amendment, this is an \namendment to just simply do nothing--not do anything about a plan to \nkeep spending under control or, if you can't do that, then under this \namendment you can't do anything about Social Security.\n  Due to the retirement of the baby boomers, Social Security will face \nrising deficits in just a little bit more than a decade. In fact, some \npeople, including me, can legitimately say that this problem really \nstarts in 3 years, when baby boomers start retiring, because their \nretirement is going to lessen the amount of surplus going from the \npayroll tax into the Social Security trust fund, which really becomes a \nproblem when we have negative cash flow, just 13 years down the road.\n  Because Americans are living longer and having fewer children, there \nare going to be in the future fewer workers to support each \nbeneficiary. That means that Social Security will face rising deficits \nlong after baby boomers are retired and gone. There is widespread \nagreement that Social Security is facing a significant financial \nproblem.\n  We could lay out 10 different charts here that would demonstrate the \nproblems of Social Security. I do not think there is a single Democrat \nor single Republican who would have any disagreement with the problems \nof Social Security, now or for the next 75 years. It is mathematical \nand we ought to be able to find a mathematical solution to it.\n  But when it comes to finding a solution, there is very little \nagreement on what needs to be done to address this problem. President \nBush has made saving Social Security one of his top priorities this \nyear. We ought to thank the President for doing it, because now we are \nin a position 3 years away from where baby boomers are retiring. We can \nlook at this issue very dispassionately, not under a crisis \nenvironment. This is the period of time to deal with these problems. If \nPresident Bush had not raised this issue in the minds of the American \npeople, we would not be dealing with it in Congress.\n  I have to say, as chairman of the committee that has to deal with \nthis, I wish there was not a Social Security problem. Maybe people \ncould say, Senator Grassley, you are chairman of this committee; why \ndidn't you deal with this 2 or 3 years ago, or 4 or 5 years ago?\n  There are some things you could spend a lot of time on and not get \nanywhere, if you don't have any colleagues who want to deal with it. \nBut President Bush, using the bully pulpit of the Presidency, has \nraised this in the minds of people now. Polls show the vast majority of \nthe people know this is a problem Congress ought to deal with. So we \nought to praise the President for helping us along a very difficult \nroad here in the Congress, dealing with something that we would not \notherwise even be talking about. So it is one of his top priorities, \nand we ought to thank him for making this a top priority. He should be \ncommended for his leadership.\n  There are a lot of Members in this body who are now fully committed \nto saving Social Security and doing it this year. So, as chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I must be ever mindful of the concerns of \nmy colleagues and the rules of the Senate. Social Security improvement \nis one of the most politically sensitive issues Congress can ever deal \nwith. That is why the last time it was dealt with was in 1983. That is \n22 years ago.\n  President Clinton brought this issue to the attention of the American \npeople and to the Congress by his very well-thought-out statement: Save \nSocial Security first--before you do anything else. He even referred to \nSocial Security as a crisis. Somehow, according to my colleagues here, \nwhen President Bush says Social Security is in a crisis, that is wrong. \nBut I didn't hear those same people, in 1998 or 1997, when President \nClinton said it was a crisis, ``save Social Security first,'' saying \nthat there was anything wrong with calling it a crisis back then. Well, \nif it was a crisis then, it is more of a crisis now.\n  I don't care whether it is a crisis, a problem or a challenge, it is \nsomething we need to deal with and deal with today. That is because if \nwe deal with it today, this year, as opposed to next year, it is $600 \nbillion less of a problem, because it costs $600 billion more on a \ncumulative basis over the next 75 years to deal with it next year \ninstead of dealing with it this year.\n  President Clinton raised this issue, and even brought up the issue of \ninvesting in the stock market as an example. But then, all of a sudden, \nit was dropped like a hot potato, and it was not brought up again until \nPresident Bush brought it before us.\n  This is a very sensitive issue, one dealt with every 20 years. We \nought to deal with it now. We ought to welcome the opportunity to deal \nwith it. We can deal with it in a calm atmosphere, not the crisis of \n1983 when we were borrowing money from Medicare to keep Social Security \nchecks going, or when we as a Congress put--I don't know whether it was \n$10 billion or $20 billion, but we put billions of dollars from general \nrevenue into the trust fund to keep checks going. Prior to that, a lot \nof people were saying, I will never increase taxes, I will never cut \nbenefits. But you know what happens when you are in a crisis; you end \nup doing both.\n  We have an opportunity to do this in the calm and correct way, such \nas the promise Congress made 28 years ago--not in 1935, not in the \noriginal contract where these promises were made. These promises we \ncan't keep today were made 28 years ago. We have a chance to correct \nthem and we ought to take advantage of that opportunity.\n  Of course, as we are dealing with this sensitive issue, we are all \nmindful that the Senate's rules require at least 60 votes to reform \nSocial Security; that is, assuming that you would have a filibuster and \nyou would have to overcome the filibuster. As a result of anything \nwhich is going to get done, we have to build strong bipartisan support \nif we are to succeed. Consequently, even if every Republican would vote \nfor Social Security, that would be 55 votes, and you aren't going to \nget all of one party going in the same direction. We have to have \nbipartisanship to get anything done.\n  To begin the process of building bipartisanship and support for \nSocial Security, I have met with the ranking Democratic member of the \ncommittee. I do that on a regular basis, not just on Social Security \nbut on everything before our committee. We are going to try to find \nsome common ground. We usually do. Everything should be on the table \nfor discussion. We should consider all of our options. Developing a \nplan to protect and improve Social Security will be a complex and \nchallenging task. It will require the support of both Democrats and \nRepublicans. If we make a commitment to build a strong bipartisan \nconsensus, we can break down partisan roadblocks that threaten the \nfuture of Social Security, but the first step is to agree on the nature \nof the problem.\n  As I said, if I laid out 10 different charts with different aspects \nof the problems of Social Security, nobody would dispute them. It is \nquantifiable, it is mathematical, and hence the agreement.\n  We have had in this debate, though, some critics who would muddy the \nwater claiming that the Social Security problem is due to tax cuts that \nCongress enacted in 2001 and 2003. I don't quite understand how cutting \nthe income tax has anything to do with the trust fund being in trouble, \nbecause we have followed the pattern that was laid out by Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt in 1935; that he wanted a payroll tax, money \ndesignated for Social Security so that there is a relationship between \nwhat you pay into it with what you get out, so that it would be an \ninsurance program and not be a welfare program.\n\n  Maybe today, welfare doesn't receive the public's lack of respect it \ndid in the 1930s. In the 1930s, it was a shame to be on welfare. Maybe \ntoday it is not. That is part of our problem with our society as a \nwhole.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted to be very careful that people who \nreceived Social Security checks were not seen as being on welfare. They \nweren't on welfare because they paid into it. They were buying \ninsurance when they did that.\n  Arguing that the cutting of the income tax has something to do with \ntaking money out of the Social Security trust fund would be the same as \nsaying we are going to put this income tax into the trust fund and get \naway from the principle of a direct relationship between what you pay \nin and you\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\nget out in interest and principal, and, consequently, have it lean more \ntoward being a welfare program.\n  The Social Security problem has nothing to do with the tax cuts of \n2001 and 2003. The critics say that repealing the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts for the rich would cover the Social Security deficit. But \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, by the year 2050, the \ncost of extending the tax cuts, if you wanted to say it had something \nto do with the Social Security problem and make it a welfare program \ninstead of an insurance program, would be 0.7 percent of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  As you can see by this chart, the Social Security deficit is in fact \n1.4 percent of gross domestic product. In other words, repealing the \ntax cuts for everyone, not just the rich, would cover only half of the \nSocial Security deficit in the year 2050.\n  If you want to start figuring that way, then turn the Social Security \nprogram into a welfare program where you get away from the principle \nset by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that there had to be a relationship \nbetween what you pay in and what you draw out so that you weren't on \nwelfare, so you didn't have the shame of welfare of the 1930s.\n  Moreover, the sustained use of general revenue to fund Social \nSecurity would destroy the historical link between individual benefits \nand contributions, thereby turning Social Security into another tax-\nand-spend welfare program. The figures being used by critics do not \ncome from the Congressional Budget Office. They were made up by a \nliberal think tank often quoted here on the floor of the Senate. The \ncritics' figures are also based upon what we call present-value \ncalculations. Such calculations now would assume that a dollar of \nadditional taxes collected today will pay about $17 of Social Security \nbenefits down the road 50 years.\n  How could this be? These present-value calculations assume that all \nthe money the Government collects from repealing the tax cuts would \nsomehow be saved and be invested in interest-bearing assets, paying 5.8 \npercent a year in interest. There is simply no way for our Government \nto make this kind of investment. History shows that the Government \nspends every dollar of taxes it collects.\n  In fact, I often have said in the Senate I might be willing to \nincrease taxes if I thought every dollar collected would go to the \nbottom line to reduce it. But what I find in the Congress, you raise \ntaxes $1 and it gives Congress permission to spend $1.10 or $1.20 and \nsometimes even more. I have never run into anyone in Congress who wants \nhigher taxes who has ever told me how high taxes have to be to satisfy \ntheir appetite to spend money. Until I can find out how high taxes have \nto be, I will be very squeamish about raising taxes and somehow \nreducing the deficit.\n  The only way to prevent the Government from spending the tax cuts \nthey would propose would be to put them in personal accounts. \nUnfortunately, those who claim the tax cuts would pay for Social \nSecurity are the very same ones who oppose personal accounts.\n  There are a number of ways to address the Social Security long-term \ndeficits. One such proposal would change the benefit formula from wage \nindexing to price indexing. Some critics of price indexing claim it \nwould increase poverty among seniors. This point has been made in the \nSenate, but it is based on a number of erroneous assumptions.\n  First, critics say if you go back in time, reducing today's average \nbenefit level to the level that would have been paid in 1940, benefits \nwould be lower and poverty would be higher. What sort of spurious \ncomparison is that? In 1940, the average retirement benefit was 40 \npercent of the poverty level. In 1960, the average retirement benefit \nfor Social Security was about 60 percent of the poverty level. Today, \nthe average retirement benefit is about 120 percent of the poverty \nlevel. So it is just this simple: no one is going to index benefits \nback to 1940. But that is the argument being made by our colleagues. \nThe proposal that has been put forward would adjust, instead, today's \nbenefits going forward into the future, not backward.\n  I also point out that many of the price indexing proposals include a \nnew minimum benefit for low wage workers. An analysis by the Social \nSecurity Administration shows that a minimum benefit would actually \nreduce poverty more than current law does. So no one should be fooled \nby these spurious comparisons going back to 1940. It is almost \nlaughable that someone would make that argument in the Senate.\n  The President has made Social Security a priority issue, and Congress \nshould take advantage of this Presidential leadership. The chance to \nfix Social Security problems may not come again in 10 years. They will \ncome for sure in 10 years because if we do not do anything, we get to \nthe point of a crisis where people who want to increase taxes will not \nhave a problem getting their heart's desire of raising taxes. But you \nwill also do what no one wants to do: change the benefits. So we should \nnot miss this opportunity.\n  President Bush needs to keep using the spotlight to educate the \npublic about why we need to take action on Social Security. We want a \nsafe and secure retirement for every American. That is part of the \nsocial fabric of America. It is kind of like Grandpa Grassley. I am 71. \nI draw Social Security benefits. I am benefiting from a very good deal \nfrom the New Deal of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt--a good deal \nfor me, my mom and dad, my grandparents. But for Carrie Grassley, 9 \nyears old, my granddaughter, it is going to be a raw deal because \ndoing nothing around here is not an option. Doing nothing is a \nguaranteed benefit cut for Carrie Grassley.\n\n  It is kind of a moral issue, whether Grandma and Grandpa Grassley \ntoday ought to be concerned about a secure retirement for our children \nand grandchildren. Do we want to be selfish? I don't think I have a \nright to be selfish. I believe I need to be concerned about the next \ngeneration. We have that opportunity now. Are we going to take \nadvantage of it?\n  Social Security is a successful program. It definitely is a part of \nthe social fabric of America. These young people who are our pages are \npaying in dramatically for me to receive my Social Security check. Even \nif we did something today and they get 100 percent of the benefits that \nare promised today, they are still getting maybe not a raw deal but not \nas good as the deal I have. For sure, if we do nothing, 70 percent of \nthose benefits is a raw deal. We have an opportunity to do something \nabout it.\n  There has been a lot of attention brought to personal accounts by the \nother side of the aisle. The other side of the aisle has had a free \nride on the question of solvency of Social Security. What about keeping \npromises to Carrie Grassley and the young pages so they can have what \nwe have. What about everything else dealing with Social Security. Do \nthey have a responsibility? After all, we all get paid $160,000 a year. \nYou mean you cannot come to the table to negotiate with Chuck Grassley \non a problem we all agree ought to be done with or without personal \naccounts? But don't figure you are negotiating in good faith if you \nsay, before you sit down at the table, you can't have everything on the \ntable. That is what negotiations are about.\n  The other side has had the luxury of the public's attention on \npersonal accounts, and they are clouding that issue. This has given \nthem the opportunity to avoid these tough issues of providing for \nSocial Security for the pages or for Carrie Grassley. I don't think \nthey can get away with it very long.\n  I hope by this summer my committee is able to meet and report out a \nSocial Security bill. It is my intention to do that. Will I get the \ncooperation to do that? One person cannot provide the votes, but we \nought to have that sort of discussion and see what we can do to bring \nit before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. Let me first say how much I welcome the tone \nand the content of his remarks. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nis exactly right. We need to work together\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nto face the challenge in Social Security, and, frankly, the even much \nbigger challenge in Medicare because, as I indicated this morning, the \nshortfall in Medicare is eight times the shortfall in Social Security. \nWe also need to address these ballooning budget deficits and this \nmassive growth of debt. All of these things need to be dealt with.\n  I also believe tax reform needs to be part of this mix. Why? Because \nthe tax system we currently have is hemorrhaging revenue. The Revenue \nService tells us the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and \nwhat is being paid, is over $300 billion a year. By all accounts, that \nis a conservative estimate. So before anybody talks about a tax \nincrease for anybody, we ought to be talking about closing this massive \ntax gap--the difference between what is owed and what is being paid.\n  Senator Grassley made a number of references to the amendment I have \noffered that I think are not a correct characterization of my \namendment. I understand he said the amendment I have offered would not \ndo anything to address overspending by Congress until we fix Social \nSecurity. And his characterization of my amendment is that it says \ndon't do anything until we fix Social Security.\n  That is not what my amendment says. That is not what my amendment \ndoes. My amendment says, let's put Social Security as the top priority. \nLet's save Social Security first. It does not say ``only.'' It says \n``first.'' It says very simply: No new spending or no new tax cuts \nuntil Social Security is solvent, unless they are paid for.\n  Boy, there is a novel idea out here. You are going to pay for \nsomething. You can have all the tax cuts you want if you pay for them \nwith spending reductions or other revenue. You can have all the new \nspending you want if you pay for it by reductions elsewhere in spending \nor new revenue.\n  My amendment says you cannot have new spending or new tax cuts unless \nyou pay for them or if you are able to come out here and get a \nsupermajority vote. Otherwise, you have to wait until we put forward a \nplan that restores the solvency to Social Security. I think that is a \npretty good idea. That is what my amendment does.\n  My colleague from North Dakota is in the Chamber.\n  Can I ask the timekeeper where we are with respect to the time \nbetween now and 2:15 on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So 21\\1/2\\ minutes on this side.\n  What is remaining on the other side, if I could ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twenty-eight minutes. I understand Senator DeMint is \ncoming to offer an amendment. We will need a little bit of time to \nrespond to that.\n  So how much time will the Senator need?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to support the amendment offered \nby my colleague, Senator Conrad, which, in effect, says: Save Social \nSecurity first. Make Social Security a priority when we evaluate what \nwe want to do around here. There are a whole series of options that we \nface: increase spending, cut taxes or do both of these things. What my \ncolleague is saying is, save Social Security. Save Social Security \nfirst.\n  I also intend to support the amendment offered by my colleague from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson. Senator Nelson's amendment is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that Congress should reject any Social Security plan \nthat requires deep benefit cuts or a massive increase in debt.\n  Now, why is Senator Nelson offering that amendment? Well, because we \nhave the memorandum that was leaked from the White House in January \nthat outlined the plan that the President's chief strategist on Social \nSecurity was offering. The plan was relatively simple. The plan is, \nborrow a lot of money up front, anywhere from $1 to $5 trillion, \ndepending on how long a time you measure it. Borrow a lot of money. Put \nit in the stock market. Change the indexing formula in Social Security \nto cut benefits. Then you have borrowed money in the stock market, with \nSocial Security benefit cuts. Then you just sit back and wait and hope \nthat everything is going to be all right.\n  At the end of that memorandum from the White House it says this, \nwhich is very revealing: It says, ``This is the first time in six \ndecades we have had an opportunity to win on Social Security.'' We know \nwhat that means. They go back to Alf Landon, when they debated this \nSocial Security bill in the 1930s. They did not like it then. Some \nstill do not like it. They would like to take it apart.\n  Now, the President began at his State of the Union Address, and \naround the State of the Union Address other members of the \nadministration said the Social Security system is in crisis. They used \nthe terms, ``bankrupt,'' ``flat broke,'' ``busted.'' None of that is \ntrue.\n  It is the case, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that \nSocial Security, as a program, will be solvent until President George \nW. Bush is 106 years old. Let me say that again. The Congressional \nBudget Office says the Social Security system will be fully solvent \nuntil President George W. Bush is 106 years old. Now, they did not say \nthe ``Bush, 106 years old'' piece. They just described how many years \nit would be solvent. I have calculated, then, the President would be \n106 years old at that point.\n  Is that a crisis? No, it is not a crisis. People are living longer, \nhealthier lives. We may have to make some adjustments to Social \nSecurity, but it does not require major surgery, and it is not a \njustification for President Bush's plan to begin taking Social Security \napart, creating privatized accounts. It is not a justification for \nthat.\n  Now, in many ways, this is about values. I respect those who believe \nSocial Security should never have been adopted. I do not agree with \nthem. I respect their right to take that viewpoint. I respect those who \nwant to take the Social Security system apart right now. I do not agree \nwith that either, but I respect their right to make that case.\n  But it seems to me if you go back to 1935 at a time in this country \nwhen 50 percent of America's senior citizens were living in poverty, \nthis country decided: We cannot have that. We are not going to allow \nthat to happen. So we created an insurance program. Yes, it is \ninsurance not investments. The FICA, the tax that is taken out of your \ncheck every month--the ``I'' in FICA is insurance. That is what it \nmeans, insurance. It is the program that would always be there. You \ncould count on it. It is guaranteed. It is not the risk piece. The \nantithesis of security is risk. It is the portion of retirement \nsecurity that will be there. That is what it was created for. The woman \nwho received the first Social Security check in 1940 and the tens of \nmillions of American senior citizens who have received Social Security \nsince have, in many cases, been lifted out of poverty by this single \nact. Some say, well, it is something that should never have been done. \nOne of the leading voices on the far right says Social Security is a \nsoft underbelly of the liberal welfare state. That describes the \nmindset of people who don't want the Social Security program to exist, \nthe kind of people who voted against it in the 1930s.\n\n  As I said, this is about values, what is important to us. Some come \nto the floor and say the most important thing, by far, is to eliminate \nthe death tax--a tax which doesn't exist, incidentally. There is no \ndeath tax in America. There is a tax on inherited wealth. I spoke \nyesterday about that. Warren Buffett, the world's second richest man, \nmakes the point that if the majority party gets its way with respect to \nthe ``death tax'' and exempting dividends from taxation and so on, the \nworld's second richest man will be paying one-tenth the tax rate that \nthe receptionist in his office pays. That is from him, not me. Warren \nBuffett says under their plan he would end up paying a 3-percent tax, \nand the receptionist in his office, with the payroll taxes, would end \nup paying a 30-percent tax.\n  I asked the question yesterday, why do we have the philosophy in the \nChamber that seems to say let's tax\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nwork, but let's exempt investment? Is work less worthy? Is it really \nless worthy? Don't we value work? Don't we honor work? Don't we connect \neffort and reward? There are some who come to the Chamber and say, \nlook, there are priorities that are more important than Social \nSecurity. Cutting the tax on dividends and interest on passive income, \neliminating the so-called death tax--despite the fact that there is no \ndeath tax--they spend money to do that. That is more important to them \nthan the Social Security program.\n  I happen to think the Social Security program works well, and has for \na long while and will continue for a long while. It will be solvent for \n75 years with any kind of reasonable economic growth, with no changes. \nBut assuming we get a pessimistic rate of growth for 75 years, 1.9 \npercent compared to the 3.4 percent we had in the previous 75 years, \nassume, as the actuaries do, that we have an anemic growth of 1.9 \npercent, then we would have to make adjustments.\n  But that is not a pretext for what President Bush wants to do. What \nhe wants to do is simple. He said it in 1978 when he ran for Congress. \nIn 1978, when he ran for Congress, he said that Social Security will be \nbroke in 10 years. He meant 1988. Of course, that didn't happen. It \nwasn't true at the time. He said Social Security will be broke in 10 \nyears and we ought to go to privatized accounts.\n  So this is not new. It is not even about economics. It is about a \nphilosophy, about a decision and a desire to take apart the Social \nSecurity program. The question for this Congress is: Does Social \nSecurity have merit and worth for this country? Has it improved this \ncountry? Is it a part of this country's decisionmaking over the last \ncentury that has improved America?\n  In my judgment, the answer is yes. We have done a lot of things \ntogether. We decided in the last century about a lot of issues. Some of \nthem were hard. We had people die in the streets of this country who \ndemonstrated for the right for workers to organize. People literally \ndied in the streets as a result of violence over the issue of whether \nAmerican workers should be allowed to organize. Should they expect to \nbe able to work in safe workplaces, safe plants. Should we have child \nlabor laws. Should we have a minimum wage. Should we stop companies \nfrom dumping chemicals and sewage into the water and the air. And in \nthe panoply of all of those decisions, one was to say it is intolerable \nthat half of our senior citizens live in poverty. These are the people \nwho helped build our country, the people who understood about going to \na barnraising for the neighbor, about building a community, starting a \nchurch in a small town, about trying to raise a family by raising a \ncrop, and hoping that crop produces something you can sell in the fall \nto keep your family over the winter. Yes, the people who worked in the \nfactories, as well, that began to mass-produce products. These are the \nworkers of America who helped build this great country of ours. We \ndecided it is intolerable that one-half of them, when they reach their \ndeclining income years and retirement, should live in poverty; it is \nintolerable, as good as this country is.\n  So we contribute each month from our paycheck--all workers do--into a \nfund called Social Security. There are a lot of things you don't know \nabout growing old. You don't know about your health. You don't know \nwhich of your relatives will survive to be helpful to you when you grow \nold. But you do know this: If you work and if you had an investment \nfrom your paycheck in the required number of quarters, Social Security \nwill be there for you. You do know that. That is important.\n  Because we know that and because we now have nearly 70 years of \nexperience with this program, we ought to understand that this ranks \nright near the top of the things we need to do to make this a better \ncountry: Preserve, strengthen, and nurture the Social Security system \nfor the long term.\n  I oppose the President's proposal. I think it is a proposal that will \nbegin to take apart the Social Security program. I support the \namendments that will be offered and voted on this afternoon. Those \namendments make good sense and they move us in the direction of \ndeciding the following: We are going to strengthen and preserve Social \nSecurity for the long term. It ranks as a priority, the highest \npriority for this Congress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor Senator Stabenow's amendment to restore funding for our first \nresponders, including local law enforcement. I am proud to cosponsor \nthis amendment. We cannot continue to cut justice assistance program \nfunding, particularly Byrne grant, local law enforcement block grants, \nand COPS funding.\n  The Byrne Grant Program, which was merged last year with the LLEBG \nprogram in a move I did not support, is vital to the efforts of local \nlaw enforcement in Montana to combat methamphetamine and other illicit \ndrugs. I have heard this again and again and again, from local law \nenforcement agencies to the Montana Narcotics Officers Association to \nthe Governor's office to the attorney general's office. The Byrne \nprogram helps communities hire additional local law enforcement, \noperate drug task forces, and send local law enforcement to drug \ntraining.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget proposes an elimination of the \nByrne Grant Program. This combined with cuts proposed by the President \nto the high intensity drug trafficking area HIDTA, program and other \njustice assistance programs, would be a disaster for Montana. It would \nset the clock back years in our efforts to fight the rapid spread of \nmethamphetamine in Montana.\n  According to the Montana Board of Crime Control, this is what will \nhappen to Montana if the President's fiscal year 2006 budget is \nenacted:\n  1. Montana will lose its multijurisdiction drug enforcement capacity, \nincluding seven multijurisdictional drug task forces. This means that \nalready stretched local law enforcement agencies will have to do what \nthey can to address drug enforcement at the local level, without \nbroader support from the drug task forces.\n  2. Montana will lose 33 drug enforcement offices throughout the \nState.\n  3. Montana will experience a significant increase in drug \navailability, manufacturing and trafficking and drug-related crime.\n  4. Montana would experience an increase in clandestine labs that \nmanufacture methamphetamine.\n  5. Montana would experience a reduction in the amounts of illegal \ndrugs and guns removed from our communities.\n  6. Montana would experience the elimination of funds for rural law \nenforcement agencies' manpower, equipment, and training.\n  The above impacts translate to a complete loss of rural drug \nenforcement in Montana and are only the tip of the iceberg. The \nmanufacturing, trafficking, drug addiction, and crime will have a \nripple effect throughout the State in our public health and correction \nsystems and the courts, negatively affecting public safety and the \nquality of life in Montana.\n  The Byrne program and similar programs support the majority of pro-\nactive drug enforcement in the 56 counties of my State. This is because \nwe are spread so thin across a vast area with a small population and an \ninternational border--Byrne is essential to us.\n  To protect our kids and our communities--our homeland--we have to \ncontinue aggressive drug enforcement across Montana. We have to \ncontinue teaching hundreds of classes to the good citizens helping to \nstop the spread of drugs like meth, including realtors, retailers, \ncivil groups, and other local law enforcement agencies. Byrne funding \nis the difference between stopping a few street level drug sales and \nstopping drug manufacturing and distribution on a much larger scale.\n  Working hand-in-hand with Byrne Grant Program funding is the COPS \nProgram. The COPS Program helps pay for all meth lab cleanups in \nMontana, protecting children and others from the harmful health impacts \nof the chemicals used to make meth. Additionally, the COPS Program \nhelps provide for more law enforcement in drug enforcement units, while \nmaintaining enough police officers patrolling our streets.\n  According to the president of the Montana Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, COPS funding is necessary to maintain an adequate number of \npolice in the field to protect our communities. He has told me that \nwithout COPS funding, the number of crimes,\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\nespecially violent crimes, will begin to rise again. And currently, \nthere is no other alternative to the COPS Program. He tells me that the \nCOPS Program is one of those programs that works, one of those programs \nthat is directly responsible for protecting our communities, for \ngetting the officers out on the street to protect us all.\n  In short, the Byrne and COPS Programs represent a relatively minor \nFederal investment in our local communities that pays huge dividends in \nterms of the health and safety of our citizens. We are also talking \nabout communities that cannot foot the bill by themselves, particularly \nin a rural, low-population State like Montana. We just can't kid \nourselves that the money will magically appear elsewhere.\n  I guarantee that Montana is not the only State that will suffer a \ndramatic loss in drug enforcement capability under the President's \nproposed budget. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the \nimportant amendment of the Senator from Michigan. We cannot shortchange \nour law enforcement--stopping the spread of illegal drugs is important \nto the security of our homeland, too.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could have an update on the time \nsituation both on the amendment and on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining. The \nmajority has 28\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is on the amendment. And on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the resolution, the majority has 15 hours, \nthe minority has 14 hours.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I assume the time in quorum calls is being charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not. The Chair corrects himself. The \nunanimous consent request that was agreed to does equally share quorum \ncall time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Maybe someone who is listening to \nthese proceedings can hear me outside this Chamber. Hopefully, Senator \nDeMint is either on his way to the floor or will be shortly because we \nhave the time until 2:15 p.m. At 2:15 p.m., we will be turning the \nattention of the Chamber to Senator Lindsey Graham. So on Senator \nDeMint's amendment, if he is to have much time, it would have to come \nbefore 2:15 or the time after 2:15 will have to be shared.\n  I hope somebody is listening to this and will advise Senator DeMint \nthat if he wants to have as much time as possible before the votes that \nare scheduled, he should come soon.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been advised that Senator DeMint \nmay not be here soon to discuss his amendment. So I am going to respond \nto his amendment before he has laid it down. We have been advised of \nwhat the amendment is. I think if I do not do that, my time will run \nout, and there will not be any chance to respond.\n  Senator DeMint's amendment says just this:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act would result \n     in massive debt, deep benefit cuts, and tax increases.\n\n  I agree with the first clause of the Senator's amendment. In fact, it \nis an amendment I support. Senator Nelson's amendment says roughly the \nsame, that we should reject any Social Security plan that requires deep \nbenefit cuts or a massive increase in debt. But the additional clause \nof the Senator's amendment says ``and a failure to act would result in \nmassive debt,'' I agree with that. ``Deep benefit cuts,'' I agree with \nthat. ``And tax increases,'' I cannot agree with that because it is \njust not accurate. It is not accurate.\n  The way it works, when we get out to 2052, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, and Social Security can only meet 78 \npercent of its obligations, what happens at that point is the benefits \nare reduced by that shortfall amount. There is no tax increase that is \ntriggered. The benefits are cut.\n\n  Try as I might, I want to be able to support the Senator's amendment \nbecause the first clause is exactly right. We should reject any Social \nSecurity plan that requires deep benefit cuts or massive increase in \ndebt. That is, unfortunately, what the President's plan does. But when \nhe goes on and says, ``. . . and a failure to act would result in \nmassive debt, deep benefit cuts, and tax increases,'' it just as a \nmatter of fact is not true.\n  I understand there maybe is a sense that will happen, but, in fact, \nwhat does happen is when you get to that point, 2052, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, and Social Security can only meet 78 \npercent of its obligations, the benefits are cut by that amount of the \nshortfall. There is no tax increase that is triggered.\n  I just cannot support something that is not factually accurate. I \nwish the Senator were here. I wish he would be open to changing his \namendment because if we just state it in a factually accurate way, I \nwould be happy to support it. But I cannot support something that is \nfactually not the case.\n  We have an ongoing problem here. The ongoing problem is that this \nbudget in this conversation is utterly detached from reality. It is \ndetached from reality because we are running massive record budget \ndeficits, and the party in the majority comes with a budget that just \nincreases the debt each and every year, by their own calculation, by \nover $600 billion.\n  Maybe somebody could bring me the chart from their own budget \ndocument that shows what their own calculation is of what this budget \ndoes.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues on the majority side of the \naisle, do they really want to support a budget that at a time of record \ndeficits and burgeoning debt says more of the same?\n  I know the rhetoric on the other side is this budget is fiscally \nresponsible, it cuts the deficit in half over 5 years. But the only way \nit reduces the deficit over 5 years is it leaves out things. It leaves \nout war costs, it leaves out the need to fix the alternative minimum \ntax, it leaves out the President's Social Security proposal.\n\n  Here is what the budget before us does, according to their own \ndocument. This is on page 5. It shows the increases in the debt that \nwould result if this budget is adopted: a $669 billion increase in the \ndebt this year; next year it increases the debt $636 billion; the next \nyear it increases the debt $624 billion; the next year it increases the \ndebt $622 billion; the next year it increases the debt $611 billion. \nThis is not my document. This is in the budget resolution before us, \nand it says this is a blueprint to increase the debt $3 trillion. Is \nthat what we should be doing? Is that really the blueprint to \nstrengthen America's economic security? I do not believe so. I think \nthat would be a profound mistake.\n  Mr. President, what is the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate that failing to address the financial \n condition of Social Security will result in masive debt, deep benefit \n                        cuts and tax increases)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 150\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act would result \n     in massive debt, deep benefit cuts and tax increases.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am encouraged by the debate today that \nrecognizes, as we consider our budget, that Social Security and its \nfuture is an important part of budget considerations. My amendment \ntoday recognizes that if we do nothing with Social Security, which \nseems to be the intent of some in this Chamber, that will only result \nin deep benefit cuts or massive increases in debt, and a failure to act \nnow will result in not keeping our promise to today's and tomorrow's \nseniors.\n  We need to address the challenge of Social Security. It is first a \npromise we must keep. Those who suggest that we need to cut benefits on \ntoday's seniors or even tomorrow's workers should consider the promise \nwe made to seniors. Those who suggest that we do not have a problem \nwith Social Security until the year 2042 do not recognize the facts \nthat our own Social Security Administration is giving us year after \nyear.\n  We can see clearly that the current level of payroll taxes that comes \nfrom our workers' paychecks every month will fund Social Security as it \nis today only through the year 2018. After 2018, the amount of money \nthat will be required in addition to payroll taxes increases \ndramatically through 2079, and continues to grow beyond that day.\n  I think it is inconceivable that in this Chamber today people are \ntelling us we can push this problem down to the next generation and not \naddress it. What will happen under current law with Social Security, if \nwe continue along the same road we are traveling today, is in 2018 we \nwill begin to pull massive amounts of money from our general fund, \ntaking money from our defense, from our education system, from our road \nsystem, and many of the Nation's priorities will have to move from the \ngeneral fund to keep promised benefits to seniors. Beyond this point, \nwe will continue to redeem the IOUs in the Social Security trust fund.\n  I want to get back to the trust fund in a minute because I am afraid \nthose who still believe there is money in the trust fund probably still \nbelieve there is a Santa Claus. But if we use all the IOUs in this \ntrust fund, what will happen in this year that is talked about on this \nfloor today is in 2042 under current Social Security law, benefits for \ntomorrow's retirees will be cut by over 125 percent in order to be paid \nfor by payroll taxes.\n  The call by our President and many of the leadership on the \nRepublican side now to address this issue today is to avoid this cut in \nbenefits in the future. It is unfair to tell the young workers of today \nthat if they continue to pay into their Social Security benefits \nthrough their payroll taxes they will get a Social Security benefit \nequal to those receiving it today. It is, frankly, not true.\n\n  I believe we can reform and save and strengthen our Social Security \nsystem without cutting benefits, and without raising payroll taxes. In \nfact, I believe it is the responsibility of this Senate, this Congress, \nand this President to do exactly that.\n  There are bills that have been proposed that will begin to say what \npeople save, what people are putting into Social Security, not taking \nmoney out of Social Security but to save the money that is going into \nSocial Security for tomorrow's workers.\n  If we only today began the process of saving the current Social \nSecurity surplus--let me address that quickly--for the next 13 years or \nso, which this line here represents, this year it is like $100 billion \nof money that is coming in for Social Security that is being spent on \nother programs. If all we did until 2018 was to save the Social \nSecurity surplus within the Social Security system, we would create a \nstronger Social Security system that has real savings in it.\n  The problem with Social Security today is not that taxes are too low, \nor that benefits are too high, but the problem with Social Security is \nwe have been taking money from workers for years and not saving it. We \nhave been spending it on other things. Now the general fund owes the \nSocial Security system well over $1 trillion.\n  The proposal by the President, and by many in the House and the \nSenate today, is to begin to save part of what people are putting into \nSocial Security, allow that money to earn interest, compound interest, \nand to grow so that over a period of years we will transform Social \nSecurity from a political promise with nothing but IOUs into a secure \nand a guaranteed retirement income for tomorrow's seniors.\n  My amendment does something very simple. It recognizes that if we do \nwhat has been proposed by many today, that we ignore Social Security, \nthat we push it to the next generation, it will result in either \nsignificant benefit cuts or massive, large increases in payroll taxes \nor huge transfers from our general fund, which will affect many of the \nNation's other priorities.\n  It is a simple request to ask my colleagues to recognize the problem.\n  I appreciate the President's efforts to tell the American people we \nhave a problem that needs to be solved. I appreciate his willingness to \nconsider saving Social Security by saving payroll taxes that are being \npaid already by workers.\n  I ask for consideration of this amendment. I believe it is important \nfor the American people to know that doing nothing to address Social \nSecurity will hurt every American and will hurt our country as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have an amendment I will send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself \n     and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 152.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the urgent need \n    for legislation to ensure the long term viability of the Social \n                           Security program)\n\n       At the end of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 68 percent by 2078;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.3 percent by 2078;\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2004 dollars or \n     $3,700,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2004 to 6.6 percent in 2078; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all \n     warned that failure to enact fiscally responsible Social \n     Security reform quickly will result in 1 or more of the \n     following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system;\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time do we have on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes on each side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try to be brief. I see the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, has come to the floor.\n  First, I thank Senator Conrad, who has been a good ally in trying to \ndefine the problems the country faces. There are about $40-something \ntrillion in promises we have made to the public through different \nentitlement programs and there is not money to pay those promises. That \nis what gets us here.\n  It is time for the country to come to grips with the idea we promised \na lot of retirement benefits, we promised a lot of medical benefits, \nMedicaid benefits for people who are disabled and poor people, and we \ndo not have the revenue streams over time to support those benefits. So \n2 years ago Senator Conrad and myself worked on a resolution trying to \ndefine the problem. There are many different views of whether it is a \nproblem or a crisis, how to fix it, where the accounts fit in, should \nwe borrow the money, should we raise revenue.\n  Quickly, I believe that without restructuring benefits and \nrestructuring taxes you cannot get there from here. I know a lot of \npeople do not want to hear that, but in 2018 we begin to pay out more \nin benefits than we collect in taxes, and it only gets worse over time \nbecause when I was born in 1955 there were 16 workers for every \nretiree. Today there are 3\\1/2\\, and 20 or 30 years from now there will \nbe 2. So it is nobody's fault. It is not the Democrat or Republican \nParty's fault.\n  The fact is, there has been a huge demographic change in the country \ncalled the baby boom. It is a big elephant working its way through the \nsystem. We need to adjust for it, and we need to make promises in the \nfuture, starting now, that we can afford to make and that are honest \npromises.\n  My goal, and I believe this about Senator Conrad, is to restructure \nSocial Security and other entitlements in a fiscally responsible way so \nfuture generations do not live in fear of the check not coming, the \nbenefit not being there, and we are willing to make some hard \ndecisions. But this amendment is not about those hard decisions. This \namendment is about, Where do we stand as a nation vis-a-vis Social \nSecurity.\n\n  If I may, I will read some of the findings:\n\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n\n  Not only is that a true statement, it is an essential statement for \nus to make as a body, Republican and Democrat, because half the seniors \ntoday who receive a Social Security check would be in poverty if it \nwere not for the Social Security check. So it is the foundation of \nretirement income for many Americans.\n\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n\n  I think we can all agree on that. We did 2 years ago. The word \n``crisis'' or ``problem'' is not in there. ``Vital national priority'' \nis because for millions of Americans this is what you count on when you \nretire.\n\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n\n  What does that mean? It means what I said before. Senator Conrad and \nI agreed 2 years ago that in 1950 there were 16\\1/2\\ workers for every \nretiree; in 2002, 3.3. And over time it comes down to two workers per \nretiree because families are smaller.\n\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n\n  And that 2018 number varies: 6 months, 12 months. That is the right \ntimeframe. What does that mean for average Americans? It means for the \nfirst time in the history of this system, the first time ever, we will \npay more out in benefits than we collect in taxes. It is true that we \nhave collected more in taxes than we have paid in benefits, and we put \nthem in Treasury notes and borrowed the money to operate the \nGovernment. I do not like it. To Senator Conrad's credit, he does not \nlike it either. That has been the practice of both parties here. But \nthat is not the reason Social Security is going to run out of money.\n  If you took all the notes and redeemed them and put the money back in \nthe system, you buy solvency for a period of time, but by no means do \nyou fix the problem. So 2018 is an important date. It is a historic \ndate. It is the first time in the history of this program we pay out \nmore in benefits than we collect in taxes.\n  Now, what does that mean over time?\n\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 68 percent by 2078;\n\n  Now, the definition of ``bankruptcy'' we can argue about, but it is \nusually an inability to pay the obligations when they come due. In \n2042, it is not bankrupt in terms of no money to be paid. In 2042, \naccording to the Social Security Administration, only 73 percent of the \nbenefits will be paid. So to do nothing means that we start paying more \nthan we collect and eventually we have to cut benefits across the \nboard. And by 2078, 68 percent of the benefits are able to be paid.\n\n  There are millions of Americans who could not suffer that in their \nretirement life because when these cuts come by doing nothing, they \ncome across the board. They do not treat somebody who makes $30,000 \ndifferently than they treat somebody who is in the Senate who now makes \n$160,000. I think we should try to avoid that in a bipartisan way.\n\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.3 percent by 2078;\n\n  What that means is if you want to restore full benefits, you are \ngoing to have to go and get more money because from 2018 to 2042 you \ntap all the reserves. At 2042 you have a scheduled benefit cut. To \navoid it, you have to bring new money to the table. And if you did it \nby raising payroll taxes, you would have a massive tax increase in \npayroll tax rates, which would make us less competitive in a global \neconomy against China and everyone else because the payroll tax is a \nsignificant problem for business. But it is the way we fund Social \nSecurity, and we should not raise it unless we absolutely have to. To \ndo nothing means it is going to be raised in a dramatic fashion.\n\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2004 dollars or \n     $3,700,000,000,000 [in 2004 dollars] measured in present \n     value terms;\n\n  In English that means you need $3.7 trillion of new money today to \nget this thing solvent to 2075. And we are talking about trying to take \n1 percent out of the Medicaid program. How do you get $3.7 trillion of \nnew money put in the system today to keep Social Security solvent for \nthe next 75 years? I\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\ndon't know how to do that without some sacrifice. There is a way to do \nit, and we will talk about that, I guess, down the road. But that is a \nfact. We are $3.7 trillion short of the money we need to keep this \nsystem afloat until 2075.\n\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2004 to 6.6 percent in 2078;\n\n  When you add Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security together, it is \n25 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  Now, listen to this: In 2080, 25 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct will be spent on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Right \nnow, the entire Federal budget, everything we spend, is 20 percent. \nThese three programs will outpace what we spend on the entire \nGovernment if we do nothing. So is this a problem? To me it is. I \nprobably will not be around in 2078, but I don't want to pass on to \npeople who are going to be around in 2078 a huge problem they can never \nwork themselves out of.\n\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all \n     warned that failure to enact fiscally responsible Social \n     Security reform quickly will result in 1 or more of the \n     following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n\n  That is one way to avoid the benefit cuts. We talked about that.\n\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n\n  To not put new money in means you reduce benefits across the board.\n\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n\n  That is what you would need to do if you did not raise the taxes: \nborrow money, cut other programs.\n  The sense of the Senate--this is what we agreed to by voice vote. \nEverything I have read to you was agreed to by voice vote 2 years ago. \nIt is not preferring one solution over another. It is not saying where \naccounts are good or bad or that indexing is good or bad. It is \ndefining the problem in responsible terms, picking dates that other \npeople have told us exist, being honest about the unfunded liability, \nbeing honest about the consequences of doing nothing. And from this I \nhope we can find a way to do something in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The sense of the Senate says:\n\n       (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system;\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n\n  I think we all agree with that.\n\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n\n  I hope we can still agree on this because this is as true now as it \nwas 2 years ago. It is more important than it was 2 years ago to define \nthe problems in honest terms without prejudicing any solution proposal.\n  I want to publicly thank Senator Conrad for stepping to the plate, as \nhe has in the past, to put on the table that Social Security has a \nproblem. We have done a joint op-ed piece defining this problem, and \nfor that I am grateful.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me address the amendment of the \nSenator. Let me say, I am generally supportive of this amendment. I \nthink it lays out accurately our overall situation. The fact is, we \nhave a challenge in Social Security, not a crisis in the sense that \nSocial Security checks are not going to be written tomorrow or next \nmonth or next year.\n  But the longer term problem we have is the demographic problem. That \nis the reality. The sooner we deal with it, the better. It is also \nimportant for people to understand that this demographic challenge is \nnot just in Social Security. In fact, we have a much bigger challenge \nin Medicare; the shortfall there is eight times the shortfall in Social \nSecurity.\n  There are two things I want to indicate about this amendment that \ntrouble me and I thought were going to be changed. Let me just \nindicate, on page 3:\n\n       Without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25 trillion in constant 2004 dollars or $3.7 trillion \n     measured in present value terms.\n\n  I thought the $25 trillion was going to be taken out and $3.7 \ntrillion, which was in our op-ed, was going to be the number.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Using 2004 dollars would be very acceptable.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You are willing to strike that one phrase?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that.\n  The one other thing I wanted to mention was, on page 4, it says:\n\n       The President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system.\n\n  I raise the issue about ``permanently.'' I do so for this reason. I \nknow we included that word before. I would like to do that as well. \nHere is the problem I have with the word. I don't want to send an \nincorrect signal about my own intentions. The fundamental problem I \nhave is, to do it permanently, one has to have some projection of long-\nterm economic growth, and the long-term economic growth one has to have \na projection of is forever. I have very little confidence in these \nlong-term projections.\n  As the Senator knows well, the underlying projection is that the \neconomy is only going to grow 1.8 to 1.9 percent every year for the \nnext 75 years when, in fact, the economy has grown over the last 75 \nyears by 3.4 percent.\n  This shows pictorially what I am talking about. I am very troubled \nwith this long-term forecast. The Social Security Administration \nassumes growth of the economy is going to slow considerably after 2015. \nThey have a long-term assumption of economic growth, on this red line, \nof 1.8 percent. That is what they are saying the growth is going to be \nover the next 75 years. Yet here is what we have seen, going back to \n1950. The green bars on the chart are what economic growth has actually \nbeen. The red line is what they are projecting going forward. You can \nsee their projection going forward is much lower economic growth than \nwe have actually experienced over the last 55 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand this chart, each column is a 5-year \nperiod; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There has been no 5-year period since 1950--none during \nthat period--in which the growth of long-term GDP has been at or below \nthe line they are projecting; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So we have exceeded it in each of these 5-year periods \nover that 55-year span?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I know they make very conservative assumptions, but it \nseems to be clear that their projection is apart from reality. I have \nseen projections into the future that don't parallel this assumption of \nthe 1.8 percent. They go low in terms of the assumption of what growth \nis going to be as we move out into the future.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The reason for their very pessimistic forecast is they \nare looking at productivity growth and new entrants to the workforce as \nthe two drivers of economic growth going forward. They have a very low \nnumber for new entrants into the workforce because of the demographic \nchange. I think we can all understand that. But they also have a very \nlow number of productivity growth for the next 75 years--1.6 percent a \nyear of productivity growth. The fact is, productivity growth has been \nabout double that in the last 5 years. So I, frankly, don't believe the \n75-year forecast. That doesn't mean, by the way, that we don't have a \nchallenge. I want to be clear. It reduces the challenge, and if these \nprojections are wrong and they are overly pessimistic, it makes a \nsubstantial difference in how big the problem is. We\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nare still left with a challenge of this demographic change.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not only how big the problem is, but I guess when the \nproblem would occur, how soon it would be upon us.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The better we do on the growth compared to \nprojections----\n  Mr. CONRAD. It pushes the problem forward. For example, the \nCongressional Budget Office had told us that the trust fund would go \ncash negative in 2018. Now, they have updated their forecast to say, \nno, we won't go cash negative until 2020, because economic growth has \nbeen stronger than the underlying forecast. A big reason for that is \nproductivity growth has been much stronger than the underlying \nforecast. So I think it is very important that we be clear.\n  That is why the word ``permanently'' gives me heartburn in the sense \nthat we are trying to forecast forevermore, and I just flatout don't \nbelieve this forecast for 75 years. I want to make clear that we still \nhave a challenge. We still need to address this problem because we have \nthe demographic problem. That is one reason I have tried to talk to my \ncolleagues about not just Social Security but Medicare and the budget \ndeficit and Medicaid, because it is all these things coming together \nthat really presents us with a challenge. It is real.\n  In any event, I don't know what the Senator's disposition is on the \nword ``permanently,'' if he would be willing to change that or maybe he \nis wedded to that. I don't know.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to stick with what we did 2 years ago. I will \ncomment why, and I will wait until the Senator gets through.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have tried to be clear on the problem I have with that \none word. That said, because I support the thrust of this, I intend to \nsupport it. I want to make clear that I believe we should be looking \ntoward 75-year solvency because I think the forecasts are so murky, and \nwe would make a real advance if we were to secure 75-year solvency. \nWith that said, I think the overall direction of the amendment is good.\n  I ask the Chair, where are we in time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The \nmajority has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield 7 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks to Senator \nGraham for a moment, if I could get his attention. I wanted to direct \nsome remarks to the Senator. First, I wish to thank the Senator. I \nthink what he is doing here is quite different than what we have been \ngetting from this White House. The Senator is being very careful to \nessentially say, let's get together and work together to solve the \nproblem.\n  I also believe that the word ``permanently'' is a little naive. I \ndon't mind it, but the point is, nothing is permanent around here \nexcept we are going to die one day. We cannot bind future Congresses. I \nget the Senator's point that we want to make sure this challenge is \nmet. Believe me, I intend to meet it. I intend to meet it without \nputting us in debt, and the Senator is totally silent on that; I \nappreciate that. This country is in debt now $7.7 trillion. This \nadministration has turned it around. We started to balance the budget, \npay back Social Security. It has been turned around.\n  We have the highest debt ever. A child born today has about $40,000 \nworth of debt on his or her back. This is painful for our country: $7.7 \ntrillion of debt is $1 million a day for 21,000 years. That is what it \nis. I appreciate the fact that unlike the President's plan, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina does not talk about borrowing those staggering sums \nof money because there are a lot of us who will not do that to the \nAmerican people. They are being burdened enough with this debt now.\n  The Senator is also silent on privatization. My hat is off to him on \nthat because, as we know, the Democrats are saying, if you want to \nprivatize this system, the only way you are going to do that is to put \nus deeper in debt, and you are going to take an overhead of one-half of \n1 percent and turn it into a 20-percent overhead. That is according to \na University of Chicago study.\n  I so appreciate that the Senator does not mention borrowing because \nwe are staggering in red ink, and he does not mention privatization \nbecause it is a nonstarter. When you privatize, you take a guaranteed \nbenefit and turn it into a guaranteed gamble. I have nothing against \nWall Street, I once worked on Wall Street. I was a stockbroker. \nSometimes it works out great, but you cannot count on it, not at all. \nSo why would we take a system that has worked perfectly and turn it \ninto a gamble, except if we really wanted to get some of that money \naway from the trust fund and into the hands of Wall Street.\n  I was in the House of Representatives in 1983, and I supported two \nicons in politics: Ronald Reagan, a Republican icon, and Tip O'Neill, a \nDemocratic icon. They followed the spirit of the approach of Senator \nGraham, which is we get together because, guess what. The people are \nmore important than the politics.\n\n  We have a President who is doing his round of townhall meetings all \nacross this great Nation. I think it is great. He is working hard to \nsell his privatization plan, to tell people they better listen to him \nor else they are going to be sorry. But do you know what the President \ndid not count on? That the people understand what Social Security is.\n  So you can do a song and dance about privatization, you can talk \nabout it in poetry, you can talk about an ownership society, but they \nare not fooled because this is what the people know: They pay a portion \nof their check over to the Social Security trust fund, and when they \nretire, they get a safety net retirement. It is safe, and it is sure. \nIt has never defaulted. It is there.\n  And guess what. If the head of household dies and there are kids, \nthey get a benefit. A lot of my constituents understand this. My own \nhusband's father died when he was 10 years old. His mother had three \nkids. She was a stay-at-home mom. What would she do? Social Security. \nOne of those kids, my husband's brother, was mentally disabled. What \nwould she do? Social Security.\n  I praise my friend for not talking about putting this country into \ndeeper debt--we are not going to go there--and for not mentioning \nprivatization because we are not going to go there. We are not going to \ntake money out of the trust fund and give it to Wall Street. We are not \ngoing to have a Social Security system that has an overhead cost one-\nhalf of 1 percent and turn it into a 20-percent overhead and turn it \ninto a gamble. We are not going to do it.\n  The people are smart. They get it. I do not care how many townhall \nmeetings any of us has, this is one the people understand. I have my \nown townhall meetings. The people get it, whether they are Republicans, \nDemocrats, or Independents. They say Social Security works and why \nwould we turn our back on it.\n  Watch out for the word ``reform.'' If it is truly reform, we should \ndo it. But if it is repeal, which is what privatization is, we are not \ngoing to do it.\n  Again, with the same reservations that my friend has, I read this \namendment and I say, bravo, we can talk, if we are not going to borrow. \nWe can talk, if we are not going to privatize. We can talk, if we are \nnot going to set up a two-tier system that hurts people. We can talk. \nAnd we can do what we did in the eighties. I was proud to stand with my \nPresident at that time, Ronald Reagan, and my Speaker at that time, Tip \nO'Neill, these icons who got behind a very simple plan.\n  And by the way, there are many civil ways. My friend has outlined \none. We can step to the plate on this challenge.\n  Let's stop using the word ``crisis'' because you are not fooling \nanybody. Mr. President, 22 years ago the Cato Institute put out a \npaper. They said: Make people think it is a crisis as soon as you can. \nIf they think it is a crisis, they may accept the end of Social \nSecurity. Tell them it is an iceberg coming.\n  That is what the White House secret little memo did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds, and then I will \nstop.\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The people are smart. They know there are some people \naround here who have been trying to get rid of Social Security for \ndecades. We cannot trust this matter to people who have wanted to do \naway with Social Security. The President himself said in 1978 that \nSocial Security will go broke by 1988 unless it is privatized. He was \nwrong then; he is wrong now. He said in the year 2000 that people act \nas if Social Security is a Federal program or something. How do we \ntrust someone who does not know Social Security is a Federal program \nwhere people pay their insurance, they pay for it, and they get back \nwhat they put in, plus a safety net?\n  I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank my friend, Senator Graham, \nfor offering us something that I think many of us will be able to vote \nfor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi will state his \ninquiry.\n  Mr. LOTT. How is the time divided between now and 3 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 minutes, \nand the Senator from South Carolina has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Mississippi 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks before we start this \nseries of votes at 3 o'clock. I understand there will be several \nstacked votes, four or five at that time.\n  First, I remind my colleagues that this is an important process. This \nis a process where we pass a budget resolution. This is a blueprint \nthat we are trying to put in place of how we will proceed the rest of \nthis year and even, depending on the enforcement mechanisms, next year. \nThis is not written in stone. This is not the Ten Commandments. This is \nan outline. This is a blueprint. These are aggregate numbers.\n  I must say, ashamedly, for 2 of the last 3 years we did not have a \nbudget. I think that is one reason we had such a mess at the end of the \nsession last year. I admit, it was an election year, but we need to \nhave some guidelines of what are we expected to do at Commerce, how can \nwe do a better job at the Transportation Security Administration, how \nmuch money is going to be available, what is going to be available at \nthe Finance Committee, what are we going to do with our entitlement \nprograms and tax policy? One way or the other, what are the \nappropriators going to do?\n  I hope my colleagues will not get too overwrought and too much into \nthe details. I do not like a lot of this budget proposal. I do not like \na lot of what the President proposed, but I will have my opportunity to \nmake my case and I will have my opportunity to vote for or against \nparts of it. This is just the beginning. This is the kickoff.\n  By the way, it should be a bipartisan effort to get this budget \nresolution in place.\n  I think the committee has done a good job. First, it cuts the deficit \nin half within 5 years. We have been dealing with increased defense \nneeds. We have been trying to figure out all the needs of homeland \nsecurity. We had economic problems, and the deficit has gone up. Now it \nis time we begin to do something about it. We need to begin to control \nspending, and we need to be careful about our tax policy which can hurt \nthe economy if we have raised taxes or if we cut taxes even in the \nwrong way versus cutting taxes in a way that gives incentive for \ngrowth.\n  This budget starts in the right direction of reducing the deficit. It \nfully funds the President's request for defense and homeland security. \nI guess we need to do that. The numbers are adequate in both areas. I \nwould like to see some more in defense. And I do not like the mix in \nthe President's budget for defense. But that is not what we will decide \nhere.\n\n  This bill maintains job-creating tax policy and it strengthens budget \nenforcement tools. Because we did not have a budget resolution last \nyear, and 2 years before that, we have been losing our ability to \nimpose some budget and fiscal restraint. This resolution does provide \noutlines that will take us into doing more, and doing a better job at \neducation, energy, welfare, and pension policy, all of which we need to \ndo.\n  I hope we will be careful. Let's not get too hot with the rhetoric \nthis week. When we get to Thursday night or Friday, we will pass a \nbudget resolution and move forward.\n  With regard to the amendments, I was interested to see we got some \namendments on Social Security. This may be good. Is this a sign that \nDemocrats are going to join us and we are going to have a serious \ndiscussion? Senator Lindsey Graham has his neck way out there, so far \nout I am not about to join him where he is right now, but he is trying \nto get us going, get engaged in this discussion. A lot of people say we \ncan't do this, we can't talk about any kind of restraint in growth and \nbenefits. We can't do anything about age. Oh, no, we can't do anything \nwith personal savings account.\n  If you listen to what they are saying, it is we don't want to do \nanything but raise Social Security taxes again. We have done that too \nmany times.\n  My time is gone. I urge my colleagues: Vote against these points of \norder. This would be the exact wrong way to get started toward Social \nSecurity reform and getting a budget resolution. I will have more to \nsay about all this later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to leave this debate on a positive note. Senator \nConrad has been a pleasure to work with. We have some philosophical \ndifferences. Maybe we can bridge those gaps. Senator Lott was talking \nabout my political career. I hope it is secure, but I know Social \nSecurity is not. I am not worried about that now, because most people \nat home have appreciated the effort on my part, and others, to bring \nhonesty to the table.\n  Why did I pick the word permanent? Why did we pick the word \npermanent? Everything Senator Conrad said about budget forecasting is \nabsolutely true. I think we need to understand that when we say words \nsuch as ``permanent,'' what I am trying to do is give the American \npublic reassurance that we, as Republicans and Democrats, are going to \ndo the same thing with Social Security that happens when you buy life \ninsurance or you buy car insurance or you buy fire insurance; that is, \nwhen you need it, if something happens, it is going to be there. You \nwouldn't buy a policy from some company that could say: You are good \nfor 10 years; After that, I am not so sure.\n  What we are trying to do is make a pledge and a promise to the \nAmerican people that we will permanently take care of this program. We \nwill make the adjustments as we need to, whenever they come and however \nthey come. Our pledge is to make honest promises, keep those promises \nand I want to tell you why it is important.\n\n  Senator Boxer commented about her family situation. The good news is \nthat Social Security has affected so many lives in a positive way. When \nI was 21, my mother died--she was 52--of Hodgkin's disease. When I was \n22, a year later, my father died. He was 69. We all thought he would go \nfirst, but you never know in life. We owned small businesses, a liquor \nstore, restaurant, and pool hall. Everything I learned about politics I \nlearned there, and it served me well.\n  But when my parents died, the businesses folded. I had a 13-year-old \nsister. We moved in with an aunt and uncle who worked in the textile \nmills; they never made over $25,000. Survivor benefits mattered to my \nfamily. Without that money, it would have been tough for our family. So \nI know as well as anyone in this body that Social Security has a \npurpose. That is a good purpose. We ought to focus on making sure in \nthe future, families like mine, who are worse off, have what we can \nafford to give them and what we promise to give them we will give them \nin a permanent fashion.\n  As to how we get there, I am openminded. Senator Lott mentioned, if \nyou don't want to go into deficit and set up accounts, I will work with \nyou.\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nBut the accounts make sense to me, because younger workers, born after \n1980, get a 1.4 percent rate of return on their Social Security \ninvestments. I know we can beat that without becoming a day trader. I \nknow we can do a better job than that. But I am not going to prejudge \nanybody's plan. My promise to you is if you want to permanently solve \nthe Social Security problem, to make sure that people in the future can \ncount on the benefits when their family needs them, I will work with \nyou.\n  Senator Conrad has been great to work with. I hope we can build upon \nwhat we have done today and find a solution that will protect the \nsafety net.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 152, As Modified\n\n  I send a modification of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Give me a moment to get settled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 152), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 68 percent by 2078;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.3 percent by 2078;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be \n     $3,700,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2004 to 6.6 percent in 2078; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all \n     warned that failure to enact fiscally responsible Social \n     Security reform quickly will result in 1 or more of the \n     following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system;\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could you advise us on the time remaining \non the two sides of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 minutes. \nThe Senator from South Carolina has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Chair would advise me at the end of 2 minutes, I \nwould be appreciative.\n  Let me again say to Senator Graham, I appreciate this effort. I \nappreciate the amendment he has offered. I have already indicated I \nintend to support this amendment because I think it lays out in some \nreasonable way the challenge we face.\n  On this question of permanency, I agree with him. We certainly do not \nwant a Social Security solution that leaves people in doubt that they \nare actually going to get their Social Security benefits. At the same \ntime, when we use the word ``permanently,'' I don't want to have people \nleft with the understanding that this is based on a forecast \nforevermore. The reason I do not is because that might lead to improper \nconclusions about what we are doing.\n  These long-term forecasts I have seen over and over are a problem. \nLet me say why that is the case. The underlying forecast by the Social \nSecurity trust fund is that economic growth going forward is going to \nbe 1.8 percent a year. That is the underlying forecast. Every year for \nthe next 75 years, they are saying the economy is only going to grow at \n1.8 percent.\n  If we look back over the last 55 years, these green bars show how \nmuch the economy has actually grown, and in no time--at no time over \nthe last 55 years, in 5-year increments, have we had economic growth \nthat was as low as their forecast of how much the economy is going to \ngrow over the next 75 years. So I have grave doubts about the accuracy \nof this forecast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator from North Dakota's comments are well made. \n``Permanent'' to me is to do whatever we need to do at whatever point \nin time to secure the safety net, starting today. Senator Conrad is \nright; we should have started yesterday dealing with all these \nproblems. Social Security is only a small slice of it.\n  This budget sense of the Senate I hope will bring us together in \nhonestly defining the problem. I am not asking anybody to prejudice an \noutcome, as to how they would solve the problem. But now we have on \npaper what the problem is for America. Working together, I think we can \nsolve it. If we do not, we know what happens. In that regard I think \nthis is a good step forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me close by saying I support this \namendment. I think it is a good-faith effort by the Senator to describe \nthe problem in an accurate and honest way. For that reason, I intend to \nsupport it. I urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I would like to conclude by saying thank you to the Senator across \nthe aisle. I think he has done a great service to all of us who are \ntrying to address this problem. When we wrote an op-ed together, we \nsaid there is a problem here. There is a challenge. We need to work \ntogether to address it. We should not take on massive new debt to do \nit.

Mr. President, the amendment before us is very simple. It \nsays: Social Security first. Very simply, the amendment says: No new \nmandatory spending or tax cuts until Social Security is solvent, unless \nthe new spending or the new tax cuts are paid for or they can get a \nsupermajority in the Senate.\n  It is a matter of priorities. This says: Social Security first. No \nnew spending, no new tax cuts until Social Security is solvent, unless \nthose amendments are paid for or they get a supermajority vote here in \nthe Chamber.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 12 seconds to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very proud to be joining my \ncolleague on this amendment. For all of us who have talked about Social \nSecurity, this is the way to put it first in the budget process. This \nis the way to secure it for 75 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment has a lot of problems. But \nthree of the major ones are, first, it creates a precedent of mixing \nthe general fund with the Social Security fund, which is a big mistake. \nSecond, it treats entitlements entirely different than it treats tax \ncuts, which is a big mistake. And third, it is brought forward by a \nparty which says there is no Social Security problem and, therefore, we \nwill never have a tax cut because they will not admit there is a \nproblem. It is essentially a stalking-horse for doing nothing on the \nissue of relieving American taxpayers of the burden which they have \nunder the present tax system at any time in the future.\n  As we know, we need major tax reform. So it would be a huge mistake \nto put this point of order in place.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that vote took 20 minutes. This time does \nnot count against the underlying budget resolution. When we have a \nseries of stacked votes such as this, if people do not vote within the \n10-minute framework of the vote, we are talking about extending the \ntimeframe of the resolution by the time we run over the vote. So if we \nhave 20 or 30 votes and we are adding 10 minutes to every one of those \nvotes--which we will have before we finish, believe me--we are talking \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours of additional time we will be in session on this \nresolution, which means a lot of us, or all of us, are going to be here \nvery late on Friday night.\n  It is up to us whether we discipline ourselves, but hopefully folks \ncan stay within the 10-minute timeframe we have set up. That is why \nSenator Conrad and I decided to stack these votes, so we could move \nthis process along. We would like to continue to work in that \nframework.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 150\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided with a \nvote on the DeMint amendment No. 150. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that if we do nothing as a body to address the Social Security \nissue, it will result in massive debt, benefit cuts for future \nretirees, as well as large payroll tax increases. The big question \ntoday, and the difference in my amendment and another amendment, is \nwhether we need to address it now or push this off until 2042.\n  It is clear by any measure, if we look at what the Social Security \nactuaries are saying, that in 2018 we will begin to move billions of \ndollars from the general fund to support Social Security benefits.\n  The time to act for Social Security change and reform to save and \nstrengthen Social Security is now, and we can do that best by beginning \nto save the Social Security surplus and to save part of what people are \nputting into the Social Security system.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, which simply says \nif we do nothing, the American people will pay for generations. This \namendment is deciding whether we are proposing something for the next \nelection or the next generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time to myself.\n  I would support the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina if \nthe amendment did what the Senator just described. That is not what the \namendment does. It says, in pertinent part:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or \n     massive increase in debt . . .\n\n  I agree with that absolutely. Then it goes on to say:\n\n     . . . and a failure to act would result in massive debt, deep \n     benefit cuts and tax increases.\n\n  That part of it is just inaccurate and here is why. When we get to \n2052, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and Social Security \ncan only meet 78 percent of its obligations, the result is deep benefit \ncuts. There are no tax increases that are triggered by the law at that \npoint. What happens is deep benefit cuts.\n  I would just say and urge my colleagues, I think you have to oppose \nthis amendment because, frankly, it states something that is just not \naccurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before \na vote in relation to the amendment of the senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we had the announcement of the vote as 56 \nand 46; from the math I learned in North Dakota, that adds up to 102.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-three.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate \non the same subject and I don't see how anybody can disagree with it.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should reject \n     any Social Security plan that requires deep benefit cuts or a \n     massive increase in debt, and a failure to act by 2042 would \n     result in deep benefit cuts; therefore Congress should take \n     action . . .\n\n  This does not say wait until 2042. It says ``a failure to act by 2042 \nwould result in deep benefit cuts'' which is exactly what the Social \nSecurity Administration and CBO have told us; that if we do not act by \n2042 they are going to pay only 73 cents on the dollar. CBO says that \ndate is 10 years later, 2052. Out of an abundance of caution, I have \nstated the earlier date.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, although this amendment certainly on its \nface could be deemed to have some reasonable points, it appears to be \nmissing a fairly large chunk of the issue. It says there should not be \nany required deep benefit cuts. I think we would all like to accomplish \nthat. It says there shouldn't be any massive increase in debt. We \ncertainly all would want to require that. But it doesn't mention taxes. \nAs a practical matter, the implication is that taxes could be increased \nrather dramatically.\n  By silence on that issue, I think basically the other side is saying \nwith this amendment we are ready to raise taxes a lot, especially on \nyounger, working Americans, which would be a serious mistake.\n  Therefore, I suggest we vote against this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It increases spending and taxes. The total amount of dollars \nallocated in 2002 to 2005 to the Office of State and Local Government \nCoordination and Preparedness was $11.2 billion. The total amount spent \nis $6.1 billion. That means we have $5.2 billion still available. Only \n55 percent first responder grant dollars have been used. Still billions \nof dollars remain.

The Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this amendment is about keeping our \nfamilies safe and our communities safe. It would restore the $1.6 \nbillion in cuts to first responders, our police, firefighters, and \nemergency workers. These cuts are included in the President's budget \nand in this mark.\n  With this amendment, we would restore those funds, as well as add \n$1.6 billion to reduce the deficit. There is an offset we are proposing \nthat we close tax loopholes that were dropped from last year's FSC bill \nin order to pay for this.\n  In my State of Michigan, and I am sure in your States as well, every \npolice chief told me they have fewer officers on the streets today than \non 9/11/2001. This is wrong. They are counting on us to provide them \nthe resources in partnership with them to keep our citizens safe.

It will be cosponsored by my colleagues as follows: \nSenators Clinton, Specter, Corzine, Murray, Rockefeller, Carper, \nSchumer, Durbin, Lautenberg, Kerry, Dorgan, and Obama.\n  Adoption of my amendment will provide a measure of financial \nstability to our Nation's passenger railroad--Amtrak. My amendment will \nalso provide a measure of certainty regarding the continuation of rail \nservice in our country to Amtrak's 25 million annual passengers and its \nalmost 20,000 employees.\n  Let me be clear: this is not a Democratic amendment or a Republican \namendment. It is an American amendment. It is an amendment to help \nrural America and urban America alike.\n  The Omnibus Appropriations Act for the current fiscal year provided \nAmtrak with a subsidy of roughly $1.2 billion. That level of funding is \nanticipated to allow Amtrak to continue to operate for the remainder of \nthis fiscal year, though its cash reserves are expected to continue to \ndeteriorate during that time.\n  For fiscal year 2006, President Bush's budget seeks the complete \nelimination of direct subsidies to Amtrak. The request for Amtrak as we \nknow it is zero--not a penny. The only funding that the administration \nhas requested for inter-city passenger rail service is $360 million, \nwhich would be set aside solely for the purpose of ensuring the \ncontinuation of existing local commuter rail services that depend on \nthe use of Amtrak property, once Amtrak, as a company, has ceased to \noperate.\n  Recently, there has been a great deal of press attention regarding \nthe fact that the administration has proposed to push Amtrak into \nbankruptcy. Indeed, page 243 of the President's budget is quite \nexplicit regarding the administration's plan.\n\n  It states that, ``with no subsidies, Amtrak would quickly enter \nbankruptcy.''\n  Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta has recently held a spate of \npress conferences and stated that President Bush is a strong supporter \nof passenger rail service in our country. Well, all I can say is that \nthe President has found a very strange way to show his support. By \neliminating the annual Federal subsidy to Amtrak in its entirety, \nPresident Bush has threatened to leave 25 million passengers standing \nat the platform. He is threatening to push those 25 million passengers \nonto our already congested highways and runways and he is threatening \nto isolate dozens of communities across the nation who do not have air \nservice and are now being threatened with being eliminated from the \nnational railroad map.\n  The budget resolution before us assumes that overall domestic \ndiscretionary funding will be at the level requested by the President. \nAs such, it also presumes enactment of the President's budget proposals \nfor transportation, including the complete elimination of Amtrak's \nfunding.\n  This amendment would increase the funding for function 400, the \ntransportation function by $1.04 billion in fiscal year 2006. When \ncombined with the $360 million that the President has requested for the \ncontinuation of commuter services in the event of Amtrak's termination, \nmy amendment would bring total rail passenger funding up to $1.4 \nbillion in 2006. My amendment would increase the cap over discretionary \nspending by the commensurate $1.04 billion. The amendment would be \ncompletely offset by an increase in revenues through the closing of \ncorporate tax loopholes.\n  Some of my colleagues may be wondering how I arrived at the funding \nfigure of $1.4 billion for Amtrak for 2006. My answer is as follows: \nWhen President Bush submitted his budget request for fiscal year 2005, \nhas asked for only $900 million for 2005. But in that same budget, the \nPresident recognized that funding should grow to $1.4 billion in 2006 \nand beyond. So, my proposal to bring Amtrak to $1.4 billion in 2006 is \nprecisely the same number that President Bush had budgeted for Amtrak \nfor 2006 just 1 year ago.\n\n  This is an important point because certain Senators might be of the \nmisimpression that enacting President Bush's reform bill for Amtrak \nmight result in actual budgetary savings. In fact, the administration \nhas said that if Congress does enact its reform bill, it would be \ninclined to request far more funding for Amtrak than the railroad \ncurrently receives. In an interview with National Public Radio \nrecently, Secretary Mineta said that the administration would be \ninclined to request between $1.5 and $2 billion for Amtrak. That \nfunding range compares to the $1.2 billion we provided in fiscal year \n2005. The budget resolution that we are currently debating, of course, \nincludes none of that increase for a reformed Amtrak.\n  Senator Gregg, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nhas not parroted the Bush administration's budget for all spending \nitems. To his credit, Senator Gregg has set aside $50 billion for \nfiscal year 2006 for the cost of the on-going conflict in Iraq. It was \nthe Bush administration's agenda to ignore the costs of the Iraq war \nand instead request this funding through a supplemental appropriations \nact. Senator Gregg, to his credit, said that his budget would not \nengage in such an indefensible policy. We know that we are going to \nhave to pay for the ongoing conflict in Iraq in 2006 and Senator Gregg \nhas appropriately set the money aside for that purpose.\n  This situation should be no different with Amtrak. The Bush \nadministration's current budget proposes zero dollars for Amtrak's \ndirect subsidy needs in 2006, and zero dollars for every year \nthereafter. Secretary Mineta, when traveling around the country, has \nsaid that the Bush administration will consider requesting adequate \nfunding for Amtrak as part of a supplemental  appropriations bill.\n\n  So, the choice before the Senate could not be clearer. If Senators \nreally desire all Amtrak service to come to an immediate and grinding \nhalt for lack of a Federal subsidy in 2006, vote against my amendment. \nBut, if Senators want to pass a realistic budget that recognizes that, \nwith or without reform legislation, continuing Amtrak service will \nrequire continued Federal subsidies in 2006, Senators should vote for \nmy amendment.\n  The elimination of Amtrak's subsidy is not a recipe for a streamlined \nrailroad. It is not a recipe for a more efficient railroad. It is a \nrecipe for a dead railroad.\n  Across the Northeast corridor--the busiest urban transportation \ncorridor in the Nation--the elimination of Amtrak's premier service \nwould be a transportation disaster. Amtrak serves 13 million passengers \neach year over the Northeast corridor. The highways along this \ncorridor--principally Interstate 95--and the runways along this \ncorridor are already congested beyond words. Imagine for a moment the \ncongestion that will result when an additional 13 million Americans are \npushed onto those highways and runways. You are talking about both a \ntransportation and economic disaster.\n  Elimination of Amtrak service would have disastrous results in both \nrural and urban America. There are over 120 communities all across the \nNation that receive regularly scheduled Amtrak service but no air \nservice whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\nSeveral of these communities have seen their bus service eliminated as \na result of a national shrinking of the Greyhound network. Amtrak's \ntermination would result in dozens of these communities across the \nnation being isolated from the national transportation network.\n  Senators should not be fooled by the provision in the President's \nbudget that calls for $360 million for commuter rail services in the \nNortheast corridor. These funds cannot be used as a matter of law to \nmaintain Amtrak services on the Northeast corridor. They can only be \nused to maintain local commuter rail services like New Jersey Transit \nor the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority that operate \nover the Northeast corridor. And those funds can only be used as a \nmatter of law to maintain those services and they can only be used in \nthe event that Amtrak ceases operation. Not one penny of the $360 \nmillion requested for this purpose can be used to maintain Amtrak \nservice for the 13 million passengers that depend on that service.\n\n  President Bush has proposed a series of so-called ``reforms'' for \nAmtrak that principally take the form of passing Amtrak's costs onto \nthe States. These proposals come on top of other proposals in the \nPresident's budget, such as so-called reforms in the Medicaid Program \nthat are designed to push additional costs of that program onto the \nStates. As Senators are aware, the Nation's Governors traveled to \nWashington, DC, earlier this month. Many of those Governors visited \ntheir congressional delegations. I doubt that even one of them spoke \nfavorably about the President's plans to push Amtrak's costs onto the \nStates. But whether you agree with President Bush's Amtrak reform \nproposals or not, I would suggest that all Senators should support this \namendment. There may be several disagreements over the merits of these \nso-called reform proposals. But one thing that is beyond question is \nthat you cannot reform a dead railroad. And that is what the budget \nbefore us calls for--a dead, dead, dead railroad.\n  We should provide some stability and some peace of mind to the 25 \nmillion passengers who use Amtrak every year. We should provide some \nstability and peace of mind to the 20,000 Amtrak employees spread \nacross the Nation, so that they will know that they will have \nemployment at the end of the current year. We should provide some \nstability to Amtrak's finances so that the House and the Senate and the \nadministration can have a meaningful debate over whether Amtrak should \nbe reformed without the distraction of the near-term risk of the \nrailroad lapsing into bankruptcy.\n  I encourage all Members to vote for my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as original cosponsors to those names that I have already read: \nSenators Kohl, Kennedy, Jeffords, and Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 158\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk the amendment to which I \nhave already referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, and \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Specter, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Carper, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, \n     Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered \n     158.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reject the President's proposal to eliminate Amtrak and to \n    provide adequate funding of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2006 to \npreserve a national intercity passenger rail system and to offset these \n               costs by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 15, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 16, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 6, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 7, increase the amount by $1,040,000,000.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the following speakers have indicated an \ninterest in making statements concerning their support for the \namendment: Senators Clinton, Corzine, Carper, Schumer, and Dorgan.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from New \nYork may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, thank you, once again, to my friend from \nWest Virginia for offering this important amendment.\n  It is somewhat hard to believe we have to offer this amendment. There \nshould not be a debate about the importance of Amtrak and national \npassenger rail service, but there is, so once again we are making the \ncase and asking the support of our colleagues in this body on behalf of \nAmtrak.\n  As Senator Byrd pointed out, the President's budget and this budget \nresolution does not provide a penny for the continued operation of \nAmtrak. It provides just enough money to shut the trains down, but \nthere is very little thought given as to the consequences of shutting \nthe trains down, of ending the services that Amtrak offers, and the \nimpact on the regional rail services that, in addition to Amtrak, \nprovide so much support for our national transportation system.\n  I know there are members of the administration and even of the \nCongress arguing that Amtrak should not receive another penny because \nit is not self-sufficient. I have to respectfully ask, are the airlines \nself-sufficient? We keep bailing them out. Are the highway systems \nself-sufficient? We continue the development and maintenance of \nhighways, transit systems, buses. No form of transportation is self-\nsufficient.\n  We have a fundamental decision to make which apparently the \nadministration is making by this budget request that we give up on \nnational rail for passenger travel. That is a very shortsighted \nposition and a critical mistake.\n  I ask my colleagues to think back to the days after September 11. Our \nairports were shut down. The bridges going in and out of Manhattan were \nshut down. The only way in and out of Manhattan was Amtrak. That was \nit. If we could not have moved through the Amtrak system in and out of \nManhattan, we would not have had any contact, any continuing \ncommunication, any movement of people.\n  I am amazed we have such a short memory. I am also amazed we do not \nrecognize the benefits that Amtrak offers in providing this service to \nso many commuters and passengers. In fiscal year 2004 Amtrak broke the \n25 million passenger record. That was an extraordinary accomplishment. \nI give David Gunn and the leadership team he brought in, which is \nturning Amtrak around, tremendous credit. The record of 25 million was \na million greater than 2003, which itself was a record.\n  So we are making progress in running a railroad that meets people's \nneeds. The new Acela trains are a great gift, moving us back and forth \nbetween Washington and New York in a little over 3 hours. I obviously \nhave a very personal interest in this because New Yorkers rely on rail \nmore than perhaps any other citizens in our country. Penn Station on \n34th street in Manhattan is the busiest passenger rail station in our \ncountry, servicing almost 9 million passengers who boarded Amtrak \ntrains there in 2004. Our Albany Rensselaer Station is the 10th busiest \nin the country. Much of our upstate economy depends upon Amtrak. We \nalso have the busiest commuter rail system in the country. I have to \npoint out we are putting our commuter rail system on the path to \nobliteration as well as Amtrak because our commuter rails operate on \nAmtrak rail lines. They use Amtrak tracks. Much of the system would not \nbe able to operate if they did not share expenses, share maintenance, \nwith Amtrak. So we are not just writing the\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\ndeath warrant for Amtrak but also writing the death warrant for \ncommuter rail.\n\n  Why are we doing this? Some are ideologically opposed to passenger \nrail. We might as well be ideologically opposed to air travel, if we \nsay if you cannot make a profit you go out of business. In many \ninstances it is the combination of Government funding and passenger use \nthat works around the world. Why do we think we can be different?\n  The effect of this policy the administration has embedded in its \nbudget will be so far reaching that I don't think people have stopped \nand considered the impact on the economy, the impact on our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I was talking to one of the people who is quite an expert in \nrailroads who said if you take Amtrak off the tracks, Amtrak is no \nlonger responsible, the burden of keeping the tracks will fall \ncompletely on the freight companies. The freight companies have not \ndone that good a job of keeping up their tracks and we will have all \nthese bottlenecks that have a ripple effect through the economy, the \nlikes of which we did not contemplate.\n  This has long-term effects on our economy, on our homeland security. \nTo remove this necessary form of transportation at a time when we face \nall of these dangers and risks is extremely shortsighted.\n  What is going to happen with our airports and our highways? Amtrak \nright now accounts for 50 percent of the Washington, DC-New York air \nand rail market and 35 percent of the Boston-New York travel market. \nAre we going to put all of these passengers into our airports which, as \nanyone who has traveled lately knows, are pretty chaotic to start with? \nAre we going to add them to the highways and to the congestion? What \nare we thinking about? I wish we would take a deep breath.\n  The administration says it would like to reform Amtrak. I am very \nimpressed with the steps David Gunn has taken. If the idea of reform is \ntransferring the costs for funding Amtrak on to the States, that is a \nnonstarter. We will be burdening the States with expenses they cannot \nmeet now. We will be thinking of cutting Medicaid, cutting housing. We \nwill cut community development block grants and then say, by the way, \npick up the costs of keeping your economy and business travel going by \npaying for Amtrak. I don't know any State that can accommodate that \nkind of hit.\n  I hope we will take the moment to support Senator Byrd's amendment. \nIt is the right approach to take. I am the first to say if we can do \nsome smart reforms in the context of keeping the railroad operating, \nlet's do it. But what are the smart reforms? David Gunn has said if he \ncan have some money for capital investments, we would cut the amount of \ntime for commuting between Washington, DC, New York, and Boston. We \ncould have high-speed rail along the east coast. We would make some of \nthe routes that are not now a very effective means for transporting \npassengers much more so because we would make the investments that are \nnecessary in the underlying infrastructure.\n  I join very happily with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I hope on both sides of the aisle all Members will \nthink hard about this amendment. I cannot stress strongly enough the \nimpact on the Northeast of killing Amtrak.\n  For people who say, well, I live a long way from there, what \ndifference does it make, the financial engine that the Northeast still \nis, that provides the funds for so much of what we offer to other \nStates far from New York, far from West Virginia, far from Boston, far \nfrom the east coast, will be at risk. This is a necessary part of our \nfinancial engine in the Northeast, particularly in New York.\n  I respectfully request every single Member to vote in your own self-\ninterests. Vote for passenger rail. Vote for the economic benefits that \nit necessarily provides. But vote for the Byrd amendment and make us \nonce again supportive of passenger rail as part of our overall \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague and the Presiding \nOfficer for this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork for her very lucid, cogent, and persuasive statement. And I thank \nher for her support of this amendment. I thank her very much.\n  Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett, is prepared to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from New York \nwith great interest, and the Senator from West Virginia. If I thought \nfor one moment that the administration's budget would, in fact, kill \nAmtrak or eliminate passenger rail service in the Northeast corridor or \nother corridors around the country, where it is prospering, I would be \nthe first to stand up and oppose the administration's position.\n  I agree absolutely that rail passenger service in highly congested \nareas such as the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston is not \nonly important, it is essential. And I agree absolutely with the \nstatement that says we could not absorb on our highways and our \nairplanes the number of passengers that would be forced there if Amtrak \nwere to disappear.\n  The Senator from New York spoke about what happened after 9/11, and \nshe said Amtrak was the only way out of Manhattan. As the bridges were \nclosed, you could not drive out. The airports were closed. You could \nnot fly out. You could not walk out. The only way New York City was \nconnected--Manhattan Island, at least--with the rest of the country was \nby train. And it would be an absolute tragedy, it would be absolutely \ninsane to shut that down. But as I understand the administration's \nposition, they have no plans to shut that down. Indeed, they are \nwilling to subsidize, as they have subsidized in the past because of \nall of the reasons that have been cited on the Senate floor, that kind \nof rail passenger traffic.\n  But let me take you to another part of the Amtrak system that does \nnot enjoy the same kind of patronage as the Acela train that goes high \nspeed from Washington to New York City, and which I have taken with \ngreat satisfaction. Let me take you to my home State of Utah. We have \nAmtrak service in Utah.\n  On one occasion, a family friend notified my wife and me that she was \ncoming to Salt Lake City on Amtrak and would we meet her train. And we \nsaid: ``Why, of course. We will be happy to meet her train.'' We were a \nlittle less happy when we discovered that the train was arriving at \n2:30 in the morning, and that this was its only stop, this was the only \ntime. There was not an alternative time because the timing of the \ntrains coming through, 2:30 in the morning was the only time this train \ncame through Utah.\n  We went down to the depot or the terminal, and I was a little bit \nstruck by how shabby it had become through misuse over the years. But \nwe were there. She came. We met her. I counted the number of people who \ngot off the train with her, and it was fewer than you could count on \nthe fingers of your two hands.\n  There are fewer than 100 people a week that come into that station in \nSalt Lake. After 9/11, there would have been no disruption whatsoever \nof people traveling in and out of Salt Lake if Amtrak were not there. \nThat terminal we went to that night was somewhat old and dilapidated \nand a bit shabby, but is now refurbished, lovely, big, and disconnected \nfrom Amtrak.\n  The current Amtrak terminal is a Quonset hut because the real estate \non which the old terminal sat was too valuable and it is part of a \nshopping center and real estate development activity. And when that \ntrain comes in to disgorge its two or three passengers per night--and \nit is not every night; the schedule only comes through three times a \nweek--the passengers who get off get off in a Quonset hut. There is no \ntaxi service there. It is in a part of town that is not easy to walk to \nand from. It has fallen into disuse not because the administration has \nnot been subsidizing it enough, not because Amtrak has not had a big \nenough capital budget, but because rail passenger service across very \nlarge numbers of miles between cities that do not naturally connect to \neach other simply does not make sense.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  Amtrak in the Northeast corridor makes all the sense in the world, \nand we must do everything we can to make sure we preserve it. In the \nCascades there is Amtrak service that makes sense. In California there \nis Amtrak service that makes sense. There are a number of places where \nAmtrak makes sense, and we must preserve it in those places. The \nadministration, in this budget, as I understand it, has provided for \n$360 million that would go to the Surface Transportation Board that \nwould be available to reimburse Amtrak in those areas where it needs it \nto keep the kind of service that has been described here on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n  Now, I have given this speech before in committee--this is the first \ntime I have done it on the floor--and every time I do, I get a flurry \nof letters. They are all from the same people. And they all object. \nTheir objections all come down to nostalgia for the rail service that \nwe all knew when we were young--or at least that I knew when I was \nyoung. I am sure there are many Members of the Senate here who have no \nmemory of it at all.\n  I have great memories of rail travel: full trains, dining rooms with \ncrisp, white linen on them, and silver tea sets and china and long \ntrips across the country. If you were taking a train trip across the \ncountry from Salt Lake to New York, you better allocate several days \nfor that. You better take along a pretty good library of books to read. \nBut you'll love the scenery. Then, you were willing to take the time. \nYou were willing to relax. It was a wonderful way to travel.\n  Americans don't like to travel that way anymore. It makes no sense to \nkid ourselves that a national railway system similar to the Europeans' \nmakes sense in the United States. Look at the difference in distances. \nThe Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston would cover three or \nfour national frontiers in Europe. You would visit three or four \ncountries traveling that far in Europe. And it makes tremendous sense \nwith the high density of population over there for them to have a \nnational railway system. But when you are dealing with a nation the \nsize of Belgium, you are dealing with something rather different from a \nnation the size of the United States.\n  Now, I have a particular personal history with this. I was working in \nthe Department of Transportation in the Nixon administration as the \nhead of congressional relations. The distinguished Presiding Officer \nwas the voice on the other end of the phone when I called the White \nHouse, as he was working for Bryce Harlow in charge of congressional \nrelations. I was not always able to get hold of Bryce Harlow, but I \ncould always get hold of Lamar Alexander. The decision to shut down \npassenger travel as we had known it for close to 100 years in the \nUnited States was made in the Nixon administration, and it was my \nresponsibility to sell the Congress on the concept of Amtrak. Because \nrailroads were required by law to maintain passenger traffic on their \nwhole system, and the railroads were hemorrhaging red ink over this \nissue, our Department came up with the idea of creating a single \nNational Railroad Passenger Corporation. That is the formal name of \nAmtrak. Amtrak was the name that was created by the image makers after \nthe Congress acted.\n  It was my responsibility, along with my team, to come to the Congress \nand convince them that it made sense to shrink rail passenger service \nto this skeletal fashion. The outcry was enormous: You can't do that. \nLook at the towns that will no longer be served if you shrink it down \nto this skeletal system.\n  I remember one Governor traveled all the way to Washington to protest \nto us. And then we pointed out to that particular Governor that the \nnumber of people who got on the trains in his State could be picked up \nwith chauffeur-driven limousines and driven to the nearest town where \nthey wanted to go in the name of rail service, and it would cost a \nfraction of the amount that was being spent on rail service. When the \nGovernor looked at the reality of what was really happening and got \naway from the nostalgia of passenger rail service, he himself, having \nnot taken a train in many years, looked at us and said: You know, this \nreally doesn't make any sense.\n\n  One by one, the Governors withdrew their objection to the creation of \nwhat is now Amtrak. We need to have the same kind of understanding here \nthat brought us to the creation of Amtrak in the first place. There are \nparts of the country where Amtrak is essential and must be maintained. \nI will be the first Senator to stand here and defend it, and I will be \na Senator from Utah who votes for appropriations for Amtrak for New \nJersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington State, California, \nand other places where it makes some sense. I agree that the Federal \nGovernment should subsidize that if it cannot make it on its own \nbecause it makes a contribution that is essential. But I cannot, under \nany condition, defend the expenditures of maintaining a national \nnetwork in the name of saying we are connected all over the country \nwith a set of rails and saying isn't that wonderful that you can get on \nthe train and go all the way across the country when it is very clear \nthat nobody wants to in any kind of quantity that makes any kind of \nsense.\n  I will be happy to contribute that portion of Amtrak's budget that \ngoes to maintain rail service in Utah to the State of New Jersey, where \nthey need it, and, if necessary, in Utah, we can come up with one bus \nper week, which has enough capacity to handle all of the Amtrak \npassengers who come through our State.\n  So for that reason, I am opposed to this amendment, because, in my \nview, it is attempting to maintain something that has passed from our \nhistory, actually to the detriment of that which is needed in our \nfuture. Let's get over the nostalgia of the old national railway \nsystem, and let's focus on the need to have an intelligent passenger \nrailway system in the corridors where it contributes enormously to \ncutting down on congestion, pollution, and delay.\n  For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I urge our fellow \nSenators to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota wish?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am advantaged from having heard twice \ntoday the proposition by the Senator from Utah--once in committee and \nnow on the floor of the Senate. I always enjoy his presentations. I \nconfess--and perhaps others will, too--to some nostalgia. We used to \nname trains. In my hometown, the train that came through was called the \nGalloping Goose. I used to watch that train come in to pick up the \ncream cans. I loved the Galloping Goose. I admit to some nostalgia, but \nthis debate is not about nostalgia.\n  There is a story about a guy who, in 1896, went to Waco, TX, where a \nrailroad company was going to destroy a couple of locomotives they were \ndone using. They decided to put on an extravaganza. They were going to \nrun the locomotives together, and 40,000 people showed up to watch. \nThey ran them together in a demonstrated train wreck, and metal flew, \nas did sparks and steam and fire.\n  There was a boy named Joe Connolly--this is a great story about Joe. \nHe discovered that people would come to watch a train wreck. Joe \nConnolly thought, I am going to sponsor train wrecks. He was a guy from \nIowa. He sponsored 71 train wrecks in his career. His last train wreck \nwas in 1932 at the Iowa State Fair. He built 3,000 feet of track, got \ntwo old locomotives that were about to be abandoned, and ran them \ntogether at 50 miles an hour. He had people pay from miles around to \nsee the train wreck. They called him ``head-on Joe Connolly'' because \nhe sponsored 71 train wrecks. What a great story.\n  You don't have to go to an Iowa State Fair to see a train wreck these \ndays. You can see it right here in the middle of this budget document. \nThat is why Senator Byrd is on the floor with his amendment. He says \nthat Amtrak is worthy, that rail passenger service in this country \nought to be a national enterprise. I fully agree. We will always have \nrail passenger service connecting Boston to Florida because there are \nmillions of people living on that eastern corridor. So that will be\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nself-sufficient--rail passenger service on the eastern corridor of the \nUnited States. The question is: Will we be able to maintain a national \nrail passenger system? Is it worthy to do so? I believe the answer is \nyes. Senator Byrd believes the answer is yes.\n  We have a train that comes through my part of the country. It goes \nfrom Chicago, up to Minneapolis, over to Fargo, up north all the way to \nSeattle, down to Portland. It is called the Empire Builder. It has been \naround for decades. When it comes through the State of North Dakota, it \npicks up nearly 90,000 people in a year. For them, traveling on the \nEmpire Builder is not nostalgia, it is necessary. It is one part of a \ntransportation system in a rural State that doesn't have very many \ntransportation systems.\n  We don't have the kind of aviation service, commercial air service, \nthey have in Chicago, for example. We don't have the bus service they \nhave in New York. But the fact is, we have Amtrak coming through our \npart of the country as part of a national rail passenger service. I \ndon't object at all to subsidizing it. Every other country in the world \nthat has rail passenger service subsidizes the service. In fact, we \nsubsidize every other kind of transportation service in this country, \nso why all of a sudden do we decide that somehow rail passenger service \nis unworthy of our support?\n  My colleague from Utah used the term ``mass transit'' this morning \nwhen describing Amtrak. Amtrak is not mass transit. I support mass \ntransit, and we don't have any in North Dakota. We don't have a subway \nin Bismarck or in Fargo, or light rail. I support mass transit because \nI believe we ought to do that for the major cities of our country. This \nis not mass transit. Amtrak is rail passenger service that has been, in \nmy judgment, spectacularly successful. Despite that, we have always had \npeople who want to disband it, take it apart, get rid of it. Why? \nBecause they know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. This \nservice has great value for our country. The relatively small subsidy \nthat is required to retain a national rail passenger system is dwarfed \nby the subsidies in many other areas of transportation.\n  I understand why some would apply a profitability test to everything. \nI said to my colleague from Utah this morning that my guess is when \nthey built the four-lane interstate highway system, somebody might have \nsaid there is a segment that we question: from Dickinson, ND, to Beach, \nND, through the western badlands of North Dakota. There are not many \npeople living there, and there is probably not so much traffic on that \nfour-lane interstate highway. Or perhaps from Beach, ND, to Miles City, \nMT, or Billings--there is not enough traffic out there, not enough \npeople living there to justify putting in four lanes. You know \nsomething? The country understood this was all about bridges--a bridge \nfrom here to there. So, too, is Amtrak and the Empire Builder a bridge \nfrom here to there. We understand that it stops in my State because it \ngoes from Chicago to Seattle. It picks up nearly 90,000 people, \nincluding retired people, in the State of North Dakota.\n  Look, I think this is a bargain by any stretch. I support the Byrd \namendment because I believe it is the right thing for this country to \ndo.\n  It is all about choices. It is always, with respect to this budget \nwhen it comes to the floor of the Senate, about choices. I am \nabsolutely surprised at some of the choices that are made and then very \nsurprised at some of the issues other people think are unworthy for \nthis country's enterprise.\n  Rail passenger service is a service that I think is important to our \ncountry. If one decides that this is all about profit and loss and not \nabout a national transportation system that includes rail passenger \nservice than I understand. We will have locomotives, we will have \nelectric trains, we will have Acela trains running from Boston to \nFlorida, and God bless them. We will wave at them as they go by, and \ngood for all of them.\n  This country can, will, and should do much better and did do much \nbetter a couple of decades ago by creating a system that works. I have \nridden Amtrak many times, and I like riding Amtrak. I hope that when \nthe dust settles around here, we will have decided, once again, as a \nCongress that having a national rail passenger system is worthy.\n  I know the President believes differently. I had the president and \nCEO of Amtrak come into my office. I wanted to talk with him about what \nwas happening and what was necessary. He made it plain--and I \nunderstood it before he came in--that if the President's recommendation \nis adopted, there will simply be no national rail passenger system. \nAmtrak, as we know it, will not exist.\n  That is a choice that perhaps the majority of Congress might want to \nmake. I hope they will not choose to make that choice, but that is what \nthe Byrd amendment is about. That is why it is on the floor of the \nSenate, and that is why it is important.\n  I came over to speak on this amendment because I believe an important \npart of this country is its transportation system, the ability of \npeople to move around and to get around, to have access. And one part \nof that having a national rail passenger system that works. Yes, it \nrequires a subsidy, and I believe that is appropriate. I am perfectly \nwilling to do as every other industrialized country has done, and that \nis subsidize rail passenger service. It is not a large subsidy relative \nto everything else we do in the Chamber of the Senate.\n  My hope is, as I said, when the dust settles, we will decide to \nreject the recommendations of the President and this Budget Committee \nand continue to fund the national rail passenger system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota for his very timely, succinct, and persuasive statement. I thank \nhim very much for his support of this amendment.\n  I believe Mr. Corzine wishes to have some time yielded. How much time \ndoes the Senator desire?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I think it should be about 7 or 8 minutes \nat most.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the very able Senator \nand look forward to hearing his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from West \nVirginia for his strong leadership in doing something that makes a \nstatement about an issue that holds our Nation together. I can promise \nthat it holds New Jersey together. I respect the Senator from Utah \nrecognizing this is a vital economic, environmental, national defense--\nalmost any kind of variable one wants to describe--element in New \nJersey's overall transportation system, but I think the point that \nneeds to be made is that this is really true nationally. Senator Byrd's \n$1.4 billion in funding for Amtrak puts it in a position to continue to \nbe that asset. I wish to speak about that a little bit.\n  All of us know that the transportation section of the budget that is \nbefore us mirrors President Bush's proposal, a plan that, on its \nsurface, intends to shut down Amtrak. By the way, it does not do that \nwith a lot of finesse. It does that across the board, whether it is in \nplaces where people might argue it is absolutely essential in the \nNortheast corridor, as well as in those places where maybe it is \nnostalgia that is driving it. I would argue that it is in those areas \nwhere we are trying to unite us as a nation.\n  Without the funding provided in the Byrd amendment, Amtrak will enter \ninto bankruptcy, and it will be through the bankruptcy actions that \nreform is taken as opposed to where it should be, which is in the \ncommittees on the Hill, in the Congress.\n  Federal funding for Amtrak provides roughly one-third of what is \nneeded to operate that national transportation system each year. Not \nall of it--one-third. It includes addressing pressing capital needs. \nThe rest comes from ticket revenues and other sources, such as real \nestate. Without Federal funding, Amtrak will not be able to operate, \nand we will be into bankruptcy/reform under that format. I do not think \nthat is the way to go. I do not think, if the American people saw it in \nsuch a stark choice mode, they would support it. I hope the Senate will \nsupport the Byrd amendment because it will make a huge difference.\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\n  No other element of our transportation system stands without \nsubsidization. None. Zero. We are now debating, what is it, a $284 \nbillion--a lot of us like to say it is a lot higher--subsidization of \nother elements of our transportation system. I am all for that. \nHighways, mass transit. But this is an important linkage for our \neconomy, it is an important ingredient in protecting our environment, \nand it is essential to pulling together the economic strength of this \ncountry. And in times of great need, such as we saw on 9/11, it is also \none of those backstops, one of those redundancies we are now building \nin all other kinds of places in our economy. We need to take that and \ndrive it.\n  I will say there is much overlap in the Amtrak system with a whole \nhost of other commuter agencies and activities, other mass transit \nsystems. I give you an example. In New Jersey, there are about 4 \nmillion people who board Amtrak trains every year. Actually, we are \nwrong on that number. It is slightly higher. But there are over 100,000 \nriders of New Jersey Transit every day who use the same rail. Every day \nwhen people go to work in our financial services industry in New York \nor whether they go to the various elements of a very diversified \neconomy in Philadelphia, they get on New Jersey Transit trains that \nactually use the same railway.\n\n  If Amtrak were to go bankrupt, we are going to be sitting with not \nmass transit but mess transit. We are going to have a huge, incredible \noutpouring jamming up two of our major cities in this country and all \nof that great corridor, the State of New Jersey.\n  It is just incomprehensible that we do not understand how we have to \ntake a holistic view of how our transportation system works, and \nputting it at risk is just not a credible way to go about reform. That \nis why I am so pleased Senator Byrd has taken on this leadership role \nwith regard to protecting the funding that will protect the 25 million \npassengers who ride Amtrak every year and gosh knows how many people \nwho ride these other transportation systems that feed into it or \nparallel it or are on top of the Amtrak system. We really ought to \nthink about an organized view about how we reform Amtrak as opposed to \nthe blunderbuss approach of putting it into bankruptcy and using that \nas a basis of reform.\n  There is also another problem with this approach, in my view. The \nPresiding Officer might recognize this from his days of trying to lead \na State. Transferring problems from Washington to our States where we \nalready have huge budget problems does not seem to be an appropriate \nformat for how we are going to resolve issues. New Jersey Transit, \nwhich I already talked about how important the Amtrak system is for its \nfunctioning, is going to get funding one way or the other. Otherwise, \nwe are going to have a highway system that is completely clogged. The \nquality of life of commuters will deteriorate enormously.\n  So what is going to happen if this funding for Amtrak does not come \nthrough? Jersey transit fares are going to go up, and the State budgets \nthat are already deeply in debt are going to have additional burdens \nimposed upon them. This is just one more shifting of responsibilities \nfrom the Federal Government here in Washington, decisions that we take, \nand pushing them off to State and local governments--in this case, the \nState government.\n\n  We need to get realistic about the importance of this transportation \nsystem, the importance of making sure that we fund it properly so we \ncan continue to expand the number of riders that are at this point 25 \nmillion--that is up a million, year over year, and a similar amount the \nyear before--and make sure that intercity rail service has the strength \nand the vitality that will allow it to help grow our economy and keep \nit thriving and healthy as we go forward. The Byrd amendment would \nprovide the funding necessary to keep Amtrak out of bankruptcy, keep \nour economy flowing, keep our Nation tied together.\n  By the way, I grew up in one of those small towns in the Midwest \nwhere one of those Wabash Cannonballs came and people got on those \ntrains and rode to St. Louis and Indianapolis and another train that \nwent north-south to Chicago. It was an important element in keeping our \nNation tied together. Those of us who live in New Jersey need to \nunderstand that there is an important networking that needs to occur in \nthis Nation.\n  I think this Byrd amendment makes that statement about us being one \nNation. It is important for the economics of many of our communities \nwhere there are densely populated areas. It is fundamental to that \ntransportation system, the economic system, the environmental system. \nLet me say I think it is important for national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment and let's move \nforward with real reform. Let's not do it through bankruptcy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1\\1/\n2\\ hours for debate on the Amtrack amendment this evening, with the \nunderstanding that the debate began at 5:10, with 60 minutes under the \ncontrol of the minority and 30 minutes allocated to the majority; \nprovided further that following that debate the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the ANWR amendment to be offered by Senator Reid, or \nhis designee, and that there be 2 hours for debate this evening equally \ndivided in the usual form. I ask unanimous consent that following that \ndebate there be 1 hour of debate in relation to an amendment relating \nto veterans to be offered by the minority.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the budget on Wednesday that Senator Feinstein be \nrecognized to speak 20 minutes; provided further that following that \ndebate, the Senate proceed to an additional 90 minutes of debate \nequally divided in the usual form in relationship to the ANWR \namendment; provided further that the Senate will then have 45 minutes \nequally divided for debate relative to a further amendment on veterans \nto be offered by Senator Gregg or his designee, and the previously \noffered amendment on veterans.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following that debate the Senate \nproceed to an amendment offered by Senator Specter relative to NIH, and \nthere be 45 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following that debate the Senate \nproceed to vote in relationship to the pending Amtrak amendment, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the ANWR amendment, with no \namendments in order to either of those amendments prior to the votes.\n  I further ask that at the end of the time running this evening \nrelative to the veterans amendment, that Senator Harkin be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, we also are trying to slot additional votes, if we can make \nthat clear to our colleagues, and the votes would start at about 1 \no'clock tomorrow afternoon. We are hoping to have five votes lined up \nat that time. I think it is important to say that for planning purposes \nof our colleagues. That is the intention of the managers of this bill. \nWe would slot these times, as has been indicated in the agreement. That \nintention would be, in addition to the two votes on Amtrak and ANWR, \nthere would be two votes on veterans and a vote on NIH starting at 1 \no'clock tomorrow.\n  That is the intention. It is not fully spelled out in this agreement \nbecause we do not have language on those amendments at this time. But \nfor the information of our colleagues, that is the intention of the \nmanagers.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. That is our \nintention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the two managers would be willing to \nput the 1 o'clock beginning of the votes into a unanimous consent \nrequest so that we can depend on that hour.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I amend the request to reflect the fact \nthat the votes cited in the request would begin at 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of Senators \nLevin, Biden, and Chafee be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nstatement. I yield such time as he may wish to have--I understand he \nwants about 10 minutes--to the very distinguished Senator, Mr. \nLautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, who has long been an advocate and supporter \nfor Amtrak. It is so fitting that he rises at this point in time to say \nlet's face up to this. We need more money. To do anything that would \neliminate funding and practically assure bankruptcy, which we have just \ndealt with in a long debate, for this important national facility--I \nlook at what is being proposed, and it is a surprise, in view of our \nneed for better security, for a balance in the modes of transportation, \nwhich we desperately need.\n  In the last couple of weeks I have met with railroad people, freight \nrailroad people. I met with aviation people. We had the heads of these \ncompanies, the CEOs in, talking to us about what their needs were and \nhow they needed more money to finance their expansion to keep up with \ntheir demand.\n  When it comes to Amtrak, there is not really the support that there \nought to be. This is a national facility, call it what you will. We \ntalk about the Northeast corridor, but that is not the whole ball game \nbecause the Northeast corridor depends on its operation being part of \nthe whole infrastructure of a rail system.\n  I refer to a piece I authored not too long ago. I start saying:\n\n       Imagine hundreds of thousands more cars on our crowded \n     highways, more hours stuck in traffic jams, more travelers in \n     our busy airports, more oil imported from the Middle East.\n\n  One cannot be in one location in this country or another without \nunderstanding that traffic jams are more the norm, and we have to do \nwhatever we can to relieve that congestion, to relieve ourselves from \nthe pollution that emits from all that traffic, cars sitting one behind \nthe other.\n  If that is what we want to see, then here we are, looking at the \nclosing of Amtrak. It is a pretty grim future for millions of \nAmericans, under the proposal made by President Bush. This \nirresponsible plan would stop our Nation's passenger rail system dead \nin its tracks. The Bush administration wants to eliminate all Federal \nfunding for Amtrak, bankrupt our Nation's national passenger rail \nsystem, and shift more of the cost of new service toward cash-strapped \nStates.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from New Jersey, just talked about \nthat and the impact it would have. The administration wants to \neliminate all Federal funding. It would be a disaster. The shortsighted \nproposal would strand 850,000 commuters who depend on Amtrak and its \nservices to get to work each and every day. It would worsen congestion, \nas I said, on our roads and in our skies.\n  Anybody who stays abreast of what is happening in our transportation \nsystem knows that we have closed the gap, the distances between \nairplanes, because there are too many out there under the old system. I \nam not suggesting it is not safe or anything of that nature, but the \nfact is we are putting it into overload. It is hard to get more \nairplanes up there. The sky, surprising to some, is a finite facility \nand we cannot keep putting more airplanes up there.\n\n  The impact in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area would be \ndevastating, where so much of our financial well-being develops, the \nmarketplace and whatever. The heaviest population in the country is in \nmy home State of New Jersey, and it spreads through the other States \nnearby, whether it is New York or Connecticut or Pennsylvania. Amtrak \ncarries 4 million passengers a year in the New York metropolitan area, \nand it is the lifeline of our transportation system.\n  Instead of killing Amtrak, we should help provide the kind of top \nquality passenger rail system our country needs and deserves. We have \nnever been willing to do that. We have never put the funds in it \nneeded, from the point in time in the early 1970s when Amtrak became a \nquasi-government organization. We have never put the funding in there \nto bring this up to the kind of system that should be operating.\n  Go to Brussels, Belgium, where the NATO headquarters exists. Try to \nget to Paris, about 200 miles away. You cannot get an airplane to take \nthat trip. You get into a train in the middle of town and a hour and 20 \nminutes later you are in Paris, 200 miles away. If we had that kind of \nservice in some of these heavily crowded corridors, not just the \nNortheast corridor but from Chicago to St. Louis, for example, from Las \nVegas, NV, to Los Angeles, some of these other places--if we could get \nhigh-speed rail there we could substantially reduce the number of \nairplanes that fill our skies. We could save money, save pollution, \nsave congestion, and do ourselves a good service.\n  Since the Federal Government created Amtrak 34 years ago to relieve \nthe private railroads of passenger service, we have invested less than \n$1 billion a year in infrastructure and operations, not nearly enough \nfor a world-class system. Germany, with its modern high-speed rail \nsystem, and where the President recently visited, invested $9 billion \nin passenger rail service in 2003 alone. Even Estonia spends more than \ntwice per capita than United States on passenger rail.\n  Americans need a world-class rail system and Amtrak has been working \nhard to provide it. Over the last 2 years, Amtrak has cut its costs \nsignificantly, trimmed its staff by 20 percent, increased the number of \ntrains by 20 percent, and launched a multiyear plan to repair long-\nneglected infrastructure needs.\n  Amtrak ridership, by the way, reached a record 25 million persons in \n2004; the equivalent of 125,000 fully booked 757 airplanes.\n  More Americans are taking the train not only out of necessity but \nbecause they appreciate the kind of service and comfort that Amtrak can \nprovide.\n  The tragic events of 9/11--I remember the day vividly from the \napartment I live in on the Hudson River. It is practically right across \nfrom the World Trade Center. When we witnessed this catastrophe taking \nplace, we thought about what the consequences might be; what might \nhappen the next day, the day after or the year after. Aviation, much to \nour surprise and regrettably, was shut down completely. And Amtrak was \nthe facility that people had to use to get from Washington. A special \ntrain was set up to carry people from Congress up to New York to get \nsome idea as to what took place.\n  We were reminded that we couldn't rely exclusively on airlines \nbecause this country's commercial aviation system was totally shut \ndown. Amtrak trains kept running and carried many stranded airline \npassengers back to their families, to their great anxiety and concern. \nAmtrak provided a spectacular service in those days.\n  Today, everybody knows that when you go to the airport there are long \nlines because of security searches, making rail travel, or any kind of \ntravel, an increasingly attractive option, but not automobile traffic.\n  On a personal note of experience, the other day I left our office in \nthe Hart Building and headed for Washington's Reagan National Airport. \nIt took us almost an hour to arrive at the airport. Then we got to the \nsecurity line, and that was over a half-hour long.\n  If we totaled the time, excluding the flight time of the first one I \nmissed and the waiting time for the second one that I had to catch, it \nwould easily have been longer than it would have taken by rail.\n  If we could do for rail what we know is being done in other countries \nand shorten the ride between here and, let's say, Newark or New York to \na 2-hour ride, we would relieve our skies, we would relieve our \nhighways of all kinds of congestion, pollution--you name it--and cost. \nBut we have never made the investment.\n  All transportation infrastructure costs money, including highways and \nairports, and States cannot bear the cost.\n  But while the Bush administration proposes $50 billion in Federal \nfunds for\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nhighways and airports this year--over $50 billion--there is not one \ndime reserved for inner-city passenger rail infrastructure. It is a \ncrime not to do that.\n  Even though there is no money in the budget, the Bush administration \npromises to pay half the cost of future rail infrastructure projects. \nBut the Federal Government currently picks up 80 percent of the cost \nfor highways and airport infrastructure.\n  Since 1982, we have spent $696 billion on highways and aviation \ncompared to $21.5 billion on rail. We have to level this playing field \nto make rail more competitive. It is a vital asset for our country. \nEven in the more remote communities serviced by rail, I know in \nconversation with colleagues they appreciate the service they get.\n  We need to help Amtrak improve service on its existing viable routes \nand expand to other markets where travelers deserve a choice. Instead, \nthe Bush administration wants to leave the passengers stranded with its \nown version of what the rail passenger asset should look like.\n  In quick summary, we make a terrible mistake to turn our back on \nsomething as vital as intercity rail service. I hope we are not going \nto let it stand as it is presently projected. The Senator from West \nVirginia has proposed slightly over $1 billion to be added to the $360 \nmillion the President has proposed for traffic service that will give \nus a start on what we have to do to finally put Amtrak in the kind of \ncondition that can develop the technology we see in so many other \nplaces, rapid transportation, and avoid having all of us line up at the \nairports and on the highways and wait anxiously to see when our turn \nwill come to take our seat and start our travel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I start by asking unanimous consent \nSenator Inouye's name be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I start today by going back in time to the \nfirst time I ever rode a train. I was about 6 or 7 years old, visiting \nmy grandparents in Beaver, WV, a bedroom community outside of Beckley, \nWV. The fellow who had been the delegate in the West Virginia \nlegislature for Raleigh County, WV, which is where my grandparents \nlived and where I was born, was Robert Byrd. By that time he had left \nthe West Virginia legislature and was serving in the Senate after \nhaving served in the House.\n  The first time I ever rode a train was a B Railroad train that \nstopped in front of my grandparents' house and picked me and my sister \nup and drove a couple hundred yards on a train of which my grandfather \nwas a crew member.\n  It is ironic that some 50 years later I stand in the Senate to \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator Byrd to support continuing \npassenger rail service. He is literally from the same place I was born. \nMy first personal experience in riding a train goes back to his old \nrepresentative district and certainly his Senate district. I say to \nSenator Byrd, thank you very much for the leadership you have shown for \nbringing us to the Senate today to express our support for passenger \nrail service in the 21st century.\n  Fast forward a little bit to 1970. I was a naval flight officer on my \nfirst couple of tours in Southeast Asia. I remember picking up one day \na Newsweek or Time and reading that somebody in the Congress had worked \nwith the Nixon administration to create a passenger rail service for \nour country. At the time, the private railroads could not make money \ncarrying people. They wanted to be relieved of that responsibility and \nonly carry commodities, not people, from place to place in this \ncountry. An agreement was struck whereby if the for-profit private \nrailroads would contribute their old rolling stock, their old \nlocomotives, their old passenger cars, their old dining cars, and old \ntrack bed from Washington to Boston, overhead wires and old signaling \nsystem, old repair shops and old terminals, and kick in a little bit of \nmoney on top of that, we would somehow come up with a new passenger \nrail service called Amtrak.\n\n  After that couple of years and a couple of years of subsidy from the \nFederal Government, this new entity called Amtrak would start making \nmoney, something the private sector cannot do in carrying people. A \ncouple years went by, and after running those old trains on the old \ntracks, with the old overhead rail wire and the old maintenance shop \nand the old signalling system and not a whole lot of Federal support to \nimprove the capital infrastructure, Amtrak didn't make money.\n  If you look across the world at countries where they invest a lot of \nmoney in their passenger rail system, they don't make money either. \nThey don't pay for the full cost of their passenger systems out of the \nfare box any more than we have been able to do.\n  Since 1970, passenger rail service, intercity passenger rail service \nin this country has been starved for capital. Railroads are inherently \ncapital intensive. Passenger rail, as freight rail, needs significant \ncapital investments and we have literally starved Amtrak for capital \ninvestments since its creation. And that continues today.\n  What has changed since 1970? Among the things that have changed, we \nimport a lot more oil today. I don't recall exactly what we were \nimporting as a percentage of consumption in 1970. It was not much. This \nyear almost 60 percent of the oil we use in America will come from \nplaces outside the United States.\n  Our trade deficit in 1970 was not much at all. We were pretty much in \nbalance. In the month of January of this year, our trade deficit \nreached about $60 billion in 1 month. Back to 1990, that is twice our \ntrade deficit in 1990, and a quarter of our trade deficit each month \nand year is attributed to oil imports. One of the things that changed \nsince 1970 is a greater trade deficit and greater dependence on foreign \noil.\n  What else? Congestion on our roads and in our airports. Today, riding \ndown I-95 to catch the train to come down here, bumper-to-bumper \ntraffic. I-95 was a parking lot through Delaware. And that is not the \nonly interstate highway that was a parking lot this morning or this \nafternoon. The same is true of roads across our country. The same is \ntrue of airports across our country.\n  What else is the difference from 1970? The quality of air is a little \nbit better. Not as good as it can be and not as good as it would be if \nwe got more people to get out of their cars and take transit.\n  The other thing that is different, 25 million people rode intercity \npassenger rail in this country last year. That is not commuters; that \nis people who rode Amtrak. That is the highest number we have ever seen \nin the last 35 years.\n  My friends, if we try to cobble up enough money for Amtrak to live \nanother year and run the old business model we have worked with for a \nnumber of years, that is not good enough. We shouldn't do it. I don't \nknow if the administration is serious about trying to force Amtrak into \nbankruptcy, but I would suggest we go down two tracks. I suggest one \ntrack we go down, we adopt the amendment to provide a reasonable amount \nof money to run the trains in the Northeast corridor and across the \ncountry, but also do the necessary work that is needed under a 5-year \ncapital investment plan to fix tracks, fix overhead wires, and fix \nsignaling systems, and be able to run the trains to their capacity and \non time.\n  At the same time we do that, we need to have a debate and a good \nrobust discussion on what the future of passenger rail service should \nbe in this country. I am not sure exactly what the future business \nmodel for Amtrak ought to be, but I suggest that it include a couple of \nthese things: One, a focus on providing high-speed passenger rail \nservice in distantly populated corridors, not only in the Northeast \ncorridor from New York to Boston, but densely populated corridors in \nthe Southeast, the west coast, hubs from Chicago. There are corridors \nwe could exploit for passenger rail where folks travel 200 or 300 or \n400 miles.\n  Today, another thing that is different from 1970 is that 75 percent \nof the people in America live within 50 miles of one of our coasts. \nThink about that. Seventy-five percent of the people in America today \nlive within 50 miles of one of our coasts. There are all kinds of \ndensely populated quarters that could be well served by intercity \npassenger rail.\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\n  Another aspect of the business model, aside from developing high-\nspeed rail service in densely populated quarters, can be what I call \ntrains that people pay a premium to ride because they like to ride \nthem, because it is a neat thing to do, because it is convenient.\n  The Auto Train. People get on the Auto Train. They got on it about an \nhour ago, just south of Washington, DC. They pay a lot of money to ride \na train down to Orlando, FL. They have great food on the train, watch \nmovies, sleep on the train. It is a nice train, modern and convenient. \nThey will get off tomorrow morning near Orlando, FL, and have their \ncars right there with them to go wherever they want to go. There are \ntrains out on the west coast--Pacific Starlight--where people will pay \nextra money just for the beauty of the ride. Some trains across the \ngreat northern part of this country are the same.\n  Amtrak can make money actually running some of those trains. Amtrak \ncan make money carrying people in a high-speed Acela Express in the \nNortheast corridor. Amtrak can make money carrying the mail. Amtrak can \nmake money renting the Northeast corridor to freight for their uses, to \nrent out part of the right-of-way to the folks who want to run other \nkinds of information through the right-of-way.\n  Those are some elements of a business plan that I think might make \nsome sense for passenger rail in the 21st century. Freight railroads \nneed to be a part of that. We need to be investing in the freight \nrailroads as well.\n  The last thing I will say is this. Senator Schumer is here to comment \nas well. I will finish and add this comment. A friend of mine, a senior \nofficial in the Bush administration, said to me a couple years ago, \nknowing of my interest in passenger rail service, that we should follow \nthe airline model. With passenger rail service, we should do the same \nkind of model we follow with respect to the airlines. And I said, with \ntongue in cheek: Does that mean we ought to follow the Pan Am model? \nShould we follow the Eastern Airlines model? Should we follow Braniff? \nShould we follow U.S. Air? Should we follow United? Is that the model \nwe should follow into bankruptcy, because they have all gone bankrupt? \nAnd now the administration is suggesting a path that will lead to \nbankruptcy for Amtrak. The Surface Transportation Board, if they were \ngiven $300 million--they can't run the Northeast corridor. That is not \ntheir ability. That is not their talent.\n  This does not make sense. What does make sense is going forward on \ntwo tracks. I would suggest we adopt this amendment and we \nsimultaneously have a full and robust and rich debate on this floor and \nin committees and elsewhere to decide what 21st century passenger rail \nservice ought to be in this Nation.\n  Last word. In a country where almost 60 percent of the oil we are \nusing in this year comes from other places around the world, where, \nfrankly, a lot of people don't like us, and I am convinced they take \nour money to hurt us, keep this in mind: To carry 1 ton of freight by \nrail from Washington DC, to Boston, MA, uses 1 gallon of diesel fuel. \nLet me say that again. To carry 1 ton of freight by rail from \nWashington, DC, to Boston, MA, takes 1 gallon of diesel fuel. In a \ncountry that is awash in foreign oil and that has huge trade deficits, \na lot of which are attributable to our dependency on foreign oil, we \nare foolish to ignore that reality.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate my good friend from Georgia recognizing me.\n  I am here to rise in strong support of the Byrd amendment. First, I \nthank our leader and our colleague and friend, Senator Robert C. Byrd, \nfor offering this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment. It is one of the most vital amendments we will vote on this \nweek in terms of the budget. Much has already been said, but I just \nwant to add my voice to the importance of Amtrak.\n  If you live in the Northeast, if you live in New York State, you know \nhow important Amtrak is, not only the train that goes from Boston to \nNew York and then to Washington, but the line that goes from New York \nCity to Albany and then to Montreal.\n  For the capital region of Albany, for over a million people, Amtrak \nis the No. 1 way to get to nearby cities, the route that goes from \nBuffalo across to Albany and then to Boston. All of them are well \ntraveled and well used and meet any national test in terms of \ntransportation. In New York, 10 million New Yorkers use Amtrak, and \nlarge numbers of people depend on Amtrak.\n  This affects all of America. I know it has been said before, but let \nme say it again. If we were to close Amtrak, and in our most densely \npopulated area, the Northeast corridor, people used planes only, you \nwould have congestion in New York City, in Boston, in Philadelphia, in \nWashington. It you lived, say, in Chicago or Los Angeles, or \nAlbuquerque, you may say: What do I care? The reason is, once the \ntraffic backs up on the east coast corridor, it then backs up to \nCleveland, to Detroit, to Chicago, and down to Dallas, and all the way \nto California. We would choke not only our rail system, which is \nprobably the intention of the amendment, but we would choke our entire \ntransportation system. The roads, densely populated by trucks and cars \nalready, would become more crowded. That means traffic jams would \nincrease. That means pollution would increase. That means time per \nworker to get something done, efficiency and productivity, would go \ndown. As I mentioned, our air service would become a total mess. So for \nthe relatively small subsidy that Amtrak gets, it keeps our \ntransportation system in the whole country humming.\n  Europe does not have the kind of delays--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Western Europe is about the only place as crowded and uses as much \ntransportation as the United States. But the delays at the airports are \nso much lower. Why? Because they have a well, efficient, and subsidized \nsystem of rail. You go from London to Paris, you take the Chunnel \ntrain. You go from Paris to Lyon or Frankfurt, you take the Train a \nGrand Vitesse. It is just ridiculous that we are thinking of cutting it \nhere.\n  Now, if you say we are against subsidies, well, agricultural \nsubsidies are a similar subsidy. And there is sort of a balance. \nBelieve me, my State, particularly now with the new laws we passed for \ndairy and apples, benefits from agriculture subsidies. They are cut 5 \npercent. Amtrak is eliminated. Why is that? If you are against \nsubsidies, you are against subsidies.\n\n  I would urge the President and the people supporting this budget: OK, \ncut Amtrak 5 percent like you cut agriculture. Maybe together we can \nfight to restore even that 5 percent. But it is not a question of \nsubsidy.\n  Then we get boxed in. People talk about: Well, what about the trains \nthat are hardly used that go through large swatches of the country \nwhere they are not used? Well, the bottom line is, people from areas \nwhere Amtrak is heavily used depend on the votes of some of those \nfolks. If we could get a guarantee from the White House and from this \nbody that only in the areas where Amtrak is highly used we would \ncontinue to support it, and eliminate the rest, that is something to \nconsider. But they do a ``beggar thy neighbor'' argument. They say: Cut \nthe subsidies out West or in the South, and then we will not support \nAmtrak anywhere. And that gives us virtually no support. It is \nuntenable and it is unfair.\n  One other issue. It affects my city, and that is the issue of \nterrorism. After 9/11 our airspace was shut down, but New York was not \nclosed to the rest of the country because we had Amtrak. God forbid \nanother terrorist incident occurs. Let's say, God forbid, somebody uses \nMANPAD shoulder-held missiles and shoots down planes in 20 places in \nthe United States of America. Again, God forbid, if we did not have a \nrail system, this country would come to a screeching halt. So after 9/\n11, the rationale is even more important than it was before 9/11. And \nthe whole idea we will send Amtrak into bankruptcy and then we will fix \nit will cause chaos--\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nchaos in New York, chaos in the Northeast, chaos in America.\n  This is no way to run a country. This is no way to run a \ntransportation system. No business man or woman who knows how to get \nthings done would make this kind of proposal. I think what we find with \nthis proposal is what we find with a lot of things these days: a small \nband of ideologues who really do not look at practicalities. Ideologues \nof the right, ideologues of the left--they have all their genius given \nto them directly from the heavens, and they do not look at \npracticalities.\n  These ideologues say: Amtrak, subsidy, bad. And then, because Amtrak \nhas less political support, people go along. Are we cutting the subsidy \nfor roads? Are we cutting the subsidy for airports? The same ideologues \nsay those are bad, too. But we are in the anomalous position where we \nare caught between the ideologues on the one hand and the practicality \nof political support on the other, and we get stuck. There is no \nconsistency, no practicality, no understanding of the need of a modern \nnation.\n  So I hope we will vote for Senator Byrd's amendment. Will it take \nAmtrak to great new heights? No. Will it allow it to continue and grow? \nYes. With the changes made by Mr. Gunn, who everybody understands is an \nexcellent manager and who doesn't like to waste a nickel, we can make \nAmtrak better.\n  I hope that on this amendment, instead of the knee-jerk reaction to \nvote down all amendments, which we have seen a lot, people will look at \nthe amendment and at the consequences of doing what is in the budget, \nand I hope we will support the Byrd amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleagues from New York and Delaware.\n  Many believe Amtrak is a critical service for the northeastern \ncorridor. Amtrak is an important passenger rail service for the \nMidwest. In my State of Illinois, we have three different Amtrak lines \nthat are vitally important to my State. Each year, about 3 million \npassengers ride Amtrak in the State of Illinois. They are young and \nold, many college students.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Again, there are 3 million passengers a year in Illinois \nthat include the young and old who ride Amtrak for a variety of \nreasons. I live in the State capital. State employees go back and forth \non the trains from Springfield to Chicago. A lot of baseball fans \nheading up to see the Cubs and Sox and the Cardinals down in St. Louis \nride on Amtrak. During a school year, you cannot board an Amtrak train \nwithout finding scores of students going to Southern Illinois \nUniversity, University of Illinois, Illinois State University, or \nQuincy University. It is a critical service for our State. Two-thousand \npeople in my State work on Amtrak.\n  If the administration has its way and closes down Amtrak, as \nSecretary Mineta and the President have suggested, or threatened, it is \ngoing to have a devastating impact on Illinois. What happens when the \nAmtrak trains go away? If they do--and I hope it never happens--if they \ndo, the answer is obvious: more cars on the highway.\n\n  Who in the world thinks that is the answer to America's \ntransportation future? Right now, communities across Illinois are \nbegging me for more money to widen and build highways because already \nthe congestion is out of control. Now comes the discussion of \neliminating national passenger service, so 3 million train passengers \nin Illinois will be in a car--or maybe 1\\1/2\\ million if 2 people ride \ntogether--adding to the congestion, adding to the pollution, adding to \nmore dependence on foreign oil.\n  What is this White House thinking? Instead of walking away from \nAmtrak, this administration and other administrations should walk \ntoward Amtrak, realizing that it is one of the key elements of \ntransportation in America.\n  We don't think twice about subsidizing highway transportation--trucks \nand cars. We do it all the time by building these highways and bridges \nthat we are going to need. We don't think twice about subsidizing \nairlines in this country. We do it, and I voted for it because airline \ntravel is critically important to our economy. Why in the world do we \ndraw the line when it comes to this rail service and say this is an \nanachronism that would not work and should not have a penny of subsidy, \nthat if it takes a subsidy, we should do away with it? That is \nshortsighted.\n  It is not surprising to me that a President from the State of Texas, \nwith limited Amtrak service, doesn't appreciate what Amtrak means to \nmany States. In Illinois, our State contributes $12 million a year to \nAmtrak. That is the State subsidy to Amtrak, which I think is a \ndemonstration of their good will to keep Amtrak running--about 90 \npercent of the operating costs for the three routes I mentioned \nearlier, and more than $70 million over the last decade, in addition to \na quarter of the cost of the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor. Illinois, \ndespite a big deficit, is willing to pay its fair share. Should the \nFederal Government not be willing to do the same?\n  Secretary Mineta is a friend of mine; we served in the House \ntogether. He came to Chicago recently and said: I want to make it \nclear, we don't want to close down Amtrak. If we wanted to do that, we \nwould do nothing. That means no subsidy. Amtrak would go away with no \nsubsidy. We should work to improve Amtrak. They have made great \nprogress over the last several years. But capital investments in Amtrak \ntoday mean better, more reliable service, faster trains, more people \nusing the trains, and fewer people on the highways. Walking away from \nAmtrak will not achieve that goal.\n  I hope we can put together a bipartisan coalition to support Senator \nByrd and the amendment he is offering on behalf of Amtrak. I think the \nSenator from West Virginia and the bipartisan group that supports \nAmtrak are going to keep this service in place so we can make certain \nthat the millions of people in Illinois and across the U.S. will \ncontinue to find Amtrak a reliable train service.\n  Mr. President, at this point, if I am not mistaken, unanimous consent \nsuggests that we are moving to a discussion or debate on the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining on this amendment \nunder the control of the majority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 17 minutes by the majority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the Amtrak amendment. Is there time remaining on the \nminority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield back all the time I have remaining to the \nChair in the hopes of speeding up this debate and bringing it to a \nprompt conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, let me repeat what I said earlier. As I \nhave listened to my friends talk about this amendment, I know of no one \non this side who wants to shut down Amtrak. I know of no one in the \nadministration who wants to destroy Amtrak. I know of no one who thinks \nthat it would make sense to stop running trains in those corridors \nwhere people depend upon them for their daily activities. I hear all of \nthe doomsday talk. I dismiss it because I don't know of anybody who is \nplanning to do the terrible things they are accused of.\n  I do want to respond to the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, on \none comment he made about the necessity for keeping a national rail \nsystem. He said, if we don't keep running trains in all of these States \nthat don't have big population centers, that depend upon Amtrak the way \nNew York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania do, we will lose their \npolitical support.\n  Apparently, he didn't hear what I had to say, so I will repeat it. I \nam a Senator from Utah who supports Amtrak, who believes it is \nessential for the Nation to have Amtrak in the Northeast corridor and \nother heavily populated areas. I would be glad to donate to Amtrak the \ncost of running a train through Utah or running several trains through \nUtah. I am not going to disappoint many of my constituents because they \ndon't ride the trains. I am\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nnot so parochial as to say that the only reason I would support Amtrak \nis because there is a train in my State. When I look at the number of \npeople who are on the train, I look at the number of people who use the \ntrain, I realize that a train in my State is a waste of money. A train \nin my State makes no sense. I have watched the service shrink, as I \nsaid before, with the number of people who ride it. I have watched the \nterminal go from a large terminal that had great nostalgia and history \ndown to a smaller one, to a corner of that one, until today it is quite \nliterally a Quonset hut. Because there are so few people going through \nit, there is so little use of it that you want to conserve as much \nmoney as you can in the capital structure that supports it.\n\n  So let us not say that the reason we have to maintain the fiction of \na national railway system is for political support that can support the \nareas where the railway system is really needed. Let's give those of us \nwho come from other States enough credit of being smart enough to \nrealize that shutting down Amtrak in the Northeast corridor would be a \nstupid thing to do, but keeping Amtrak running across areas of the \ncountry bigger than the areas across Europe all by themselves, where \nnobody uses the service, is also a stupid thing to do.\n  This is not an all-or-nothing discussion. This is not a debate \nbetween killing Amtrak and putting 15 million people on the Northeast \ncorridor on the highways or keeping rail service available all across \nthe Nation. This is a question of saying after 30 years of watching the \nsubsidies fail to produce a system that makes sense, it is time to \nredraw the nature of the system. And this is the administration's way \nof getting our attention.\n  If, in fact, we find out during the appropriations process that the \nadministration wants to kill Amtrak, that the administration really \nwants to destroy service in the Northeast corridor, I will be the first \nto come to the floor and stand with my friends from New Jersey, New \nYork, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Maryland and say this is a stupid \nthing to do. And I will vote for appropriations, I will vote for \nsubsidies for Amtrak in those areas, as I always have. But do not \nassume the reason I always have is because there is a train running \nthrough my State. Indeed, I have always voted in that fashion saying \nthat you ought to get rid of the train that is running through my State \nso that you have more money available to solve the problems in the \nNortheast corridor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time we have \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the \nfunding for Amtrak. I have joined Senator Byrd on the Byrd-Specter \namendment to provide $1.4 billion for Amtrak which is, in my judgment, \nabsolutely essential for the welfare of the United States of America.\n  The hallmark of an industrial society is having urban transportation. \nThe Amtrak issue has been before the Congress virtually every year \nsince I was elected in 1980. I recall one of the early meetings in the \noffice of Senator Howard Baker, who was then the majority leader, where \nAmtrak had been zeroed out. In those days, it was funded between $600 \nmillion and $700 million. We were discussing the issue with David \nStockman, who was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \nHis argument was Amtrak will go to bankruptcy and the line between \nBoston and Washington would be saved.\n  It seemed to me there would be enormous problems. You would not be \nable to land at National Airport, now Reagan Airport, and get through \nthe Baltimore tunnel. We were able to save Amtrak. We have saved Amtrak \nin every year.\n  There is an enormous amount of work which needs to be done on \nAmtrak's infrastructure, fleet, and equipment. Amtrak is setting record \nridership, and as the congestion of our airports and highways continues \nto increase, it would be a grave mistake to cut back.\n  On February 10 of this year, 35 Senators, including 8 Republicans, \nwrote to Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad expressing our deep \nconcern regarding the President's proposed elimination of Amtrak \nfunding in the 2006 budget proposal and setting forth in detail the \nreasons Amtrak should be funded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to Chairman \nGregg and Ranking Member Conrad be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2005.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Conrad: We are writing to \n     express our deep concern regarding the President's proposed \n     elimination of funding Amtrak in his 2006 Budget proposal. At \n     a time when Amtrak is setting ridership records and as \n     congestion at our airports and on the highways continues to \n     increase, we believe it would be a grave mistake to cut the \n     essential federal funds that keep Amtrak operating. Without \n     such funds or other intervening action, Amtrak would quickly \n     enter bankruptcy and shutdown of all Amtrak services, leaving \n     millions of riders and thousands of communities without \n     access to the essential and convenient transportation that \n     Amtrak provides.\n       Therefore, we ask that you provide sufficient funding in \n     the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution to sustain Amtrak's \n     national network of passenger rail service. Amtrak's 5-year \n     Strategic Plan, which was approved by Amtrak's Board of \n     Directors on June 10, 2004, specifies that approximately $1.8 \n     billion will be required for fiscal year 2006 to provide safe \n     and efficient operation of the railroad. In addition, the \n     most recent reauthorization proposal from the Administration \n     would require a funding level of at least $1.5 billion for \n     fiscal year 2006, according to the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General.\n       Where Amtrak service is available, Americans ride the train \n     and are doing so in record numbers. Despite a sluggish \n     domestic travel industry. Amtrak carried more than 25 million \n     passengers nationwide. If Amtrak had the same opportunity to \n     receive Federal infrastructure investments as highway and \n     aviation interests, with a federal match comparable to funds \n     available to those modes of transportation, many more \n     communities would avail themselves of passenger rail service.\n       Amtrak has made real progress reforming itself over the \n     last few years by reducing its operating costs to help fund \n     needed capital improvements. Over the last 30 months, Amtrak \n     CEO and President David Gunn has cut operating costs, reduced \n     the employee headcount from slightly less than 25,000 to just \n     under 20,000 employees, has increased the number of trains it \n     operates by 20%, and implemented internal reforms designed to \n     control costs and improve efficiencies. Amtrak's core \n     operating expenses are now less than they were in 2000.\n       There is an enormous amount of work needed on the \n     infrastructure, fleet and equipment Amtrak owns and operates. \n     Amtrak cannot continue to defer this important work \n     without jeopardizing safety and reliability of its \n     operations or putting at risk service that is relied on by \n     hundreds of thousands of commuter and intercity passengers \n     each day.\n       Please consider our request for adequate funding for Amtrak \n     in preparing the FY 2006 Budget Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n         Conrad Burns,\n         Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n         Arlen Specter,\n         Lincoln Chafee,\n         Charles Schumer,\n         Jon S. Corzine,\n         Byron L. Dorgan,\n         Ron Wyden,\n         Frank R. Lautenberg,\n         Max Baucus,\n         Joe Biden,\n         Paul Sarbanes,\n         Herb Kohl,\n         Joe Lieberman,\n         Barbara H.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support adequate \nfunding for Amtrak. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Byrd for standing up \nfor the future of our Nation's national passenger rail service system \nwith this amendment.\n  For the past 4 years, this administration has acted in a thoroughly \ncynical way on Amtrak. Each year they have requested less funding than \nthe railroad needs to operate and improve its services, and then they \npillory Amtrak when it falls short of truly impossible goals.\n  David Gunn, the CEO of Amtrak since 2003, has stated numerous times \nto Congress and administration officials that to put Amtrak on solid \nfinancial footing and increase ridership, key capital improvements are \ndesperately needed, and would cost an estimated $1.8 billion a year.\n  In fact, Amtrak's 5-year strategic plan calls for $1.8 billion this \nyear, but the Bush administration simply refuses to request it from \nCongress, because they are bent on destroying the railroad.\n  Compared to the railroad investments made by our major economic \ncompetitors like Japan and Germany--each of which invests nearly 20 \npercent of its total transportation budget on rail or between $3-4 \nbillion each year--Mr. Gunn's request for $1.8 billion--or 2 percent of \nthe Federal Government's transportation budget--doesn't seem \noutrageous.\n  Amtrak operates a nationwide rail network, serving over 500 stations \nin 46 States. It has over 22,000 miles of track and 20,000 employees.\n  Amtrak's request for $1.8 billion doesn't even come close to rivaling \nthe amount the Federal Government spends on highways and air travel. \nLast year, we invested $34 billion for highways, and provided airlines \nwith $14 billion to subsidize air travel.\n  Yet despite Amtrak's clear and compelling needs, the administration \nhas proposed only $900 million in each of the past 2 years, forcing \nCongress to scramble to provide a ``barebones'' budget of $1.2 billion \nneeded to prevent the railroad from shutting down.\n  As a result, instead of being able to focus on a long-range plan of \nrestructuring and reform, Amtrak has been forced into a permanent plan \nof crisis management.\n  They have been forced into accepting short-sighted capital investment \ndeferrals and bookmaking wizardry simply to keep the railroad afloat. \nThey haven't had any choice, and they are barely holding on.\n  As anyone in the transportation industry will testify, repairs \ndelayed only become more costly in the future. Yet that is what Amtrak \nhas been forced to do because of chronic underinvestment.\n  Despite these hardships, Mr. Gunn and his Amtrak team have had some \nsuccesses, and we should acknowledge them.\n  First, they were able to increase ridership by 4 percent during \nfiscal year 2004, for a total ridership of over 25 million nationwide.\n  In addition, measured against domestic airlines, Amtrak has moved \ninto 8th place in total ridership and 1st place in terms of on-time \nperformance.\n  After undermining Amtrak's efforts to make critical capital \ninvestments and improve services in recent years, the administration \nnow simply proposes to eliminate funding altogether.\n  In fact, the administration's budget itself advises that Amtrak will \nbe forced into bankruptcy, and some sort of restructuring will take \nplace.\n  What we see again and again from this administration is the call for \nreform, without the resources to achieve it. It doesn't work in \neducation, and it won't work with the Nation's passenger rail system.\n  If the administration's plan--bankruptcy were--to happen, all of \nAmtrak's assets its stations, its track, its railroad cars, its \nlocomotives--will be sold at fire-sale prices to pay off its creditors.\n  Among the assets that could be permanently removed from the Nation's \ntransportation network are:\n  2,141 railroad cars; 425 locomotives; 20 high-speed train sets; 97 \nmiles of high speed track in Michigan; 62 miles of track between \nHartford, Connecticut and Springfield, MA; 104 miles of high speed \ntrack in Pennsylvania; and the 363 miles of Northeast Corridor track \nconnecting Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.\n  Make no mistake, if these assets are pulled from the Nation's \npassenger rail system, no one will be able to put it back together \nagain. Travel will be permanently undermined, to the detriment of our \neconomic competitiveness, the quality of our environment, and our \nnational security.\n  The administration suggests that perhaps the governors will step in. \nBut what will they step into? The States individually, and \ncollectively, don't have the resources to acquire an operate the \nsystem.\n  Even if they did, they haven't been consulted about such a proposal. \nNot a single State has come forward to express any interest in assuming \nthe financial or legal responsibility for operating an interstate rail \nservice.\n  Can you imagine if the administration had proposed to eliminate the \nFAA and suggested that perhaps the Governors should take it over?\n  This budget is a serious danger to the stability of our nation's \ntransportation system. The Senate should reject the Bush \nadministration's mindless plan of forcing Amtrak into bankruptcy.\n  A safe, reliable, and efficient national transportation system \ndemands that Congress act responsibly on passenger rail issues, even if \nthe administration continues to refuse to do so.\n  What if we have to shut down the national air traffic control system, \nas we did after 9/11, or if key parts or our Interstate system are \ncompromised by terrorist attacks, as they may well be?\n  Shouldn't the mere possibility of one or more of these crises force \nus to recognize the importance of maintaining a viable national rail \nnetwork?\n  The Senate should reject the administration's irresponsible passenger \nrail bankruptcy plan, and pass the Byrd amendment to ensure that \nAmerica's transportation network remains strong and flexible for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting additional funding for passenger rail. As we all know, the \nadministration eliminated funding for Amtrak in its fiscal year 2006 \nbudget. I believe that this is a shortsighted policy that could strand \ntravelers throughout the country, including those who rely on passenger \nrail in my State.\n  I am supporting this amendment, which would add $1.4 billion to the \nbudget for Amtrak because rail service is so important to travelers in \nWisconsin. I have long fought to ensure that intercity rail service \nexists in the Midwest. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nWisconsin's secretary of transportation, Frank Busalacchi, who is \ncurrently serving as the chairman of the States for Passenger Rail \nCoalition. Rail makes up an important portion of our intermodal system \nin Wisconsin. In January of this year, a total of 37,445 passengers \nused Amtrak's Hiawatha Service between Milwaukee and Chicago. That is \n37,000 fewer cars on our roads, reducing congestion and pollution. So \nmany times, when you hear commuter rail, we think of only the Northeast \ncorridor. I want to assure the people of Wisconsin that I know this is \nnot the case, and that I will fight to ensure that the corridors in \nWisconsin are not shut down.\n  I support reforms in Amtrak, and look forward to working with Amtrak, \nwith the administration, and with my colleagues to enact meaningful \nreform. But we cannot move forward on reform if Amtrak has been forced \nto abandon its services in other areas. The Northeast is not the only \nregion in the country that relies on a viable rail system--now is not \nthe time to force the more than 540,000 people who used Amtrak in \nWisconsin on to our overburdened roads and airports. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Byrd's \namendment to the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution to increase funding \nfor Amtrak. The budget resolution before us today effectively zero's \nout Amtrak's funding in accordance with the President Bush's perilous \nstrategy of bankrupting Amtrak as a means of reform. This is a \ndisastrous plan that will shut down all Amtrak operations across the \ncountry and severely limit Congress's abilities to provide intercity \npassenger rail service in the future.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment would increase funding for Amtrak by $1.04 \nbillion. This would be in addition to the $360 million included in the \nbudget to\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nmaintain commuter service operated by Amtrak in the case of bankruptcy. \nAmtrak would receive a total of $1.4 billion to fund railroad \noperations and meet capital needs. While this number is less than \nAmtrak has said it needs, it should allow Amtrak to continue its \noperations and maintain much of the progress the company continues to \nmake on repairing and replacing worn-out capital assets. The increased \nspending requested by this amendment is offset by closing corporate tax \nloopholes.\n  It is essential that we provide adequate funding for Amtrak so that \nthe railroad can maintain and improve the operations of the national \nsystem and make critically needed investments to return rolling stock \nand infrastructure to a state of good repair while Congress addresses \nthe larger questions surrounding Amtrak's future through the \nreauthorization process. As the cochairman of the Commerce Committee, \nAmtrak's authorizing committee, I look forward to working with my \nChairman, Senator Stevens, and with our Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Chairman, Senator Lott, on ways we \ncan improve Amtrak's service, costs, and structure. But, we must act \ntoday to ensure that adequate funding is reserved in this year's budget \nto avert any future crisis, to ensure the preservation of passenger \nrail as an alternative for the American traveling public, and to let \nAmtrak's employees and creditors know that Congress will not leave them \nout in the cold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 8 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania if he \nwould be in a position to either yield back the time on the Amtrak \ndebate or reserve the time and allow us to begin the debate on the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, which I believe is next in the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Illinois giving me the option. \nSince I do not have the authority to waive, I choose option 2.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime on this Amtrak amendment on the majority side be reserved and that \nwe now be allowed to go forward on the allocated time for the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make clear, since the chairman \nof the committee came to the floor, that there were 8 minutes remaining \non the Amtrak debate on the majority side, and I protected that 8 \nminutes so it would not be surrendered. Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, we now move to the debate on the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. I hope that meets with his approval. If it does not, I will be \nhappy to work with the majority on that question.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was created in the administration \nof President Eisenhower. This Republican President decided in the 1950s \nthat there were parts of the United States so important for future \ngenerations that they should be protected. One of those parts was the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  There has been a lot of debate about the future of that refuge. It is \na place in our Nation that has a special significance to many people. \nThere are Native Americans who live there and count on this refuge for \ntheir sustenance, maintaining their tradition, really protecting their \nlifestyle. There are others who see this Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge from a much different perspective, and that is why we continue \nto debate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The reason we are considering it on the budget resolution is because \na decision has been made, and that decision, made by those who wish to \nsee drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas, is \nthat they no longer want to follow the regular rules of the Senate \nbecause the regular rules of the Senate allow us to debate for a period \nof time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Are regular rules of the Senate to filibuster a bill? I \ndo not understand what the Senator is saying. The only reason this is \nin the budget resolution is because he and others have threatened to \nfilibuster it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my question. Would the Senator guarantee us an \nup-or-down vote if we do not keep it in this resolution?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska. He has certainly been \nhere a lot longer than I have. He understands the rules of the Senate \nfar better than I do, and under the regular order of the Senate, we \nallow debate to protect the rights of the minority. I think the Senator \nis well aware of that fact. It is really what makes the Senate unique. \nAnd the fact that now the Senator from Alaska wants to raise this issue \non the budget resolution is because he wants to in some way go around \nthe regular order of the Senate and to win with 51 votes an issue which \nmay require 60 votes if it was debated in the regular order. I think \nthe Senator would concede the fact that what he is doing is \nextraordinary, that he is asking for this Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield there?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not at this point because I think we have divided time \nfor debate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to charge it against my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator will have ample opportunity to use his own \ntime. I will not yield at this time. I would like to not be interrupted \nfor a few minutes, and then we can have a conversation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator state his party never tried to put an \nitem in the budget resolution--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator asking a question? If not, I do not yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am asking the Senator a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor, and \nhe may yield for a question if he so desires.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question, a brief question, but I have \na certain amount of time to use here and I would like to use it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator saying his party has never used the same \nprocedure to put in a budget resolution an item so it would avoid a \nfilibuster?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In my response to the question, I am not saying in the \nhistory of the Senate this never occurred. But I will say to the \nSenator from Alaska, he knows as well as anyone who has been in this \nChamber for a period of time that this is not the usual order of \nSenate. This is an extraordinary procedural move being made by the \nSenator from Alaska because he has had a difficulty passing this \nimportant bill that he would like to see passed. I think that is a fact \nof life.\n  What I would like to address for a moment, though, is the merit of \nthe issue. Think about it for a minute. When we ask the Bush \nadministration, What is your energy policy for America, they tell us \nthe centerpiece for their energy policy for America is drilling for oil \nand gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Surely you must believe, if you think that is truly the centerpiece, \nthere must be an extraordinary trove of oil and gas there that will \nsustain America for a lengthy period of time.\n  Let's look at the facts. The facts tell us quite the opposite. In \nfact, what we now find is when we look at the oil production that we \ncan anticipate from the coastal plain that is being debated here, it \nwould peak at 0.26 billion barrels a year in the year 2027, when the \nU.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Americans will \nconsume about 10.2 billion barrels of oil annually. The Arctic Refuge \noil would provide about 2.5 percent of America's annual need in that 1 \nyear--2.5 percent; and that is the peak year for oil production, \naccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n  If we are talking about a source of oil which in its best and peak \nyear is producing 2.5 percent of our oil needs in America, how in the \nworld can this be the centerpiece of our energy policy for America? \nFrankly, it is not and should not be. It has become a separate issue.\n  For those from the State of Alaska, the two Senators here who are \npassionately committed to this, I can understand the nature of their \ncommitment.\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nOil and gas exploration in Alaska has been very profitable, not only \nfor the companies involved but for many people in Alaska. But for those \nof us who are trying to look at a balanced energy picture, there are \nsome serious questions here as to why we would decide to go forward in \na wildlife refuge established almost 50 years ago and say we have \nreached such a desperate point in America when it comes to energy that \nwe have no choice but to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  For years I have come to the floor questioning this decision by the \nBush administration. I have been told from time to time by those on the \nother side that I don't know what I am talking about because I have \nnever been there; I have never seen the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  After having been told that for a number of years, I decided to do \nsomething about it. I went there. I went there 2 years ago and camped \nout 2 nights in the refuge with my son and some friends, to take a look \nat what the refuge was. We went there in August. It was an \namazing experience, one of the most beautiful pieces of real estate on \nthis Earth. Although there are some who come and disparage it and say \nit doesn't offer that much, I think it is extraordinary. I think \nPresident Eisenhower was right in setting it aside as a wildlife \nrefuge.\n\n  When you take a look at the area where oil exploration and drilling \nhave been allowed, you can see as you fly over the dramatic difference. \nThe landscape is scarred with roads and activities in those areas not \nprotected as a wildlife refuge. On the side of the river where the \nwildlife refuge exists, it is quite different. It is as God made it and \nit still stands today. It is significantly different.\n  The administration and its supporters for drilling in the Arctic \nRefuge have claimed the drilling can be done in an environmentally \nsound manner. I recently heard one of the Secretaries say we would use \nice roads which would disappear when the spring thaw came around; you \nwould never even know they had been used. They noted that the United \nStates has the highest environmental standards and the most advanced \ntechnology in the world.\n  That may be true. But toxic spills and air pollution from permanent \nyear-round operations are currently wreaking havoc on many areas of \nAlaska's fragile North Slope. Once part of the largest intact \nwilderness area in the United States, Alaska's North Slope now hosts \none of the world's largest industrial complexes, spanning a thousand \nsquare miles of once pristine arctic tundra.\n  Prudhoe Bay and 26 other oil fields include the following: 28 oil \nproduction plants, gas processing facilities, and seawater treatment \nand powerplants; 38 gravel mines; 223 production and exploratory gravel \ndrill pads; 500 miles of road; 1,800 miles of pipeline; 4,800 \nexploration and production wells. All of this activity is taking place \nin an exceptionally fragile region.\n  Any physical disturbance--bulldozer tracks, seismic oil exploration, \nspills of oil and other toxic substances--can scar the land for \ndecades. The National Academy of Sciences concluded it is likely that \nthe most disturbed habitat will never be restored and the damage to \nmore than 9,000 acres by oilfield roads and gravel pads is likely to \nremain for centuries.\n  At risk in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the home for nearly \n200 wildlife species including polar bears, musk oxen, and caribou. \nWhile I was there camping in the ANWR we saw one of these musk oxen. It \nwas an amazing sight. During the summer, nearly 135 bird species, \nincluding millions of tundra swans, snowy owls, eider ducks and shore \nbirds, are among those that rely on the area for sustenance before \nmigrating south for the winter.\n  No matter how careful oil companies are, oil exploration and \nproduction are not environmentally sensitive practices.\n  Exploration and production would not be confined to a limited area; \nit would range across many separate fields, affecting wildlife habitat \non hundreds of thousands acres interspersed between sprawling oil \nfacilities and pipelines.\n  Habitat would be further disrupted by industrial activity associated \nwith airports, permanent production and support facilities, housing, \nand the gravel roads needed to connect drilling sites.\n  All this industrial activity would fragment the coastal plain, \ndisrupting critical birthing, denning and breeding areas.\n  Each year, the oil industry spills ten of thousands of gallons of \ncrude oil and other hazardous materials on the North Slope.\n  From 1996 to 2004, there were some 4,530 spills of more than 1.9 \nmillion gallons of diesel fuel, oil, acid, biocide, ethylene glycol, \ndrilling fluid and other materials.\n  In the Arctic, the environmental damage from oil spills is more \nsevere and lasts longer than in more temperate climates. Diesel fuel, \nfor instance--the most frequently spilled substance on the North \nSlope--is acutely toxic to plants. Even after decades have passed, \ntundra vegetation has been unable to recover from diesel spills.\n  Then there is the issue of air pollution. Each year, oil operations \non Alaska's North Slope emit more than 70,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, \nwhich contribute to smog and acid rain. North Slope oil facilities also \nrelease greenhouse gases emitting anywhere from 7 to 40 million metric \ntons of carbon dioxide and 24,000 to 114,000 metric tons of methane. \nPlumes of pollution from Prudhoe Bay have been detected in Barrow, \nAlaska, nearly 200 miles away.\n  The City of Nuiqsut Council in 2001 noted, ``the impact of oil and \ngas development on our village has been far reaching. This has affected \nour day-to-day lives in several ways. Our ability to hunt and gather \ntraditional food has been severely impacted by development.''\n  Increased cases of asthma have also developed in villages subject to \nthe air pollution posed by development.\n  Hazardous waste contaminates water and wetlands despite advances in \nwaste disposal methods where drilling wastes are ground up and re-\ninjected.\n  In 2000 British Petroleum was ordered to pay $22 million in civil and \ncriminal fines and establish a new environmental management program \nbecause its contractors had illegally disposed of hazardous wastes \ncontaining benzene and other toxic chemicals. These crimes only came to \nlight because a whistle-blower reported them to the EPA.\n  If the United States were in a situation, a desperate situation where \nour economy was teetering near collapse, where we worried if businesses \nand jobs would continue because of energy shortages, where there was a \nserious question about the national security of America, I suppose the \ncase could be made that even drilling in a wildlife refuge, even \ndrilling in part of this world that we promised would never be touched, \nis warranted. That is not the case when it comes to the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. The amount of oil and energy that could be gleaned \nfrom this area is minuscule in terms of America's security demands.\n  The damage that could be done to this area would be permanent. It \nwould change it forever.\n  You have to ask yourself, if we have not reached such a desperate \nmoment in our history where we have to go to a wildlife refuge and \ndrill for oil, why are we doing it?\n  Some argue that many oil companies with their leases would make \nmoney. Some argue it would be good for the economy in some parts of \nAlaska. But I look at it from a different perspective, perhaps from a \nnational perspective.\n  It is interesting to me that this energy bill which makes the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge the centerpiece of the administration's energy \npolicy--a region which at its peak year could only produce 2.5 percent \nof the oil we needed--is the same Energy bill that refuses to even \nconsider fuel efficiency and fuel economy of the cars and trucks that \nwe drive in America. If we are worried about our dependence on foreign \nfuel--and we should be--aren't we doing the obvious? Why are we not \nsaying that we are going to create incentives and standards so that we \nproduce trucks and cars for America which will be more fuel-efficient \nvehicles? We have done this before.\n  In 1975, we faced an energy crisis. Congress ignored the big three \nautomakers, and many who opposed them,\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nand said we are going to pass a standard to double the fuel efficiency \nof vehicles on the road in America. We went from 14 miles a gallon \naverage fuel efficiency over 10 years to almost 28 miles a gallon. Some \nsaid it couldn't be done technologically. Some said we had no right to \ndo it legally. We did it. More fuel-efficient vehicles were on the \nroad, with less dependence on foreign oil.\n  What has happened since 1985 when those new standards were \nimplemented? Exactly nothing. We have failed to rise to the challenge \nof fuel efficiency and fuel economy on cars and trucks in America. In \nfact, we created a gaping loophole for trucks saying they wouldn't be \nbound by the same fleet fuel average, and SUVs drove right into that \nloophole. Now there are SUVs all over the highway, with limited gas \nmileage burning fuel, adding to the air pollution, increasing our \ndependence on foreign oil. If we improved slightly the efficiency of \ncars and trucks, fuel efficiency over the next few years, this debate \nwould be totally unnecessary. We wouldn't have to be talking about \ndrilling in a wildlife refuge. We wouldn't have to be talking about \ndrilling offshore in California or Florida or other States. We would be \ndoing the right thing for our environment and reducing our dependence \non foreign oil.\n\n  But this administration will not even entertain the possibility of \nasking them to drive more fuel-efficient vehicles. ``Let the \nmarketplace work its will,'' is what we hear over and over again. We \nhave seen ample demonstration of the marketplace at work as we find \nlarger, heavier vehicles on the road consuming more fuel and getting \nfewer miles per gallon. That is the trend for our future.\n  In our desperation, we import more oil to feed gas-guzzling vehicles, \nand we turn our back on the obvious needs to conserve energy--not just \nin the vehicles we drive but in our everyday lives and in our business \nconcerns as well.\n  I come to this debate wondering if we have reached such a desperate \npoint that we have to drill in a wildlife refuge set aside for my \nchildren, my grandchildren, and generations beyond. Have we reached the \npoint when it comes to America's energy security where we have no \nchoice but to go into these areas that are so important and so pristine \nand engage in drilling and production techniques that will leave scars \non the landscape forever?\n  From my point of view, we have not. There is a lot more that we can \ndo--simple, honest approaches to this problem which will meet our \nNation's energy needs without sacrificing some of the valuable \nresources and treasures such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I don't know how this vote will come out on this issue. It is likely \nto be very close. But having been there and seen what the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge represents, this Senator is going to oppose \nthis effort to drill in ANWR.\n  I think we should show real leadership, leadership that calls for \nconservation, renewable fuels, and better fuel efficiency. And with \nthat fuel efficiency there will be no need to compromise the integrity \nof such important areas in America as the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have listened with interest to my \nfriend from Illinois. I am sure he enjoyed his camping experience in \nthe wildlife refuge. I wish he had been with us about a week ago when \nwe were in the wildlife refuge and up on the North Slope when the oil \nactivity was going on. He should remember that oil activity in the area \ndoes not go on in the summertime. It goes on in the wintertime when \nthere is enough ice that you can drive on ice roads, and we did. You \ncan drive to a drilling pad that is made of ice, and we did; and know \nthat when spring comes and the thaw sets in, both the roads and the \ndrilling pads will disappear. All that will be left from the \nexploratory well is a single marker showing where the well was.\n  The one thing I learned that I had not known before I went up there \nand started talking to the people who were paying attention to that \narea was where the areas are and the labels that have been drawn.\n  The Alaska National Petroleum Reserve--that is an area we do not hear \ndiscussed in this debate. But it is there, and we visited that. The \nNational Petroleum Reserve and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge we \nvisited as well.\n  These are very evocative words: the Petroleum Reserve calls up images \nof great wells of petroleum being held in reserve just waiting to be \ntapped. The wildlife refuge calls up images of something being \nprotected, that wildlife goes there as a haven to get away from \npredators, or the devastation of human activity, and so on. What I \nlearned in the trip is that the National Petroleum Reserve was drawn on \na map by President Warren Harding in 1923 at the recommendation of the \nNavy who said: There is probably some petroleum up here. There was no \nscientific examination of the kind we use today.\n  By today's standard, the idea that there was petroleum there was very \nprimitive. But the President of the United States, in 1923, drew a line \non a map and created by decree the National Petroleum Reserve.\n  President Eisenhower, in 1960, drew another line on a map creating \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It was expanded by subsequent \nPresidents, first President Johnson and then President Carter.\n  The interesting thing to me was to discover that there is more \nwildlife in the petroleum reserve than there is in the wildlife refuge, \nand there is more petroleum in the wildlife refuge than there is in the \npetroleum reserve. When the Presidents drew those lines, they didn't \nhave the advantage of today's information.\n  The other thing that my friend from Illinois did not mention is that \nwhen President Eisenhower drew those lines he also drew a line around \nan area within the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Range--\nrefuge now--saying this portion of it is set aside for exploration and \nproduction of oil and gas.\n  For those who are saying let us not despoil this magnificent area, \nlet me remind them that this magnificent area was created by a \nPresidential declaration and that same declaration said in this portion \nof the area we are going to have oil and gas exploration and \nproduction. It was set aside right from the beginning.\n  I am sure the senior Senator from Alaska will explain the promises \nthat were made to the people of Alaska for oil and gas production in \nthat area at the time that designation was set aside, promises that \nhave not been fulfilled for over a quarter of a century.\n  The interesting thing for me to discover with respect to these \nevocative words and how they don't really describe what happens on the \nground was the discussion of the caribou herd. We have had an awful lot \nof rhetoric about the caribou and how the caribou in ANWR must be \nprotected. The caribou are unaware of the boundaries drawn by the \nPresident. The caribou go where they want to go in the area and the \narea includes the petroleum reserve, State land, ANWR, and Canada. The \ncaribou go across all of those jurisdictions without paying attention \nto the names that are given to the land they are wandering over.\n  It was interesting to talk to some of the people in Barrow, which is \nthe northern-most city in the United States. They pointed out that when \nPrudhoe Bay was opened for exploration and the pipeline was built there \nwas great concern about the caribou being unable to cross the pipeline. \nOverpasses were built over the pipeline to allow the caribou free \naccess to the other side because they said it will upset the caribou's \nmigrating habits, it will upset their mating season, it will upset the \ncalving season if they cannot move freely across. Ultimately, the \ncompromise was that we will build the overpasses for the caribou.\n  As this native of Barrow who has lived there all of his life said to \nus, the caribou didn't understand that. The caribou don't use the \noverpasses. The caribou, when they get to the pipeline, scrunch down \nand go under the pipeline and go on with their migration without paying \nattention whatever to the oil pipeline.\n  I was in the Nixon administration when the debate about building the \noil pipeline went on. It was just as bitter as the debate today. We \nwere told the caribou population would be decimated by this. Go up \nthere 30 years later and the caribou herds are bigger now than\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nthey were when the pipeline was built, and by a fairly substantial \nmargin.\n  I talked to some of the natives who watch the caribou. They said the \nthing that bothers the caribou the most are the mosquitos. They are \nterrible in the summer. We find caribou coming on to the gravel oil \npads because if they stand under the oil platform on the gravel, there \nare fewer mosquitos.\n  The caribou like to come around. The caribou are disturbed by human \nactivity there. The mayor of Barrow said to us, look outside the town \nand you find plenty of caribou. The only time caribou get upset by \nhumans and their activity is when the humans get on snowmobiles and \nchase into the caribou herd with rifles and start shooting them. The \ncaribou don't like that.\n  But that is the pattern of some of the people who said to us, do not \ndisrupt our subsistence living culture. There was one Gwich'in Indian \nalmost in tears as he pled with us, do not disrupt our subsistence \nliving culture that has gone back 1,000 years. We live on the caribou \nand the whale. We don't need the oil. We live on the caribou and the \nwhale. I thought, if you really want the subsistence living culture, it \ngoes back 1,000 years, we can give it to you by cutting down the \nshipment of diesel fuel that goes to your village, that provides you \nwith heat and power during the wintertime.\n  I was more moved by the prayer of the preacher who came to talk at \nour meeting who said he thanked God for the caribou and he thanked God \nfor the oil. He said, God gave us the caribou and God gave us the oil. \nAnd they were meeting in a heated room where they could gather for the \ntown meeting that we held there under the direction of Senator \nDomenici, and then for the church service that was held there.\n  I asked a question, how is this heated? Where do they get the power \nfor this? They said, once a year a barge comes through and deposits a \nyear's supply of diesel fuel. They had a power shortage in that \nvillage. Everything shut down. Helicopters, rescue teams, everything \nwas set up to try to get to them to restore the power so they weren't \nsitting in their homes freezing anymore. And it was diesel fuel.\n  My friend from Illinois talks about the diesel spills. I think there \nare probably more diesel spills connected with the shipping of the fuel \nup there to take care of the native villages than there are on the oil \npads and the activities of the oil industry because I saw the lengths \nto which the oil industry goes to try to prevent any kind of spills. I \nsaw trucks driving around with diapers on. That is not literally true, \nbut it is figuratively true. They had plastic pads under them in case \nthere was any leakage out of the truck, then it did not get on to the \nice and slip into the tundra. When you are unloading diesel fuel, a \nwhole year's supply, in the village you will have spills.\n  I didn't respond to this particular Indian, tell me about your \nsubsistence living culture, because I didn't want to embarrass him, but \nI knew that his subsistence living culture meant getting on a \nsnowmobile and going after the caribou with the rifles. I thought, the \ncaribou would much rather have oil engineers giving them some shelter \nfrom the mosquitos rather than this kind of human intervention into \ntheir lives.\n  A lot has been said about the puny amount of oil this would be. A lot \nhas been said, economically, we don't need it. All the rest of it. I \ncame back recognizing how important this is to the people of the State \nof Alaska, how important this is to their economy and to their future. \nIt won't affect the caribou. It won't affect the wildlife. There are \nmillions of acres they go over without respect to any of this activity. \nBut if we did not proceed with this, it will significantly affect the \npeople of Alaska. As a Senator from Utah I don't want to deprive them \nof that which is their natural heritage as described by that preacher \nwhen he said God gave us this oil.\n  It will be extracted in an environmentally friendly fashion. I think \nit is time we went ahead and did it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Colorado wish to speak? I guess we \nare going to go back and forth.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I say to the Senator from Alaska, I would like to speak. \nI yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much appreciate that of the \nSenator from Colorado and also I beg the indulgence of my colleagues; I \nam going to speak on another subject for about 5 minutes. It is not the \nsubject at hand. I ask consent my remarks appear apart from the debate \non ANWR.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: will that time be charged against \nthe 2 hours of the Senator's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be charged against the 2 hours \nof debate time on the Democrat side.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to oppose the reconciliation \ninstruction in this budget resolution directing the Finance Committee \nto cut Medicaid by $15 billion over 5 years. These cuts will tear the \nfabric of our Nation's safety net at a time when Medicaid is needed \nmore than ever. I plan to cosponsor an amendment to strike these \ninstructions and instead establish a bipartisan Medicaid Commission.\n  Medicaid is just too important to be subject to arbitrary budget \ncuts. It is a critical public program that provides a lifeline of \nhealth coverage and long-term care services to more than 53 million of \nour Nation's most vulnerable individuals.\n  For example, Medicaid ensures access to health coverage for more than \none in four children. Just think of that: one in four. It is the \nNation's largest single purchaser of long-term care services and fills \nthe gaps in Medicare's coverage for more than 6 million low-income \nsenior and disabled individuals.\n  It is an essential provider of health care services for women, the \nleading purchaser of family planning services, and it pays for more \nthan 40 percent of all births in America. Medicaid pays for more than \n40 percent of all births in America.\n  Medicaid funding is a major source of support that keeps the doors \nopen at thousands of community health centers, public hospitals, \nnursing homes, and other facilities.\n  While Medicaid is a critical component of our health care system, it \nis certainly not perfect. For that reason, I am open to talking about \nchanges in Medicaid. I am open to talking about better accountability, \nthe need for more State flexibility. And I am willing to consider any \nother area where improvements or clarification to existing Medicaid law \nis needed.\n  But we should not cut Medicaid for the sake of meeting an arbitrary \nbudget number. That is clear. And we should not be cutting Medicaid \nunder the guise of ``program integrity'' without a better understanding \nof what the States are doing--and what that really means--without \nknowing whether the activities singled out in the President's budget \nare truly abusive--we need to know that, too--and without knowing what \nimpact these cuts will have on the people who depend on Medicaid--we \ndon't know that either. So to enact these arbitrary cuts without \nknowing and having some semblance of the answers to those questions is \njust plain reckless.\n  Yes, Medicaid costs are growing. Recent cost growth at the State and \nFederal level is cause for concern. But most of this cost growth is due \nto an increase in enrollment and the same health care cost inflation \nthat affects every insurance plan.\n  From 2001 to 2003--this is pretty important--during the last \nrecession, Medicaid added 7.5 million people to the rolls. It was \nduring the recession, because of the recession. Most of these people \nwere insured but lost coverage because their employer dropped coverage \nor they could not afford the premiums. These 7.5 million would likely \nbe uninsured if it were not for Medicaid. This growth in enrollment \nshows that Medicaid is doing its job, growing to meet the need when \ntimes are tough.\n  That is the whole point of Medicaid. And times were tough. We were in \na recession. Employers laid people off. People needed health care, so \nthey had to go to Medicaid.\n  Even though Medicaid costs are increasing, just as in Medicare and \nthe private sector, it is important to keep in mind that Medicaid \ngrowth is lower on a per person basis. A recent study showed that \nMedicaid cost growth is 6.1 percent per person, compared to a 12.6-\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\npercent cost growth for private coverage. The growth in the cost of \nhealth care in Medicaid is half the growth per person under the private \ninsurance plans which most Americans are offered today. So Medicaid is \nnot a wasteful program.\n  We also pay more for Medicaid because of the critical role it plays \nin filling Medicare's benefit gaps for seniors and people with \ndisabilities.\n  More than 40 percent of all Medicaid spending goes to pay for long-\nterm care, for prescription drugs, other coverage and cost-sharing for \nlow-income individuals who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. \nThat is 40 percent of Medicare's costs, even though dual eligibles make \nup only about 14 percent of all Medicaid enrollees.\n  In essence, Medicaid picks up the tab for what Medicare should be \ncovering. The new Medicare drug benefit should provide some new \nassistance with costs for the dual-eligibles. However, States will \nstill be responsible for a substantial share of total spending in the \nform of so-called clawback payments.\n  Medicaid deserves its own policy debate, just like we had with \nMedicare. And whatever policy we support must address the root causes \nof the challenges facing Medicaid: the growth in enrollment; rising \nhealth care costs; and the increasing cost of providing long term care \nand other services to dual eligible beneficiaries.\n  We need the right diagnosis before we can get the prescription right. \nThat is why I support creating a bipartisan Medicaid commission to \nadvise Congress on how to sustain Medicaid well into the future.\n  By contrast, the budget resolution we are now debating would \nconstrain us to finding savings that meet a target number--even if that \nmeans cutting services and benefits, shifting costs to states, or \ndramatically restructuring the program.\n  The budget resolution frames these cuts as the amount that is \nmisspent on so-called waste and abuse in the system. Without a doubt, \neveryone wants to make Medicaid more efficient. And everyone agrees \nthat we need to root out fraud and abuse in Medicaid. In fact, Congress \nhas acted to root out fraud and abuse in Medicaid every time we have \ndiscovered it. Like with upper payment limits, disproportionate share \nhospital payments, and provider taxes.\n  And we stand ready to correct any misappropriation of federal funds.\n  But in the case of the administration's proposals, it is not entirely \nclear that there is evidence of abuse--or that the policy they have \nproposed will address the issue. For example, in the case of the \nPresident's proposal to limit intergovernmental transfers--IGTs--the \nCongressional Budget Office failed to score any savings. CBO lacked \nsufficient detail on the policy.\n  In fact, Senator Grassley and I have been asking the Administration \nfor specific information--for over a year now--about which states are \ncurrently out of compliance with the IGT rules, and how their policy on \nIGT enforcement may have changed. But they have not provided the \ninformation that we have requested.\n  I caution my colleagues in the Senate against buying the \nadministration's pig in a poke on this issue.\n  So let's be clear on what the President's proposal would do. It would \nchange the rules of the game on how states can finance their Medicaid \nprograms, pure and simple.\n  And the bottom-line impact on States could be devastating. In \nMontana, proposed cuts in the budget resolution would result in a net \nloss of more than $133 million Federal dollars from state's Medicaid \nprogram. In human terms, this funding cut could mean a loss of coverage \nfor 2,800 seniors or more than 12,000 children.\n  Lost Federal funds could also mean State revenues and jobs created by \nMedicaid spending.\n  For every $1 million Montana spends on Medicaid, more than $4.7 \nmillion in new business activity is generated and just over 57 new jobs \nare created. Montana can ill afford to lose this business revenue and \neconomic development.\n  Beyond the statistics and economic impact statements, there are real \npeople who will be hurt if we cut Medicaid.\n  Last month I heard from Kaaren Rizor, director of the Ashland \nCommunity Health Center in Ashland, MT, who told a powerful story about \nhow Medicaid has helped her community and what cuts might mean for her \ncenter's ability to serve those in need. She wrote:\n\n       I can't imagine what our population in Ashland, Montana \n     would do without Medicaid. Talk about impacting underfunded \n     Community Health Centers! [Medicaid cuts would] mean \n     accepting more patients for sliding fee scale discounts with \n     no means of recouping the cost of their care.\n       The concept of more Community Health Centers is noble and \n     good, but we aren't magicians. We can't pull money out of a \n     hat to survive.\n       Our clinic has tripled to quadrupled the number of annual \n     patient encounters. Along with that, we see more and more \n     families living at 100 percent of poverty. Without Medicaid, \n     we carry a tremendous burden to see all who come to us, \n     without the funds to provide quality care.\n\n  Let me reiterate that I am open to working on improvements to \nMedicaid. But we should not throw the proverbial baby out with the bath \nwater. This program is too important to too many people. And program \ncuts or funding caps will have a real impact on real people.\n  Finally, I would note that the House budget includes reconciled cuts \nin these programs that are much deeper than those in the Senate. We \ncannot act as though all such savings can somehow be achieved by \nwishing away fraud, waste, and abuse. I am deeply concerned about \nconference deliberations on this matter.\n  The amendment to strike this reconciliation instruction and instead \nestablish a bipartisan Medicaid commission enjoys widespread support \nfrom many Governors, health care providers, and more than 131 national \norganizations dedicated to helping the Nation's Medicaid beneficiaries, \namong countless others. I applaud the leadership of Senators Smith, \nBingaman, and Coleman in proposing this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto join me and Senators Smith, Bingaman, and Coleman in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I very much appreciate the indulgence of \nmy good friends from Colorado and Alaska and others who have let me \nmake this statement which is not on the subject at hand. I thank them \nall and yield the floor, and I particularly thank my friend from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today, first of all, to \nacknowledge the work of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Chairman \nGregg, as well as Ranking Member Conrad, and the work of their staff in \nputting together this very complicated budget that we are debating on \nthe Senate floor this evening and throughout the week. I know how hard \nthey are working because last night, even at 10 and 11 o'clock, we were \ngetting e-mails from the work they are performing. So I thank them for \ntheir hard work on this most important of matters for the U.S. Senate.\n  Secondly, I also want to say, with respect to the budget resolution \nin general, I come from a place in the West which is very far removed \nfrom Washington, DC. As I was growing up on this farm and ranch in the \nSan Luis Valley, south of Denver by nearly 300 miles, my father and \nmother taught me a lot about the most important values of America. One \nof those most important values was the value of honesty and the value \nof candor.\n  I grew up in the West where a handshake across a fence line meant \nthat your word was going to be true. And it meant that you would not \nmislead anyone in terms of the direction you were taking with respect \nto anything that was important to you or your family, your country, or \nyour God.\n  Yet when I look at what has happened here with the President's \nbudget, the fact of the matter is that the American public is, in fact, \nbeing misled. We are being misled because we have been presented a \nbudget that continues the fiscal recklessness that I believe future \ngenerations of Americans simply cannot afford.\n\n  It would be my fervent hope that as this Senate moves forward dealing \nwith this budget, and the pay-go amendments that will be offered here \ntomorrow, we can, in fact, put this Government back on the kind of \nbudget of\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nconservatism that will truly bring us back to a place where we can, in \nfact, pay our debts.\n  I want to take a minute and speak about the Social Security issue \nbecause that is a major issue that we have been debating in Washington \nfor some time and which the President has been taking around the \ncountry, to talk about the importance of Social Security changes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  It will just take 1 second.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Yes, I say to the great Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, do we understand the distinguished \nSenator is speaking on the Democrats' time on ANWR?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is speaking on the budget, but, I say to \nthe Senator, you are using time that is allotted for ANWR. Does the \nSenator understand that?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me make several quick points of what is happening, in my view, \nwith respect to Social Security. I do so because the President of the \nUnited States will actually be, I hear, in my State next week to talk \nabout the importance of the issue of Social Security. I think it is \nimportant that as the President talks to the people of America, he talk \nto the people of America, not simply to groups that are controlled with \nmaking sure that only people who have his point of view are heard on \nthe issue of Social Security.\n  In that regard, it is important for the people of America to know the \nfacts; that is, that Social Security has, in fact, worked, that we have \ngone from a time and place in our Nation where we had millions of \npeople in poverty--50 percent of older Americans who were in poverty--\nto a point now where less than 10 percent of older Americans are in \npoverty. That is an important fact that I think the President needs to \ntell people.\n  Secondly, he also needs to make sure that he is candid with the \nAmerican people, and that when we talk about the issue of solvency for \nSocial Security, that we are solvent in Social Security. In fact, not \nmy office, not a Republican office, not a Democratic office, but the \nOffice of the Congressional Budget Office says that we are solvent \nuntil the year 2052.\n  So we do not have the kind of emergency crisis on our hands that has \nbeen exaggerated by this President to the American people. The American \npeople need to have realism with respect to what is happening with \nrespect to Social Security.\n  And third, my belief is that the President's proposal on Social \nSecurity will continue to add to the kind of red ink that we already \nhave in this Government, which is absolutely unwarranted. We need to \nrecognize that a very significant amount of the current Federal deficit \nis being masked by the huge amount of money that is currently being \nborrowed from the Social Security surplus.\n  Over $160 billion a year is borrowed from the Social Security surplus \nto mask the size of the deficit. The President's proposal shows that we \nhave a deficit of $332 billion. But when you take out the omitted costs \nfor the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the homeland \nsecurity efforts, and when you take out the amount that is being \nborrowed from the Social Security surplus, the fact is our current \ndeficit for this fiscal year alone is $579 billion.\n  When you continue on down the road, in the next fiscal year it goes \nup to $584 billion, and so on, to $594 billion. So that is a huge red \nsea of ink that is being created for the United States of America that \nI do not believe we should pass on to our children or grandchildren.\n  When you look at what the Social Security transition costs will be, \nit would even deepen the deficit further, to the point where we would \nhave a $621 billion deficit in the outyears. Now, I don't know about \nyou, but at least when I look at what conservative values are, one of \nthe things about those values is having fiscal integrity and making \nsure that we are paying our debt. We are not doing that today. We don't \nhave a long-term plan with which to deal with the deficit.\n  I believe it is the obligation of our National Government to make \nsure that we deal with the American people with candor and the kind of \nhonesty that they deserve.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak about my support for protecting the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil exploration and development, \nand also to oppose any measure included in this year's budget \nreconciliation bill to open this land.\n  At the outset, let me say I have always believed in balance between \nthe development of our natural resources and at the same time the \nprotection of our lands. I had the honor of serving as the Executive \nDirector of the Department of Natural Resources in my State for 4 \nyears, and I worked closely with industry in the development of our oil \nand gas resources throughout the State of Colorado. I worked closely \nwith the proponents of oil and shale development to see where that \nresource could be taken in the future. As we move forward in dealing \nwith the issue of energy, which is important to our country, I strongly \nbelieve we need to achieve that same kind of balance we tried to \nachieve during the time I was Director of the Department of Natural \nResources.\n  Let me say that no matter what happens with ANWR--and I am going to \nbe opposed to the opening of the Arctic Refuge--no matter what happens \nwith respect to this issue, which will be debated tonight, tomorrow, \nand it will be decided on the floor, it is incumbent upon all of us to \nmake sure what we are doing is working in a bipartisan manner to create \nthe kind of Energy bill that will help us get rid of our overdependence \non foreign oil and will help us push forward with a new ethic and era \nof renewable resources and conservation.\n  Beyond this debate, I want to work closely with leaders on both sides \nof the aisle, with Senator Bingaman and Chairman Domenici, to make sure \nthat what we deliver to the President for signature is an energy bill \nthat has the support of the American people and the support of at least \nmost of the people in this body.\n\n  Let me spend a few minutes talking about the Arctic Refuge. First, \nthe Arctic Refuge itself, when we think about the amount of land that \nwould actually be affected, we have heard the figure that it would only \nbe 2,000 acres. That is the footprint out of this 1.9 million acres, in \narea 1002; 2,000 acres would be involved in oil and gas exploration and \ndrilling activities. The National Academy of Sciences, and others who \nhave looked at this, believe the amount of land that would be affected \nis much greater than those 2,000 acres because you have to put in \npipelines and other facilities that ultimately would end up having a \ngreater effect than just the 2,000 acres that have been talked about.\n  Secondly, there are the risks with respect to the transportation of \nhazardous materials. The Department of Environmental Conservation for \nAlaska last year alone said the current activity on the North Slope \ncreates over 500 spills a year. So we will see spills and other toxic \nsubstances if this area is opened for exploration and drilling.\n  Third, we need to all be very candid with respect to the oil we would \nget from area 1002. According to the DOE's own energy administration \nreport dated March 2004, they predicted there would be about 300,000 \nbarrels a day that would be produced by 2015. Their projection showed \nthat would be about 1 percent of world oil production in that year. \nWhen you look at the fact that that is only 1 percent of the world's \noil production, it means the current energy dependence that we have on \noil and gas that we import from other countries would only be very \nmarginally affected, by 1 percent. It is predicted that instead of \nimporting 63 percent of our oil, we would be importing only 62 percent \nof our oil.\n  So for a 1-percent solution, we are saying to the people of America \nthat we are opening up the Arctic Refuge for exploration and \ndevelopment. My concern is not only with the opening of the refuge, but \nalso what it would do with respect to other areas of special \nimportance, including the over 500 refuges that we have all around our \ncountry, including the National Wildlife Refuges that we have in our \nStates.\n  Even the major oil companies, many of whom I have met, and many of\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nwhom I have worked with--I have friends who work there--they have \nexpressed their own concern about drilling in the Arctic Refuge. In a \nrecent New York Times article, dated February 21, the ExxonMobil CEO \nwas quoted as saying during a previous interview:\n\n       I don't know if there is anything in ANWR or not.\n\n  There are other leading industry leaders who say they do not believe \nthat we ought to be opening the Arctic Refuge for exploration or \ndrilling, in the same kinds of words my colleagues believe we should \nmove forward. Let me say I do not believe we should take what is such a \nprecious and unique natural resource and open it for exploration and \ndrilling, when we know that at the end of the day we are dealing with \nonly 1 percent of the oil and gas that is needed in this country.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying I believe we need a new energy vision that \nfrees America of our dependence on fossil fuels. We need to provide \nadequate resources for research and development and alternative \nsources. We need affordable, cleaner, and safer energy, and a policy \nthat protects special places in wilderness. We need the opening of \nareas that do have oil and gas in them, but from my point of view that \ndoes not include the Arctic Refuge.\n  I believe opening the Arctic would also reinforce the view that we as \na nation lack a commitment to humbling ourselves to the natural wonders \nGod has bestowed upon this Earth. We are, at the end of the day, merely \nstewards of those gifts.\n  I want to make two quick points here. The budget projections that \nhave been used in this budget reconciliation measure are, from my point \nof view, fantasy. I think to base our Nation's revenue projections on \nthe opening of the refuge is not candid and not fiscally responsible. \nThe Department of the Interior's 2006 budget assumes that the Federal \nGovernment will realize $2.4 billion from the first lease sale in \n2007--$2.4 billion from the first lease sale in 2007. For the Federal \nGovernment to realize $2.4 billion, the leases would have to sell for \nbetween $4,000 and $6,000 an acre. That is not going to happen. This is \nnot the fiscally responsible way that we should be moving forward as we \ndevelop the budget for the following year.\n  Let me conclude by reading this letter written by President Jimmy \nCarter concerning the Arctic wildlife area:\n\n       Dear Senator Salazar:\n       This year marks the 25th anniversary of my signing the \n     Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act into law. I am \n     proud to have been a part of crafting this landmark \n     legislation, which is widely recognized as the most extensive \n     land and wildlife conservation action in American history. \n     Now it seems possible that some in Congress may try to \n     subvert parts of ANILCA by inserting a provision in the \n     fiscal year 2006 budget resolution that is designed to \n     circumvent normal legislative procedures and allow for oil \n     drilling and exploration in the coastal plain 1002 area of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I have been fortunate \n     enough to visit the coastal plain of the Arctic refuge as \n     tens of thousands of caribou passed around me in their \n     timeless migration into their vital calving and nursery \n     grounds--the very area targeted for oil development. I have \n     watched a herd of Musk oxen circle their young to protect \n     them. But that defensive behavior will not save them from \n     industrial development. The same is true of the polar bear \n     and the millions of migratory waterfowl that nest on this \n     coastal tundra. This is their wilderness home.\n       I urge Senators to vote for removing any provisions from \n     the fiscal 2006 budget resolution that would turn over the \n     Arctic refuge Coastal Plain to oil development. Keeping the \n     Arctic refuge wild and free of development is part of \n     fulfilling our moral obligations, not only for the present \n     but for future generations of Americans who will be grateful \n     for our foresight and stewardship in protecting their \n     interests. Sincerely, Jimmy Carter.\n\n  How much time do I have, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 19\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I will take 30 seconds.\n  At the end of the day, I believe there is a very balanced approach to \nhow we develop our resources. I am a person who has supported \ndevelopment of our oil and gas resources. I do not believe the Arctic \nRefuge is a place we should go to for development. I say that with all \ndue respect to my colleagues from Alaska and my colleague from New \nMexico and my other colleagues on the other side of this particular \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am sorry I did not have a chance to \nvisit with the Senator from Colorado sooner, but I would like to \ndisabuse him of two things. The 1002 area is not wilderness, and 1002 \nis not within the wildlife refuge. That section specifically excludes \nit from the wildlife refuge until the period of oil and gas exploration \nis over.\n  There is no question we have a difference of opinion, but I do hope \nwe will stick to the facts. As a matter of fact, the Senator just read \nPresident Carter's letter. I am writing a response to President Carter \nbecause I also received that letter. I stood in the White House with \nhim as he signed the bill in 1980. He did not want that bill to come to \nhim before the election. He asked Congressman Mo Udall to hold it up \nuntil after the election because he believed he could not sign it if he \nwas reelected. When he was not reelected, he did sign it, and he put \ninto law the sections that pertain to this area and the overall refuge, \nbut sections 1002 and 1003 specifically exclude this area from the \nrefuge until the oil and gas exploration is over.\n  There has historically been support for utilizing Alaska's oil \ninterests to serve our national security interests. Senators Mark \nHatfield and Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson, who both represented northwestern \nStates, agreed that the development of the North Slope was vitally \nimportant. They stated that the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act and, in particular, the provision keeping the Coastal \nPlain of ANWR open for development was--this is their statement, and \none of them was ``Scoop'' Jackson:\n\n       It is crucial to the Nation's attempt to achieve energy \n     independence. One-third of our known petroleum reserves are \n     in Alaska, along with even greater potential. Actions such as \n     preventing even exploration of the Arctic wildlife range is \n     an ostrich-like approach that ill serves our Nation in this \n     time of energy crisis.\n\n  That was the statement of two northwestern Senators, including \nSenator ``Scoop'' Jackson.\n  We are now at a critical juncture in terms of our energy dependence. \nThe United States is at the mercy of the Middle East and others for our \nenergy needs. As a matter of fact, today OPEC met in Iran to determine \nhow much oil and at what price they would sell it to us.\n  Opening of ANWR would reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil which we \nrely on for over half our oil needs today. This development alone would \nreduce U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil by 4 percent, not 1 \npercent, and would be produced from only 2,000 acres. The 10.4 billion \nbarrels of oil that is estimated to be in this area translates to 436 \nbillion gallons, and that is enough oil to fill up every car in America \n115 times. Let me repeat that.\n  People say there is not any oil. There is enough oil there to fill up \nevery car in America 115 times.\n  At 867,000 barrels a day, it would create 36 million gallons of \ngasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, heating oil, medicines, plastics, \nsurgical devices, and other products vital to our Nation.\n  There is no question there has been a lot said here that is \nmisleading. I have in my hand something given to me before I came to \nthe floor. It is from our colleague John Kerry. It says:\n\n       The Republicans are trying to sneak legislation through the \n     Senate approving oil drilling and they are incredibly close \n     to winning.\n\n  It goes on to say some things here that are absolutely not true, but \nit does pinpoint seven of our colleagues and asks for people to call \nthem and put pressure on them now. It asks for an emergency donation \nright now. What for? We are going to vote tomorrow. I do not know why \nthey need emergency donations.\n  Beyond that, it says:\n\n       Of course, the Arctic Refuge supports more than wildlife. \n     For a thousand generations, the Gwich'in people of Northwest \n     Alaska and Northwest Canada have depended on it and lived in \n     harmony with it. To them, the Arctic Coastal Plain is sacred \n     ground.\n\n  They do not even live there. They live on the South Slope of the \nBrooks Range. The Gwich'in people have nothing to do with the Arctic. \nThe only thing they have to do with it is they harvest some of the \ncaribou that come up the Porcupine River and go up to\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\nthe North Slope about every year. But several years of the last 10 \nyears they have not come up at all because they are hunted so hard by \nthe Gwich'in people in Canada that there is not enough left of them to \ntravel. The misinformation here is staggering, really staggering.\n  Above all, I think we ought to get down to talking about what \nEisenhower did. I was the solicitor of the Interior Department during \nthe Eisenhower administration. I helped write the order that created \nthe Arctic Wildlife Range in 1960. It was approved by President \nEisenhower. It created an Arctic Wildlife Range open to oil and gas \nexploration and development specifically. When we had the great \nargument in the 1980s--really the late seventies, leading into 1980--\nabout the Alaska National Interest Conservation Lands Act, the question \nwas should that area, the 1.4 million acres in the Arctic, be left open \nto oil and gas development as it had been left open by President \nEisenhower's administration.\n\n  I fought and fought, and we finally got the agreement with Senator \nJackson and Senator Tsongas that, yes, that would be left open under \ntwo conditions. One, we had to have an environmental impact statement \nand, second, we had to have the approval of the President and the \nCongress of that impact statement. We have tried now for 24 years--24 \nyears--to have the Congress approve that.\n  I heard the Senator from Colorado. I have had family connections with \nColorado in the past, and I have great respect for his service in \nColorado. It may interest him to know that I was the first person to \ntestify in favor of the wilderness before the Senate on behalf of \nPresident Eisenhower. We value wilderness in our State, but this is not \nwilderness. It was never wilderness. It was specifically kept out of \nwilderness.\n  Let me put up a chart. I want to point this out to the Senator. This \nis the Eisenhower I knew and for whom I worked. It was his World War II \nposter.\n\n       Talk to the oil workers of America: Your work is vital to \n     victory . . . our ships . . . our planes . . . our tanks must \n     have oil. Stick to your job--oil is ammunition.\n\n  That is why, in the 1970s, when we tried to get the Alaska oil \npipeline built, there was never even a hint of filibuster. No one, not \none Senator mentioned a filibuster.\n  Instead, we all knew it was a security aspect that we were dealing \nwith. It was oil, oil that we needed. We had an embargo from, I think, \nNovember to March. We had no imports of oil.\n  That could happen again. Again, I point out where they are meeting. \nThey are meeting today in Iran.\n  The letter President Carter wrote said:\n\n       It seems possible some in Congress may be trying to subvert \n     parts of ANILCA by inserting provisions in this budget \n     resolution designed to circumvent normal legislative \n     procedures.\n\n  The only reason we have been doing it is because it has been \nfilibustered for 24 years--24 years. This is the first chance we have \nhad, really, to keep it in this resolution. We did try it once before \nand when we did it before in the last Congress, no one accused us of \nsneaking. That is a sneaky thing to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Kerry's flier be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks, so people can see the depth to which people \nare going to accuse us of somehow doing something wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are trying to carry out the provisions of the 1980 \nact that allowed us to explore and develop this 1.5 million acres.\n  It is a difficult thing for some of us to be accused of trying to \nsubvert, to circumvent normal legislative procedures.\n  President Carter indicates that this is a wilderness. It is not a \nwilderness. I stood in the White House with him and he acknowledged it \nthen, the Jackson-Tsongas amendment was in the bill he signed in 1980, \nafter the election--after the election.\n  I don't know where you are, President Carter, but I wish you would \ntell the truth. Tell the truth to the American public. This is an area \nthat was left open to exploration.\n  I have here a chart. I don't know how many people can see it. I hope \nthe Senator can see it. It shows the wilderness area of the old range, \nall of it except that portion that was named wilderness. If you look at \nthis chart, the new addition made by President Carter was not made \nwilderness. There are 18 million acres there; 1.5 million acres were \nleft for oil and gas exploration and the balance of the 8.6 million \nacres is wilderness. We do not oppose that wilderness. That was \nwilderness that we accepted as a designation because of the fact the \narea that was in the oil and gas province was left open to exploration.\n  It is not wilderness. The problem is, the people who live on the \nNorth Slope--there was one young lady with me in the press conference \nwho lives in Kaktovik. It is in the 1002 area, but it is not \nwilderness; it is coastal plain and specifically open to oil and gas \nexploration.\n  Madam President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me know when I use 3 more minutes, please.\n  I want to tell the Senator, one of the friends I had here in the \nSenate in days gone by was Senator Jim Buckley. Senator Jim Buckley \nleft the Senate and became a judge. He is a judge in New York. He sent \nme this letter. You read a letter. Let me read you a letter from Judge \nBuckley, former Senator Buckley. He wrote this to me on January 24.\n\n       Dear Ted, twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate--\n     --\n\n  And here it is for everybody to read.\n\n       Twenty-six years ago, after leaving the Senate, I was a \n     lead signatory in full-page ads opposing oil exploration in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve that appeared in the New \n     York Times and the Washington Post. I opposed it because, \n     based on the information then available, I believed that it \n     would threaten the survival of the Porcupine caribou herd and \n     leave huge, long-lasting scars on fragile Arctic lands. Since \n     then, caribou populations in the areas of Prudhoe Bay and the \n     Alaskan pipeline have increased, which demonstrates that the \n     Porcupine herd would not be threatened, and new regulations \n     limiting activities to the winter months and mandating the \n     use of ice roads and directional drilling have vastly reduced \n     the impact of oil operations on the Arctic landscape.\n       In light of the above, I have revised my views and now urge \n     approval of oil development in the 1002 Study Area for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. With proper management, I don't see that any significant \n     damage to arctic wildlife would result, and none that \n     wouldn't rapidly be repaired once operation ceased.\n       2. While I don't buy the oil companies' claim that only \n     2,000 acres would be affected, even if all of the 1.5 \n     million-acre Study Area were to lose its pristine quality (it \n     wouldn't), that would still leave 18.1 million acres of the \n     ANWR untouched plus another five million acres in two \n     adjoining Canadian wildlife refuges, or an area about equal \n     to that of the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, \n     and New Hampshire combined. In other words, it is simply \n     preposterous to claim that oil development in the Study Area \n     would ``destroy'' the critical values that ANWR is intended \n     to serve.\n       3. In light of the above, it is economic and (to a much \n     lesser degree) strategic masochism to deny ourselves access \n     to what could prove our largest source of a vital resource.\n       Having visited the Arctic on nine occasions over the past \n     13 years (including a recent camping trip on Alaska's North \n     Slope), I don't think I can be accused of being insensitive \n     to the charms of the Arctic qua Arctic. I just don't see the \n     threat to values I cherish.\n\n  There is the man who signed the ads. He started the drive. He \nliterally was the one who started the drive that everyone else now has \njoined, and that is the drive to prevent us from carrying out the \nintent of the 1980 Alaska Lands Act.\n  I will have a lot more to say about this tomorrow. But above all, I \nwish people would start telling the truth.\n  No. 1, it has never been wilderness. No. 2, it has been open to oil \nand gas development since the Eisenhower days and remains open. It only \ntakes the approval of Congress to proceed with that. No. 3, the \nGwich'ins don't live on the North Slope. The Gwich'ins are not \nresidents of this area. And, No. 4, it has not been harming and would \nnot harm the caribou. The caribou around the oil pipeline have \nincreased from 3,000 to over 300,000 in the central Alaska herd.\n  We are not bad stewards of our lands. We have protected more \nwilderness than all the rest of the Nation put together. We have been \ngood stewards of our land. We have managed our wildlife better than any \nother State. It is ridiculous to be put on trial because of a group of \nprofessional, extreme environmentalists who make money.\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  Look, Senator Kerry is sending out requests for them: Send money in \nnow. You need money. You need money to fight this because this is going \nto be voted on tomorrow.\n  It is preposterous. Again, I am sorry I did not get a chance to visit \nwith my friend from Colorado. I admire Colorado and I know what they \nhave down there. You should come see our wilderness areas. We have \nwilderness areas, a great deal more than you have seen in your life, \nmore wilderness areas in one State than there is in the whole Nation. \nTo have people mischaracterize this as wilderness is absolutely \npreposterous.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                               John Kerry\n\n       Dear Friend. We have only 24 to 48 hours to try and save \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       The Republicans are trying to sneak legislation through the \n     Senate approving oil drilling and they are incredibly close \n     to winning. We have to stop them.\n       I am joining with Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) in \n     offering a critical amendment to stop this sneak attack on \n     our environment. We will fight on the floor of the Senate, \n     but we need you by our side.\n       There are seven key Republican Senators whose votes will \n     decide the future of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \n     Before they vote, we need to make sure they know that their \n     constituents are watching, and that they will not be able to \n     support drilling without anybody noticing.\n       Here are two critical steps we can take together to support \n     our amendment to protect this National Wildlife Refuge:\n       1. Join the Citizens' Roll Call. First of all, take part in \n     a massive fast-moving display of citizen support for the \n     Arctic Refuge. Sign our Cantwell-Kerry Citizens' Roll Call \n     now. http://www.johnkerry.com/RollCall.\n       To make our Citizens' Roll Call impossible to ignore, we \n     have alerted the media, environmental advocates and my fellow \n     Senators to a scrolling display of the names and home towns \n     of the roll call signers. It is posted on our johnkerry.com \n     website, where we hope to soon add your name and a running \n     tally of the number of citizens on our Citizens' Roll Call.\n       2. Bring the fight to the home states of the seven \n     senators. We need to launch emergency online advertising \n     campaigns in the home states of those seven critical \n     senators: Senator Coleman (MN), Senator Smith (OR), Senator \n     Specter (PA), Senator Martinez (FL), Senator Lugar (IN), and \n     Senators Gregg and Sununu (NH).\n       We need your help to bring our Save the Arctic Refuge \n     message home in these six states. Help us fund an emergency \n     ad campaign to make sure they know how strongly the people \n     they represent feel about protecting the Arctic. Please make \n     an emergency donation right now. http://\ncontribute.johnkerry.com/.\n       When Senator Cantwell, myself and other Senators stand up \n     in support of the Cantwell-Kerry amendment, we will have \n     powerful arguments on our side. (I have recapped some of \n     those arguments at the end of this email message.)\n       But, to win, we need to be able to report directly to our \n     Senate colleagues that massive numbers of citizens around the \n     country--and in their own states--are rising up to demand \n     that the Senate protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       That's why your immediate signature is so critical. http://\nwww.johnkerry.com/RollCall.\n       The Bush Administration and its oil industry allies want to \n     send a message that they can drill for oil wherever and \n     whenever they want to--even if it means targeting a place as \n     striking, pristine and irreplaceable as the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       They don't care about putting America on a genuine path to \n     energy independence. If they did, they'd support efforts to \n     increase energy conservation and to create clean, renewable \n     sources of energy that no terrorist can sabotage and no \n     foreign government can seize.\n       Let me be very direct with you. It is going to take an \n     immediate and impossible-to-ignore display of grassroots \n     support to stop them. That's why your decision to sign our \n     Cantwell-Kerry Amendment Citizens' Roll Call is so crucial.\n       Thank you for acting quickly on this vital request.\n                                                       John Kerry.\n       P.S. Senator Cantwell, who comes from a state in the heart \n     of the Pacific Northwest, has--at considerable political \n     risk--courageously stepped forward to join me in leading this \n     fight. We need you to help us win it.\n       Here are your save the arctic refuge talking points:\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 19 million acres \n     comprise one of the last places on earth where an intact \n     expanse of arctic and subarctic lands remains protected.\n       Drilling in the Arctic Refuge can't make even a small dent \n     in meeting America's energy needs. U.S. Geological Survey \n     scientists estimate that there is very likely only enough oil \n     to supply America's needs for six months. And oil companies \n     admit that, even that won't be available for at least 10 \n     years.\n       An irreplaceable natural treasure, the Arctic Refuge is \n     home to caribou, polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, golden \n     eagles, snow geese and more. Millions of other birds use the \n     Arctic Refuge to nest and as a critical staging area on their \n     migratory journeys.\n       Of course, the Arctic Refuge supports more than wildlife. \n     For a thousand generations, the Gwich'in people of Northeast \n     Alaska and Northwest Canada have depended on it and lived in \n     harmony with it. To them, the Arctic Coastal Plain is sacred \n     ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of our time.\n  I very much respect my colleague from Alaska, not only for his \nheroism for our country but also for his leadership on a whole host of \nissues. I very much look forward to working with my colleague from \nAlaska. I just want to respond to one point my colleague raised. He \nwent through a very eloquent statement about Alaskan interests and the \nlegislation and history with respect to this area.\n  When you read the law specifically from 1980 it says:\n\n       Until otherwise provided in law, from 1980, all public \n     lands within the coastal planes area are withdrawn from all \n     forms of entry or appropriation under the mining laws and \n     from operation of the mineral leasing laws of the United \n     States.\n\n  That was in 1980. It happened that they ended up with that consensus \nlanguage in that legislation because there was not consensus about what \nought to happen with respect to the ANWR area. Today we are in exactly \nthe same place.\n  I suggest to my esteemed colleague from Alaska that we are having \nthis debate on this floor today as part of the budget reconciliation \nmeasure because we have not yet as a country been able to come to a \nconsensus on how exactly to treat the area 1002. If we had moved \nforward in a manner that would have arrived at a consensus which they \nanticipated might have been arrived at when they wrote the legislation \nin 1980, we might be in a different place today. But we are not there. \nThere is still an absolute lack of consensus on the part of this Senate \nand the people of the United States about how we ought to move forward \nwith respect to area 1002.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, had the Senator been there, he would \nunderstand, as I have said, that Senator Jackson and Senator Tsongas \nsaid we will go ahead when the Congress and the President approve the \nenvironmental impact statement. Section 1003 spells that out. The land \nis not available for gas leasing until we act. That is true. But it is \nnot wilderness, either. It is not refuge, either. That is the \ndifference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to continue with the \ndiscussion about the wilderness and designation within the refuge. \nSenator Stevens certainly defined it during his comments, but I think \nit is worth a few minutes so people understand what ANWR is, what the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is.\n  It is this colored section up on the northeastern part of the State. \nIt is an area in total of 19.6 million acres. It is an area the size of \nthe State of South Carolina.\n  Within the refuge itself, there are three different designations. You \nhave down here in the orange the refuge itself, which is about 10 \nmillion acres. You have the wilderness designation area here, which is \n8 million acres. Then up here, you have the reserve area, as Senator \nStevens has indicated, that portion, the 1.5 million acres that was set \naside for the purpose of study for exploration of potential oil and \ngas.\n  When we talk about ANWR, there is, I think, a confusion. The Gwich'in \npeople, who are referred to as living within ANWR, are separated by a \nmassive mountain range, the Brooks Range, which is here. They are down \nhere in this section of the refuge, nowhere near the Coastal Plain. The \n1002 area has been specifically set aside.\n  It is important that we talk about the specifics within the refuge \ndesignation, and recognize that as far as wilderness goes, those areas \nthat are set aside for wilderness will not be subject to any kind of \nexploration activity. The area within the refuge will not be subject to \nany exploration, or any production activity. It is only this area up \nhere. It is within this area here that we\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nare talking about exploring on 2,000 acres. Out of the total area the \nsize of the State of South Carolina, we are looking at a coastal plain \nabout the size of the State of Delaware. And within that size of the \nState of Delaware, we are talking about 2,000 acres, or literally the \nsize of a medium-sized farm in South Dakota.\n  It helps to put it into perspective when we are talking about oil \nexploration on the northern plain.\n  I want to focus my comments tonight on three areas: energy security, \neconomic security, and environmental security.\n  Senator Stevens touched on the energy security component, recognizing \nwe are currently 58 percent dependent on foreign oil; that we here in \nthis country are waiting to see what the OPEC nations are going to do \nand how that will affect us and our economy.\n  This dependence is expected to pass the two-thirds mark within 20 \nyears. This is a threat to our national security. We are in a position \nto do something positive. We need to recognize that by moving forward \non the domestic level to produce our own resources--our own oil--we can \nmake a difference.\n  There have been those who have suggested that the amount of oil \npotential up in the Coastal Plain is miniscule; that somehow or other \nit is not worth it to explore and to drill in this region.\n  Let us talk a little bit about what is there for us in terms of the \nresources, the jobs that can be created, and the economic benefit with \nthe potential we have in ANWR right now.\n  To suggest this amount of oil is not going to help us in this country \nis akin to suggesting that all of the oil we receive from east Texas \nisn't worth it because it is not able to sustain this country, it is \nnot able to give us the energy independence we need. That is a \nridiculous argument.\n  Putting into context where we are getting our oil right now, if we \nare 50 percent accurate with our projections of the potential in ANWR, \nwe are looking at a million barrels a day going into our pipeline. That \nis about 25 years worth of oil that we currently receive from Saudi \nArabia. Twenty-five years worth of oil that we are receiving from Saudi \nArabia is equivalent to what we could expect out of ANWR, if we are \nhalf right on our projections.\n  To suggest somehow this is not something we should do because there \nis not enough there is not an argument that makes sense. Giving up \nANWR's likely oil is like saying we as a nation should never have \nbothered opening up the Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska because Prudhoe \nwould only supply us with 3 years' supply of oil. In fact, Prudhoe has \nprovided America up to a quarter of our domestic oil supply for the \npast 28 years.\n  With our recovery methods, when we thought initially Prudhoe was \ngoing to be recovering 35 percent of our oil, we are now up to a \nrecovery rate of about 65 percent. To suggest that the amount is \nminimal is not being realistic.\n  Let us talk about the economics in terms of our ability to stabilize \nour energy crisis: generating more than $30 billion in Federal revenue, \nprobably several billion dollars within 4 years of opening of ANWR.\n  Talking about our deficit, as we are dealing with the budget, it \nwould reduce our payments of deficit--the remainder of our payments of \ndeficit--because we are not going to be buying as much oil overseas. \nLast year alone, we paid nearly $166 billion for oil overseas. That is \na quarter of our trade deficit.\n  When we talk about $30 billion-plus a year, it is important to \nAmerica. The jobs will come. We keep talking about hundreds of \nthousands of jobs, but the fact is when we produce domestically, \neverybody benefits. The jobs across this Nation will increase.\n  The other economic benefits, the reason that organized labor is \nsupporting us, the reason the farmers are supporting us on opening \nANWR, is it stabilizes everything, from the cost of planting in the \nspringtime to the thousands of products that are made from oil, whether \nit is antihistamines, cosmetics, or compact disks, or heart replacement \nvalves. The list goes on and on, to recognize the economic benefit to \nus as a nation of opening ANWR. American farmers last year lost $6.2 \nbillion of income because of higher fuel and fertilization costs.\n  We recognize we have an opportunity here to make a difference. To \ndownplay it and say, Well, it is only so many months' worth of oil, or \nit is not enough to make a difference--again, if you would suggest the \noil we have received from Texas for these many years is not \nsignificant, if you would suggest the oil we have received, 20 percent \nof our domestic supply from the North Slope from Prudhoe Bay, is not \nsignificant, we have to put all of this into perspective.\n  You have energy security. By producing more of our energy needs here \nin the country, you have economic security that ANWR brings.\n  We also have the environmental side. My colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle have talked about the caribou and the effect on the \nenvironment. I live there. My family lives there. I am the last person \nin the world who wants to see my State spoiled. I want to make sure \nthat what we do when it comes to development is going to be done in \nbalance with our environment. We figured out how to do it up there. We \nhave been perfecting the Arctic engineering up north for 30 years.\n  We have seen a tenfold increase in the central Arctic caribou herd \nsince Prudhoe Bay was opened 30 years ago. Our wildlife studies show \nthat several herd species have grown. Polar bears were mentioned. With \nthe science and the technology we have, we use infrared sensing, and we \npinpoint where the bears are denning so we do not go near them.\n  There is a sensitivity to the environment that we pay attention to. \nWe are using 3D and now 4D seismic technology so we know where to \nexplore. We are using underground directional drilling that allows us \nto put the plug in and explore out 3 or 4 miles in every direction so \nwe are not disturbing the surface. We have decreased the size of the \npads 70, 80 percent over the past 30 years.\n  What this picture shows is an exploration rig that is connected not \nby road but connected by ice roads. It was described earlier by Senator \nBennett. This road will disappear in the spring. This pad that this \nexploration rig is sitting on disappears in the spring. What is left is \na plug, a cap, in the ground.\n  I need to make a quick comment about the spills that have been \nmentioned by a couple of my colleagues. What they do not mention is \nthat the companies up North have to report all spills, all spills of \nany nonnatural occurring substance, whether this is a spill of \nsaltwater or anything that is more than a gallon of oil or chemical \nsuch as lubricating oils or hydraulics. The vast majority of oil spills \nat Prudhoe Bay have been saltwater used in water floating to enhance \noil recovery, not oil spills.\n  In 1993, one of the worst years for spills at Prudhoe Bay, there were \n160 reported spills, nearly 60,000 gallons of material, but only 2 \nspills involved oil, and all but 10 gallons were in secondary \ncontainment structures and were easily cleaned up.\n  We know we have to do it right up there. It is a fragile environment. \nIt is an environment that we know we must care for. But look at what we \ndo in Alaska with the toughest environmental safeguards anywhere in the \nworld. I challenge anyone, anywhere, to come up with more stringent \nstandards when it comes to development. Alaska will beat them every \ntime.\n  I suggest that we need to be global environmentalists. If we are not \ntaking the oil from ANWR, we will still need it elsewhere. If we do not \ntake it in an area where we know we are going to monitor it and do it \ncorrectly, it will come to us from across the water, from Russia, from \nVenezuela, from Africa, where they did not care for their environment. \nTo use the phrase of some on the other side, think globally but act \nlocally. This is a perfect example of where we need to do just that.\n  I look forward to the rest of the comments from my colleagues and \nfurther debate tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the other side have, and how much \ntime do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 16 minutes 37 seconds, and \nyou have 16 minutes 48 seconds.\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And now the time goes to the Democratic side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. I have \nsent an amendment to the desk that I am offering to strike the language \nfrom the budget resolution the reconciliation instructions to the \nEnergy Committee that assume Arctic drilling. Specifically, under the \ninstructions, the Energy Committee must report legislation by June 6 at \nthe latest that produces $2.7 billion in revenue from 2006 until 2007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We object to the amendment. It is not in order. There \nis a consent decree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has been advised we cannot accept \nyour amendment right now without unanimous consent.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. We had a unanimous consent order earlier to agree to \ndebate the amendment, and I thought it would be wise to put the \namendment on the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I objected, but I understand this is a \nmotion to strike the ANWR provisions, and we have no objection. That is \nbusiness.\n  Is that correct, Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized \nagain. The amendment has been sent to the desk and the clerk will \nreport.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I hope you have no objection, but tomorrow at 1 o'clock \nyou might object to the amendment, but thank you for allowing us to lay \nit down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n     Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 168.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure that legislation that would open the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge, other federal lands, and the Outer \n   Continental Shelf to oil drilling receives full consideration and \n   debate in the Senate under regular order, rather than being fast-\n tracked under reconciliation procedures; to ensure that receipts from \nsuch drilling destined for the federal treasury are fairly shared with \nlocal jurisdictions; and does not occur unless prohibitions against the \n                   export of Alaskan oil are enacted)\n\n       Strike Section 201(a)(4).\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thought for the benefit of my \ncolleagues we would lay that down tonight so people could understand \nthe amendment and we could continue debating it in our time this \nevening and continue debating it tomorrow. I hope that clarifies issues \nfor my colleagues.\n  I start by saying a word to the Senators from Alaska because I think \nboth Senators from Alaska have been diligent in their concerns for this \nissue, in their advocacy for making sure the issues they would like to \nrepresent are heard in this debate, and that the accuracy of \ninformation provided is correct. I certainly applaud them for that. \nBut, I certainly don't diminish the difference of opinion we might \nexpress tonight as it relates to where this country should go on an \nenergy policy.\n  I believe our energy policy must be very aggressive in creating a \nfuture for new energy technology and renewables, in making a \ndownpayment on getting off of our overdependence on foreign oil, and, \nspecifically in continuing to diversify off of our country's dependence \non oil in general.\n  I may have a different opinion about what I think our energy strategy \nshould be. If the last generation of Americans were smart enough to put \na man on the Moon, this generation of Americans ought to be smart \nenough to get off our overdependence on foreign oil. But that assumes \nwe would pass an energy bill that would outline these policies and that \nwe would have a debate about them. We have been trying to have this \ndebate, and we certainly have had disagreements about what the policy \nshould be.\n  For the last couple of years, I have expressed concern over our \ncountry's overfocus on fossil fuels, the fact that 60 percent of the \nincentives in the Energy bill have focused on fossil fuels. And I think \nwe should start incentivizing other types of energy supply and move \nahead.\n\n  That is why I find this particular process to be an end run on energy \npolicy and energy discussions. In fact, I think it is somewhat absurd \nthat we can simply mandate the opening of ANWR by putting language in \nthe budget, by simply saying: Let's put the revenue in the budget, and \nby doing that, we will then start the process for legislating that ANWR \ncould be opened.\n  The reason why that is so bothersome to this particular Senator--\nthink, for example, if in the next budget we put revenue in there \nexpediting timber sales in our National Forests or basically expediting \nthe leasing off the coast of Florida for oil production. Or, God \nforbid, why don't we put revenue in the resolution recognizing oil \nleasing in Yellowstone National Park, even though it is a National \nPark? Why don't we do this process by continuing to put revenues in the \nbudget resolution?\n  Well, I think the energy debate deserves far more attention than \nsimply sticking language in the budget resolution demanding the Energy \nCommittee report a bill capture this revenue. I think that is what \nother people have started to see about this proposal. In fact, the New \nYork Times recently ran a story about this, the refuge drilling, and \nbasically pointed out:\n\n       Others who advised Mr. Bush on his energy plan said \n     including the refuge was seen as a political maneuver to open \n     the door for more geological promising prospects off the \n     coasts of California and Florida.\n\n  So my first question is, If we don't stop this now, where does this \nstop in the future? I ask my colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, if today you are going to allow the opening of ANWR by \nsimply putting language in the budget requiring that we produce \nrevenue, where will you go next? And clearly, I do not think the \ndiscussion of opening up leasing off the coast of Florida or the coast \nof California or even in ANWR belongs in the budget resolution. I do \nnot think we should legislate in the budget resolution. To me, the \nprocess of having this debate now is very bothersome. But I understand \nthere are some who will continue to push this until they find a way to \nmake this proposal a reality.\n  I do not think anybody can say our side of the aisle cannot be \nconcerned about this type of tactic. I simply say, we should vote for \nmy amendment tomorrow and turn this proposal down and start a real \ndiscussion on the energy bill.\n  The senior Senator from Alaska, I know, is very concerned that this \nnot be referred to as a wilderness area. He is right. It is a wildlife \nrefuge. He is right. It is a wildlife refuge. It is not a wilderness \narea. One of my colleagues would like to make it a wilderness area, the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and he has proposed \nlegislation to do that. We have had that debate, too. We have had that \ndebate about as long as we have had this debate about whether we should \nopen up ANWR to oil drilling.\n  The fact of the matter is, in 1980, section 1003 of the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act specifically prohibited oil \nand gas development in the entire refuge or the leasing or development \nleading to the production of oil and gas from the range unless \nauthorized by Congress. So that is what we are here debating: unless \nauthorized by Congress.\n  I have given you my reasons why I do not think we should authorize on \nthe\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nbudget resolution this significant of an action without discussing \nenergy policy and the impacts of opening up ANWR on the refuge.\n  I personally think there are many things we should be doing to attain \nour energy future. I think there are many policies that would be far \nmore interesting to us as a country because a lot of people are trying \nto argue that we should do this now because it is an energy supply and \nit is national security.\n\n  Well, I can tell you, this Senator, along with my fellow west coast \nSenators, is outraged over the price of gasoline in America. We are \nfrom a State such as Washington, where we have four refineries, we are \nthe closest to the supply that you could get, and yet we have some of \nthe highest gasoline prices in America.\n  So what this Senator would like to see--just as I have forced and \npushed, and will continue to speak out on market manipulation of \nelectricity prices--I believe we should do our homework and make sure \nwe are holding those responsible accountable as to: Why do we have this \ndiversity of gasoline prices when there is so much available supply \nright in our backyard?\n  I know the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, has asked for \ninvestigations into these high gasoline prices, and threatened to hold \nup various nominations over the issue. I have certainly put questions \nto various members of the Department of Energy, the Department of \nJustice, and to our own State's Governor, and will continue to do so, \nbecause I think the price of gasoline is outrageous.\n  This particular Senator is not a supporter for opening up the SPRO. I \nagree, we should have energy for energy security, an energy supply. I \nthink people have made that point and made it well. But I want to see \nus continue to diversify into other areas. So this Senator will join \nthe Alaska Senators any day of the week to talk about the development, \nthe delivery, the execution, and expedited access to Alaska natural \ngas. We need to have natural gas. If there is any proposal that \ndeserves an expedited review by this body, it would be to get that \nproduction to the United States at a faster rate.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, when security was a national debate in \nthe 1970s, when we were all at the gasoline line filling up our cars, \nwaiting, with the most absurd price for gasoline, America took notice. \nAmerica took notice of those gas prices and said: What are we going to \ndo about it? And we had an aggressive plan to get off of our dependence \non home heating oil. We realized the price of oil was so expensive that \nit was not smart for America to continue a policy of investing in that \nas a delivery source of energy. Now, decades later, we have reduced our \ndependence on home heating oil 35 percent. We got the natural gas. We \ngot the necessary supply. We got it to where people needed it. And we \nmade a major shift in America. We took the prices that were facing us \nand we acted with the certainty about the future we wanted to see in \nAmerica, with a cleaner source of energy supply.\n  So first on my list would be making sure we have the North Slope \nnatural gas pipeline project moving. We certainly heard today from a \nvariety of people about renewable fuels.\n  I should say, by the way, people talk about the drilling in the \nArctic, and we don't know for sure, but economically recoverable oil \nmight be somewhere between 3.2 and 5 billion barrels. That is generally \nwhat people think. Well, there is at least 35 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas available. So that is the energy equivalent of 6 billion \nbarrels of oil.\n  We could continue to look at renewable or nonpetroleum fuel, such as \nethanol made from crops, something the other side of the aisle has also \nsupported, and look at requirements for renewable content of gasoline. \nThat would be about 5.1 billion barrels by 2013--again, a source of \ncleaner energy that would be important for us in an energy plan.\n  We can invest in new technology to convert agriculture waste to oil, \nsomething some States are doing on a much smaller scale. But we could \nproduce as much as 4 billion barrels of a cleaner product on an annual \nbasis.\n  I certainly am a fan of making sure that CAFE standards are passed by \nCongress. If you think about the CAFE standards and fuel efficiency, \nthat would help us. We could save 60 billion barrels of oil over the \nnext 50 years.\n  Why are we not focusing on that in our proposal for an energy plan? \nJust making sure the tires of our transportation system are properly \ninflated and educating America on the oil savings of that simple action \ncould save 200,000 barrels of oil per day. Yet we are out here \ndiscussing a proposal that has been discussed for years, with much \ncontroversy and much concern because of what it focuses on--first, a \nrefuge wildlife area that was set aside and preserved, and a focus on \noil that some of us, including myself, are saying we need to diversify \noff of.\n  I could go through other examples of renewable technologies, of \nenergy efficiency technology that could continue to save the equivalent \nof another 4.9 billion barrels of oil--something that I know would make \ngreat progress with the building and development sectors of our country \nas they add efficiency improvement, and install renewable technologies \nand distributed generation. But that is the kind of leadership I think \nwe should be talking about. We should not be talking about whether we \nwant to go and open up this wildlife refuge.\n  If I may, I know my colleagues have put up a few pictures. I would \nlike to put up a few pictures of the area as well because I think when \nthe area was first established as a wildlife refuge, people recognized \nthe uniqueness of the coastal region. The government looked at it as an \narea to support wildlife and sustain their migration patterns. We have \nheard a lot about that for the last several years, the caribou and \ntheir migration habits. I never thought the Senate would become such \nexperts on the migration habits of the caribou, but I think both sides \nof the aisle have expressed quite a bit of knowledge. I am simply \noffering a few pictures of the wildlife that resides on the coastal \nplain of the refuge. The reason I am showing these photographs is to \nremind my colleagues and individuals that we have choices, and we have \noptions like this refuge drilling proposal that we have debated before, \nand it is fine to debate them. What I object to is the process of \ntrying to essentially stick authorizing language on a budget bill. That \nis a bad precedent and it is trying to limit discussion on an issue \nthat was never intended to be considered in this way without the Energy \nCommittee and the Energy Committee debate.\n  Now, I know some people have talked about the supply of oil we might \nget from the refuge. I think that New York Times article was very \ninteresting in the sense that it said:\n\n       Even the plan's most optimistic backers agree that any oil \n     from the refuge would only meet a tiny fraction of America's \n     needs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the Democratic side has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds so I may \nfinish up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues as we continue this \ndebate to think about this proposal and the fact that we ought to be \ntaking ourselves in a different direction, and this proposal will not \nprovide us the leadership for an energy future that we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes forty-two seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had two Senators who wanted to speak. \nI have not spoken yet. Would the Senator from Tennessee like to speak \nfor, say, 4 minutes?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Why doesn't the chairman take the time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will try to leave some time for the two of you. \nTomorrow morning, we have a total of 45 minutes before the vote, \nstarting somewhere around 9:45. If you don't get your time tonight, \nmaybe you can call and see how much time you can have then.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest that the distinguished Senator who just \nspoke said she was outraged because the price of gasoline was so high \nin her State. I might say to the distinguished Senator, if she is \noutraged today, I don't know what she is going to be 3\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nyears from now because if we don't start doing something, as President \nReagan once said, ``you ain't seen nothing yet.'' That is what I am \ngoing to tell the Senate and people of this country about gasoline \nprices.\n  Let me also suggest that for those who think we are going to solve \nthis problem with an investigation to see whether there is price fixing \nor something like that, let me suggest that is not going to happen. \nThat has been looked at before. The truth is, this great United States \nof America has made a gigantic blunder, and we don't know how to get \nout of it. Certainly, one way to get into it deeper is to take a piece \nof America, like this 1.5 million acres which is supposed to be \nexplored for oil and gas--and keep that kind of property closed and not \nproduce crude oil.\n  Let me assure everybody here that there is no one who knows how to \nget off of crude oil very quickly. In fact, I don't think anybody knows \nhow America will ever be off of oil as a means of transportation and \nfor many other things. I hope we get an energy bill that provides \nconservation. I hope Americans start driving small cars. I hope we have \nhybrids. But for now, I say to my good friend from Colorado, every \nsingle suggestion that anyone has about how we can reduce our \ndependency ought to be adopted.\n  If you think we ought to conserve, conserve. If you think we ought to \nproduce more crude oil, produce it. None of these potential solutions \nare going to be enough because we are now struggling over the fact that \nwe are importing so much crude oil. I heard a Senator say today that we \nmight consider ANWR if we were collapsing.\n  Well, we won't know when we are collapsing, but we are pretty close. \nRight now, we are importing about 58 percent of the crude oil from a \nworld that is in trouble, where some countries are fragile, and war \nmight occur in others, and here we go along our merry way importing \nmore and more oil. Petroleum imports are expected to reach 69 percent \nin the year 2025. Then we get a chance to produce 1 million barrels a \nday, and we are immediately confronted with those who say that is not \nvery much. Why do we want to produce a million barrels of oil? Well, \nyou know, this great United States is consuming 20.5 million barrels of \noil a day and is currently only 11th on the scale of the most reserves \non down the line. We are 11th from the top in the amount of oil \nreserves we have in our country. That is almost insignificant compared \nto Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia ranks first in proven world oil reserves \nwith 260 billion barrels. However, our reserves are only about 21.9 \nbillion barrels.\n  I say to my good friend from Tennessee, the 1002 area we are \ndiscussing is estimated to have about 10 billion barrels of oil--that \nis very probable. Just do the arithmetic. Our country's entire oil \nreserves amount to 21.9 billion barrels. This area in ANWR will produce \n10 billion barrels. Insignificant they say? Add the two together and we \ncould have 31 billion barrels in reserves. Again, this property will \ncomprise 10 billion barrels of it. That is one-third of the reserves of \nAmerica that will be up there in Alaska, and we are being told it is \ninsignificant. That is like saying all the oil we have in America is \ninsignificant. Why don't we close Texas down? That must be \ninsignificant. It must be insignificant because we buy it from the \nworld. As long as the world can supply it, I guess we are going to have \nto keep on arguing about ANWR. If there are not any more ANWRs around, \nI don't know what we are going to look to.\n  I can tell you this. ANWR, with the potential for 1 million barrels \nof oil a day, will be the most significant onshore production capacity \nof any potential new onshore area in the United States--a brand new \none. ANWR is by far the most promising site for onshore oil in the \nUnited States. You might say, since I learned that ANWR is so little, \nmaybe America doesn't have much oil, and we should just not worry about \nhaving any.\n  I do not think so. I think we better do everything we can and must \nproduce as much as we can.\n  There are so many facts indicating that we are pursuing a path of \neconomic arrogance--we are absolutely refusing to face reality. Every \ntime we discuss this issue someone will come and talk about another way \nto use less oil, but not to produce more here in America.\n  I repeat, if you implemented every potential solution that everybody \nis suggesting, our tremendous Nation would be in terrible jeopardy for \nthe next 25 to 50 years. We already are. America, as a powerhouse in \nthe world for good and for freedom, is totally in jeopardy because we \nhave not decided that we are going to move in a direction of diverse \nenergy sources and where we can produce our own.\n  It is so critical, in my opinion--and I say to the new Senator from \nColorado--I predict that in your first term as Senator, we will be in \nthe shale oil of Colorado again. We will be there with terrific \nresearch and experimentation saying can we convert that shale to oil \nbecause there sits oil in abundance. But you have to convert it. We \ntried it 30 years ago, but oil was not expensive enough. We are in such \na bind, we will even look at that.\n  Canada will produce oil from tar sands in abundance because we have \nto find some way to lessen our dependence while we make a transition to \nsomething else.\n  I have been on the Budget Committee since a year after the Budget Act \nwas written. I regret to tell my colleagues that everything that is \nused in the budgeting of America--I am going to use a terrible word--\nwas invented by me. It was invented by me and my staff. The first \nreconciliation ever used, we used it. It was a total argument about \nwhether it was right or wrong. We won on the floor and said it was \nright. Every year we would use reconciliation, there would be an \nargument about whether it was right.\n  Reconciliation does not mean the bill that is adopted pursuant to it \nor voted pursuant to it is automatic. It still has to get 51 votes, and \nit still has to be signed by the President. So for those who think this \nis an easy way to get through the process without any of the \nlegislative and executive input, they are mistaken. But conversely, if \na Budget Committee says we need additional revenue and we would like \nthe Energy Committee to furnish us with new revenue and then gives the \nEnergy Committee an instruction that says produce new revenue, for \nexample produce revenue that flows about like this: 400 million, 600 \nmillion, 2 billion in each of these years, that is what the Senate \nvoted on when we pass a budget.\n  The instruction comes to the Energy Committee and it says ANWR \nreceipts will produce a certain amount of money, therefore write a bill \nin response to that order. The reconciliation process then, produces \nthat amount of revenue. That is absolutely legitimate. That is what the \nBudget Act has been used for in the last 27 years.\n  I regret to say there are some who do not think that is how \nreconciliation ought to be used, but they lost that argument a long \ntime ago. That is long past. The Senate wrote an act and we are living \nwith it. I have already told them over 50 times in the past 20 years: \nYou said this was a way to avoid filibuster. You said this was a way to \navoid prolonged debate. Now we are using it. That is what we are doing \nhere. There is absolutely nothing that says it cannot be done.\n  Whatever questions you have about what else might be done, we will \ntake them up in their proper time, and if they come up, they come up.\n  This one we already did. We sent it all the way to the President as a \nreconciled bill, and then President Clinton vetoed it after it was \ndone. If the President had signed the bill, oil from ANWR would \ncurrently be flowing and our dependence on foreign oil would be much \nless.\n  So it seems that these letters being circulated by Senator Kerry and \nPresident Jimmy Carter, those very activist environmentalists, will \nhave nothing to talk about tomorrow when we win this, and 4 weeks from \nnow when we produce the bill. They have to understand, we have been \ntrying for 24 years. A filibuster means we have to have 60 votes, \nunless there is a procedure which permits us to do otherwise.\n\n  I say to my friend, the Senator from Colorado, this is not simple, \nnor is it profound. It is very cumbersome. There is a lot to it, but it \nis absolutely proper. It means that if this million barrels of oil a \nday is important enough, we\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nwill do it with a simple majority, but we still have to have a \nmajority. We will put it in a bill, it will go to the President, and if \nthe President wants to sign it, he will sign it. If he does not, it \nwill not become law.\n  I do not think we ought to be accusing anybody about doing this in a \ntricky manner or in some untoward way because such is not the case. It \njust is not the case.\n  Tomorrow I will talk, for those who want to listen, about why we will \ndo so little harm, if any, to the environment, and why there is no \nproject, including Prudhoe Bay, that we can go see that shows what this \nis going to look like with new technology. There are none. It is \nabsolutely so different from what we have ever done before that it is \ngoing to be amazing.\n  I close by saying those of us who went to Alaska saw a production \nfacility called Alpine. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, did \nnot go with us. I wish he had. The 96 acres of land at Alpine had upon \nit the entire oil production facilities--the oil wells, not one but \nseveral so close together that it looked almost like a row of outhouses \nat a public park. Each outhouse has a well in it--that is how little it \nwas--an oil well. Each oil well had six or eight wells underground.\n  I will show one of those tomorrow. That little 96 acres had no roads. \nInstead, ice roads were built in the winter that simply melt away in \nthe summer. In the summertime, there are no roads to it because they \nhave melted. The facility produces 120,000 barrels of oil a day because \nunder that little piece of property are wells that go down 7,000 feet, \nfind the oil, and go up 4\\1/2\\ miles and drain the field. There is \nanother one that goes down, and there are five new wells sprout out \nfrom under it, and coming out of the wellhead is 3,000 to 4,000, 5,000 \nbarrels a day from one well. They have been getting that for a long \ntime.\n  It seems to me that it is rather ironic that we are all here talking \nabout a crisis. We are suggesting it is not a big enough crisis to \nworry about a million barrels a day. We are also suggesting that we \nought to do other things. This Senator has been here a while. First, \nthis is the proper way to do it. Second, if anybody has another \nproposal for a million barrels of American oil, let's have it. It would \nbe tremendous if we had a few more. If anybody knows how to conserve \nand pass through Congress a measure that would cause us to conserve 2 \nmillion or 3 million or 4 million barrels a day, put it on the table. \nIt is not that if we did that we do not need this. We need them both.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice today in support \nof the amendment offered by Senator Cantwell. This amendment would \nstrike the instruction to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \ncontained in the budget resolution premised on opening the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development and enacting the \nPick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program cost recovery proposal set forth in \nthe President's Budget for fiscal year 2006. I would like to address \nboth of these issues.\n  First, I have concerns regarding the Pick Sloan cost recovery \nproposal. Although I have not had an opportunity to thoroughly review \nthe proposal, I am advised that it could result in significant rate \nincreases for power users in rural areas of the Upper Midwest and the \nGreat Plains. The instruction assumes that the provision would increase \nrevenues by $33 million in fiscal year 2006 and $157 million over the \nnext 5 years. If the committee should choose not to enact the Pick \nSloan cost recovery proposal, we would be obligated to find these \nrevenues elsewhere. Given the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee, our \noptions are few. We have only limited mandatory spending within our \njurisdiction. We have jurisdiction over imposition of fees for the use \nof public lands. Administration of oil and gas leasing on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and the revenues raised from opening areas currently \ncovered by moratoria is within the jurisdiction of the Energy \nCommittee. Similarly, the President's budget contains a proposal to \ndivert revenues from southern Nevada land sales, which falls within our \ncommittee's jurisdiction. All of these are likely to be controversial. \nThe best way to ensure that the Pick Sloan cost recovery proposal is \nnot enacted as part of budget reconciliation legislation and the only \nway to avoid finding an offset is to support the Cantwell amendment to \nstrike the instruction, and I think that is clearly the preferred \ncourse of action at this juncture.\n  Turning now to the Arctic Refuge, there are many reasons--related to \nboth energy security and environmental concerns--that lead me to \nconclude that I cannot support oil and gas leasing and development in \nthe Arctic Refuge.\n  The most compelling reason for not opening the Arctic Refuge is that \nit will do very little, if anything, to further our national energy \nsecurity. If opened, not one drop of oil will come from the Arctic \nRefuge for 7 to 12 years. The most recent Energy Information \nAdministration, EIA, study, ``Analysis of Oil and Gas Production in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge,'' March 2004, assumes that production \nwill not occur for 10 years. According to EIA, peak production will not \noccur for another 10 to 11 years after initial production. Thus, we \nwill have to wait for 20 years before having the benefit of maximum \nproduction from the Arctic Refuge. Drilling in the Arctic Refuge does \nnothing to address near-term shortages or issues of energy security.\n  More importantly, drilling in the Arctic Refuge does not address our \nreliance on imported oil. The United States relies on imports for 58 \npercent of its current oil supplies. The Energy Information \nAdministration in March 2004 has estimated that production from the \nArctic Refuge would, at its peak, reduce our reliance on imports by \nonly 4 percent by the year 2025, based on the mean estimate of \ntechnically recoverable resources.\n  Unlike other future-looking initiatives that we could undertake now, \ndrilling in the Refuge would over the long term have no effect on \nreducing imports, once the oil resources in the refuge have been \ndepleted. Unfortunately, the controversy over the Arctic Refuge diverts \nattention from the real opportunities to enhance domestic energy \nproduction. Last Congress, we enacted energy tax legislation that I \nbelieve is a good start in addressing our Nation's energy future. \nUnlike opening the Arctic Refuge, this legislation is intended to \nprovide a near-term increase in domestic energy production. Not only \ndoes the legislation include tax provisions that would promote highly \nefficient hybrid vehicles and alternative transportation fuels such as \nethanol, make renewable energy more competitive, and enhance energy \nefficiency, it would also provide specific incentives to increase oil \nand gas production at home. In particular, I am pleased that we were \nable to pass the marginal well production tax credit. It is my hope \nthat this year we will be able to expand upon the energy tax package \nthat was enacted last Congress and do even more to provide for our \nNation's energy security.\n\n  Environmentally sound development of the National Petroleum Reserve--\nAlaska provides another opportunity to enhance our domestic energy \nsecurity. This is 23.5 million acres of Federal land set aside by \nPresident Harding to secure the Nation's petroleum reserves for the \nnational security. The area is highly prospective for oil and gas. BLM \nconducted lease sales in 1999, 2002, and 2004 that had an extremely \nhigh level of industry interest. Several wells have been drilled that \nhave encountered oil and gas. The NPRA is estimated to hold a mean \nvalue of 3.1 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil at $24 per \nbarrel and a mean estimate of 9.3 billion barrels of technically \nrecoverable oil. While I believe that BLM should take all measures to \nconduct leasing in an environmentally sensitive way, and also am of the \nview that there are areas of NPRA that should not be developed, the \nvast majority of this resource can and should be tapped to enhance our \nenergy security.\n  Renewables, energy efficiency and R must play an increased role in \nmeeting our Nation's energy needs. Clean energy from renewable sources \nsuch as the sun, the wind, the ocean, geothermal heat and biomass helps \nto diversify our energy portfolio and enhance our energy security with \nminimal environmental impact.\n  In addition, a rational energy strategy should focus on cost-\neffective ways to reduce energy demand, not solely on increasing \nsupply. Energy efficiency\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nprovides an array of benefits--economic growth, national security, \nreliability and environmental protection. Our growth in demand, each \nyear, for automotive fuels far exceeds any potential new domestic oil \nproduction. That includes any production from the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, even if we were to open it and even if the Arctic \nRefuge has more oil than anyone thinks is likely. Because of that \nreality, Congress needs to take a serious approach to increasing the \nfuel efficiency of our new cars, trucks, and SUVs. We cannot talk \nseriously about loosening our dependence on foreign oil without \nadvancing meaningful improvements in automotive fuel efficiency.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, there are many reasons why the coastal \nplain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge need not and should not be \ndrilled for oil and gas. The environmental sensitivity of this area is \nwell-known. Opening the Arctic Refuge is not good environmental policy, \nbut equally important to our Nation, it is far from necessary to our \nenergy policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to oil and gas leasing \nand development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  Our dependency on foreign oil is now over 11 million barrels a day--\nit is rapidly moving towards 20 million barrels a day. This is \nimportant. Let's assume our dependence will be 19 or 20 million barrels \na day by 2025. The oil produced at ANWR would represent about 5 percent \nof what we need to import from foreign sources. That is a lot.\n  I close by saying 1 million barrels of oil a day equals $18.4 billion \na year in balance of trade dollars. We talked about the merchandise \ntrade balance. Currently, 25.5 percent of this country's merchandise \ntrade deficit is from net imports of crude oil and petroleum products. \nEverybody is worried about it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for an additional 30 seconds, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We worry about China bringing in all this, but almost \n26 percent of the balance of trade is pure oil. We can stop the \nimbalance with China and continue to buy oil, and we will have a trade \nimbalance that is still going up, and we will be wondering whether we \nneed a million barrels of oil a day from an area that is supposed to be \nexplored that some do not even want to allow us to look at. I believe \nthe time has come. I hope it is tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  There will now be 1 hour of debate evenly divided in the usual form \non an amendment relating to veterans, to be offered by the minority. \nWho seeks recognition?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 149\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 149, which is at \nthe desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the budget resolution fails veterans. It is \njust that simple. I am pleased to stand with my colleagues who joined \nme in offering this veterans' health care amendment, which adds $2.85 \nbillion for VA health care.\n  While I largely agree with the President on the overall amount needed \nfor VA health care, I take issue with how he chooses to fund the \nsystem. The administration's approach is to ask veterans to pay more \nfor their care via increased copayments for medications and a new user \nfee for middle-income veterans. Our approach, instead, asks for \nappropriated dollars. Real money for real veterans' health care needs.\n  I remain unclear about whether sufficient funding was included to \ncompensate for these proposals.\n  Our amendment would add $2.85 billion to the resolution. How was this \namount derived? I stress that nearly all of these amounts come directly \nfrom the President's own budget. According to the administration's own \nnumbers, VA needs $1.4 billion just to cover medical care inflation and \nautomatic salary adjustments for health care workers. The level in the \nbudget resolution before us does not even come close to covering that \namount.\n  Additionally, VA requires funding to absorb new patient workload, \nfrom new veterans returning home from both Operations Iraqi and \nEnduring Freedom and from older veterans who are just now turning to \nVA.\n  The amendment also provides funds to allow for modest increases in \nmental health and prosthetics. Again, these numbers follow those sent \nforward by the President. While it is broadly acknowledged that VA \ncould do much more in these areas and others, we recognize that the \nbudget climate is tight. Mental health and prosthetics must receive at \nleast modest increases if we are to truly fulfill the promises we made \nto these men and women when they were sent to war.\n  The only new cost that was not included in the President's budget--\nand therefore the budget resolution--is funding to allow middle-income \nveterans to enroll with VA for care. In January of 2003, the President \ncut-off\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nenrollment to middle-income veterans. To date, 200,000 veterans have \nbeen turned away. This amendment provides the money to make the system \naccessible to all who have served. It is simply wrong to exclude any \nmen and women who have served our country from VA services, especially \nat a time of war.\n  While some of my colleagues will argue that the President's budget is \na good one for VA, I would like to share some of the comments of the \nveterans service organizations. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, with its \n2.4 million members, say that:\n\n     it is clear that the proper funding of veterans health care \n     is not an Administration priority.\n\n  The Disabled American Veterans has characterized this budget--and \ntherefore the budget resolution--as:\n\n     one of the most tight-fisted, miserly budgets for veterans \n     programs in recent memory.\n\n  Similarly, my colleagues will argue that the President has done more \nfor VA health care than any President in recent memory. I would \nclarify, however, that Congress, through this amendment process, which \nhas increased veterans health care spending year after year.\n  Mr. President, I implore you and my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to recognize the great need that exists for veterans' health \ncare.\n  I will take time later to discuss more of this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 23 and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this very hour, veterans in my home \nState of Washington and throughout the country are waiting for the \nhealth care they were promised. They are facing understaffed and \novercrowded VA hospitals and clinics. They are dealing with paperwork. \nThey are dealing with redtape. They are not getting the service they \nwere promised.\n  At this hour, veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and other \nconflicts are waiting for appointments to see a doctor, waiting for \nprescription drugs, and waiting for help with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. While they are waiting, new veterans are coming home from \nIraq, from Afghanistan, and they need health care, too.\n  Every day the system is getting more and more crowded. The waiting \nlists are growing longer. We have to do something about it. These brave \nmen and women were there for us. We have now got to be there for them. \nThey answered our country's call, and now we have to do our part. That \nis why I am on the floor tonight with Senator Akaka, offering an \namendment to increase funding for veterans health care by $2.85 \nbillion.\n  I am here today with a simple message, which is displayed right here \non this chart: Congress needs to keep its promise to America's \nveterans. We need to honor their service and their sacrifice, and we \nneed to fund health care now. I received many letters from veterans \nthroughout my State with this simple plea: Keep our promise to \nAmerica's veterans. Fund health care now.\n  Let me say, we have a lot of work to do. If we follow the budget \nPresident Bush proposed last month, we will force veterans out of the \nVA system, we will force veterans out of nursing homes, we will force \nveterans to pay more in fees and copayments, and we will force veterans \nto wait even longer for the care they have earned.\n  As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran, as the first \nwoman in history to serve on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and \nas the voice of more than 700,000 brave veterans in the State of \nWashington, I cannot let that happen.\n  I have been fighting for veterans for many years. In fact, just last \nweek in the Budget Committee I offered an amendment to boost funding \nfor VA health care. Do you know what some Senators told me? They said: \nWe have already increased funding for veterans plenty, so we don't need \nanother dime for veterans health care.\n  They are wrong. That is not what the veterans in my home State are \ntelling me.\n  I want every Senator to know that how you vote on this amendment is a \ntest of how committed you are to helping America's veterans. With this \nvote, we are going to find out who is serious about helping our \nveterans and who is just talking.\n  With this vote, every Senator will have to announce publicly whether \nthey are making life better for our veterans or whether they are making \nexcuses. I am here to say let's do the right thing. Let us support this \namendment and keep the promise to those who have served.\n  For those veterans who are following this debate tonight, let me \nrecap where it stands.\n  This month, Congress is deciding how much money to spend on \npriorities such as veterans health care. So far, we have only had two \nchoices, and one is to follow President Bush's approach. He offered a \nbudget that will impose higher fees and copayments on many veterans. It \nwill lock the doors of VA to thousands of veterans. It is no wonder \nthat veterans organizations from coast to coast have denounced that \nbudget proposal.\n  Last week, the Senate Budget Committee organized its own budget \nproposal. I serve on that committee. I was part of that debate.\n  The Republican proposal got rid of some of the onerous fees in \nPresident Bush's budget, but they refused to increase funding for \nveterans to meet their needs.\n  I tried to improve that bill in committee with the Murray veterans \nhealth care amendment, but the Republicans blocked my funding and \npassed an inaccurate budget on a party-line vote. Now that flawed \nbudget is here on the Senate floor, and we have one more chance to make \nit right.\n  That is why I am here tonight offering this amendment with Senator \nAkaka. Our amendment says let's fund veterans health care based on real \nneeds.\n  We know what the needs are because over the past few weeks, the \nNation's largest veterans service organizations came before the Senate \nVeterans Affairs Committee, the committee on which I serve. Leaders \nfrom AMVETS, the Disabled Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars, all told us what they need. \nThey are not asking for special treatment--just what they were promised \nin exchange for serving our country. They told us that veterans are not \ngetting the help they need. They told us what would happen if we \nadopted the President's budget.\n  For me, veterans health care is a very personal issue. My father \nserved in World War II, and he returned as a disabled veteran. During \nthe Vietnam war, I interned in the Seattle VA hospital. I know \nfirsthand the scars and the wounds that burden our veterans when they \ncome home.\n\n  During the gulf war, when our soldiers were coming home with gulf war \nsyndrome, I brought the VA Secretary out to Washington State so he \ncould hear from veterans what I was hearing.\n  Over the past 2 years when President Bush tried to close the doors at \nthree VA hospitals in Washington State, I worked with veterans and \ncommunity leaders from across our State to keep those facilities open. \nI continue to press the VA to open new community clinics in north-\ncentral Washington and in Whatcom County to help our veterans who today \nhave little access to VA services.\n  When it comes to VA's health care budget, it has been a battle every \nyear to get the funding we need. Every year, the President has proposed \na small number for veterans health care, and every year we in Congress \nhave stepped in to protect our veterans.\n  I have been convinced for a long time that we need to move VA health \ncare out of the annual budget process. That is why I have sponsored \nlegislation to make VA health care funding mandatory, so it is always \nthere no matter what type of budget games are going on.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority has blocked that commonsense \nproposal every year.\n  So the fight goes on. That is why we are here tonight. This year's \ndebate started on February 2 when the President unveiled his budget \nproposal.\n  Veterans of Foreign Wars looked at his proposal, and they said:\n\n       If the President's budget were approved, waiting time for \n     basic health care appointments would again skyrocket, \n     returning us to the era of the six-month waiting period.\n\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n\n  That is what the commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nsaid about the President's budget.\n  The President's budget would force more than 2 million veterans to \npay a $250 annual fee just to get VA health care. In my book, if you \nserved our country, if you have already paid your dues, it is insulting \nto nickel and dime America's veterans.\n  The President's plan would also double the copayment for prescription \ndrugs for thousands of our veterans. It would slash prosthetics \nresearch by $9 million.\n  The President's budget would eliminate thousands of State-run nursing \nhome beds. In my home State alone, 300 veterans who honorably served \nthis country would lose their place in a State nursing home. That is \n300 Washington State families being asked to shoulder a new burden, and \nthat is just wrong.\n  The President's budget would cut the VA workforce by more than 3,000 \npeople while there is a backlog of more than 700,000 claims. That just \ndoes not make any sense.\n  We have a huge backlog of claims, with new claims coming in every \nday, and now there will be fewer staff to process. That is wrong.\n  The President's budget would also continue to ban some veterans from \ncoming to the VA for care. So far, under this flawed policy, nearly \n200,000 veterans have been turned away, including more than 3,100 \nveterans in Washington State.\n  That is what the President proposed. I have been working with others \nto fix that.\n  I have to tell you that it has been very frustrating. No one in this \nadministration is willing to say how we are going to take care of our \nnewest veterans, when they have waiting lists for existing veterans.\n  I asked the President's budget director on February 9: Where is the \nmoney in your budget to take care of our newest veterans and our \nexisting veterans? I didn't get an answer. So on February 15, I asked \nthe Veterans Secretary. I didn't get an answer from him. So the next \nday, I asked the Defense Secretary, but I didn't get an answer from him \neither.\n  So I offered an amendment in the Senate Budget Committee last week. \nMy veterans amendment was defeated on a party-line vote of 10 to 12.\n  So tonight I am here on the Senate floor with Senator Akaka with a \nsimilar amendment. And now every Senator is going to have to go on the \nrecord either for or against our veterans.\n  During this debate, you are going to hear Senators say that we have \nraised funding for veterans plenty. Other Senators are going to suggest \nthat we are meeting the needs today. I am going to refute those claims \nline by line. But let me say this first: When veterans tell me they are \nbeing left behind and politicians tell me everything is fine, I will \nbelieve the veterans every time.\n  With that said, I want to look at some of the claims the other side \nwill make.\n  One of the arguments you are going to hear from the opponents is that \nappropriations for veterans medical care grew by 63 percent from fiscal \nyear 1995 to fiscal year 2004. That claim is inaccurate because it \nleaves out three critical facts.\n  First of all, the number of veterans who have served has gone up \ndramatically over that same period of time, as this chart shows. During \nthe same year, the number of unique veterans getting care from the VA \nhas increased by 88 percent.\n  It is nice that the funding has gone up, but it is nowhere close to \nmeeting the number of veterans who are getting care at the VA.\n  Second, the Republican claim is inaccurate because it ignores the \nimpact of medical inflation.\n  As this chart shows, over the same timeframe they are talking, \nmedical inflation has shot up 92 percent, so the increases we have had \nso far have not even kept up with medical inflation. It is great that \nveterans funding has increased over the years, but it has not even kept \nup with inflation.\n  There is another problem with this excuse that we do not need this \namendment, because every day, as each of us knows, new veterans are \ncoming back home and seeking care at the VA. If the number of veterans \nwas going to be stable in the coming years, it would be one thing, but \nwe all know the number of veterans will keep growing as soldiers come \nhome from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Washington State alone has sent thousands of brave men and women to \nIraq and Afghanistan over the past several years. Now a large group is \nreturning home, including 4,000 members of the National Guard. This is \nthe next generation of veterans.\n  Congress needs to provide more funding if we are going to keep up \nwith the growing needs. So we are going to hear some of the opponents \nclaim that veterans funding has gone up 63 percent so veterans do not \nneed any more. But when we hear that claim, we need to remember the \nnumber of veterans in the VA system has gone up 88 percent. Medical \ninflation has gone up 92 percent. And we are creating new veterans \nevery single day who need a strong, stable VA to take care of them.\n  Here is another excuse we will hear from the opponents. They will say \nthe VA is sitting on nearly $500 million. VA officials in Washington, \nDC, may well be holding back money to see what next year may bring, but \nthat does not mean the funds are not needed at VA hospitals and \nclinics. Veterans health networks are already experiencing shortfalls. \nAs a result, the committee has heard that outpatient clinics have \nstopped seeing even the poorest of patients, sending them hundreds of \nmiles away to other facilities.\n  I am hearing from veteran leaders in my region that the VA is not \nmoving forward with new clinics in Whatcom County and north central \nWashington because all those dollars are needed for medical care for \nexisting veterans.\n  If the VA is sitting on funds we have appropriated, I want those \ndollars moved out to help veterans as we intended. It is not an excuse \nto block this amendment.\n  We may also hear opponents claim this budget increases veterans \nfunding by about $900 million. But when you look at the numbers, the \nincrease in medical care is less than $80 million.\n  I have a chart that was produced not by us but by majority staff on \nthe Committee on Veterans Affairs. I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record after my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have heard some opponents say we \nshould not provide another dime in the budget for veterans health care \nbecause we do not know how the Appropriations Committee will spend that \nmoney. I serve on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and I serve on the \nVeterans Appropriations Subcommittee. If the Senate passes our \namendment, then the Appropriations subcommittee will have explicit \ninstructions that this money is to be spent on veterans health care. \nBecause I serve on all the committees involved--Appropriations, \nVeterans' Affairs--I will be there at every turn to remind my \ncolleagues of the promise we made.\n  This amendment is also about making sure our military is strong \ntoday. How we treat our veterans affects our ability to recruit the men \nand women we need to serve in our Armed Forces. That is nothing new. It \nhas actually been true since the founding of our country. On the chart \nbehind me I have a quote from George Washington in 1789. Washington \nsaid:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  That was President George Washington in 1789.\n  We have an opportunity tonight with this amendment to do right by our \nveterans and to keep our country strong. This amendment will help meet \nthe growing needs and will ensure that we keep the promise to those who \nhave answered this country's call. They were there for us when we \nneeded them, and we need to be there for them.\n  With this amendment offered by Senator Akaka and myself and many \nothers, every Senator will have to decide if they are voting for \nveterans or against them.

How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the fact that VA \nhas so much money that they expect to carry-over nearly $500 million to \nnext year, as Senator Murray said.\n  I urge all my colleagues to touch base with the veterans at home and \nfind out if the VA is really swimming in money.\n  VA's health networks are already experiencing shortfalls. Let me \nshare some more specifics.\n  The Boise facility is facing a $1.8 million deficit. This facility, \nlike so many others, has a hiring freeze. The facility has seen a \nworkload increase over 7% for FY 05, but there will be staff \nreductions. And at present there is no money for staff education.\n  Veterans in need of treatment for PTSD or addiction treatment will \nhave one less place to go due to the VA budget. The Psychiatric \nRehabilitation Program at the Chillicothe VA hospital is being shut \ndown.\n  Thirty nursing home beds at the VA hospital in Manchester, NH, will \nnot be opening. VA officials expect to save $1.3 million by not opening \nthese beds.\n  As my good friend, Senator Collins, has pointed out, the hospital in \nTogus has a projected $14 million deficit. This Maine facility has a \nhiring freeze and cannot replace equipment.\n  At the Louisville, KY, hospital veterans undergoing a cystoscopy must \nlie on a broken table during the procedure. It's been almost a year \nthat this medical table has been broken--but the VA can't replace it \nbecause they have no money. The facility's only endoscope is broken, \nand the facility cannot afford a back-up.\n  Also at the Louisville, VA, elective surgeries have been cancelled \nbecause of lack of staff due to funding.\n  So, again, the administration--the same administration putting \nforward the budget--is holding back $450 million.\n  Perhaps they are holding onto this money because they know that the \ncoming year may be horribly tight if the President's budget is made a \nreality.\n  But the VA facilities which are serving veterans need more funding.\n  During the Clinton years, the Clinton administration, a Democratic \nadministration, proposed actual cuts in a veterans budget. In 1998 and \n1999, they proposed those cuts. What did Congress do? Did it accept the \nbudget? Of course it did not. It said: No, Mr. President, you may \npropose, but we will dispose. And we did. And we plussed up those \nbudgets dramatically.\n  Not once in the past 4 years has the Bush administration proposed \ncuts in veterans budgets. They proposed substantial increases. Once \nagain, Congress came along and said: Mr. President, we don't think \nthose are quite adequate. And we plussed them up. In the course of the \nlast 4 years, we have seen relatively dramatic increases in veterans \nbudgets. Are they necessary? You bet they are necessary.\n  Here is a perfect example of the medical care budget. From 2001 to \n2005, we went from $21 billion to nearly $30 billion. What did we get \nin return? More veterans being served. And we now have what is being \ncalled the finest health care delivery system in the United States.\n  This Congress ought to be darn proud of it. And we are. That is what \nwe are going to sustain in the budget this Congress will adopt this \nweek.\n  What did we do in other benefit areas? We did in the general \nmandatory areas exactly the same kind of thing. We looked at the budget \nin 2001. It was $25.7 billion. By 2005, it was $37.1 billion. \nNecessary? You bet it was necessary. As a result of that, we were able \nto expand the capacity of the Veterans' Administration to serve \nveterans. And that is what we are about. So that has resulted in the \ngreatest increase in veterans spending in the history of this country, \nto serve a truly needy and necessary population. We have had a 43-\npercent increase over 4 years, better than a 10-percent increase.\n  My colleague from Washington said: Yes, but numbers increased. You \nbet they did. They went in the area of enrollment from 4.9 million to \nover 7.7 million, and all during that time the quality of health care \nwent up. We served those in need. We served those in the right \ncategories. And, most importantly, we increased the timeliness of the \nservice to the veterans. As a result of that, we also produced quality \ncare.\n  Well, I have to tell you that when the President proposed his budget, \nthere were areas of it I was not satisfied with. Some of my colleagues \nwere not satisfied with it. The ranking member was not satisfied with \nit. And we proposed to make some changes. We are going to see an \namendment offered in a few moments that makes those changes, an \namendment offered by Senator Ensign, myself, Senator Vitter, and \nSenator Hutchison that will add another $410 million of budget \nresolution to the health care services.\n  When that is done--the committee has already added more than that--\nfor the 2005 budget we will have moved that well beyond its area. We \nwill have seen an increase of 3.7 percent. An additional $1.2 billion \nwill be provided, and it will be a tremendous amount for incentives in \nfunding. There will be no reconciliation order. That is new money. That \nis real money in the Veterans' Administration.\n  We do not raise taxes. We do not raise taxes on working veterans such \nas our Democrat colleagues do to serve veterans. We believe the budget \npie is big enough to reach in and pull out another $1.2 billion to meet \nthe necessary services we are about to do.\n\n  My colleagues are going to go into greater detail in a few moments to \ndo so. But what is important about it? We said no to enrollment fees. \nWe said no to copayments as they relate to prescription drugs. We did \nnot think those were necessary at this time. Most importantly, the \nVeterans Committee, after hearing from all of those service \norganizations, as my colleagues have mentioned, recognized not only the \nneed of current day veterans, but coming out of Iraq there is a whole \nnew class of veterans. And they, too, have to be served. They are \ninjured and impaired in unique ways, and they will have to have health \ncare and service, in\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nsome instances, for the rest of their lives from this Government and \nthis country which recognizes the kind of services they did and have \ncontinued to perform.\n  So not only no copays for prescription drugs, and no enrollment fees, \nwe have done something else. There is another layer of service out \nthere to veterans that oftentimes we do not talk about. It is because \nit is not as visible. But home in our States it is visible; that is, \nthe State veterans homes where the State government and the Federal \nGovernment share. This year it was proposed that we reduce the per diem \npayment at the Federal level. In my State of Idaho and across the \nNation we would have found truly needy veterans without the kind of \ncare that we think is necessary, and we said: No, Mr. President, we \ndon't think at this time we ought to be doing that. Yes, budgets are \ntight. Yes, you proposed reasonable increases in a variety of areas. \nBut what is most important is that we serve the veterans we are serving \ntoday, we add to the enrollment when we can, and we make darn sure we \nare doing the right things for those veterans coming home.\n  Our veterans homes across the Nation provide over 20,000 beds. In my \nState it is 268. It is important in my State and across the Nation that \nwe plus those up where we can and recognize the true need.\n  There are a good many other areas I could cover that are included in \nthe President's budget. The President recognized the unique need for \nprosthetic care and as a result added $100 million to it, focusing on \nthe truly injured veterans coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan. We \nrecognize that and recognize that portion of the budget and add to it \nto strengthen it.\n  So a lot of work has been done. My colleagues on the other side, I am \nsad to say, would suggest there is never enough. This is a tight budget \nyear. We all recognize that, but we ought not try to cut the budget on \nthe backs of the veterans. And we are not doing that. A plus-up of $1.2 \nbillion without reconciliation orders in this budget is a significant \nincrease, one we can all be proud of, one that services our veterans, \nas it should, and services those who are in true need today.\n  Mr. President, can I ask how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 21 minutes 50 \nseconds left.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me stop at this point and yield to my \ncolleague from Nevada for the purpose of the offering of an amendment, \nfurther discussion on this important issue of veterans funding, and \nthen I believe we will be joined by my colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, to further discuss this before we close out for the evening. \nBut I believe we can turn to the Senate tomorrow and ask them to vote \non a very responsible veterans budget as proposed by the Senate.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Ensign.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 171\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Craig, Senator Vitter, and Senator Hutchison.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. \n     Craig, Mr. Vitter, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 171.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose to increase Veterans medical care by $410,000,000 in fiscal \n                              year 2006.)\n\n       On page 22, line 16, increase the amount by $410,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 17, increase the amount by $369,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 21, increase the amount by $37,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 25, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 15, decrease the amount by $410,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 16, decrease the amount by $369,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 20, decrease the amount by $37,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 24, decrease the amount by $2,000,000.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are proposing an amendment today that \nwill increase the spending on our veterans in this budget by $410 \nmillion this year. Some may ask: Why not the amount that the Democrats \nhave proposed? Well, first, we are in tight budget times. And we are \nconsidering this amendment without raising taxes. We are taking the \nmoney out of the State Department and foreign aid budgets instead of \ntaking the money out of the pockets of hard working Americans who are \ntrying to make a living, trying to provide for their families.\n  We can never spend as much money as the Democrats. There is no \nquestion about that. Every single time we offer an increase in this \nbudget, the Democrats will try to outbid us. We understand that. We \naccept that. We are trying to be fiscally responsible, at the same time \ntaking care of our veterans and not increasing taxes on working \nAmericans.\n  In the Democratic amendment, there is a $6.6 billion tax increase \nover the next 3 years--$6.6 billion in new taxes. That is one of the \nmany amendments they are going to offer on this budget that will \nincrease taxes. Of that, $2.8 billion goes for veterans care next year. \nBut $6.6 billion in new taxes.\n  Senator Murray from the State of Washington talked about some of her \nveterans and the problems with some of her veterans. Nevada has \nexperienced some of the same problems. Nevada is the fastest growing \nState in the country.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is not the amount of money we are \nspending, but rather the manner in which we are spending it. By that I \nmean that veterans are moving away from the Rustbelt to faster growing \nStates like Nevada. A large number are moving to the west coast. A lot \nto the Sunbelt States. They have chosen to move, but a lot of the VA \nfacilities are still located in the Rustbelt.\n  Because of the way Congress works, Senators and Representatives work \nhard to keep a lot of money in their States, even though the veterans \nhave moved away. So while States such as Washington and Nevada may have \nVA facilities that are packed to the gills, there are some VA \nfacilities that have 20 to 30 percent occupancy in their beds. Frankly, \nsome of them should be closed. This President has, with the CARES \nCommission, proposed reallocating some of the funds so that the \nveterans with the greatest needs will get the care they deserve. Our \namendment recognizes that you cannot do this overnight. So we recognize \nwe have to increase spending on veterans care. We have to keep our \npromise--the promise we made to the men and women who don the uniform \nof the U.S. military and say: I will lay my life on the line to protect \nyour freedom. All our veterans ask in return is that we take care of \nthose who come home with medical needs. This amendment is about keeping \nthat promise to our veterans.\n  I thank Senator Craig, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nHe has done great work on behalf of veterans across America. We really \nowe him a debt of gratitude for the work he has done. This is just the \nopening chapter, I believe, in ensuring that every veteran gets the \nkind of quality medical care they deserve. We have to look at the whole \nVA system as we are transforming it, to make sure we best spend the \ndollars so that veterans will get the quality care they need. As a \nresult of veterans coming home from the war, we are going to have to \nexamine their needs. As we determine those needs, we may have to spend \nmore. If we have to spend more, I know this body will step up to the \nplate and do what is necessary to take care of those heroes who fought \nfor our freedom.\n  The $410 million in our amendment will restore funding to maintain \nthe prescription copays at $7 for veterans. It also restores funding \nrequired to prevent the imposition of a $250 enrollment fee on \nveterans. This amendment restores funding required to stop the scale \nback of State nursing home per diem payments made by the VA.\n  It adopts the President's request to spend an additional $100 million \nfor mental health services.\n  Many of our homeless veterans are homeless because of mental health \nissues. The President has proposed another $100 million, and this \nbudget will\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nnow meet that. We also adopt the President's request to spend an \nadditional $100 million for prosthetics. With all the veterans who have \nbeen wounded in the war, we are going to need at least that much. Next \nyear, we may have to spend even more than that.\n  We also adopt the President's request for other nonmedical \ndiscretionary accounts, allowing for a $116 million increased funding \nfor construction, an increase in disability claims, caseworkers, and \nthe continued expansion of the National Cemetery System, the largest \nsuch expansion since the Civil War.\n  Mr. President, I believe strongly that we must keep our word to our \nveterans, and we must take care of those men and women who have \nsacrificed so much while wearing the uniform of the U.S. military. This \namendment helps keep the promise we have made to our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \namendment. I believe it is responsible and appropriate, as we plus up \nthis budget, to assure that the veterans are adequately served and that \nwe adjust appropriately for the new veterans coming in from Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Now I yield to the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified at 7 \nminutes so that I can yield back the remainder of the time to Senator \nCraig.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is notified \nthat there is a little over 6 minutes left.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, please notify me when I have used 4 \nminutes. I thank Senator Craig, the chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, and Senator Ensign, a member of that committee. I chair the \nVeterans' Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. It happens that today we \nhad our hearing on the Veterans Affairs Department, and Secretary \nNicholson came before our committee and talked about what is in the \nbudget. He said, of course, we have full coverage for the priority 1 \nthrough 6 veterans. We have full coverage in the budget for the injured \ncoming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. And we all know that the growth \nin the veterans medical care area has been in the other priority \nveterans, Nos. 7 and 8. These are people who do not have combat-related \ninjuries and people who are in upper incomes. When they became covered \na few years ago, really, it was thought by Congress that there would \nnot be a big surge to get the Veterans Affairs coverage because they, \nwe thought, had private insurance. But, in fact, that has been the big \nsurge in medical care coverage for veterans, in those 2 categories, 7 \nand 8; and 15 percent of those do not have private coverage.\n  So what we are doing with this amendment is we are saying we are not \ngoing to change anything right now. We are not going to have copays, \nand we are not going to have enrollment fees. But I did talk to the \nSecretary about making sure that if there is private insurance, that \nthat insurance would be the first payer in a veterans health care need; \nthat the private insurance payer would pay first, and Veterans Affairs \nwould come second so that we could recoup some of the money that could \nbe going into serving other more needy veterans and try to also keep a \nbalance in the budget. That is what we are trying to do. We are trying \nto increase what is in the budget, and we will do that in this \namendment.\n  We are, most certainly, going to try to do it in a way that will not \nharm any veteran at all. We are not going to have copay increases. We \nare not going to have enrollment fees, and we are not going to have a \nreduction in the per diem payments for nonservice-connected veterans in \nState veterans homes. So we are trying to do the right thing, while \nalso whittling down the deficits we are facing in our country.\n  I think Senators Craig and Ensign have a very good amendment. We are \ngoing to do the right thing for veterans always. We will be able to \nassure coverage this year with this added $400 million, and we will be \nable to come back in next year, if we need more.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention one other area before I turn the \npodium back over to Senator Craig. It is something we will more fully \ndiscuss tomorrow. I wanted to lay down the marker that we will have an \namendment to increase the number of border patrol in this budget. I am \nvery concerned about the reports from our FBI Director Mueller, who \ntold Congress that people from countries with ties to al-Qaida are \ncrossing into the United States through our Mexican border.\n  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary James Loy, recently said that \nintelligence reports say that Al-Qaida is looking at the Mexican border \nas a way to put people into the United States for the purpose of \nterrorist attacks. So I think we must increase the budget coverage \nabove the 210 border patrol agents who have been added in the budget \nbefore us. We need to increase that to at least 1,000. Our intelligence \nreform bill said that we would have the capability to increase border \npatrol by 2,000 per year for the next 5 years. I am going to try, \nthrough an amendment, to increase that to at least 1,000, and we will \ndo it without busting the top line of the budget.\n  We think it is very important that we stop people from coming over \nour borders illegally. We know we are vulnerable in this Nation right \nnow. We know we need more places for detention, more Border Patrol \nagents, and better technology to secure our borders to the south and \nthe north. These Border Patrol agents will go throughout the United \nStates to the Border Patrol centers.\n  My amendment will be sponsored by Senator Cornyn, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Feinstein. These are Senators from border \nStates who know the problems of illegal immigration firsthand.\n  It is a very important amendment that we will discuss more fully \ntomorrow, but I hope our colleagues will start thinking of ways that we \ncan assess the priorities and determine that we need at least a \nthousand Border Patrol agents in this year's budget and another \nthousand next year. But we will do 1,000 at a time, I hope, because \nthat is what can be absorbed, that is the number that can be trained in \nany 1 year.\n  I hope we will address the Border Patrol issue tomorrow, and I \ncertainly hope that when we have the competing veterans amendments that \nwe will take the Craig-Ensign-Vitter-Hutchison amendment that does keep \nin mind the priorities of our budget, but also increases the amount \nthat will be for medical care for our veterans and will not require any \nhigher copays or registration fees for any of our veterans at this \ntime.\n  I yield back my time to Senator Craig.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what is the time remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is notified \nthat the Parliamentarian informed the Senator of the wrong time. The \nSenator now has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will close. I think the Senator from \nWashington has time left that she would like to use.\n  I think every Senator who comes to the floor of the Senate to speak \nabout our veterans is committed without question to assuring to the \nveterans community of this country that we will honor their needs. It \nis our responsibility.\n  I happen to disagree with the Senator from Washington. I do not think \nwe need to raise taxes to meet the necessary needs at this time. \nVeterans are hard working, too, and they pay taxes. But there are \nadditional moneys necessary from what were moneys proposed by the \nPresident, and that is exactly what this amendment does, along with the \nadditional plus up that the committee itself has accomplished.\n  When the Ensign-Craig-Vitter-Hutchison amendment is adopted, the net \nincrease will be over $1.2 billion of new money for the Veterans \nAdministration to spend. What do we do with that money? I mentioned we \nadd $100 million for VA prosthetic care. We look seriously at those who \nare tremendously injured in body, but we also recognize that there may \nbe veterans injured not of body but of mind, and mental health programs \nare increased.\n  The Ensign-Craig amendment to the budget resolution will mean an \nadditional $100 million can be devoted this year to expanding treatment \nand services in mental illness for America's veterans who suffer PTSD \nas a result of their service in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\n  Also, the budget proposes $43 million to ensure that veterans who \nseek emergency care in non-VA facilities are treated exactly the same \nas if they had sought care at a VA facility. Clearly, across my large \nexpansive State of Idaho--it is true of the State of Washington--we \ncannot have a veterans hospital or a care center in every community, \nand yet veterans live there and emergency care is sometimes necessary. \nWe assure that they can enter that emergency room door and be treated \nprior to moving on to a veterans care facility.\n  Finally, this budget with the $410 million added by the Ensign-Craig-\nVitter-Hutchison amendment will provide $19 million for the treatment \nof homeless veterans. That may sound like a small amount of money, but \nit will bring this program up to the $100 million level and help us \nbuild on gains we have already made in reaching out to this incredibly \nvulnerable population of veterans.\n  I can stand on the floor of the Senate tonight with the offering of \nthis amendment, as chairman of the Veterans Affairs' Committee in the \nSenate, working with all of my colleagues and assure them that all of \nthose gains we talked about earlier that we all share, we recognize, \nand we are proud of, whether it be in mandatory spending or whether it \nbe in health care, are gains that will be sustained by this budget in \n2006, that we can build on the strength of those gains and assure that \nveterans who are in the categories of 1 through 6 will be truly served.\n  Those who have service-connected disabilities or problems in other \nareas will be served. We recognize that the 20,000 veterans' home beds \nacross the States will remain open and available to veterans by not \nbringing down the per diem. This is a sincerely responsible budget to \ndeal with America's veterans' needs as we have always done as a \nCongress and as we will continue to do in the 2006 budget and into the \nfuture.\n  A tight budget year? You bet it is. Need we be fiscally responsible? \nYou bet we should be. Should we raise taxes on the working men and \nwomen of America to accomplish that? No, we should not. What we should \ndo is exactly what we are doing tonight: reestablishing priorities \nwithin the overall budget and saying here is an area of true need and \ncare, a responsibility that we have to address, and we are open, \ncaring, and responsible in addressing it.\n  I am proud to serve as chairman of the committee. I am proud to work \nwith my colleague from Texas who is the chairman of the appropriating \ncommittee. With the combination of all of us in a very real and \nbipartisan way, we are going to meet the needs of veterans as we always \nhave, and we are going to meet them with a budget that represents a \n3.7-percent increase over last year.\n  In as tight a fiscal year as we are in, that is a large and \nresponsible and sensitive increase of which I am proud.\n  I will yield the floor, and we will be back tomorrow to debate this \nimportant issue as we ask our colleagues to support us in this effort. \nI do believe when we look at all the facts and figures, when we look at \nthe 43-percent increase in veterans spending over the last 4 years, \nwhen we see the increase of veterans going out and the quality of \nhealth care going up and the efficiencies that we have asked the system \nto produce--and it has produced it--then this is in itself a truly \nresponsible and caring budget, and I am proud to be a sponsor of it \nalong with my colleagues.\n  We will ask the Senate to support us in this effort. I yield the \nfloor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3 minutes 9 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho, who has assumed \nthis year the task of chairing the Veterans' Committee, does have a \ntrue compassion for veterans. I appreciate his work and his diligence \non this and all the work he is attempting to do to take care of our \nveterans because he shares with all of us a concern of making sure we \ntake care of those who have served us.\n  We just have a difference of opinion on the amendment that we have \noffered on this side. There are $70 billion worth of tax cuts that are \nassumed in this budget. All we are saying with our amendment is let's \nassume over $67 billion instead of $70 billion and use that amount for \nour veterans.\n  I am one who believes that when we ask our men and women to serve, we \nhave to keep a commitment to them that we will be there to take care of \nthem when they come home. It is part of the cost of war. I agree with \nthe Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, that \nwe have increased veterans care. We had to. We have more veterans. We \nhave increased it 43 percent over the past 4 years. But I remind my \ncolleagues that the number of veterans needing veterans health care has \nincreased 88 percent. Medical inflation has increased 92 percent. Even \nwith the amendment that Republicans have offered, we will not be \nmeeting the needs of the veterans, the men and women who have served \nthis country.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to do that. I believe we cannot \ntell the next generation we are asking to serve that we are only going \nto take care of 43 percent or 60 percent. We have an obligation to take \ncare of their health care when they come home.\n  The amendment offered on this side by Senator Akaka and myself will \nassure us we can go home and our tell veterans they have been there for \nus and they will not be turned away. They have served us and we should \nserve them.\n  I am one who believes the cost of taking care of veterans is a cost \nwar. It is not a cost we should pass on to the next generation. It is \nnot a cost we should ignore. It is a cost that we have a responsibility \nto take care of.\n  I commend the Senator from Idaho for his amendment. I appreciate his \nattempt to raise it. But I say we have to make sure that all veterans \nare cared for. I believe that is a cost of war and it is a cost we \nshould assume. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment that was \noffered on this side so we can make sure when we go home and face our \nveterans, the men and women who are coming home today from Iraq and \nAfghanistan will have the services they need. It is the least we can \ndo.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, amendment No. 153 is a sense of the Senate \nexpressing the importance of providing treatment to children infected \nwith HIV/AIDS. I encourage all of my colleagues to read the amendment \nand ask that they join as cosponsors to show support for pediatric \ntreatment of HIV/AIDS. This Congress must not overlook children who are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS.\n  Fortunately, Congress has realized that the transmission of HIV/AIDS \nis preventable and avoidable. We have supported funding for mother-to-\nchild transmission, which, when effectively implemented in the United \nStates, has resulted in the near elimination, less than 2 percent \ntransmission, of mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission. By contrast, in \nresource-poor settings, less than 10 percent of pregnant women living \nwith HIV have access to services to prevent mother-to-child \ntransmission of HIV. It is inexcusable for us to not do something to \ncontinue to reduce the rate of transmission between mother and child. \nWith the President's Emergency AIDS Initiative, we have certainly made \nsome progress, but there is always more to do.\n  But, we cannot stop at preventing the transmission. We have to ensure \nthat there is treatment available for children when necessary.\n  Approximately 2.2 million children under the age of 15 are infected \nwith the HIV virus, and 1,900 children worldwide are infected with HIV \neach day. To date, more than 4 million children worldwide are estimated \nto have died from AIDS. We must ensure that HIV-positive children and \nchildren with AIDS are no longer overlooked and that they begin \nreceiving the treatment and care that they deserve.\n  Few programs specifically target the treatment of children with HIV/\nAIDS in resource-poor countries due to significant challenges in \ndiagnosing and treating infants and young children with HIV. Such \nchallenges include: difficulty in diagnosing HIV in infants less than \n18 months of age; lack of appropriate and affordable pediatric HIV/\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nAIDS medicines; and lack of trained health care providers. When I went \nto Guyana two years ago, only one child--one child in the whole \ncountry--was receiving antiretroviral treatment medicine. I know that \nmore are receiving treatment now, but not many. We have to do more to \nchange that. We need to ensure that physicians and clinicians are \ntrained in pediatric care and that safe and effective medicines are \navailable to infected children who need them to survive.\n  Ultimately, pediatric treatment cannot be anecdotal. It must be \nroutine. And we should demand that it be routine. This sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment is a step in that direction. It forces us to look at \nthe facts, and it compels us to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, today I also join my friend and colleague, Senator \nLeahy, in amendment No. 161 that would increase the funding level for \nthe Child Survival and Maternal Health Program to $660 million. That \nwould be a $334 million increase over the budgeted level of $326 \nmillion.\n  This is an appropriate and necessary step. And, it is, simply, the \nright thing to do.\n  With regard to today's child survival crises, we know the facts: 130 \nmillion children entered the 21st Century unable to read or write; \n2,000 children younger that 15 each day are infected with AIDS; 650 \nmillion children live in extreme poverty; and over 10 million children \ndie each year, most from preventable causes and almost all in poor \ncountries.\n  According to UNICEF, out of every 100 children born, 30 will most \nlikely suffer from malnutrition in their first 5 years of life; 26 will \nnot be immunized against the most basic of childhood diseases; 19 will \nlack access to clean, safe drinking water; and 17 will never--ever--go \nto school.\n  How have we responded to this world of ours? How have we responded to \nthe developing world? We have seemingly come to expect, and indeed, \naccept poverty, instability, and epidemic disease as a way of life in \nthe developing world. The real tragedy is that all of it is avoidable.\n  We can do something about it. We can do simple things to save \nmillions of children's lives. Our amendment would help save lives.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to share some more statistics \nabout child and maternal mortality. I am often hesitant to recite \nstatistics here on the floor of the U.S. Senate because when we hear \nthem repeatedly, it is all too easy to become numb to them--to forget \nthe human realities that they do, in fact, represent. It is important, \nthough, for my colleagues and for the American people to listen to some \nof these statistics because they are so unbelievable and so tragic and \nrepresent so many lives that could be saved--lives that could be saved \nif we would make the appropriate amount of resources available to the \ndeveloping countries in such dire need.\n\n  Of those 10 million children who die each year worldwide, 3.9 million \noccur in the first 28 days of life. These babies don't even have a shot \nat living their lives. Yet, two-thirds of these deaths could be \nprevented if available and affordable interventions had reached the \nchildren and mothers who needed them.\n  Malnutrition contributes to 54 percent of all childhood deaths. And, \nas many as 3 million children die annually as a result of Vitamin A \ndeficiency and an estimated 400,000 cases of childhood blindness are \nreported each year.\n  According to World Health Organization estimates, at least 30 million \ninfants still do not have access to basic immunization services, and \nover 4.4 million children died from vaccine preventable diseases in \n2001--diseases such as hepatitis, polio, and tetanus. Of all the \nvaccine-preventable diseases, measles remains the leading childhood \nkiller, claiming the lives of 745,000 children--more than half of them \nin Africa. Yet, vaccine-preventable deaths could actually be cut in \nhalf by 2005 if these children were receiving proper vaccinations.\n  Recently, the Lancet, which ran a series of articles last year about \nchild survival, has launched a series of articles about neonatal death. \nHere is what the first few articles reveal: Of the 130 million babies \nborn every year, about 4 million die in the first 4 weeks of life--the \nneonatal period. In poor communities, many babies who die are unnamed \nand unrecorded, indicating the perceived inevitability of their death. \n[Also], 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable \ncauses.\n  This is unconscionable, and it is an emergency situation. There \nreally isn't any other way to describe it. Over 10 million children \ndying each year from preventable and treatable illnesses is an \nemergency.\n  But this emergency cannot be resolved through short-term, temporary, \npiecemeal assistance. If we are to make any real headway in improving \nthe health of women and children in the long-term, we need to take some \nbold and radical steps and be committed to supporting maternal and \nchild health programs not just now, but next year and the year after \nand the year after that. Our funding simply cannot be administered in a \nsingle-dose.\n\n  Our amendment would allocate additional money to help avert maternal \nand neonatal death and improve maternal health, including the \nprevention of obstetric fistulas and other types of injuries and \ndisabilities resulting from childbirth in unsafe circumstances. The \nfact is that all pregnant women are at risk for injuries and childbirth \ncomplications, which is why it is so important to have skilled \nattendants--midwives, doctors, or nurses--present at birth. Yet, only \nabout half of the world's women give birth with a skilled attendant \navailable.\n  Child survival and maternal health funding provides resources so that \nUSAID can provide training and technical assistance in infection \nprevention and quality of care, as well as needed equipment and \nsupplies to bring health facilities up to a level where they can \nprovide safe and effective emergency pre- and post-natal care. Child \nsurvival interventions work, and they are the most cost-effective tools \nwe have in the struggle for better global health. We can and should \ninvest in these programs as they increase developing countries' access \nto basic health services--services like vaccinations, immunizations, \nmicronutrient programs, and vitamin supplements.\n  If we make this investment and work toward equal access to health \ncare, we help ensure that mothers receive proper prenatal care, that \nchildren and families receive nutrition counseling and vitamin \nsupplements, and that children receive the necessary immunizations and \nvaccinations to live healthy lives. But tragically, if we fail to make \na sufficient and sustained investment in the development of public \nhealth systems that provide primary care, mothers will continue to die \nprematurely during childbirth, children will continue to die from \npreventable disease and causes, and life expectancies in these \ndeveloping nations will stagnate or perhaps even decrease. That is not \nan acceptable future for any of us.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I have come to the floor as a cosponsor on \nthe Sarbanes amendment to the budget to protect funding for the \ncommunity development block grant CDBG administered at the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development.\n  This program is crucial to the development of low income communities \nacross America.\n  As you know, the administration has proposed a plan in the 2006 \nbudget to consolidate 18 existing economic and community development \nprograms into a single program administered by the Department of \nCommerce. The HUD community development block grant program--also \ncalled the CDBG program--is the largest of those 18 programs.\n  The grants previously awarded under these 18 programs would be \nawarded in the name of a single, newly formed strengthening America's \ncommunities, SAC, grant program.\n  But when examined, it becomes clear that the President's proposal \nwill mean less assistance for low-income communities and a dismantling \nof relationships within a community development infrastructure of \npublic servants and community-based organizations that we have built \nover the last 30 years.\n  Under the proposal, the total budget for these 18 programs would drop \n30 percent from $5.31 billion in 2005 to a proposed $3.71 billion in \n2006. That means less money for home ownership, less money for economic \ndevelopment, less money for communities struggling in changing economy.\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n  To give you a sense of what that means for State and local \ngovernments, consider that in 2005 the community development block \ngrant, CDBG, program alone was funded at $4.15 billion, $450 million \nmore than the $3.7 billion requested for the total 18 programs being \nconsolidated under the new strengthening America's communities grant \nprogram in 2006.\n  That is not a consolidation of programs. It is a direct attempt to \ndismantle those programs. That is why the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nthe National Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities \nall oppose this.\n  As those groups have pointed out, the Commerce Department lacks the \ncapacity to administer the newly proposed program. HUD has 1,100 urban, \nsuburban, and rural CDBG grantees, constituting a strong infrastructure \nfor program administration. And, HUD's $4.7 billion CDBG program dwarfs \nthe Commerce Department's $257 million economic development program. \nHUD has skills and experience Commerce lacks.\n  On March 4, 2005, I wrote a letter to Chairman Gregg and Ranking \nMember Conrad supporting full funding for the CDBG and objecting to its \ntransfer to the Department of Commerce from HUD.\n  Those who are closest to the needs of low-income communities our \nNation's Governors, community based organizations in Illinois, and \nlocal government officials from Illinois have all come out in support \nof the Sarbanes amendment. They know the CDBG program works and have \nshared success stories of communities strengthened with CDBG funds. \nThey respect the public servants that administer the program, and they \nhave developed a working partnership with them.\n  In Illinois, communities large and small are making the most of this \nassistance.\n  The city of Chicago, for example, which has already seen its formula \nshare of CDBG funds reduced by $14 million over the last 3 years, has \nfocused its CDBG priorities on five specific program areas: affordable \nhousing, youth programming, health clinics, job training, and support \nservices to groups with specific needs, such as domestic violence, \nemergency food aid, and meals on wheels.\n  Let me give you a specific example of CDBG funds in action. Mujeres \nLatinas en Accion is an organization in Chicago's Pilsen community that \nserves Latinas and their families. The total they receive in CDBG funds \nboth through the city of Chicago and the city of Cicero is close to \n$170,000.\n  Mujeres Latinas en Accion depends on CDBG funds to support services \nsuch as rental assistance for program participants to prevent \nhomelessness. They also provide comprehensive services for victims of \ndomestic violence including crisis intervention, court advocacy, \nindividual counseling, group counseling, 24-hour crisis hotline, and \nreferrals to shelters. And, the group also uses CDBG funds to provide \nservices to young people promoting the development of peaceful \nrelationships, open communication with peers and family, and school \nsuccess. The goal of the program is to provide youth a variety of age \nappropriate structured activities during nonschool hours to help \nprevent teen involvement in gangs, alcohol and drug use, sexual \nactivity, pregnancy, and other problems facing adolescents in low-\nincome communities.\n  In Champaign, IL, CDBG funds have been used to help low-income \nfamilies become homeowners, make homes accessible for the disabled, \nprovide credit counseling, construct emergency and transitional \nshelters for the homeless, and provide a broad range of services to \npeople in need. A number of towns in St. Clair County, IL, are using \nCDBG funds for housing rehabilitation grants and loans for their low to \nmoderate income residents.\n  As you can see, these proposed cuts in the CDBG program affect big \ncities and smaller towns. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley wrote me that, \n``significant reductions in CDBG funds . . . would have a serious \neffect on the network of community-based organizations throughout the \ncity which rely on CDBG for their existence. A number of them would \nlikely close their doors.'' And, in the words of Eric Kellogg, the \nmayor of Harvey, IL, population 30,000, ``Many have characterized CDBG \nas the best federal domestic program ever enacted because of its \nflexibility and adaptability in meeting the needs of a diverse \nAmerica.''\n  The CDBG program works. Let's not destroy it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Sarbanes amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRIZZLIES IN THE NCAA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last September, a gay tourist was attacked outside a popular gay club \nin Hawaii. The woman was walking to the club with two of her friends \nwhen she was approached by two men. One of the men asked if the women \nwere gay.

Mr. President, the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, \nheld a hearing last week that examined the close relationship between \nRussian Federation and Syria. The Commission heard testimony detailing \ntheir intricate financial and military dealings that began in the \nearliest days of the Cold War and continue to this day. This \nrelationship allows Syria to continue to support numerous terrorist \ngroups, groups that have terrorized Lebanon for the past three decades \nand fuel the insurgency in Iraq. In addition,\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nwe heard details about Syria's support of terrorist organizations who \noperate around the world. Finally, we heard from both Lebanese and \nSyrians committed to freedom and democracy who have become victims of \nthe Assad regime and are now languishing in the prison cells of \nDamascus.\n  The Commission's concern regarding Russia's involvement with Syria--a \ncountry that has been listed as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979 \nby the State Department--rises from the Helsinki commitments that \nRussia has freely accepted as a participating State of the Organization \nfor Cooperation and Security in Europe OSCE. The OSCE Charter on \nPreventing and Combating Terrorism was agreed to at the Porto \nMinisterial in 2002. Russia then committed to refrain from instigating \nor providing active or passive support or assistance to, or otherwise \nsponsoring terrorist acts in another state. Russia also committed to \nreducing the risk of terrorists gaining access to weapons and materials \nof mass destruction and their means of delivery.\n  Russia's support for the terrorist regime in Damascus flies in the \nface of these commitments. Russia is an active enabler of the Assad \nregime, whose Ba'ath Party was described by one of our witnesses as the \nrichest terrorist organization in the region. The Syrian regime has \nreceived untold amounts of military hardware, much of which are \ncurrently being used by terrorists in Iraq against our American troops \nand our allies. Additionally, Syrian intelligence supports terrorist \nunits in Iraq, composed not only of Syrians, but including Egyptians, \nSudanese, Moroccans, and other Islamic mujaheddin.\n  Even more alarming is Russia's plan to sell an unknown number of Igla \nSA-18 shoulder-held missiles to Syria. Such a sale to this terrorist \nstate is more than criminal. This sale will put in the hands of \nterrorists some of the most sophisticated shoulder-held missiles in the \nRussian inventory, and increases the likelihood that they will get into \nthe arsenals of other terrorist organizations around the world. Despite \nRussia's denials, indicators are that this sale will go forward soon, \nputting at risk every airline flight, every military flight, with the \npotential for massive loss of life and the shutting down of modern \ntransportation around the world.\n  We must focus on the fact that, while there is no apparent direct \nRussian involvement in Iraq, this direct support of Syrian military and \nintelligence operations, coupled with Syria's support for Hezbollah in \nLebanon and the long list of evil deeds coming out of Damascus, cast \nRussia as a suspicious party to these terrorist activities. We should \nnot sit idly by and allow this to transpire without comment. We must \ncall upon President Bush and Secretary Rice to reiterate U.S. demands \nthat Russia disengage from its support of Syria, a state sponsor of \nterrorism. It is not enough to stop the sale of the missiles. Complete \ncessation of financial and military support to this rogue regime is \nnecessary.\n  On the eve of the Helsinki Commission hearing, a courageous group of \nhuman rights activists and pro democracy reformists held a \ndemonstration in Damascus, a daring display of dissent quickly broken \nup by the security forces. One of the protesters held up at banner that \nread: ``Freedom for Prisoners of Opinion and Conscience.'' According to \nthe Syrian Human Rights Committee, the Assad regime in Damascus has \nexecuted nearly 17,000 Syrian and Lebanese prisoners. Additionally, \nthere are over 600 prisoners of conscience in Syrian jails, champions \nof human rights, accountability and transparency who are still \nlanguishing under horrible conditions.\n  I would like to highlight a few of these prisoners of conscience \nwhose names were submitted to us by one of the witnesses and call for \ntheir immediate release: Riad Seif, member of parliament; Aref Dalilah, \neconomist; Maamun al-Homsi, member of parliament; Abdul Aziz al-Khayer, \nphysician; Habib Issa, lawyer; Walid al-Bounni, physician; Mohammad \nBashir al-Arab, student leader and doctor; Muhanad al-Debs, student \nleader; Mahmoud Ammo, activist; Mahmoud Abou Sader, activist; Mazid Ali \nAl-Terkawi, businessman; and Fawaz Tello, engineer.\n  I was pleased to hear of Syria's promise to a U.N. envoy to withdraw \nits troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon, but as the counter-\ndemonstrations yesterday against Syria demanded, Damascus must follow \nthrough with actions as soon as possible. I am hoping that details of \nthe withdrawal plan from U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen after his talks \nwith Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanese President Emile Lahoud \nwill allow the people of Lebanon to hold their parliamentary elections \nin May without any interference from the Syrians and to do so in a \nmanner that is free, timely, and transparent.\n  What would be unacceptable is the kind of warning issued by Prime \nMinister-designate Omar Karami that polls may have to be postponed if \nthe country's political opposition fails to enter a dialogue with the \ngovernment. Such an effort will surely ignite the kind of violence that \nthe Lebanese people have been yearning for so many years to avoid.\n  It is time for the international community to lend support for the \nslogan that defines the people's revolution in Lebanon and in the \nregion: ``Kifaya,'' which means ``enough.'' Let's listen to what the \npeople in Lebanon are saying for what they are saying is now being \nheard not only in Beirut but in Damascas, in Cairo, and in Riyahd: \nenough of autocrats, enough of the corruption, and enough of the \nrepression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2729-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2729-S2730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WINDS OF CHANGE IN ROMANIA?\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the people of \nRomania and newly elected President Traian Basescu on the success of \ntheir recent national elections, and to encourage them in their efforts \nto consolidate democracy in Romania. In the 15 years since the \noverthrow of the brutal Communist dictatorship which ruled that country \nfor decades, Romania has undertaken four successful national elections \nand peaceful transfers of power, and has made important strides in \nbuilding democratic institutions and the rule of law.\n  I was recently appointed chairman of the Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe--the Helsinki Commission--and have followed \nevents in Romania for many years. In that capacity, I look forward to \nworking with the government and the people of Romania on the challenges \nconfronting both of our countries.\n  Romania is a good friend of the United States and a strong partner in \nthe war on global terrorism. I thank the Government of Romania for its \nsteadfast support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, where a \nbattalion serves on the ground, and for its support of the U.S.-led \nmilitary action in Iraq. More than 700 Romanian soldiers contributed to \nthe efforts that supported the people of Iraq in their historic ballot. \nRomania is our NATO ally and anticipates accession to the European \nUnion in 2007.\n  President Basescu has recognized that endemic corruption and the \npoverty it breeds are a threat to Romania's national security, and his \ngovernment is already taking steps to combat this scourge and to \ninstitute effective government reform. We commend the President's \nefforts and stand ready to assist him as he shines the light of \ntransparency across Romania.\n  President Basescu's focus and determination give me hope that \nprogress can also be made on a number of matters that have been of \nconcern.\n  In 2001, Romania imposed a moratorium on all international adoptions \nunder pressure from the European Union, and amid allegations of ``baby \nselling.'' This moratorium was extended several times pending \ndevelopment of comprehensive child protection legislation to include \nnew rules on adoption. The new legislation came into effect in January \nof this year and limits international adoption to the grandparents of \nthe Romanian child--effectively ending international adoption. More \nthan 200 U.S. families were in the process of adopting Romanian \nchildren when the moratorium was established, and the Government of \nRomania indicated that it would proceed with those adoption requests \nthat were ``already in the pipeline.'' However, to date, these cases \nremain unresolved. This total ban on international adoptions is \nregrettable and means that many children in Romania will now grow up \nwithout permanent families. I\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nam particularly concerned about the over 200 adoption cases which were \nalready being processed for U.S. parents, and I urge the Government of \nRomania to resolve these cases quickly, so these children can be placed \nwith the families as promised. I also urge President Basescu to \nconsider revising existing law to allow the resumption of international \nadoptions with appropriate safeguards.\n  The Government of Romania enacted a comprehensive antidiscrimination \nlaw in 2000 and has in place a national action plan on Roma. Yet the \ngreat majority of Roma and Sinti in Romania remain marginalized, living \nin abject poverty due to severe discrimination in employment, housing, \nand education. President Basescu should take bold and concrete steps to \nensure that Romani citizens have full opportunity to participate in the \ncivil and political life of Romania. The establishment of a fund to \nimplement school desegregation would be an important step toward \nachieving that goal and would make the Romanian government's \nparticipation in the Decade of Roma Inclusion truly meaningful.\n  Following decades of denial, the Government of Romania has made great \nstrides in the past year in recognizing Romania's role in the \nHolocaust. I commend the government for taking steps to examine this \ndark and painful chapter in the country's history. The International \nCommission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania, led by Elie \nWiesel, officially issued its findings last November in Bucharest. In \naddition to the establishment of a national Holocaust Remembrance day, \nwhich Romania marks on October 12, the Commission's recommendations \ninclude the construction of a national Holocaust memorial and museum in \nBucharest, the annulment of war criminal rehabilitations, and the \nestablishment of Holocaust education curricula and holocaust courses in \nsecondary schools and universities. The government should move quickly \nto implement that Commission's recommendations.\n  In a related matter, I hope that the Government of Romania will \nfinally bring to closure the rehabilitation and honoring of World War \nII dictator, Marshall Ion Antonescu, Hitler ally and war criminal \ncondemned for the mass murder of Jews and Roma. During the past 3 \nyears, government officials publicly condemned efforts to honor \nAntonescu and removed from public land three statues that had been \nerected in his honor. One statue remains on public land in Jilava, the \nsite of Antonescu's execution, and important streets in the cities of \nCluj, Targu Mures, and Campulung Muscel continue to be named after him. \nI urge the Government of Romania to remove these remaining vestiges \nhonoring the former dictator.\n  The process of providing restitution or compensation for property \nconfiscated by former regimes in Romania has been slow, complicated, \nand difficult. Government records indicate that more than 200,000 \nclaims for property restitution have been filed by individuals, and \nmore than 7,000 claims have been filed by religious denominations and \ncommunal groups. The plight of Romania's Greek Catholic Uniate Church, \nwhich was banned by the Communist government in 1948, is particularly \ntroubling. More than 2,500 churches and other buildings seized from the \nUniates were given to Orthodox parishes. The government decree that \ndismantled the Greek Catholic Church was abrogated in 1989, however, of \nthe thousands of properties confiscated from the Greek Catholics, fewer \nthan 200 have been returned. I hope that this government will finally \ntake significant steps toward the restitution of Greek Catholic \nproperty as well as that of other religious denominations. Romania's \nfailure to return religious properties to their rightful owners 15 \nyears after Communist rule is inexcusable and, in my view, a \ndestabilizing element in Romanian society.\n  Trafficking in human beings will continue to challenge the new \ngovernment. Romania is a source and transit country primarily for women \nand girls trafficked for sexual exploitation. While the Romanian \nGovernment has made tremendous progress in its antitrafficking \ninitiatives in the past several years, there are still some areas of \nconcern including corruption within the law enforcement community, \nlight penalties for those convicted of trafficking, and proposals to \nlegalize or regulate prostitution.\n  Greater accountability is needed among members of the law enforcement \ncommunity in view of allegations that officials have assisted \ntraffickers in obtaining false passports, facilitated illegal border \ncrossings and accepted bribes to tamper with witnesses' testimony. \nTraffickers are increasingly likely to be prosecuted for their crimes \nin Romania, however, the penalties imposed by judges are still too \nlow--usually 1 year or less in prison. Penalties should be severe \nenough to reflect the heinous nature of the crime and to serve as a \ndeterrent to other prospective traffickers. Finally, it is important \nfor the government to take a firm stance against all efforts to \nlegalize or regulate prostitution. Legalized and regulated prostitution \nis a magnet for human trafficking and provides a shield behind which \ntraffickers hide.\n  While many challenges remain on the road ahead for President Basescu, \nhis new government, and the people of Romania, I am convinced that, \nworking together, they will move toward a bright and prosperous future. \nI stand ready to assist our friends in Romania in any way I can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2730-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ACTION AGAINST SLAUGHTER OF SEALS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today there will be rallies in 50 cities \nacross the world calling on the Canadian Government to stop the cruel \nand needless slaughter of seals. Animal protection and environmental \ngroups in the U.S. and throughout the world have condemned Canada's \nincreased seal hunt, which will allow sealers to kill over 300,000 baby \nseals this year alone. The hunt officially opened on Nov. 15, 2004, but \nthe bulk of the killing will begin toward the end of March, after the \nbabies have been born. They will be clubbed and shot mainly for their \nfur.\n  A recent study was conducted by an independent team of veterinarians \nwhich found that the seal hunt failed to comply with basic animal \nwelfare standards and that Canadian regulations with regard to humane \nkilling were not being enforced. The study concluded that up to 42 \npercent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive and \nconscious. The United States has long banned imports of seal products \nbecause of widespread outrage over the magnitude and cruelty of the \nhunt.\n  Our neighbor to the north is fortunate to have vast and diverse \nwildlife populations--animals that deserve protection, not senseless \nslaughter. Americans have a long history of defending marine mammals, \nbest evidenced through our Marine Mammal Protection Act. Not \nsurprisingly, recent polling shows close to 80 percent of American \nvoters oppose Canada's seal hunt, and the majority of those surveyed \nare willing to make consumer choices that will help put a stop to the \nslaughter.\n  On February 1, 2005, Senator Collins and I introduced a resolution, \nS. Res. 33, which urges the Government of Canada to end this senseless, \ninhumane slaughter. We are pleased that 18 of our colleagues in the \nSenate have cosponsored this resolution: Senators Lugar, Biden, \nCantwell, Jeffords, Dodd, Durbin, Feinstein, Johnson, Lautenberg, \nMurray, Stabenow, Dorgan, Kennedy, Reed, Schumer, Wyden, Feingold and \nBoxer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2730-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2730-S2731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING THE POPLAR BLUFF MULES\n\n Mr. TALENT.

Mr. President, every year in March we celebrate \nWomen's History Month. It offers us the opportunity to honor the women \nwho have made historical contributions to our Nation. It also allows us \ntime to reflect on their achievements, which continue to inspire us \nevery single day.\n  Today, I rise in tribute to one of these very special women. A woman \ndear to my heart and dear to the hearts of generations of Arkansans, \nwhose courage and convictions forever changed the history of this Great \nBody. That woman is Hattie Ophelia Wyatt Caraway. On January 12, 1932, \nthis Arkansan became the first woman ever elected to the United States \nSenate.\n  When we think of the life of Hattie Caraway, we think of a life \ndevoted to the family, State, and country that she loved so deeply. \nThose who knew her were drawn to her endearing sense of humor, her \ngentle and dignified manner, and her warmth. The example she set, both \npersonally and professionally, has always been an inspiration to me, \nand as the second woman to serve Arkansas in the U.S. Senate, I feel a \nspecial bond with Hattie and am humbled to follow in her footsteps.\n  Hattie Caraway came to this distinguished body on November 13, 1931, \nfollowing the death of her husband, Senator Thaddeus Caraway. An \nappointment by the Governor of Arkansas allowed her to temporarily fill \nthe seat of her husband, and the historic special election that \nfollowed allowed her to achieve what no woman had ever achieved--an \nelected seat in the U.S. Senate. It was not only a testament to the \nopenmindedness and fairness of the people of Arkansas, but it was a \ntestament to Hattie Caraway and the kind of woman she was.\n  Upon the conclusion of her husband's term, it was generally expected \nthat Hattie would retire and quietly settle down with her family back \nin Arkansas. In doing so, the seat that she and her husband had proudly \nserved for 12 years would go to one of the candidates, including a \nformer Governor and U.S. Senator, who were now running for the \nnomination. But Hattie Caraway was never one to make decisions based on \nthe expectations of others. With a firm belief that ``women are just as \nloyal, courageous, and self-sacrificing as men,'' she stood boldly in \nthe face of overwhelming odds to campaign for a full Senate term. \nAlthough she had little campaign funding and was less experienced than \nher male opponents, she got support from an unlikely source--the \nlegendary Senator Huey Long, of neighboring Louisiana.\n  Not only were the Caraways and the Longs close friends but Senator \nLong had come to respect his new female colleague for her undaunted \ncourage in voting against special interests and standing up for the \npeople in her home State. Upon arriving in Arkansas for the campaign, \nwhat the two of them would accomplish together that first week of \nAugust in 1931 would become legend. The week-long ``Hattie and Huey \nTour'' wound its way through the State, speaking in more than 35 \ncommunities, traveling over 2,000 miles, and drawing huge crowds. With \nthe fiery Long imploring crowds that, ``If Wall Street and their gang \nsucceed in defeating enough Senators who have stood with the people \nlike this little woman from Arkansas has . . . You'll never be able to \nget anyone from this State to stand by you again,'' he effectively \nintroduced Hattie to new areas\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nof the State. As a result, the depression-stricken Arkansans who had \nendured months of unemployment, poverty, and low farm prices began to \nsee Hattie Caraway for who she was, an honorable friend and neighbor \nwho would always remain an advocate for the best interests of them and \ntheir families. At the polls, the people of Arkansas stood by Hattie in \noverwhelming numbers, doubling the votes of her nearest rival and \ncarrying 61 of Arkansas' 75 counties.\n\n  In the Senate, it was rare for ``Silent Hattie'' to participate \nactively in debate or deliver a speech to the chamber. She had learned \nfrom her husband's years of public service and was weary of the \npoliticians who placed a higher priority on hearing their own voice \nthan working on behalf of the people they were elected to represent, \noften remarking, ``It's funny how they talk on after we've all made up \nour minds.'' Senator Caraway took her responsibilities as a legislator \nseriously and built a reputation among her colleagues as a woman of \nintegrity who showed a determination to faithfully champion the \ninterests of Arkansas above everything else.\n  Although she maintained her political independence, Hattie was a \nproponent of much of the legislation proposed under President Franklin \nRoosevelt's New Deal. As a friend to the veterans and a critic of \nlobbying groups, Hattie also advocated commercial aviation safety and \nused her seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee to fight for farm \nrelief and flood control on behalf of Arkansas farmers. Her diligent \nservice and effective advocacy of legislation for Arkansas won her \nanother term in 1938, beating in the Democratic primary a legend in \nArkansas politics who would later serve 34 years in the U.S. Senate, \nJohn L. McClellan.\n  Quickly becoming accustomed to breaking the Senate's gender barriers, \nHattie became the first woman to chair a Senate committee, the \nCommittee on Enrolled Bills, in 1933 and 10 years later would become \nthe first woman to serve as Presiding Officer on the floor of the \nSenate. Her legacy would also be distinguished by the support she \noffered for many of the Nation's historical pieces of legislation. One \nof these bills was President Roosevelt's lend-lease proposal and Hattie \ngained national notoriety by speaking assertively on its behalf. This \nprogram of lending supplies and materials to England to assist in their \nwar effort was viewed by many isolationists in the United States as an \nunnecessary measure that would drag our Nation into war. In that time, \nwomen were seldom involved in issues of war and national security but \nHattie's voice was influential in passing the lend-lease bill through \nCongress. Hoping to avoid war at all costs, she felt lend-lease would \nonly strengthen England's effort to provide the ``last wall protecting \nus from Naziism.'' As the proud mother of sons serving our Nation in \nuniform, she was a credible voice on the issue and her plea to view the \nmatter without emotion struck a chord among Americans.\n  Hattie's historic Senate career came to a conclusion during the \nDemocratic primary of 1944, when she was defeated by another Arkansas \npolitical legend, J. William Fulbright. At the conclusion of her final \nterm, Hattie was honored by her Senate colleagues with a standing \novation on the floor of the Senate. Those on hand described it as \n``almost without precedent.''\n  Although Hattie passed away in December of 1950, her impact is still \nfelt in the institution she served and by all of those who have found \ninspiration in the life she led. In 1996, a portrait of Hattie was \nplaced just outside the Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol. The \nportrait is only the second in the Senate's permanent art collection \nwhich honors a woman; the first is Pocahontas. In 2001, Hattie made \nhistory again when she became the first Arkansan to ever appear on a \nstamp and I was proud to help unveil the 76-cent Hattie Caraway \ndefinitive stamp, as a part of the Postal Service's ``Distinguished \nAmericans'' series.\n  While there are many ways for us to remember Hattie, her lasting \nlegacy will live on in those who have been inspired by her example and \nin the generations of women seeking elective office who have followed \nthe road she has so boldly paved. We have come a long way since the \nSuffragist Movement at the beginning of the last century, and we have \nwomen like Hattie Caraway to thank. Thirty-one women have followed \nHattie Caraway to the U.S. Senate, and today, a record 14 women are \ncurrently serving. With the 68 women serving in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, a record 82 currently women serve in the U.S. Congress \ntoday. Hattie would be proud. It is up to us to continue the progress \nshe made and to urge a new generation to follow the heroic example set \nby her and so many other pioneering women.\n  When I think of Hattie Caraway, I think of a quote she made \nthroughout her 1932 campaign. I carried it with me throughout my first \nSenate campaign: ``If I can hold on to my sense of humor and a modicum \nof dignity, I shall have a wonderful time running for office whether I \nget there or not.'' Well, Hattie, you got there. In the process, your \nhumor carried you through and your dignity earned you the affection of \ngenerations who are inspired to follow in your footsteps despite \nwhatever barriers they may encounter or traditions they must overcome.\n  In the illustrious history of this great body and in the hearts of \nthose who are inspired by her courage, one woman clearly stands out. \nHer name is Hattie Caraway. I am proud that she is from my home State \nof Arkansas, and I am proud to call her one of my heroes.\n  Each of us has our own personal story about a woman who has provided \nour lives with hope and inspiration. During this month, take some time \nto tell that story. By doing so, you will not only honor their efforts \nbut may also inspire a member of our younger generation with both the \nimagination to think a bit larger, and the courage to boldly turn their \ndreams into reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2732-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLLEGE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one of \nMontana's fine educational institutions on its first national \nchampionship title. Rocky Mountain College, located in Billings, is \nMontana's oldest institution of higher education. Last weekend, the \nmen's ski team became the overall national champions at the 27th Annual \nUS Collegiate Ski Association Championships.\n  Montana's schools may be smaller than the ( average universities \naround the Nation, but Rocky Mountain College has again proven that \nsmaller schools can achieve giant results.\n  Under Coach Jerry Wolf's leadership, the men's ski team made history \nfor Rocky Mountain College by leading the men's ski team to their first \nnational championship in the school's history.\n  However, the men were not the only ones from the Big Sky State to \nshine that day.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the 15-year recovery period for the depreciation of \ncertain leasehold improvements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake permanent the 15-year depreciation period for leasehold \nimprovements that was enacted on a temporary basis as part of the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my Finance Committee colleague, Senator Kyl.\n  Leasehold improvements are the alterations to leased space made by a \nbuilding owner as part of the lease agreement with a tenant. In actual \ncommercial use, leasehold improvements typically last as long as the \nlease--an average of less than 10 years.\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nHowever, until last year, the Internal Revenue Code required leasehold \nimprovements to be depreciated over 39 years--the life of the building \nitself.\n  Economically, this made no sense. The owner received taxable income \nover the life of the lease, yet could only recover the costs of the \nimprovements associated with that lease over 39 years. This mismatch of \nincome and expenses was alleviated somewhat by our action last year in \nreducing the recovery period to 15 years.\n  A shorter recovery period more closely aligns the expenses incurred \nto construct improvements with the income they generate over the term \nof the lease. By reducing the cost recovery period, the expense of \nmaking these improvements has fallen more into line with the economics \nof a commercial lease transaction. One of the most important goals of \nthis change is to encourage building owners to adapt their buildings to \nfit the needs of today's business tenant.\n  It is good for the economy to keep existing buildings commercially \nviable. When older buildings can serve tenants who need modern, \nefficient commercial space, there is less pressure for developing \ngreenfields in outlying areas. Americans are concerned about preserving \nopen space, natural resources, and a sense of neighborhood.\n  Unfortunately, the recovery period reduction enacted last year is \neffective only through the end of 2005. If Congress fails to act before \nthe end of this year, the recovery period for leasehold improvements \nplaced in service beginning in 2006 would again be 39 years.\n  I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this legislation to \nprovide rational depreciation treatment for leasehold improvements for \nthe long term.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF 15-YEAR RECOVERY PERIOD FOR \n                   DEPRECIATION OF CERTAIN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       Section 168(e)(3)(E)(iv) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (defining 15-year property) is amended by striking \n     ``before January 1, 2006''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Levine, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 622. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law \n107-296) to provide for the protection of voluntarily furnished \nconfidential information, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week marks the first national \n``Sunshine Week.'' The centerpiece of this week is Freedom of \nInformation Day, which falls on March 16, the anniversary of James \nMadison's birthday. A firm believer in the need for open and \naccountable government, Madison said, ``A popular government, without \npopular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to \na farce or tragedy or perhaps both.'' Each generation of Americans \nshould heed James Madison's warning, and it is fitting and proper that \ntoday's generations of Americans use this week to revisit the \npotentially damaging limitations placed on access to government \ninformation in just the last few years.\n  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been the centerpiece of \nopen government for the 38 years since it came into force in 1967. It \nenables citizens to obtain information on how their government is \nprotecting the Nation, spending their tax dollars, and implementing the \nlaws their officeholders enact. FOIA helps hold our government \naccountable. It was through FOIA requests that the St. Petersburg Times \nuncovered information showing that since the 1991 Gulf War, and due in \npart to lax security at military bases, thousands of pounds of weapons \nhave been lost or stolen from U.S. stockpiles, and some remains \nunaccounted for. The Bremerton Sun newspaper in Washington State used \nFOIA to confirm the mishandling of a nuclear missile at a Navy \nsubmarine facility. These are examples of the day-to-day importance of \nFOIA in helping Americans safeguard our security infrastructure. There \nare countless other examples of FOIA enabling citizens to obtain \ninformation relating to health and safety concerns in their cities and \nneighborhoods.\n  In 2002, when I voted to support passage of the Homeland Security Act \n(HSA), I voiced concerns about several flaws in the legislation. I \ncalled for the Administration and my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to monitor implementation of the new law and to craft corrective \nlegislation. One of my chief concerns with the HSA was a subtitle of \nthe act that granted an extraordinarily broad exemption to FOIA in \nexchange for the cooperation of private companies in sharing \ninformation with the government regarding vulnerabilities in the \nnation's critical infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, the law that was enacted undermines Federal and State \nsunshine laws permitting the American people to know what their \ngovernment is doing. Rather than increasing security by encouraging \nprivate sector disclosure to the government, it guts FOIA at the \nexpense of our national security and the safety and health of the \nAmerican people.\n  Today, with my distinguished colleagues Senators Levin, Feingold, and \nLieberman I reintroduce legislation to restore the integrity of FOIA. I \nthank my colleagues for working with me on this important issue of \npublic oversight. We first offered this bill, which we call the \nRestoration of Freedom of Information Act, or ``Restore FOIA,'' in the \n108th Congress.\n  ``Restore FOIA'' protects Americans' right to know while \nsimultaneously providing security to those in the private sector who \nvoluntarily submit critical infrastructure records to the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS).\n  Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the government \nto keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks \nis a goal we all support. But the appropriate way to meet this goal is \na source of great debate a debate that has been all but ignored since \nthe enactment of the HSA.\n  The HSA created a new FOIA exemption for ``critical infrastructure \ninformation.'' That broadly defined term applies to information \ncovering a wide variety of facilities such as privately operated power \nplants, bridges, dams, ports, or chemical plants that might be targeted \nfor a terrorist attack. In HSA negotiations in 2002, House Republicans \nand the Administration promoted language that they described as \nnecessary to encourage owners of such facilities to identify \nvulnerabilities in their operations and share that information with \nDHS. The stated goal was to ensure that steps could be taken to ensure \nthe facilities' protection and proper functioning.\n  In fact, such descriptions of the legislation were disingenuous. \nThese provisions, which were eventually enacted in the HSA, shield from \nFOIA almost any voluntarily submitted document stamped by the facility \nowner as ``critical infrastructure.'' This is true no matter how \ntangential the content of that document may be to the actual security \nof a facility. The law effectively allows companies to hide information \nabout public health and safety from the American people even from \nneighbors of such a facility in its local community--simply by \nsubmitting it to DHS. The enacted provisions were called ``deeply \nflawed'' by Mark Tapscott of the Heritage Foundation in a November 20, \n2002, Washington Post op-ed. He argued that the ``loophole'' created by \nthe law ``could be manipulated by clever corporate and government \noperators to hide endless varieties of potentially embarrassing and/or \ncriminal information from public view.''\n  In addition, under the HSA, disclosure by private facilities to DHS \nneither obligates the private company to address the vulnerability, nor \nrequires DHS to fix the problem. For example, in the case of a chemical \nspill, the law bars the government from disclosing information without \nthe written consent of the company that caused the pollution. As the \nWashington Post pointed out in an editorial on February 10, 2003, ``A \ncompany might preempt environmental regulators by 'voluntarily' \ndivulging incriminating material, thereby making it unavailable to \nanyone else.''\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\n  The law also 1. shields the companies from lawsuits to compel \ndisclosure, 2. criminalizes otherwise legitimate whistleblower activity \nby DHS employees, and 3. preempts any state or local disclosure laws.\n  Finally, the HSA requires no reporting whatsoever to the Congress or \nthe public on critical infrastructure submissions to DHS. As a result, \nit is nearly impossible for the public to learn whether this law is \nbeing followed in good faith, whether it is being manipulated by \nsubmitters, and whether DHS is conducting due diligence on submissions. \nIt also places hurdles before those of us in Congress who believe in \neffective oversight.\n  In an effort to obtain some basic data on the treatment of ``critical \ninfrastructure information'' at DHS, two organizations filed a FOIA \nrequest in 2004. OMB Watch and the Electronic Privacy Information \nCenter sought public release of the number of submissions and \nrejections under the law, and of any communications between DHS and \nsubmitters. They also requested the Department's program procedures for \nhandling information. DHS did not provide answers. The groups filed a \ncomplaint, and the D.C. District Court ordered DHS to respond. We \nlearned that as of February 2005, the critical infrastructure program \nreceived 29 submissions and rejected seven of those. We know nothing of \nthe substance of the accepted submissions, what vulnerabilities they \nmay describe, or what is being done to address them.\n\n  Most businesses are good citizens and take seriously their \nobligations to the government and the public, but this ``disclose-and-\nimmunize'' provision is subject to abuse by those businesses that want \nto exploit legal technicalities to avoid regulatory guidelines that are \ndesigned to protect the public's health and safety. The HSA lays out \nthe perfect blueprint to avoid legal liability: funnel damaging \ninformation into this voluntary disclosure system and preempt the \ngovernment or others harmed by the company's actions from being able to \nuse it against the company. This is not the kind of two-way public-\nprivate cooperation that serves the public interest.\n  The HSA FOIA exemption goes so far in exempting such a large amount \nof material from FOIA's disclosure requirements that it undermines \ngovernment openness without making any real gains in safety for \nfamilies in Vermont and across America. We do not keep America safer by \nchilling federal officials from warning the public about threats to \ntheir health and safety. We do not ensure our nation's security by \nrefusing to tell the American people whether or not their federal \nagencies are doing their jobs, or whether their government is spending \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars wisely. We do not encourage real \ncooperation by giving companies protection from civil liability when \nthey break the law. We do not respect the spirit of our democracy when \nwe cloak in secrecy the workings of our government from the public we \nare elected to serve.\n  The Restore FOIA bill I introduce today with Senators Levin, Feingold \nand Lieberman is identical to language I negotiated with Senators Levin \nand Bennett in the summer of 2002 when the HSA charter was debated by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Bennett stated in the \nCommittee's July 25, 2002, markup that the Administration had endorsed \nthe compromise. He also said that industry groups had reported to him \nthat the compromise language would make it possible for them to share \ninformation with the government without fear of the information being \nreleased to competitors or to other agencies that might accidentally \nreveal it. The Governmental Affairs Committee reported out the \ncompromise language that day. Unfortunately, much more restrictive \nHouse language was eventually signed into law.\n  The Restore FOIA bill would correct the problems in the HSA in \nseveral ways. First, it limits the FOIA exemption to relevant \n``records'' submitted by the private sector, such that only those that \nactually pertain to critical infrastructure safety are protected. \n``Records'' is the standard category referred to in FOIA. This corrects \nthe effective free pass given to regulated industries by the HSA for \nany information it labels ``critical infrastructure.''\n  Second, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows for government \noversight, including the ability to use and share the records within \nand between agencies. It does not limit the use of such information by \nthe government, except to prohibit public disclosure where such \ninformation is appropriately exempted under FOIA.\n  Third, it protects the actions of legitimate whistleblowers rather \nthan criminalizing their acts.\n  Fourth, it does not provide civil immunity to companies that \nvoluntarily submit information. This corrects a flaw in the current \nlaw, which would prohibit such information from being used directly in \ncivil suits by government or private parties.\n  Fifth, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows local authorities \nto apply their own sunshine laws. The Restore FOIA bill does not \npreempt any state or local disclosure laws for information obtained \noutside the Department of Homeland Security. It also does not restrict \nthe use of such information by state agencies.\n  Finally, the Restore FOIA bill does not restrict congressional use or \ndisclosure of voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure \ninformation.\n  These changes to the HSA would accomplish the stated goals of the \ncritical infrastructure provisions in the HSA--without tying the hands \nof the government in its efforts to protect Americans and without \ncutting the public out of the loop.\n  Restore FOIA is supported by the American Library Association, Common \nCause, the Freedom of Information Center, OMB Watch, Association of \nResearch Libraries, the Project on Government Oversight, and \nOpenTheGovernment.org, among other leading open government \norganizations.\n  The argument over the scope of the FOIA and unilateral Executive \npower to shield matters from public scrutiny goes to the heart of our \nfundamental right to be an educated electorate aware of what our \ngovernment is doing. The Rutland Herald got it right in a November 26, \n2002, editorial that explained: ``The battle was not over the right of \nthe government to hold sensitive, classified information secret. The \ngovernment has that right. Rather, the battle was over whether the \ngovernment would be required to release anything it sought to \nwithhold.''\n  We need to fix this troubling restriction on public accountability. \nJames Madison's warning is a clear warning to us, and it is our \ngeneration's duty to heed it. I urge my colleagues to support the \nRestoration of Freedom of Information Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectional \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Short title. This section gives the bill the short title, the \n``Restoration of Freedom of Information Act.''\n  Sec. 2. Protection of Voluntarily Furnished Confidential Information. \nThis section strikes subtitle B (secs. 211-215) of the Homeland \nSecurity Act (``HSA'')(P.L. 107-296) and inserts a new section 211.\n  Sections to be repealed from the HSA: These sections contain an \nexemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that (1) exempt from \ndisclosure critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to \nthe new department that was designated as confidential by the submitter \nunless the submitter gave prior written consent; (2) provide civil \nimmunity for use of such information in civil actions against the \ncompany; (3) preempt state sunshine laws if the designated information \nis shared with state or local government agencies; and (4) impose \ncriminal penalties of up to one year imprisonment on government \nemployees who disclosed the designated information.\n  Provisions that would replace the repealed sections of the HSA: The \nRestore FOIA bill inserts a new section 211 to the HSA that would \nexempt from the FOIA certain records pertaining to critical \ninfrastructure threats and vulnerabilities that are furnished \nvoluntarily to the new Department and designated by the provider as \nconfidential and not customarily made available to the public. Notably, \nthe Restore FOIA bill makes clear that the exemption covers ``records'' \nfrom the private sector, not all ``information'' provided by the \nprivate sector, as in the enacted version of the HSA. The Restore FOIA \nbill ensures that portions of records that are not covered by the \nexemption would be released pursuant to FOIA requests. It does not \nprovide any civil liability immunity or preempt state or local sunshine \nlaws, and it does not criminalize whistleblower activity.\n  Specifically, this section of the Restore FOIA bill includes the \nfollowing:\n\n       A definition of ``critical infrastructure\": This term is \n     given the meaning adopted in section 1016(e) the USA Patriot \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)) which reads, ``critical \n     infrastructure means systems and assets, whether physical or \n     virtual, so vital to United States that the incapacity or \n     destruction of such systems and assets would have a \n     debilitating impact on security, national economic security, \n     national public health or safety, or any combination of those \n     matters.'' This definition is commonly understood to mean \n     facilities such as bridges, dams, ports, nuclear power \n     plants, or chemical plants.\n       A definition of the term ``furnished voluntarily'': This \n     term signifies documents provided to the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) that are not formally required by the \n     department and that are provided to it to satisfy any legal \n     requirement. The definition excludes any document that is \n     provided to DHS with a permit or grant application or to \n     obtain any other benefit from DHS, such as a loan, agency \n     forbearance, or modification of a penalty.\n       An exemption from FOIA of records that pertain to \n     vulnerabilities of and threats to critical infrastructure \n     that are furnished voluntarily to DHS. This exemption is made \n     available where the provider of the record certifies that the \n     information is confidential and would not customarily be \n     released to the public.\n       A requirement that other government agencies that have \n     obtained such records from DHS withhold disclosure of the \n     records and refer any FOIA requests to DHS for processing.\n       A requirement that reasonably segregable portions of \n     requested documents be disclosed, as is well-established \n     under FOIA.\n       An allowance to agencies that obtain critical \n     infrastructure records from a source other than DHS to \n     release requested records consistent with FOIA, regardless of \n     whether DHS has an identical record in its possession.\n       An allowance to providers of critical infrastructure \n     records to withdraw the confidentiality designation of \n     records voluntarily submitted to DHS, thereby making the \n     records subject to disclosure under FOIA.\n       A direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     establish procedures to receive, designate, store, and \n     protect the confidentiality of records voluntarily submitted \n     and certified as critical infrastructure records.\n       A clarification that the bill would not preempt state or \n     local information disclosure laws.\n       A requirement for the Comptroller General to report to the \n     House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House Governmental \n     Reform Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee the number of private entities \n     and government agencies that submit records to DHS under the \n     terms of the bill. The report would also include the number \n     of requests for access to records that were granted or \n     denied. Finally, the Comptroller General would make \n     recommendations to the committees for modifications or \n     improvements to the collection and analysis of critical \n     infrastructure information.\n\n  Sec. 3. Technical and conforming amendment. This section amends the \ntable of contents of the Homeland Security Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 623. A bill to direct the Secretary of Interior to convey land \nheld in trust for the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah to the City of \nRichfield, Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Paiute Indian \nTribe Land Conveyance Act of 2005.\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey or \ntransfer four small Paiute trust land parcels to the city of Richfield.\n  The Paiute Indian Tribe Land Conveyance Act of 2005 would allow the \nSecretary of the Interior to transfer three acres of land held in trust \nfor the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah to the city of Richfield, UT. The \ncity of Richfield would provide fair market value compensation directly \nto the tribe, and pay any costs incurred in this transaction. This land \ntransfer would allow expansion of the Richfield Municipal Airport and \nprovide the Tribe with proceeds to purchase land that has economic \ndevelopment potential. This bill passed the House last year and I \nintroduced it in the Senate, but the Senate bill did not make it \nthrough the legislative process prior the end of the 108th Congress.\n  This proposal has support from all sides. The city of Richfield \napproached the Tribe about acquiring this parcel of land adjacent to \nthe airport runway. The Tribe agreed and the Paiute Tribal Council \npassed Resolution 01-36, unanimously agreeing to the conveyance of this \nparcel of land to the City. The land in question has not been used by \nthe Tribe for more than 20 years. It is not contiguous to the Paiute's \nReservation and for nearly 30 years now has had no economic development \npotential. The tribal resolution expresses the Paiute's desire to \naccept the city's offer to purchase the land at fair market value and \nserves as the request to the Secretary of the Interior to convey the \ntrust land. However, only an act of Congress may authorize this land \nconveyance.\n  The Paiute Indian Tribe Land Conveyance Act of 2005 would also \ntransfer three trust land parcels, each an acre or less in size, from \nthe Tribe to its Kanosh and Shivwits Bands. All parcels would remain in \ntrust status. The first parcel of one acre would be transferred from \nland held in trust by the United States for the Paiute Tribe to land \nheld in trust for the Kanosh Band. This parcel is surrounded by 279 \nacres of land that is either owned by the Kanosh Band or held in trust \nfor the Kanosh Band. For more than twenty years, the sole use of this \nland has been for the Kanosh Band Community Center. The second parcel, \ntwo-thirds of an acre in size, would also be transferred from the Tribe \nto the Kanosh Band. The land has been used exclusively by the Kanosh \nBand. It was originally intended that the land be taken in trust for \nthe Kanosh Band in 1981 under the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah \nRestoration Act. However, through an administrative error, the land was \nmistakenly placed in trust for the Tribe. By way of several Band \nresolutions, the Kanosh Band has formally requested correction of this \nerror.\n  The third parcel of land, less than an acre in size, would be \ntransferred from the Tribe to be held in trust for the Shivwits Band. \nThe land already is surrounded by several thousand acres of land held \nin trust for the Shivwits band, and its sole use has been for the \nShivwits Band Community Center.\n  Finally, the bill would eliminate the word ``City'' from the current \nofficial name of the ``Cedar City Band of Paiute Indians,'' a name \nwhich has never been used by the Band of residents of southwestern \nUtah. Thus, the bill makes clear that any reference in a law, map, \nregulation, document, paper, or other record, of the United States to \nthe ``Cedar City Band of Paiute Indians'' shall be deemed to be \nreference to the ``Cedar Band of Paiute Indians.''\n  I would like to make some clarifications as part of the record. This \nbill has language that would allow the city of Richfield to purchase \nland from the Tribe and provide payment directly to the Tribe without \nthe funds being funneled through the Department of the Interior. I \nsupport that provision. The bill also has a provision that would make \nlands which were acquired by the United States in trust for the Tribe, \nafter February 17, 1984 and prior to the date of the enactment of this \nlegislation, a part of the reservation. this clarifies the intent that \nlands already in possession of the tribe should be part of the \nreservation. I would also like to clarify that nothing in this \nlegislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make land \nconveyances for any tribe or band without their official consent to \nsuch a conveyance.\n  This bill will cost U.S. taxpayers nothing, but it will solve the \ndilemma that the city of Richfield faces as it works to make its \nairport meet the needs of the citizens of southwestern Utah. Equally \nimportant is the fact that this bill will allow the Paiute Tribe to use \nthe proceeds from the land sale to acquire land with economic \ndevelopment potential to facilitate the well-being of the Tribe. The \nbill also takes care of non-controversial land adjustments and \ntechnical corrections. The bill is supported by the Paiute Tribe, its \nBands, and the people of southwestern Utah residing nearby. That is why \nI am introducing this legislation that would convey or transfer small \nPaiute trust land parcels.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the Paiute Indian \nTribe Land Conveyance Act of 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 625. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \n$1,000 refundable credit for individuals who are bona fide volunteer \nmembers of volunteer firefighting and emergency medical service \norganizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nand introduce legislation that would allow a $1,000 refundable tax \ncredit for the true heroes in our society: those brave and dedicated \nAmericans who serve as volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency \nmedical service personnel.\n  I am introducing today a companion bill to H.R. 934, a bill \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by a fellow New Yorker, \nCongressman Maurice Hinchey. His bill is cosponsored by six other New \nYork Members of Congress: Tim Bishop, Steve Israel, Nita Lowey, Mike \nMcNulty, Jerrold Nadler, and Major Owens.\n  Many communities around New York State rely on volunteer firefighters \nand EMTs for much-needed public services, but it is getting harder and \nharder to find people to fill the slots because middle-class families \nhave increasing demands on their time, or financial concerns that \npreclude their participation. This bill is designed to offer an \nadditional incentive for people to get involved in their communities in \nthis vitally important way.\n  In 1736, Benjamin Franklin organized the Union Fire Brigade in \nPhiladelphia, PA, and ever since, thousands of American municipalities \nhave depended on civilians to protect lives and property from the \nravages of fire. The ``volunteer firefighter'' is a true American \ninvention, and its tremendous success for over 200 years has been \nrooted in the spirit of volunteerism that Alexis de Tocqueville was so \ntaken with when he visited this country in the 1800s.\n  That spirit is still alive today, yet it is becoming increasingly \nhard for municipalities to recruit and retain enough volunteer \nfirefighters. Many people simply have less time to devote to community \nservice. Families in which both parents work have become commonplace, \nand what little free time is left is often spent on organized \nactivities such as youth sports and school functions. At the same time, \nthe science of firefighting has evolved, and the mission of fire \ndepartments has diversified. This has caused the amount of required \ntraining to increase exponentially. While this is good for safety, it \ngreatly increases the overall time commitment that volunteer \nfirefighters must make. Twenty-five years ago, a volunteer could join \nand respond to a call in the same day. Today, that same volunteer must \ncomplete months of training before they can truly participate at an \nemergency.\n  The situation has reached a crisis stage in many of our communities. \nAccording to the Fireman's Association of the State of New York, fewer \nyoung people are joining the ranks. Many departments are having a hard \ntime filling crews, especially during the day when most people are \nworking. All across the country, fire departments are depending on \n``mutual aid'' from neighboring departments to supplement their own \ncrews. This leads to increased response time, which in turn, places \nfurther risk on life and property.\n  While many local governments understand the need for a recruitment \nincentive, most simply do not have the resources to implement one. At \nthe same time, we all understand that our firefighters are often on the \nfront lines of the War on Terror, and essential to\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nour homeland security. Moreover, every single day we rely on volunteer \nfirefighters to save residential and commercial property, and to clean \nup accidents and reopen our highways, all of which protects the \neconomic prosperity of many of our communities.\n  Let me offer a few examples from my State of how difficult the \nproblems of recruitment and retention have become.\n  In Duchess County, former fire chief Harold Ramsey is a current \nmember of the volunteer corps. His company is 100 percent volunteer, \nwith about 30 to 35 current members. When Mr. Ramsey joined the \ndepartment in the mid 1980s, there were 60 to 75 members. They have \nsignificant suffered a loss of members in the past five years. He \nbelieves that a tax credit would be a major incentive to younger \nmembers and would help to recruit new members.\n  In Orange County, Jeff Hunt is the President of Dikeman Engine and \nHose Company in Goshen. His company currently has 55 active members. \nThey are getting a new member next month, which will be their first new \nmember in five years. In an effort to improve their numbers, they have \nbeen visiting area schools to recruit, with little success. The company \nhas also looked into working with the Boy Scouts of America to increase \nenrollment. Membership is a major concern; during the day shift Mr. \nHunt says he is lucky to get four or five members to respond to calls. \nThat is not even enough to get all of the trucks and equipment out. He \nbelieves that the $1,000 tax credit would be a ``great start in the \nright direction'' to attract new members.\n  In Westchester County, in the town of Lewisboro, Joe Posadas is the \nChief of the South Salem Fire Department. His department also has \nsevere recruitment and retention issues. In next six months, he expects \nto lose three of his top responders. Members of the company are moving \nout of Westchester because they can no longer afford to live there--an \nongoing problem.\n  The company has approximately 35 members on paper, but for daytime \ncalls, only four members are typically able to respond. For night \ncalls, 10 to 15 can respond. The property tax deduction approved by the \nstate is so small that it provides little benefit or incentive for \nrecruitment, so Mr. Posadas believes that the $1,000 federal tax credit \nwould help. ``Anything we get helps attract new members,'' he said.\n  Steve Mann is a member of my staff and a 17-year veteran of a \nvolunteer firefighter squad. He is Captain of Engine 4 in Rensselaer, \nNY. His father and uncle are firefighters as well, and I guess you'd \nsay it's ``in his blood.'' He devotes most of his spare time to the \nfire department--but with a young family and a demanding job, it's not \nalways easy. He tells me that it is becoming harder and harder to find \npeople who are willing to devote the necessary time to the fire \ndepartment.\n  These are just a few examples.\n  Therefore, I believe it is appropriate for the federal government to \ntake an active role in fixing this problem. This tax credit would give \nmunicipalities and fire departments an important tool in attracting new \nvolunteers, and just as important, in retaining current members. The \nvolunteer firefighters are just as important to this country today as \nthey were in Benjamin Franklin's day, and we must do all that we can to \npreserve this legacy of service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 626. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove-access to diabetes self management training by designating \ncertified diabetes educators who are recognized by a nationally \nrecognized certifying body and who meet the same quality standards set \nforth for other providers of diabetes self management training, as \ncertified providers for purposes of outpatient diabetes self-management \ntraining services under part B of the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. Nelson of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce an important \npiece of legislation that will correct an oversight from the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997.\n  In 1997, Congress created a new diabetes benefit under medicare--\ndiabetes self-management training--but did not create a new provider \ngroup to deliver it. Congress assumed that the existing diabetes \neducation programs in hospitals would be able to provide services to \nall who were in need.\n  Certified Diabetes Educators (CDEs) were not given the ability to \nbill Medicare directly for diabetes self-management training when \nCongress passed the new benefit in 1997 because they did not feel there \nwas a need to create a new provider because CDEs could work within a \nhospital setting and receive reimbursement through hospital billing.\n  However, due to changing health care economics, hospital diabetes \nself-management training programs have been closing at an alarming \nrate, forcing patients to seek other avenues for obtaining diabetes \nself-management training such as clinics and stand-alone programs.\n  While small in scope, the Diabetes Self-Management Training act of \n2005 will correct this oversight to ensure our Nation's seniors with \ndiabetes have access to this important benefit.\n  Diabetes education is very important in my State of Nebraska. \nAccording to the Nebraska Health and Human Services System, about five \npercent of Nebraska's adults have diagnosed diabetes--or about 60,000 \npeople. An additional 20,000 Nebraskans probably have diabetes but have \nnot been diagnosed.\n  While diabetes rates continue to grow at an alarming rate, lack of \naccess to diabetes-self management training, which is critical to \ncontrolling diabetes and preventing secondary complications, has also \nbecome a chronic problem. Despite the fact that twenty percent of \nMedicare patients have diabetes, and about a quarter of all Medicare \nspending goes to treat diabetes and diabetes-related conditions, less \nthan one-third of eligible patients are currently receiving the \nbenefit.\n  Because CDEs are not able to bill Medicare directly for diabetes \nself-management training, patients have limited options for obtaining \nthe training they need to successfully manage their disease and prevent \nexpensive and debilitating complications.\n  The potential for complications is enormous. If patients with \ndiabetes cannot gain access to diabetes self-management training, \nserious complications will arise, such as kidney disease, amputations, \nvision loss, and sever cardiac disease. In fact, half of all Medicare \ndialysis patients suffer from diabetes.\n  By improving access to this important benefit, I believe we will take \nan important step toward helping patients control their diabetes, which \nwill not only save the Medicare program the significant costs \nassociated with the complications from uncontrolled diabetes, but more \nimportantly it will dramatically improve the quality of life for the \nmillions of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes.\n  That is why I am so proud to introduce this bi-partisan legislation, \nthe Diabetes Self-Management Training Act of 2005, along with my \ncolleague Senator Hutchison.\n  Throughout the Medicare debate in 2003, one of the top considerations \nfor all Senators was the cost of the legislation and the long-term \nsolvency of the Medicare program. In fact, we passed new programs in \nthat legislation to begin studying new health care delivery models that \nwill improve the outcomes for beneficiaries with chronic diseases like \nMedicare. While I strongly supported those new demonstration programs, \nwe need not wait to begin helping our seniors.\n  With diabetes already directly affecting so many seniors, and the \nbaby boomers on the horizon, we cannot afford to deny seniors access to \nproven programs like diabetes self-management training any longer. I \nlook forward to working to pass this legislation and help those with \ndiabetes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 627. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit, to increase the rates of the \nalternative incremental credit, and to provide an alternative \nsimplified credit for qualified research expenses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my friend \nand colleague Senator Baucus and several of our Finance Committee \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\nfrom both sides of the aisle today in introducing legislation that \nwould permanently extend and improve the research tax credit.\n  Extending the research credit is an important step for the future \neconomic growth of the United States. A permanent credit can help our \neconomy develop the new technologies that will enhance existing capital \ninputs and make workers more productive. The result will be a stronger \neconomy at home, and a more competitive nation abroad. As many of our \ncolleagues are aware, the current research credit is set to expire on \nDecember 31, 2005.\n  I believe that if we allow the research credit to expire, we will see \nthe negative effects manifest in lower economic growth, fewer jobs \ncreated, fewer innovative products, and lost opportunities as research \nactivities move to other countries with more attractive incentives. We \nshould never forget that our Nation's future economic health is \ndependent on the innovations of today.\n  In assessing the health of our economy, we find an important \ncorrelation between economic growth and inflationary pressures. One \nsure way to have strong economic growth without the pain of inflation \nis to increase productivity. And most productivity gains are derived \nfrom technological advances, which reduce the cost of producing goods \nand services, and thereby help maintain low consumer prices.\n  An additional benefit of productivity growth is a corresponding \nincrease in corporate profits. Such increases lead to higher returns on \nsavings and investment, and higher wages for workers. I believe the \ngreatest benefit of increased R is productivity growth, which in turn \nforms the foundation of higher living standards.\n  Productivity growth also largely determines our society's long-term \neconomic welfare. Our ability to deal with budgetary challenges, such \nas Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlements, depends \ncritically on the future direction of our productivity.\n  From 1995 through 2003, average annual productivity growth was three \npercent, double the 1.5 percent growth rate that prevailed between 1973 \nand 1995. According to economists, this surge in productivity is the \nresult of businesses beginning to efficiently integrate computer and \ninformation technology into day-to-day operations. We need a strong and \npermanent research credit in order to continue these gains in \nproductivity growth.\n  My home State of Utah is a good example of how State economies \ncurrently benefit from the research credit. Utah is home to various \nfirms that invest a high percentage of their revenue in R There are \nthousands of employees working in Utah's technology based companies, \nwith thousands more working in other sectors that engage in R \nApproximately 5 percent of the State's non-agricultural workforce is \nemployed in research-intensive, high technology sectors.\n  Moreover, high technology jobs pay substantially more than the Utah \naverage. In 2004, high technology payrolls accounted for 9.2 percent of \nUtah's total payrolls. This is a significant proportion considering \ntechnology jobs make up only 5 percent of the workforce.\n  Utah's largest technology segment is in computer systems design, \nwhich accounts for more than 20 percent of the State's technology \nemployment with approximately 10,700 workers. Furthermore, this sector \nis Utah's second highest exporter of merchandise. This is a prime \nexample of an industry group contributing directly to the productivity \nexpansion I mentioned earlier.\n  The medical equipment manufacturing industry makes up another \nsubstantial R industry group employing nearly 8,000 Utahns. This \nindustry has been an important and relatively stable component of the \ntechnology sector for many years.\n  Utah profits from, and also imparts, many ``spill-over'' benefits \nfrom the innovations developed both within and outside of the state. To \ngive one example, more than 7,000 people work in Utah's chemical \nindustry. This industry is the State's fourth-largest exporter. It \nbenefits greatly from R taking place in Utah and throughout the \ncountry, and it shares the benefits with its trade partners. Research \nand development is clearly the lifeblood of Utah's economy.\n  Since 1981, when the research credit was first enacted, the Federal \nGovernment has joined in partnership with large and small businesses to \nensure that research expenditures are made in the United States. This \nenhances domestic job creation, and helps the United States to \ninternalize more of the economic benefits from the research credit.\n  It seems clear that to grow our economy we must enhance our position \nas the world leader in technological advances. Consequently, robust R \nspending should permeate our economy. We simply must continue to invest \nin research and development, and the Federal Government needs to \nreaffirm its role as a partner with the private sector. To achieve \nthis, I have long advocated a permanent credit, and this body is \noverwhelmingly on record in favor of that proposition. During the \nSenate's debate on the 2001 tax cut bill, I offered, and the Senate \nadopted, an amendment to provide for such a permanent credit. \nUnfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference and we lost a \ngreat opportunity.\n  Once again, I want to ask my colleagues to make this credit \npermanent. I think we all know that this credit is going to be \nextended, again and again, every few years. It takes time and energy \nfor my colleagues to revisit this issue every few years. Can we not \njust, once and for all, make this provision permanent? We know this is \ngood policy, and it is one of the most effective tax incentives in the \ncode. Even under today's permanently temporary credit, every dollar of \ntax credit is estimated to increase R spending by one dollar in the \nshort run and by up to two dollars in the long run. And if we make this \npermanent, those incentives will only improve.\n  While the research credit has proven to be a powerful incentive for \ncompanies to increase research and development activities, it \nunfortunately does not work perfectly. One reason is that the credit is \nincremental, and was designed to reward additional research efforts, \nnot just what a company might have done otherwise. From a tax policy \nperspective, I believe this is the best way to provide an incentive tax \ncredit. Nevertheless, it is difficult to craft an incremental credit \nthat works flawlessly in every case.\n  While the credit works well for many companies, it does not help some \nfirms that still incur significant research expenditures. This is \nbecause the credit's base period of 1984 through 1988 is growing more \ndistant and some firms' business models have changed.\n  To address this problem, we have added a third way to qualify for the \ncredit, an elective ``alternative simplified credit.'' We propose to \nbase this new alternative credit on how much a company has increased \nits R spending compared to the last three years. Companies will \naverage their R spending over the previous three years, and cut that \nnumber in half. For every dollar they spend over that amount, they get \na 12 percent tax credit. If they spend less than that amount, they get \nno credit at all. This is why this credit is so effective--it gives \nbenefits to companies that do more, and gives no benefits to companies \nthat do less. That is good tax policy, and good growth policy.\n  The United States needs to continue to be the world's leader in \ninnovation. We cannot afford to allow other countries to lure away the \nresearch that has always been done here. We cannot afford to have the \nlapses in the research pipeline that would result if we do not take \ncare of extending this credit before it expires on December 31.\n  In conclusion, making the research tax credit permanent will increase \nthe growth rate of our economy. It will mean more and better jobs for \nAmerican workers. Making the tax credit permanent will speed economic \ngrowth. And new technology resulting from American research and \ndevelopment will continue to improve the standard of living for every \nperson in the U.S. and around the world.

Mr. President, I am pleased to again join with my friend, \nSenator Hatch, in introducing legislation to make a permanent \ncommitment to research-intensive businesses in the United States. This \nlegislation is bipartisan and bicameral. A companion bill will be \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Nancy \nJohnson and Congressman Ben Cardin.\n  Every morning we hear news of some new product or discovery that \npromises to make our jobs easier or our lives better. Many of these \ninnovations started with a business decision to hire needed researchers \nand finance the expensive and long process of research and \nexperimentation. Since 1981, when the R tax credit was first enacted, \nthe Federal Government was a partner in that business endeavor because \nof the potential spillover benefits to society overall from additional \nresearch spending.\n  Research has shown that a tax credit is a cost-effective way to \npromote R The Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and others have \nall found significant evidence that a tax credit stimulates additional \ndomestic R spending by U.S. companies. A report by the Congressional \nResearch Service, CRS, indicates that economists generally agree that, \nwithout government support, firm investment in R would fall short of \nthe socially optimal amount and thus CRS advocates government policies \nto boost private sector R\n  R is linked to broader economic and labor benefits. R lays the \nfoundation for technological innovation, which, in turn, is an \nimportant driving force in long-term economic growth--mainly through \nits impact on the productivity of capital and labor. We have many times \nheard testimony from economists, including Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan, that the reason our economy grew at such \nbreakneck speed during the 1990s stemmed from the productivity growth \nwe realized thanks to technological innovations.\n  There has been a belief that companies would continue to increase \ntheir research spending and that the benefits of these investments on \nthe economy and labor markets would continue without end. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case. According to Battelle's 2005 \nfunding forecast, industrial R spending will increase only 1.9 \npercent above last year, to an estimated $191 billion, which is less \nthan the expected rate of inflation of 2.5 percent. For the fifth year \nin a row, industrial R spending growth has been essentially flat.\n  Over recent years, industry-financed R declined from 1.88 percent \nto 1.65 percent of GDP in the United States between 2000 and 2003, \nwhile R performed by the business sector declined from 2.04 percent \nto 1.81 percent of GDP. Japan, in contrast, saw a steep increase in \nbusiness-performed R 2.12 percent to 2.32 percent of GDP \nbetween 2000 and 2002--and modest gains were posted in the EU.\n  Moreover, just last week, the World Economic Forum released its \nannual Global Information Technology Report. The rankings, which \nmeasure the propensity for countries to exploit the opportunities \noffered by information and communications technology, ICT, revealed \nthat Singapore has displaced the United States as the top economy in \ninformation technology competitiveness. As a matter of fact, the United \nStates has dropped from first to fifth place in this ranking. Iceland, \nFinland and Denmark are the countries ranked two, three and four out of \nthe 104 countries surveyed. Iceland moved up from tenth last year.\n  These numbers should be a wake up call for all of us. As research \nspending falls, so too will the level of future economic growth.\n  It is also important to recognize that many of our foreign \ncompetitors are offering permanent and generous incentives to firms \nthat attract research dollars to those countries. A 2001 study by the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, ranked the \nU.S. ninth behind other nations in terms of its incentives for business \nR spending. Countries that provide more generous R incentives \ninclude Spain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Netherlands, \nFrance, and Korea. The United Kingdom was added to this list in 2002 \nwhen it further expanded its existing R incentives program. The \ncontinued absence of a long-term U.S. government R policy that \nencourages U.S.-based R will undermine the ability of American \ncompanies to remain competitive in U.S. and foreign markets. This \ndisparity could limit U.S. competitiveness relative to its trading \npartners in the long-run.\n  Also, U.S. workers who are engaged in R activities currently \nbenefit from some of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, \nhigh-skilled\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\njobs in the economy. My own State of Montana is an excellent example of \nthis economic activity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments \nprovided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 \nper year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average \nprivate sector wage of less than $20,000 per year during the same year. \nMany of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance \nof the R credit. While there may not be an immediate rush to move all \nprojects and jobs offshore, there has been movement at the margins on \nthose projects that are most cost-sensitive. Once those projects and \njobs are gone, it will be many years before companies will have any \nincentive to bring them back to the United States.\n  We continue to grapple with the need to stimulate economic growth and \nadvance policies that represent solid long-term investments that will \nreap benefits for many years to come. Senator Hatch and I repeatedly \nhave pointed to the R tax credit as a measure that gives us a good \n``bang for our buck.'' I hope this year we can enact a permanent tax \ncredit that is effective and more widely available. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n  As we have in years past, our proposal would make the current \nresearch and experimentation tax credit permanent and increase the \nAlternative Incremental Research Credit, AIRC, rates. And, in this \nlegislation we take one additional but necessary step.\n  We propose a new alternative simplified credit that will allow \ntaxpayers to elect to calculate the R credit under new computational \nrules that will eliminate the present-law distortions caused by gross \nreceipts. This revised and improved R credit did pass the Senate last \nyear on a 93-0 vote, but a straight short-term extension of current law \nwas enacted instead.\n  There is no good policy reason to make research more expensive for \nsome industries than for others. While the regular R tax credit works \nvery well for many companies, as the credit's base period recedes and \nbusiness cycles change, the current credit is out of reach for some \nother firms that still incur significant research expenditures. To help \nsolve part of this problem Congress enacted the AIRC in 1996 and now we \npropose a way to address the rest of that problem.\n  Under current law, both the regular credit and the AIRC are \ncalculated by reference to a taxpayer's gross receipts, a benchmark \nthat can produce inequities and anomalous results. For example, many \ntaxpayers are no longer able to qualify for the regular credit, despite \nsubstantial R investments, because their R spending relative to \ngross receipts has not kept pace with the ratio set in the 1984-88 base \nperiod, which governs calculation of the regular credit. This can \nhappen, for example, simply where a company's sales increase \nsignificantly in the intervening years, where a company enters into an \nadditional line of business that generates additional gross receipts \nbut involves little R, or where a company becomes more efficient in \nits R processes.\n  Our proposal would correct this by allowing taxpayers a \nstraightforward alternative research credit election. Taxpayers could \nelect, in lieu of the regular credit or the AIRC, a credit that would \nequal 12 percent of the excess of the taxpayer's current year qualified \nresearch expenditures, QREs, over 50 percent of the taxpayer's average \nQREs for the 3 preceding years. Unlike the regular credit and the AIRC, \nthis credit calculation does not involve gross receipts.\n  The R tax credit has proven it can be an effective incentive. We \nneed to act to make it a permanent part of the tax code that U.S. \nbusinesses can rely on. The best thing we can do for our long-term \neconomic well-being is to stoke the engine of growth--technology, high-\nwage jobs and productivity. I look forward to working with Senator \nHatch and all my colleagues on this important issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Bunning):\n  S. 628. A bill to provide for increased planning and funding for \nhealth promotion programs of the Department of Health and Human \nServices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nPromotion FIRST, Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis and Training, \nAct, legislation to provide the foundation for solid planning and a \nscientific base for health promotion.\n  Between one half and two-thirds of premature deaths in the United \nStates and much of our health care costs are caused by just three risk \nfactors: poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco. Recent news \nreports have highlighted the alarming increase in obesity across the \nNation. In the last 10 years, obesity rates have increased by more than \n60 percent among adults--with approximately 59 million adults \nconsidered obese today.\n  We also know that medical costs are directly related to lifestyle \nrisk factors. The September 2000 issue of the American Journal of \nHealth Promotion reported that approximately 25 percent of all employer \nmedical costs are caused by lifestyle factors. Emerging research is \nshowing the value may be closer to 50 percent today.\n  Medical care costs are reaching crisis levels. Some major employers \nare actively exploring discontinuing medical insurance coverage if \ncosts are not controlled. The Federal Government has the same cost \nproblems with its own employees, and the cost to Medicare of lifestyle-\nrelated diseases will only increase as Baby Boomers retire, and more \nand more beneficiaries are diagnosed with lifestyle-related illnesses.\n  An obvious first step to addressing our health and medical cost \nproblems is to help people stay healthy.\n  The good news is that both the public and private sectors are \nstarting to do more in the area of health prevention and health \npromotion. For instance, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 \nincluded several new prevention initiatives for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Also in recent years Congress and the Administration have worked \ntogether to pass numerous pieces of legislation to establish grants to \nprovide health services for improved nutrition, increased physical \nactivity, and obesity prevention.\n  However, despite the success of many health promotion programs, there \nis a quality gap between the best programs and typical programs. This \noccurs because most professionals are not aware of the best practice \nmethods. Furthermore, even the best programs reach a small percentage \nof the population and do poorly in creating lasting change.\n  The Health Promotion FIRST Act will build the foundation for a stable \ncoordinated strategy to develop the basic and applied science of health \npromotion, synthesize research results and disseminate findings to \nresearchers, practitioners and policy makers.\n  The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop strategic plans focusing on the following: how to develop the \nbasic and applied science of health promotion; how to best utilize the \nauthority and resources of the Department of Health and Human Services \nand other Federal agencies to integrate health promotion concepts into \nhealth care and other elements of society; how to synthesize health \npromotion research into practical guidelines that can be easily \ndisseminated and; how to foster a strong health workforce for health \npromotion activities.\n  Additional funding is also provided for the Centers for Disease \nControl and the National Institutes of Health to augment current \nactivities related to health promotion research and dissemination.\n  We have made a good start, at the Federal level, in addressing the \nneeds of health promotion. However, we need to go further. I believe \nthis legislation will serve as a good basis for Congress and the \nadministration to take the next step in developing health promotion \nprograms for the next decade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 630. A bill to establish procedures for the acknowledgment of \nIndian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 631. A bill to provide grants to ensure full and fair \nparticipation in certain decisionmaking processes of the\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with our colleague, Senator \nLieberman, to reintroduce two pieces of legislation intended to improve \nthe process by which the Federal Government considers petitions of \nAmerican Indians and their tribal governments for Federal recognition. \nThe first bill is called the Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau \nEnhancement Act, or the TRIBE Act. The second bill is a bill to provide \nassistance grants to financially needy tribal groups and municipalities \nso that those groups and towns can more fully and fairly participate in \ncertain decision-making processes at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. \nI offer these bills with a sense of hope and with the expectation that \nthey will contribute to the larger national conversation about how the \nFederal Government can best fulfill its obligations to America's native \npeoples, and uphold the principles of fairness and openness in our \nlaws.\n  The persistent problems that plague the current tribal recognition \nprocess have been well-documented and widely acknowledged. A General \nAccounting Office report concluded in November, 2001 that ``weaknesses \nin the process create uncertainty about the basis for recognition \ndecisions, and the amount of time it takes to make those decisions \nimpedes the process of fulfilling its promise as a uniform approach to \ntribal recognition.'' This conclusion has been shared by many tribal \nand non-tribal governments. The Chairwoman of the Duwamish Tribe of \nWashington State has testified that she and her people ``have known and \nfelt the effects of 20 years of administrative inaccuracies, delays and \nthe blase approach in . . . handling and . . . processing the Duwamish \npetitions.'' And it has even been shared by the BIA itself, when in \n2001, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs admitted that ``. . . \nit is time for Congress to consider an alternative process.'' Clearly, \ntribes, municipalities, and others interested in the recognition \nprocess have been ill-served over the years by a broken system. I \nbelieve that we have an obligation to restore public confidence in the \nrecognition process.\n  The TRIBE Act would improve the recognition process in several ways. \nFirst, it would authorize $10 million per year to better enable the \nBureau of Indian Affairs to consider petitions in a thorough, fair, and \ntimely manner. Currently, there is an enormous backlog of tribal \nrecognition petitions pending at the BIA. At current rates of progress, \nit takes many years for a petition to be considered. It seems to me \nthat is an unacceptably long amount of time. Indeed, I can think of no \nother area of law where Americans must wait as long to have their \nrights adjudicated and vindicated. Second, the TRIBE Act would provide \nfor improved notice of a petition to key parties who may have an \ninterest in a petition, including the governor and attorney general of \nthe State where a tribe seeks recognition, other tribes, and elected \nleaders of municipalities that are adjacent to the land of a tribe \nseeking recognition. Third, it would require that a petitioner meets \neach of the seven mandatory criteria for Federal recognition spelled \nout in the current Code of Federal Regulations. Unfortunately, in a \nnumber of highly controversial decisions, it appears that these \ncriteria have not been applied in a uniform and consistent manner. \nFourth, it would require that a decision on a petition be published in \nthe Federal Register, and include a detailed explanation of the \nfindings of fact and of law with respect to each of the seven mandatory \ncriteria for recognition.\n\n  I want to emphasize what this legislation would not do. It would not \nrevoke or in any way alter the status of tribes whose petitions for \nFederal recognition have already been granted. It would not restrict in \nany way the existing prerogatives and privileges of such tribes. Tribes \nwould retain their right to self-determination consistent with their \nsovereign status. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the TRIBE Act \nwould not dictate outcomes nor would it tie the hands of the BIA. It \nwould simply create a uniform recognition process that is equal and \nfair to all.\n  My second bill would provide grants to allow poor tribes and \nmunicipalities an opportunity to participate fully in important \ndecision-making processes pertaining to recognition. Consequently, \nthese grants would enable these communities to provide to the BIA more \nrelevant information and resources from which to make a fair and fully-\ninformed decision on tribal recognition. When the Federal Government, \nthrough the BIA, makes decisions that will have an enormous impact on a \nvariety of communities--both tribal and non-tribal--it is only right \nthat the Government should provide a meaningful opportunity for those \ncommunities to be heard.\n  I believe that every tribal organization that is entitled to \nrecognition ought to be recognized and ought to be recognized in an \nappropriately speedy process. At the same time, we must make sure that \nthe BIA's decisions are accurate and fair. Every recognition decision \ncarries with it a legal significance that should endure forever. Each \nrecognition decision made by the BIA is a foundation upon which \nrelationships between tribes and States, tribes and municipalities, \nIndians and non-Indians will be built for generations to come. We need \nto make sure that the foundation upon which these lasting decisions are \nbuilt is sound and will withstand the test of time. We cannot afford to \nbuild relationships between sovereigns on the shifting sands of a \nbroken bureaucratic procedure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S.J. Res. 7. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and \nwomen; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senators Murray, Cantwell, \nCorzine, Kerry, Lieberman, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Boxer, Lautenberg, \nDurbin, Schumer, Levin, Feinstein, Harkin, Dodd and I are re-\nintroducing the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. In doing \nso, we reaffirm our strong commitment to equal rights for men and \nwomen.\n  Adoption of the ERA is essential to guarantee that the freedoms \nprotected by our Constitution apply equally to men and women. From the \nbeginning of our history as a nation, women have had to wage a \nconstant, long and difficult battle to win the same basic rights \ngranted to men. It was not until 1920 that the Constitution was amended \nto guarantee women the right to vote, and still today discrimination \ncontinues in other ways. Statutory prohibitions against discrimination \nhave clearly failed to give women the assurance of full equality they \ndeserve.\n  Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act in the \n1960s, discrimination against women continues to permeate the workforce \nand many areas of the economy. Today, women earn less than 76 cents for \neach dollar earned by men, and the gap is even greater for women of \ncolor. In the year 2000, African American women earned just 64 percent \nof the earnings of white men, and Hispanic women earned only 54 \npercent.\n  Women with college and professional degrees have achieved advances in \na number of professional and managerial occupations in recent years--\nyet more than 60 percent of working women are still clustered in a \nnarrow range of traditionally female, traditionally low-paying \noccupations, and female-headed households continue to dominate the \nbottom rungs of the economic ladder.\n  The routine discrimination that so many women still face today makes \nclear that the Equal Rights Amendment is needed now more than ever. \nPassage of the ERA by Congress will reaffirm our strong commitment to \ngenuine equality for all women in this new century.\n  A bolder effort is clearly needed to enable Congress and the States \nto live up to our commitment of full equality. The ERA alone cannot \nremedy all discrimination, but it will clearly strengthen the ongoing \nefforts of women across the country to obtain equal treatment.\n  We know from the failed ratification experiences of the past that \nincluding the ERA in the Constitution will not\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\nbe easy to achieve. But its extraordinary significance requires us to \ncontinue the battle. I urge my colleagues to approve the ERA in this \nCongress, and join the battle for ratification in the states. Women \nhave waited too long for full recognition of their equal rights by the \nConstitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S. J. Res. 7\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing two Senate Joint \nResolutions appointing citizen regents to the Board of Regents of the \nSmithsonian Institution. I am pleased that my fellow Smithsonian \nInstitution Regent, Senators Frist and Leahy, are cosponsors.\n  The Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents recently recommended the \nfollowing distinguished individuals for appointment to six year terms \non the Board; Robert P. Kogod of Washington, D.C., and Shirley Ann \nJackson of New York.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of their biographies and the text \nof the joint resolutions by printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nShirley Ann Jackson, President, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, \n                                New York\n\n       Shirley Ann Jackson is the 18th president of Rensselaer \n     Polytechnic Institute and the first African American woman to \n     lead a national research university. She is widely recognized \n     for her intelligent, compassionate problem-solving abilities \n     and her promotion of women and minorities in the sciences.\n       The words ``first African American woman'' describe much of \n     Dr. Jackson's career: a theoretical physicist, she is the \n     first African American woman to receive a doctorate from \n     M.I.T., the first African American to become a Commissioner \n     of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the first woman \n     and the first African American to serve as the Chairman of \n     the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the first African \n     American woman elected to the National Academy of \n     Engineering.\n       Since coming to Rensselaer, Dr. Jackson has led the \n     development and initial implementation of the Rensselaer Plan \n     (the Institute's strategic blueprint), restructured processes \n     and procedures, and secured a $360 million unrestricted gift \n     commitment to the University. Prior to becoming Rensselaer's \n     president, Dr. Jackson's career encompassed senior positions \n     in government, industry, research, and academe.\n       Dr. Jackson is currently president of the American \n     Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); director \n     of a number of major corporations, including FedEx \n     Corporation, AT Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, and \n     Medtronic, Inc.; member of the New York Stock Exchange's \n     board of directors, the Council on Foreign Relations, the \n     National Academy of Engineering, the National Advisory \n     Council for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Comptroller-\n     General's Advisory Committee for the Government Accounting \n     Office (GAO), the Executive Committee of the Council on \n     Competitiveness, and the Council of the Government-\n     University-Industry Research Roundtable; fellow of the \n     American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American \n     Physical Society; Life Member of the M.I.T.

Res. 82\n\n       Whereas Hezbollah is a Lebanon-based radical organization \n     with terrorist cells based in Europe, Africa, North America, \n     South America, Asia, and elsewhere, receiving financial, \n     training, weapons, and political and organizational aid from \n     Iran and Syria;\n       Whereas Hezbollah has led a 23-year global campaign of \n     terror targeting United States, German, French, British, \n     Italian, Israeli, Kuwaiti, Saudi Arabian, Argentinean, Thai, \n     Singaporean, and Russian civilians, among others;\n       Whereas former Director of Central Intelligence George \n     Tenet called Hezbollah ``an organization with the capability \n     and worldwide presence [equal to] al Qaeda, equal if not far \n     more [of a] capable organization . . . [t]hey're a notch \n     above in many respects\n     . . . which puts them in a state sponsored category with a \n     potential for lethality that's quite great'';\n       Whereas Hezbollah has been suspected of numerous terrorist \n     acts against United States citizens, including the suicide \n     truck bombing of the United States Embassy and Marine \n     Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in October 1983, and the Embassy \n     annex in Beirut in September 1984;\n       Whereas the French unit of the Multinational Force in \n     Beirut was also targeted in the attack of October 1983, in \n     which 241 United States soldiers and 58 French paratroopers \n     were killed;\n       Whereas Hezbollah has attacked Israeli and Jewish targets \n     in South America in the mid-1990s, including the Israeli \n     Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in March 1992, and the \n     AMIA Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires in July 1994;\n       Whereas Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for \n     kidnappings of United States and Israeli civilians and \n     French, British, German, and Russian diplomats, among others;\n       Whereas even after the Government of Israel's compliance \n     with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March \n     19, 1978) by withdrawing from Lebanon, Hezbollah has \n     continued to carry out attacks against Israel and its \n     citizens;\n       Whereas Hezbollah has expanded its operations in the West \n     Bank and Gaza Strip, providing training, financing, and \n     weapons to Palestinian terrorist organizations on the \n     European Union terrorist list, including the Al Aqsa Martyrs \n     Brigade, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine;\n       Whereas in 2004, Hezbollah instigated, financed, or played \n     a role in implementing a significant number of Palestinian \n     terrorist attacks against Israeli targets;\n       Whereas the European Union agreed by consensus to classify \n     Hamas as a terrorist organization for purposes of prohibiting \n     funding from the European Union to Hamas;\n       Whereas the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty \n     Restoration Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note) urges the \n     Government of Lebanon to assert the sovereignty of the \n     Lebanese state over all of its territory and to evict all \n     terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including \n     Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards;\n       Whereas, although the European Union has included Imad \n     Fayiz Mughniyah, a key operations and intelligence officer of \n     Hezbollah, on its terrorist list, it has not included his \n     organization on the list;\n       Whereas the United States, Canada, and Australia have all \n     classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and the \n     United Kingdom has placed the Hezbollah External Security \n     Organization on its terrorist list;\n       Whereas leaders of Hezbollah have made statements \n     denouncing any distinction between its ``political and \n     military'' operations, such as Hezbollah's representative in \n     the Lebanese Parliament, Mohammad Raad, who stated in 2001, \n     that ``Hezbollah is a military resistance party, and it is \n     our task to fight the occupation of our land. . . . There is \n     no separation between politics and resistance.'';\n       Whereas in a book recently published by the deputy \n     secretary-general of Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem, entitled \n     ``Hezbollah--the Approach, the Experience, the Future'', \n     Qassem writes ``Hezbollah is a jihad organization whose aim, \n     first and foremost, is jihad against the Zionist enemy, while \n     the political, pure and sensible effort can serve as a prop \n     and a means of support for jihad'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council resolution 1559 \n     (September 2, 2004), jointly sponsored by the United States \n     and France, calls upon all remaining foreign forces to \n     withdraw from Lebanon and for the disbanding and disarmament \n     of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias;\n       Whereas in December 2004, the Department of State placed \n     Al-Manar, Hezbollah's satellite television network, on the \n     Terrorist Exclusion List, and in December 2004, the French \n     Council of State banned the broadcasting of Al-Manar in \n     France;\n       Whereas France, Germany, and Great Britain, with the \n     support of the High Representative of the European Union, \n     have created a working group with Iran to discuss regional \n     security concerns, including the influence of terror \n     perpetuated by Hezbollah and other extremist organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas cooperation between the United States and the \n     European Union regarding efforts to combat international \n     terrorism is essential to the promotion of global security \n     and peace: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the European Union to classify Hezbollah as a \n     terrorist organization for purposes of prohibiting funding \n     from the European Union to Hezbollah and recognizing it as a \n     threat to international security;\n       (2) condemns the continuous terrorist attacks perpetrated \n     by Hezbollah;\n       (3) condemns Hezbollah's continuous support of Palestinian \n     terrorist organizations on the European Union terrorist list, \n     such as the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Hamas, the Palestinian \n     Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of \n     Palestine; and\n       (4) calls on Hezbollah to disarm and disband its militias \n     in Lebanon, as called for in United Nations Security Council \n     resolution 1559 (September 2, 2004).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2746-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2746-S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 144.

COPS provides resources that reflect our \n     national priority of terrorism prevention.'';\n       (4) on February 26, 2002, the Attorney General stated, \n     ``The COPS program has been a miraculous sort of success. \n     It's one of those things that Congress hopes will happen when \n     it sets up a program.'';\n       (5) the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Assistant \n     Director for the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination has \n     stated, ``The FBI fully understands that our success in the \n     fight against terrorism is directly related to the strength \n     of our relationship with our State and local partners.'';\n       (6) a 2003 study of the 44 largest metropolitan police \n     departments found that 27 of them have reduced force levels;\n       (7) shortages of officers and increased homeland security \n     duties has forced many local police agencies to rely on \n     overtime and abandon effective, preventative policing \n     practices. And, as a result police chiefs from around the \n     nation are reporting increased gang activity and other \n     troubling crime indicators,\n       (8) several studies have concluded that the implementation \n     of community policing as a law enforcement strategy is an \n     important factor in the reduction of crime in our \n     communities;\n       (9) In addition, experts at the Brookings Institute have \n     concluded that community policing programs are critical to \n     our success in the war against terrorism.\n       (10) the continuation and full funding of the COPS program \n     through fiscal year 2010 is supported by several major law \n     enforcement organizations, including--\n       (A) the International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n       (B) the International Brotherhood of Police Officers;\n       (C) the Fraternal Order of Police;\n       (D) the National Sheriffs' Association;\n       (E) the National Troopers Coalition;\n       (F) the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n       (G) the National Association of Police Organizations;\n       (H) the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \n     Executives;\n       (I) the Police Executive Research Forum; and\n       (J) the Major Cities Chiefs;\n       (11) Congress appropriated $928,912,000 for the COPS \n     program for fiscal year 2003, $756,283,000 for fiscal year \n     2004, and $499,364,000 for fiscal year 2005, and (12) the \n     President requested $117,781, 000 for the COPS program for \n     fiscal year 2006, $381,583,000 less than the amount \n     appropriated for fiscal year 2004.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that an increase of \n     $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 for the Department of \n     Justice's community oriented policing program will be \n     provided without reduction and consistent with previous \n     appropriated and authorized levels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 152.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 68 percent by 2078;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.3 percent by 2078;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2004 dollars or \n     $3,700,000,000,000 measured in present value terms; and\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2004 to 6.6 percent in 2078; and\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \n     Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \n     the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security have all \n     warned that failure to enact fiscally responsible Social \n     Security reform quickly will result in 1 or more of the \n     following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress, and the American people \n     including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system;\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security system; and\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations including the disabled and survivors; \n     and\n       (3) the Senate should honor section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 153.

Res. 18, setting forth the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2006 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n2005 and 2007 through 2010; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILDREN WITH HIV/\n                   AIDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 2,200,000 million children under the age \n     of 15 are infected with the HIV virus, and 1,900 children \n     worldwide are infected with HIV each day.\n       (2) In 2004, it was estimated that of the 4,900,000 people \n     newly infected with HIV, 640,000 were children. The vast \n     majority of them were infected through mother-to-child \n     transmission, which includes transmission at any point during \n     pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding.\n       (3) Effective implementation of prevention of mother-to-\n     child transmission of HIV and care and treatment services in \n     the United States has resulted in the near elimination (less \n     than 2 percent transmission) of mother-to-child transmission \n     of HIV/AIDS. By contrast, in resource-poor settings less than \n     10 percent of pregnant women living with HIV have access to \n     services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n       (4) Currently, more than 4,000,000 children worldwide are \n     estimated to have died from AIDS.\n       (5) In 2004, approximately 510,000 children died of AIDS, \n     resulting in almost 1,400 AIDS deaths in children per day.\n       (6) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/\n     AIDS, if current trends continue by 2010, 3,500,000 of the \n     45,000,000 people infected worldwide will be children under \n     the age of 15.\n       (7) At least a quarter of newborns infected with HIV die \n     before the age of one, up to 60 percent die before reaching \n     their second birthday, and overall, most die before they are \n     5 years of age.\n       (8) HIV threatens to reverse the child survival and \n     developmental gains of past decades.\n       (9) Research and practice have shown conclusively that \n     timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy to infants or \n     young children with HIV/AIDS can preserve or restore their \n     immune functions, promote normal growth and development, and \n     prolong life.\n       (10) There is clear evidence in resource-rich countries \n     that antiretroviral treatment in children is very effective. \n     For example, many children who were infected through mother-\n     to-child transmission in the United States are living with \n     HIV as young adults.\n       (11) Few programs specifically target the treatment of \n     children with HIV/AIDS in resource-poor countries due to \n     significant challenges in diagnosing and treating infants and \n     young children with HIV. Such challenges include difficulty \n     in diagnosing HIV in infants less than 18 months of age, lack \n     of appropriate and affordable pediatric HIV/AIDS medicines, \n     and lack of trained health care providers.\n       (12) Children are not small adults and treating them as \n     such can seriously jeopardize their health.\n       (13) Children should not be forgotten in the fight against \n     the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that--\n       (1)(A) assistance should be provided to support the \n     expansion of programs to prevent\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\n     mother-to-child transmission of HIV as an integral component \n     of a comprehensive approach to fighting HIV/AIDS;\n       (B) to facilitate the expansion described in subparagraph \n     (A)--\n       (i) more resources are needed for infrastructure \n     improvements and education and training of health care \n     workers; and\n       (ii) better linkages between mother-to-child transmission \n     and broader care and treatment programs should be created for \n     women, children, and families who are in need of access to \n     expanded services;\n       (2) assistance should be provided to support the care and \n     treatment of children with HIV/AIDS, including the \n     development and purchase of high-quality, low-cost pediatric \n     formulations of antiretroviral drugs and other HIV/AIDS \n     medicines, including fixed-dose combinations, pediatric-\n     specific training to doctors and other health-care personnel, \n     and the purchase of pediatric-appropriate technologies;\n       (3) all antiretroviral drugs need precise and simplified \n     dosing guidelines for all pediatric age groups, including \n     infants, and all HIV/AIDS drugs including those developed for \n     children should be made available at drastically-reduced \n     prices in resource-poor countries;\n       (4) health care sites in resource-poor countries need \n     better diagnostic capacity and appropriate supplies to \n     provide care and treatment services for children, and \n     additional training is required to ensure that all health \n     care providers can administer specialized care services for \n     children, including psychosocial support; and\n       (5) pediatric care and treatment should be integrated into \n     the existing health care framework so children and families \n     can be treated simultaneously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 154.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE REDUCTION OF CHILD \n                   POVERTY.\n\n       (a) Findings--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       1. Nearly 13 million American children younger than 18--\n     nearly one in five--live below the poverty line;\n       2. The parents of poor children are playing by the rules \n     and still can't get ahead since seven out of ten poor \n     children live in a working family, and almost one poor child \n     in three lives with a full-time year-round worker;\n       3. Poor children are at least twice as likely as non-poor \n     children to suffer stunted growth or lead poisoning, or to be \n     kept back in school; poor children score significantly lower \n     on reading, math, and vocabulary tests when compared with \n     otherwise-similar non-poor children; and more than half of \n     poor Americans experience serious deprivations during the \n     year, including lack of food, utility shutoffs, crowded or \n     substandard housing, or lack of a stove or refrigerator.\n       4. Eighteen percent of children are hungry or on the verge \n     of hunger--largely because they are living in poverty. Hungry \n     children lack nutrients vital to healthy brain development; \n     have difficulty focusing their attention and concentrating in \n     school; often have greater emotional and behavioral problems; \n     have weaker immune systems and are more susceptible to \n     infections, including anemia; and often suffer from obesity;\n       5. Child poverty has risen significantly--by 1.3 million--\n     since 2000.\n       6. The poverty rate for children in the United States is \n     substantially higher than that of other major industrialized \n     nations.\n       7. America's children are more likely to live in poverty \n     than Americans in any other age group.\n       8. African-American and Latino children are much more \n     likely to live in poverty than white children. One third of \n     African-American children are low-income, as are nearly a \n     third of Latino children.\n       9. Great Britain made a public commitment to cut child \n     poverty in half in 10 years, and end child poverty by 2020, \n     and they have already successfully lifted 2 million children \n     out of poverty.\n       10. Poverty is a moral issue and the Congress has a moral \n     obligation to address it.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the functional totals in this resolution assume that the \n     United States shall set a national goal of cutting child \n     poverty in half within a decade, and eliminating it entirely \n     as soon as possible thereafter; that funds should be raised \n     through a one percent surtax on income over $1 million for \n     joint filers, or over $500,000 for single filers to help \n     achieve that goal; that the revenue raised is to be \n     designated to a child poverty elimination fund and overseen \n     by a child poverty elimination board, which shall design the \n     poverty reduction program, set annual child poverty reduction \n     targets, and recommend allocation of funds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 167.

UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO GLOBAL HIV/AIDS, \n                   TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached staggering \n     proportions. At the end of 2004, an estimated 40,000,000 \n     people were infected with HIV or living with AIDS. HIV/AIDS \n     is estimated to kill 3,000,000 men, women and children each \n     year. Each year, there are estimated to be 5,000,000 new HIV \n     infections.\n       (2) The United States was the first, and remains the \n     largest, contributor to the Global Fund.\n       (3) The Presidential Administration of George W. Bush \n     (referred to in this section\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\n     as the ``Administration'') has supported language in the \n     Global HIV/AIDS authorization bill that links United States \n     contributions to the Global Fund to the contributions of \n     other donors, permitting the United States to provide 33 \n     percent of all donations, which would match contributions on \n     a one-to-two basis.\n       (4) Congress has provided one-third of all donations to the \n     Global Fund every year of the Fund's existence.\n       (5) For fiscal year 2006, the Global Fund estimates it will \n     renew $2,400,000,000 worth of effective programs that are \n     already operating on the ground, and the Administration and \n     Fund Board have said that renewals of existing grants should \n     receive priority funding.\n       (6) The Global Fund is an important component of United \n     States efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and \n     supports approximately 300 projects in 130 countries.\n       (7) For fiscal year 2006, the President has requested \n     $300,000,000 for the United States contribution to the Global \n     Fund.\n       (8) Through a mid-year review process, Congress and the \n     Administration will assess contributions to date and \n     anticipated contributions to the Global Fund, and ensure that \n     United States contributions, at year-end, are at the \n     appropriate one-to-two ratio.\n       (9) Congress and the Administration will monitor \n     contributions to the Global Fund to ensure that United States \n     contributions do not exceed one-third of the Global Fund's \n     revenues.\n       (10) In order to cover one-third of renewals during fiscal \n     year 2006, and to maintain the one-to-two funding match, the \n     United States will need to contribute an additional \n     $500,000,000 above the President's request for the Global \n     Fund for fiscal year 2006 to keep good programs funded at a \n     level of $800,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this budget resolution assume \n     that none of the offsets needed to provide $800,000,000 for \n     the Global Fund will come from international humanitarian \n     assistance programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 170.

Mr. President, I have an amendment that I just sent to \nthe desk. It is pending. I will not call it up now or ask unanimous \nconsent, but I will do so at some point, probably tomorrow. I want to \ntake this time to at least lay out the reasons for this amendment and \nwhat it does, because I know what the crunch will be like tomorrow when \nwe come back here.\n  The budget resolution for fiscal year 2006 basically eliminates \nfunding for an enormously effective and popular education program \ncalled the Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act. The \nstraightforward purposes of my amendment, which I will offer for \nmyself, Senator Durbin, Senator Murray, and others, are, first, to \nrestore funding to the Perkins Vocational Education Act; second, to \nreduce the deficit; and, third, to offset the costs by rescinding two \ntax-cut provisions in the 2001 tax bill.\n  These tax-cut provisions, the so-called PEP and Pease phaseout \nprovisions, are scheduled to start taking effect next year for the \nfirst time.\n  President Kennedy used to say that to govern is to choose. Right now \nthe budget resolution chooses very unwisely. It eliminates funding for \na critical education program, vocational education, while allowing to \nstand two new tax cuts. While these two new tax cuts cost $23 billion \nin the first 5 years, after that the costs explode. They will cost at \nleast $146 billion in lost revenue in the coming decade, with 97 \npercent of the benefits going to those earning at least $200,000 a \nyear.\n  This is the wrong choice. The budget resolution does not reflect the \npriorities of the American people. Overall, the budget resolution would \ncut funding for education, the first cut in education funding in 10 \nyears. It underfunds the President's No Child Left Behind Act by $12 \nbillion. It leaves behind nearly 3 million children who could be fully \nfunded and fully served if title I were funded at the authorized level. \nAnd, as I said, it eliminates all the funding for the Perkins \nVocational Education Act.\n  This is one I am particularly concerned about. It is a program that \nwas just reauthorized in the Senate on a bipartisan basis by a vote of \n99 to 0. The Perkins Act makes possible a broad range of vocational and \ntechnical education programs for millions of young people and adults. \nIt is a true lifeline for students at risk of dropping out of school.\n  For millions of these at-risk students, vocational education programs \nare relevant, and they are meaningful. They give kids a reason to stick \nit out until graduation, maybe to go on to a community college, and \nthey lead to good, solid jobs.\n  In Iowa alone, elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education \nProgram would impact 93,000 high school students and more than 37,000 \ncommunity college students. The impact nationwide would be a disaster \nfor millions of students.\n  We are eliminating the Perkins Vocational Education Program for two \nnew tax cuts? Overwhelmingly for the most affluent? This makes no \nsense. In fact, it borders on the obscene.\n  Our friends on the other side might claim the budget resolution does \nnot expressly eliminate the vocational education program, but the \nreality is this budget resolution effectively endorses the budget \nproposed by President Bush, and President Bush endorsed eliminating the \nPerkins program.\n  So there are only two ways to retain funding for vocational education \nunder this budget resolution: either cut other educational programs or \nincrease the overall allocation for education.\n  This chart here shows what I mean. Right here basically you have a \npuzzle. We put it all together. This is education. We have title I, we \nhave afterschool centers, we have special ed, bilingual ed, impact aid, \nPell grants--all the things that make up our education plan.\n  What is left out? Vocational education, ed tech, TRIO, Safe and Drug-\nfree Schools, arts education. These are left out.\n  Someone on the Budget Committee might say, we didn't say that voc ed \ncouldn't be funded, but here are all the things we fund. If you want to \nput voc ed back into the puzzle, what do you take out? Because, you \nsee, this is the limit. We only have this much money. If you put voc ed \nin, do we take the money away from title I or do we take it away from \nPell grants? How about special ed; do we take money away from special \ned to put it back in? Or do we make the square bigger and then put it \nin, so we don't take anything away from the educational programs that \nare already there.\n  That is exactly what my amendment accomplishes. We add more overall \nfunding to the educational budget. How do we do this? Where do we get \nthe money? My amendment offsets the cost of restoring the Perkins \nprogram. It also reduces the deficit by rescinding two tax cuts that \nhave not even taken effect yet. Both of these tax cuts, the so-called \nPEP and Pease provisions, were enacted in 2001 and they start next \nyear.\n  We have a unique opportunity. We are not proposing to repeal or undo \na tax cut that is already in effect. Rather, we are saying that because \nof radically transformed budgetary circumstances--that is the huge debt \nwe are in, the deficits we are running up--we are not going to go \nforward with two new tax cuts that haven't even taken effect yet, two \nnew tax cuts we can no longer afford.\n  When PEP and Pease were put in in 2000, the argument was made that we \nhad all of these budget surpluses that were left over from President \nClinton, and we could afford it. That was then and this is now.\n  Because of the surge in Federal spending, because of the deficits \nsince President Bush has taken office, the surpluses left by President \nClinton are gone. Instead, we are looking at projected deficits in \nexcess of $200 billion a year, and annual deficits in excess of $500 \nbillion a year decades from now, unless we straighten out our house.\n  It makes good sense to stop these two new tax cuts from going into \neffect next year--$146 billion that this will cost us over 10 years.\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\n  Who gets the gravy? Here it is right here. Under PEP and Pease, the \ntax cuts that start next year, for those making over $1 million, when \nthey are phased in, $19,234 a year; $500,000 to $1 million, $4,000 a \nyear; under $75,000 a year, you get nothing, zero.\n  In fact, if these two new tax cuts go into effect next year, 97 \npercent of all the benefits will go to people making over $200,000 a \nyear. Fifty-four percent will go to people making over $1 million a \nyear. We can't afford these tax cuts.\n  There are two things we can't afford. We can't afford these tax cuts, \nand we can't afford to underfund and to eliminate the Perkins \nvocational education bill.\n  We now have a unique opportunity to rescind these tax cuts before \nthey even go into effect.\n  The Perkins program is a lifeline to low-income Americans struggling \nto obtain job skills, the essential rung on the ladder of opportunity.\n  I also refer to this editorial that was in the Washington Post, \nFebruary 22, last month. ``PEP, Pease, Presidents.''\n  I will refer to this. It says:\n\n       The cuts would repeal two provisions enacted as part of the \n     first President Bush's deficit reduction plan. The \n     provisions--known as PEP, for Personal Exemption Phaseout, \n     and Pease, for its author, the late Rep. Donald J. Pease of \n     Ohio--essentially make more income of wealthy Americans \n     subject to taxation.\n\n  As they said:\n\n       Given the deficits that have piled up on his watch, and the \n     growing costs of war in Iraq, it makes sense to ask: Why does \n     President Bush think this tax break is necessary?\n\n  It is not necessary. It hasn't even started yet. I will lay 10 to 1 \nthat not one Senator in this Senate on either side of the aisle has \never been contacted by someone making over $200,000 a year who says we \nhave to have it. Nonsense.\n  My amendment basically says we are not repealing these, we are just \nsaying these two tax cuts won't go into effect next year. We will save \na lot of money. We will put that money into deficit reduction, and we \nwill put the money into restoring Perkins funding.\n  We just recently voted 99 to 0 to reauthorize the Perkins program. \nEvery Senator said, yes, we need vocational education. The President \nsends his budget out and says get rid of the whole thing. And this \nbudget has the same money figures in it for education that the \nPresident wants.\n  Now is our opportunity. We can vote to not let these tax cuts go into \neffect. We can do two good things: Reduce the deficit and make sure we \ncontinue with vocational education in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nWashington Post editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 2005]\n\n                         PEP, Pease, Presidents\n\n       Here's a modest tax proposal for President Bush: Cancel two \n     tax-cut provisions that haven't yet taken effect. These tax \n     cuts weren't part of Mr. Bush's original tax proposal but \n     were inserted into his 2001 tax package. They begin to phase \n     in next year unless Congress acts. And 97 percent of the cuts \n     will go to the 4 percent of U.S. households with incomes \n     greater than $200,000; more than half to the 0.2 percent of \n     households with annual incomes of more than $1 million. \n     During the first 10 years they are fully in effect, they will \n     reduce government tax revenue by close to $200 billion, \n     including interest, and possibly much more it, as the \n     administation has promised, there are adjustments to the \n     alternative minimum tax (which would otherwise recapture some \n     of taxpayers' savings from these breaks).\n       The cuts would repeal two provisions enacted as part of the \n     first President Bush's deficit reduction plan. The \n     provisions--known as PEP, for Personal Exemption Phaseout, \n     and Pease, for its author, the late Rep. Donald J. Pease (D-\n     Ohio)--essentially make more income of wealthy Americans \n     subject to taxation. In a perfect tax world, PEP and Pease \n     would be abolished. They are complex and at times unfair (for \n     example, PEP penalizes those with larger families). PEP and \n     Pease would be great candidates for change in the broader tax \n     overhaul Mr. Bush is planning.\n       But of all the complicated tax provisions in the most \n     complicated tax code in the developed world, why repeal these \n     two? After all, even if PEP and Pease were untouched, \n     wealthier taxpayers would reap big benefits from the \n     remaining tax cuts. For example, in 2010, when the repeal is \n     to be fully effective, households with incomes of more than \n     $1 million will get tax cuts averaging $108,000 from other \n     tax provisions adopted in 2001 and 2003, according to \n     calculations by the Tax Policy Center. With the effect of \n     estate tax repeal, this group will reap average cuts of \n     $133,000. Getting rid of PEP and Pease brings that total to \n     $152,000.\n       Given the deficits that have piled up on his watch, and the \n     growing costs of war in Iraq, it makes sense to ask: Why does \n     President Bush think this tax break is necessary?\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, President Kennedy used to say that ``to \ngovern is to choose.'' Right now, the budget resolution chooses very \nunwisely. It eliminates funding for a critical education program: the \nPerkins act, while allowing to stand two new tax cuts worth. While \nthese two new tax cuts cost $23 billion in the coming 5 years, the \ncosts explode after that. They will cost at least $146 billion in the \ncoming decade--with 97 percent of the benefits going to those earning \nat least $200,000 a year.\n  This is the wrong choice. The budget resolution does not reflect the \npriorities of the American people. In fact, it doesn't reflect what \nPresident Bush says are among his top priorities. Overall, the budget \nresolution would cut funding for education--the first cut in education \nfunding in 10 years. It underfunds the President's No Child Left Behind \nAct by $12 billion. It leaves behind nearly 3 million children who \ncould be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the \nauthorized level. It underfunds special education by $3.6 billion--just \n3 months after the President signed a new IDEA reauthorization law. And \nit eliminates all funding for vocational education, school counselors, \neducation technology, safe and drug-free schools, and 44 other \neducation programs totaling over $4 billion.\n  I am particularly concerned that the budget resolution totally \neliminates funding for the Perkins vocational education program--a \nprogram that was just reauthorized in the Senate on a bipartisan basis.\n  The Perkins Act makes possible a broad range of vocational and \ntechnical education programs for millions of young people and adults. \nVocational education combines classroom instruction, hands-on-\nlaboratory work, and on-the-job training. This is a true lifeline for \nstudents at risk of dropping out of school.\n  For millions of these at-risk students, vocational education programs \nare relevant. They are meaningful. They give kids a reason to stick it \nout until graduation and perhaps go on to community college. And they \nlead to good, solid jobs after graduation.\n  Just last week, I met with high school and community college students \nfrom Iowa who have benefited from Perkins funding. They are truly an \ninspiration--and I hate to think of their fate if they had not been \ngiven the option of vocational and technical education. But that is \nexactly what will happen if the budget resolution is not changed. In \nIowa alone, elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education program \nwould directly impact 93,000 high school students and more than 37,000 \ncommunity college students. The impact nationwide would be a disaster \nfor many millions of students.\n  And we are eliminating this program to make room for two new tax \ncuts, overwhelmingly for the most affluent? This makes no sense. In \nfact, it borders on the obscene.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle claim that the budget \nresolution doesn't expressly eliminate the vocational education \nprogram. That is too clever by half. The reality is that the budget \nresolution effectively endorses the budget proposed by President Bush--\nand that means it endorses the elimination of Perkins funding.\n  There are only two ways to retain funding for vocational education \nunder this budget resolution: By cutting other education programs \ninstead . . . or by increasing the overall allocation for education.\n  This chart shows what I mean. The puzzle represents the Republican \nbudget resolution. Unfortunately, there are a lot of pieces that don't \nfit. There's no room in the budget resolution for vocational education, \ntechnical education, TRIO, and many other programs. The only way to \ninclude funding for vocational education is to take out a different \npiece of the puzzle. So what pieces do the Republicans propose to take \nout in lieu of vocational education? Do they want to cut Title I? Pell \nGrants? Special education?\n  The truth is that the only way we can be assured of saving Perkins \nfunding is by adding more overall funding\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nto the education budget for that purpose. And that is exactly what my \namendment accomplishes.\n  As I said, my amendment offsets the cost of restoring Perkins--and it \nreduces the deficit, as well--by rescinding two tax cuts that have not \nyet taken effect. Both of these tax cuts--the so-called PEP and Pease \nprovisions--were enacted in 2001. One of these tax measures repeals the \nlaw enacted in 1990 that scales back the magnitude of itemized \ndeductions that high-income taxpayers can take. The second tax-cut \nmeasure repeals another provision enacted in 1990, under which the \npersonal exemption is phased out for households with very high incomes. \nUnder the 2001 tax cut legislation, these two current provisions of law \nbegin to be phased out next year, and are eliminated entirely in 2010.\n\n  We have a unique opportunity, here, because we are not proposing to \nrepeal or un-do tax cuts that are already in effect. Rather, we are \nsaying that--because of radically transformed budgetary circumstances--\nwe are not going to go forward with two new tax cuts that have not yet \ntaken effect. . . two new tax cuts that we can no longer afford.\n  When the PEP and Pease phase-out provisions were passed in 2001, a \ncase could be made--I disagreed, but certainly a case could be made--\nthat these tax cuts were affordable. Thanks to the budget surpluses \nthat President Bush inherited from President Clinton, we were looking \nat cumulative surpluses of $5 trillion over the coming decade, enough \nto eliminate the national debt, and then some. The chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, publicly worried about the \nimpending surplus crisis--What in the world would we do with all these \nsurpluses after we eliminated the national debt? Moreover, President \nBush and other advocates of the 2001 tax cuts assured us that they \nwould total no more than $1.35 trillion between 2001 and 2010.\n  Well that was then, and this is now. The tax cuts that were supposed \nto cost $1.35 trillion are now projected to cost more than $2 trillion \nin the decade after 2010. And because of the surge in federal spending \nsince President Bush took office--including the creation of a huge new \nentitlement program--the surpluses bequeathed by President Clinton are \ngone. Instead, we are looking at projected deficits in excess of $200 \nbillion each year as far as the eye can see--and annual deficits in \nexcess of $500 billion a year a decade from now if we follow the \nPresident's recommendations.\n  It makes good sense to eliminate these two tax cuts. The fact is, \nthey are a ticking timebomb scheduled to detonate after 2010--a \ndetonation that will further explode the deficits and debt. The revenue \nloss because of the PEP and Pease phase-outs would be a relatively \nmodest $24 billion over the first 5 years. But the revenue loss \nexplodes in the years after that. In the first 10 years after full \nimplementation, the revenue loss will be a whopping $146 billion.\n  And who gets these tax cuts? According to the Tax Policy Center of \nthe Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, 54 percent of the \nbenefits go to households earning more than $1 million a year. Fully 97 \npercent of benefits go to households making more than $200,000 per \nyear.\n  What does that mean for a taxpayer? When the phase out is fully \nphased in by 2010, the tax cut will save the average taxpayer making \nover $1 million nearly $20,000 per year.\n  But almost no taxpayers making less than $150,000 will receive even a \npenny of tax cuts under these provisions.\n  These are two tax cuts that we cannot afford. They are two tax cuts \nthat their beneficiaries do not need.\n  The deficits and debt are exploding because of actions by the \nPresident and Congress. To quote the cartoon character Pogo: ``We have \nmet the enemy, and he is us.'' But we now have this unique opportunity \nto rescind two unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts before they take \neffect.\n  Such a modest mid-course correction is exactly what President Ronald \nReagan did in 1982. He realized that his 1981 tax cuts had overshot, \nand that they were projected to cause the kind of monster deficits we \nare experiencing today. President Reagan did the prudent and \nresponsible thing: he pared back some of his tax cuts. Today, we need \nto show that same kind of restraint by not allowing the PEP and Pease \nprovisions to go forward.\n  The difference, or course, is that President Reagan repealed tax cuts \nthat had already taken effect. What we are proposing, today, is simply \nto not allow two new tax cuts to go forward--tax cuts that haven't yet \ntaken effect.\n  The Perkins program is a lifeline to low-income Americans struggling \nto obtain marketable job skills. It is an essential rung on the ladder \nof opportunity that we extend to our young people.\n  So I come back to President Kennedy's remark that ``to govern is to \nchoose.'' We can't have it all. We must choose. And today we are \nconfronted with this choice. We can go forward with these two new tax \ncuts, overwhelmingly for people who don't need them, while eliminating \nPerkins funding for vocational education. Or we can say, ``Two trillion \ndollars in tax cuts, mostly for the affluent, is surely enough. Let's \nrescind these two new tax cuts before they go into effect. And let's \nredirect that money to education. . . to giving millions of young \nAmericans the vocational skills they need to succeed in the global \neconomy.''\n  Certainly, all who favor creating an opportunity society should be in \nfavor of this amendment. So should all who believe in basic fairness \nand equity.\n  Indeed, if all the millionaires who stand to benefit from these two \nnew tax cuts were here in this chamber, today, and voting on this \namendment, there is no doubt in my mind that the vast majority of them \nwould vote ``yes.'' They would say, ``We have already made it. America \nhas already blessed us with wealth and comfort. By all means, withhold \nthese latest tax cuts, and redirect that money to vocational education \nstudents so they can graduate, so they can have opportunity, so they \ncan achieve the American dream as we did.''\n  Let's restore Perkins funding and let's reduce the deficit. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in a resounding, bipartisan vote on this \namendment. We voted 99-0 to reauthorize the Perkins program. Now let's \nvote to keep this proven, effective program alive and thriving for \nmillions of students across America.\n  I will close by saying I hope we will get this amendment up for a \nvote tomorrow so Senators can express themselves on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/15/senate-section/article/S2757-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
