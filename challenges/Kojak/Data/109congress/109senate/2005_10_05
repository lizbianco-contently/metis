Mr. President, shortly we will resume debate on the \nDefense appropriations bill. We began consideration on that bill last \nThursday. Since that time, Members have had Thursday night, Friday, and \nall day Monday. We were here all day Monday, all day yesterday, \nTuesday, to offer amendments. We will continue with the amendment \nprocess through today.\n  As I have announced previously, we will stack votes beginning at \nsometime around 7:30 this evening to accommodate observance of the \nJewish holiday. As I have said from the outset, our intentions are we \nwill finish the Department of Defense appropriations bill this week \nprior to going out on our week-long recess. It is a critically \nimportant bill, something we will finish this week.\n  Last night, I did file cloture on the bill. I filed in order to \nensure we finish the bill this week in an orderly way. Everyone has had \nthe opportunity for the last 3 or 4 days to come forward and offer \namendments. We will vote on those amendments tonight, and then we would \nhave the cloture vote tomorrow morning.\n  Again, I encourage, as I have every day for the last several days, \nMembers to come to the Senate and offer those amendments so we can vote \non them. We have had more than 100 amendments filed. It is imperative \nthat the Senators who are serious about their amendments and want them \nconsidered come forward and work with the managers over the course of \nthis morning and not wait until tonight. We will finish the bill this \nweek.\n  As a reminder, we will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the weekly \nparty luncheons.\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\n  Let me turn to the Democratic leader on anything on the schedule \nbefore I make a very brief statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11060-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my staff received a telephone call this \nmorning, less than an hour ago, indicating Ambassador Negroponte would \nnot be coming today because the leader or his people indicated he \nshouldn't come.\n  We have these very important elections taking place in Iraq on \nOctober 15. This is an opportunity for Members to visit with Ambassador \nNegroponte, who is, if not the expert on what is going on in Iraq, \ncertainly one of the two or three top people in the world to tell \nMembers what is going on there. This briefing is open to all Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans. There certainly is no reason we should not \nbe able to do that. It is an important oversight responsibility we \nhave.\n  I hope the distinguished Republican leader has not been part of \ntelling Negroponte and his people not to come up here for that briefing \nat 3 to 4 o'clock. I had a meeting this morning at 9 o'clock. I invited \nall Senators to come who were with me. We are going to have good \nattendance at that meeting. This is not a meeting in any way to do with \nanything other than find out what is going on. We have a responsibility \nto find out what is going on. I would like to have the Ambassador come \noften. I don't know why we can't go ahead with this briefing.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with regard to a briefing which was \ninitiated on a partisan basis by the other side of the aisle in spite \nof their knowledge that we do have an all-Senate briefing that is \nbipartisan in the tradition--we have had over 20 different briefings, \nincluding one very useful one last week, one the week prior to that. On \na partisan basis, an all-Senate briefing was scheduled; a counteroffer \nwas made. We already have a meeting scheduled with the Ambassador here \nin 2 to 3 weeks.\n  I will continue to work with the Democratic leader coming back and \nforth. These all-Senator briefings we have, which are on a classified \nbasis, have proven to be a very useful vehicle for all Senators to \nparticipate, to be able to ask questions of various representatives, \nand is a very good model.\n  I will continue to work with the Democratic leader. As he knows, \nAmbassador Negroponte is coming in about 2\\1/2\\ or 3 weeks--I don't \nknow exactly what that date is for that particular all-Senate briefing \ninitiated on a bipartisan basis and not on a partisan basis, which this \nlast meeting was.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Republican leader \nhas a statement to make, but just on this subject, on a more personal \nbasis, the Republican leader and I had a number of meetings the last \nseveral weeks, certainly the last few days, and this issue has never \nbeen raised.\n  I don't see how we can have too many briefings on what is going on in \nIraq. Negroponte has simply not been here. I have the greatest respect \nfor him, but in a briefing--in 2 or 3 weeks, the elections will have \nbeen over in Iraq. That is one of the reasons people are losing faith \nin what is going on in Iraq--because we do not have the information to \nconvey to the people. The administration says just stay the course. We \nwant information.\n  Negroponte, if he is told by the Republican leader not to come, he is \nnot going to come. It is too bad. It is a perfect day for this. The \nJewish holiday is still on. Most Members would have the opportunity to \ncome here. Senator Lieberman and a couple of others would not be able \nto, but we already have on my side about 20 Senators willing and \nwanting to come.\n  I am disappointed this will now have to become a political issue. It \nshouldn't. I like Negroponte. He is good. He is good for the country. I \ntold the President personally that this was a great choice he made to \nlead this new intelligence agency.\n  There is no need to belabor the point other than to say I am terribly \ndisappointed that my Senators--and anyone else on the other side of the \naisle--want to come and listen to a presentation prior to the elections \nand now are going to be unable to have this briefing. That is too bad.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am a bit offended when the Democratic \nleader knows last week we had defense, we had Generals Myers, Abizaid, \nand Casey brief Members extensively in a bipartisan way in a tradition \nwe have set up that is working very well. We have the Secretary of \nState, which he knows, coming on October 19 to have a very similar \nbriefing, addressing issues in Iraq, in Afghanistan. And Negroponte is \ncoming, as I said, the following week.\n\n  So we will work together. I do want to make it clear their invitation \nwas initiated in a partisan way, with a letter I was not a part of, not \nasked to be a part of, in the letter itself, the initial letter. I \nthink we need to continue to work together to continue these briefings, \nwhich are very important, as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11060-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROSH HASHANAH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the Jewish \nholiday at this juncture, if I might.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the Jewish holiday of Rosh \nHashanah and to reflect on the importance of Israel to the Jewish \npeople and the United States.\n  Rosh Hashanah, also called the Jewish New Year, began Monday evening. \nJews all across the globe flocked to their synagogues, prepared \nceremonial meals, and set aside special time with family to mark the \noccasion.\n  Rosh Hashanah celebrates the anniversary of the creation of the \nworld. It is a time for contemplation and prayer, a day to look forward \nto the year ahead, to reflect on past deeds, and to ask for God's \nforgiveness.\n  Rosh Hashanah is followed by Yom Kippur, the most solemn occasion on \nthe Jewish calendar. Beginning on the 10th day of Tishri--the evening \nof October 12--the Jewish people will observe a day of fasting, of \nprayer, and reflection. And as with every year, they will end the \nannual rite with the words: ``Next Year in Jerusalem.''\n  Israel, and the city of Jerusalem, a city that both major parties \nrecognize as its capital, is the birthplace to three of the world's \ngreat religions. It is rich in tradition, history, and culture, all of \nwhich truly touches the soul.\n  From the mountains of the Golan to the port of Eilat, Israel's \nnatural beauty is as diverse as the religions that share its golden \ncity of Jerusalem.\n  A land of economic and scientific innovation, the mysticism of the \npast unites with technology of the future.\n  Perhaps most significantly, Israel is a symbol of the survival of the \nJewish people. It shines as a beacon of hope to Jews all over the \nworld, even as it stands surrounded by a sea of tyrannies.\n  And to the United States, this small and besieged country is a vital \npartner in the war on terror. The struggle it fights every day against \nterrorist forces, within and without its borders, is part of the same \nstruggle our troops fight every day in Iraq and Afghanistan--the same \nstruggle that rocked the island of Bali on Saturday.\n  Reasonable people can and should debate Israel's policies. Serious, \nthoughtful debate is crucial to devising effective and correct \nsolutions. It is the cornerstone of democracy.\n  But we must always distinguish between those who raise legitimate \nquestions about the specific policies of a democratic state and those \nwho use criticism of Israel as a disguise for attacks on the Jewish \npeople.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to reflect on the longstanding \nrelationship, friendship, between the United States and Israel; to wish \nour ally peace and prosperity in the year ahead; and to work to \nstrengthen, deepen, and improve our bond as defenders of freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11060-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11060-S11061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF TIMOTHY SCOTT WINEMAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Timothy Wineman has worked for the Senate \nfor 35 years. On September 28, the Senate noted the outstanding service \nof Tim by adopting S. Res. 258.\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\n  He has spent his entire 35 years of Senate service working in the \nDisbursing Office. That in itself is a commendable feat.\n  In 1970, Tim began his career as a payroll clerk and was promoted to \npayroll supervisor 6 years later. He continued to receive promotions \nand in 1998 became the Senate's financial clerk. Tim's career in the \nDisbursing Office has been stellar. You could always count on Tim and \nhis staff for topnotch service and to accommodate Members and staff.\n  Tim and his wife Pat met in high school, got married, and have two \nchildren, Matthew and Lory. Matt and Lory have provided Tim and Pat \nwith four grandchildren--two boys and two girls.\n  Tim plans to spend the first 6 months trying to get his sea legs, \nenjoying some ``downtime'' with his family and playing a little golf. \nHe and Pat then plan to do some traveling. They want to go to Alaska to \nsee what is happening there.\n  I salute Tim on his service to the Senate and congratulate him on a \njob well done. He certainly was part of the Senate family and always \nwill be. I hope he enjoys his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11061-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IRAQ AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say this. Ambassador Negroponte came \nto the Senate the last time this past May. Did he talk anything about \nwhat was going on with intelligence in Iraq or what was going on in \nIraq, period? No. He talked about international terrorism. It is not as \nif we have been bothering the Ambassador having him come here all the \ntime.\n  But I am disappointed to have to report to the American people this \nis what is going on with this administration: You never get to what the \nissue is. Put it off. Do not talk about it. Stay the course.\n  In Iraq we have some problems: almost 2,000 dead Americans; 15,000, \n16,000 wounded, many of them very badly.\n  I in no way say this to disparage the managers of this bill, one of \nwhom is a winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, Senator Dan \nInouye; the other served valiantly in World War II as a pilot. But \ntheir job would be much easier if they had a Defense authorization bill \nprior to coming here to this floor with an appropriations bill. It \nmakes their job, if not impossible, extremely difficult.\n  Let me explain what I am talking about. You authorize funding in the \nCongress, and then it goes to the all-important Appropriations \nCommittee, and they determine what of the authorization bill deserves \nmoney. That is basically what it amounts to. There has to be some limit \nto spending, and that is what the Appropriation Committee's job is; to \ndetermine whether the money should be spent.\n\n  Well, here there is no authorization bill. There is legislation in \nthe authorization bill that deals with retirement pay for the military, \nwith pay raises for the military, with all kinds of programs for the \nveterans, the National Guard and Reserve. The Appropriations Committee \ndoes not have the benefit of that. They will be working, in effect, on \nlast year's law.\n  I do not know how we could ever--I am sure it has happened sometime \nin the far distant past. I am sure it has happened. I hope it does not \nhappen in the future that they try to do this jury-rigged system, where \nyou take an appropriations bill without having done an authorization \nbill.\n  There are matters in that authorization bill dealing with prisoner \nabuse. A number of people want to offer amendments. They cannot offer \nan amendment on the appropriations bill dealing with prisoner abuse.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, in the Chamber, the \nmover of the legislation to have a look at what has gone on in Abu \nGhraib and other prison facilities the military has. I think the author \nof the bill, Senator McCain from Arizona, may have a little bit of \nexpertise on prisoner of war abuse. I think he may have a little bit of \nauthenticity when he comes before the Senate and says he wants to take \na look at that.\n  John McCain spent years of his life in a prison camp in Vietnam, not \ndays, weeks, months but years--try 5\\1/2\\ years--most of it in solitary \nconfinement. So he wants to offer an amendment. He cannot do it unless \nhe gets unanimous consent that he can have a vote on it. He can offer \nit, but it falls similar to everything else. But I will bet he is going \nto get unanimous consent because we want him to be able to debate this \nissue. Who has more standing than the Senator from Arizona to raise \nthis as an issue?\n  Mr. President, we--I repeat--had a scheduled briefing at 3 o'clock \ntoday to find out what is going on in Iraq dealing with intelligence. \nWe have never, ever had a briefing by Negroponte since he has assumed \nhis duties as head of the so-called DNI on April 21 of this year. We \nhave not been briefed by him on Iraq since he assumed his position. So \nI do not think we are being greedy taking an hour of his time.\n  Ducking debates about our national defense has become too topical and \ntypical in this country because we are unable to bring matters before \nthis floor. No amendments, no votes, no debates--that is not the way to \ndo a bill in the Senate.\n  Why didn't we finish the Defense authorization bill the first time? \nBecause we went to gun liability. So this process is unacceptable. We \nare a nation at war. We have troops in Iraq, in Afghanistan. We have an \nopportunity to have an open, honest debate about our national defense.\n  Our troops and the American people deserve better, and that is not \nwhat we are having here. And the distinguished majority leader said he \nwas offended because I asked for a briefing by the Intelligence \nDirector of this country. Offended? I am sorry he is offended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11061-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, the pending \namendments are set aside for the consideration of this amendment, which \nthe clerk will now report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Smith, and Ms. Collins, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1977.\n\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Relating to persons under the detention, custody, or control \n                    of the United States Government)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR THE INTERROGATION OF PERSONS \n                   UNDER THE DETENTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--No person in the custody or under the \n     effective control of the Department of Defense or under \n     detention in a Department of Defense facility shall be \n     subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not \n     authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field \n     Manual on Intelligence Interrogation.\n       (b) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to with \n     respect to any person in the custody or under the effective \n     control of the Department of Defense pursuant to a criminal \n     law or immigration law of the United States.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect the rights under the United States \n     Constitution of any person in the custody or under the \n     physical jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING \n                   TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT OF PERSONS UNDER \n                   CUSTODY OR CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--No individual in the custody or under the \n     physical control of the United States Government, regardless \n     of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to impose any geographical limitation on the \n     applicability of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment under this section.\n       (c) Limitation on Supersedure.--The provisions of this \n     section shall not be superseded, except by a provision of law \n     enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act which \n     specifically repeals, modifies, or supersedes the provisions \n     of this section.\n       (d) Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n     Defined.--In this section, the term ``cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, \n     and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, \n     Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \n     United States, as defined in the United States Reservations, \n     Declarations and Understandings to the United Nations \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman \n     or Degrading Treatment or Punishment done at New York, \n     December 10, 1984.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would do two things: one, \nestablish the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the \ninterrogation of Department of Defense detainees; and, two, prohibit \ncruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of prisoners in the detention \nof the Government. It is pretty simple and straightforward.\n  Mr. President, I regret, of course, as all my colleagues do, that \nthis amendment has to be brought up on an appropriations bill. We are \nonly doing so because so far we have been unable to get sufficient \nagreement to bring up the Defense authorization bill. I have made it \nvery clear, over a long period of time, my feeling about how important \nit is to take up and complete the authorization bill, but that is a \nsubject for another day. I know good-faith efforts are being made on \nboth sides to try to get the authorization bill up. But that has not \nhappened so, therefore, we are addressing this issue.\n  By the way, I have had a preliminary ruling that this amendment is \ngermane because there is reference made to it in the House version of \nthe appropriations bill.\n  The Senate has an obligation to address the authorizing legislation, \nas it has an obligation to deal with the issue that apparently led to \nthe bill being pulled from the floor, which is America's treatment of \nits detainees.\n  Several weeks ago, I received a letter from CPT Ian Fishback, a \nmember of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, and a veteran of \ncombat in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a West Point graduate. Over 17 \nmonths, he struggled to get answers from his chain of command to a \nbasic question: What standards apply to the treatment of enemy \ndetainees? But he found no answers.\n  In his remarkable letter, he pleads with Congress, asking us to take \naction to establish standards to clear up the confusion, not for the \ngood of the terrorists but for the good of our soldiers and our \ncountry. Captain Fishback closes his letter by saying:\n\n       I strongly urge you to do justice to your men and women in \n     uniform. Give them clear standards of conduct that reflect \n     the ideals they risk their lives for.\n\n  This comes from a young captain in the U.S. Army who has served his \ncountry both in Iraq and Afghanistan and who says it in a far more \neloquent fashion than I have ever been able to. By the way, I thank God \nevery day that we have men and women the caliber of Captain Fishback \nserving in our military. I believe the Congress has a responsibility to \nanswer this call, a call that has come not just from this one brave \nsoldier but from so many of our men and women in uniform. We owe it to \nthem. We sent them to fight for us in Afghanistan and Iraq. We placed \nextraordinary pressure on them to extract intelligence from detainees, \nbut then we threw out the rules that our soldiers had trained on and \nreplaced them with a confusing and constantly changing array of \nstandards. We demanded intelligence without ever clearly telling our \ntroops what was permitted and what was forbidden. And when things went \nwrong, we blamed them, and we punished them. I believe we have to do \nbetter than that.\n  I can understand why some administration lawyers might have wanted \nambiguity so that every hypothetical option is theoretically open, even \nthose the President has said he does not want to exercise. But war \ndoesn't occur in theory, and our troops are not served by ambiguity. \nThey are crying out for clarity. The Congress cannot shrink from this \nduty. We cannot hide our heads, pulling bills from the floor and \navoiding votes. We owe to it our soldiers during this time of war to \ntake a stand. So while I would prefer to offer this amendment to the \nDOD authorization bill, I am left with no choice but to offer it to \nthis appropriations measure. I would note that I am offering this \namendment in accordance with the options afforded under rule XVI of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate.\n  The amendment I am offering combines the two amendments I previously \nfiled to the authorizing measure. To fight terrorism, we need \nintelligence. That much is obvious. What should also be obvious is that \nthe intelligence we collect must be reliable and acquired humanely, \nunder clear standards understood by all our fighting men and women. To \ndo differently would not only offend our values as Americans but \nundermine our war effort, because abuse of prisoners harms, not helps, \nin the war on terror.\n  First, subjecting prisoners to abuse leads to bad intelligence, \nbecause under torture, a detainee will tell his interrogator anything \nto make the pain stop. Second, mistreatment of our prisoners endangers \nU.S. troops who might be captured by the enemy--if not in this war, \nthen in the next. And third, prisoner abuses exact on us a terrible \ntoll in the war of ideas, because inevitably these abuses become \npublic. When they do, the cruel actions of a few darken the reputation \nof our country in the eyes of millions. American values should win \nagainst all others in any war of ideas, and we can't let prisoner abuse \ntarnish our image. Yet reports of detainee abuse continue to emerge, in \nlarge part, I believe, because of confusion in the field as to what is \npermitted and what is not. This amendment will go a long way toward \nclearing up this confusion.\n\n  The first part of the amendment would establish the Army Field Manual \nas the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of Defense \ndetainees. The Army Field Manual and its various editions have served \nAmerica well through wars against both regular and irregular foes. It \nembodies the values Americans have embraced for generations, while \npreserving the ability of our interrogators to extract critical \nintelligence from ruthless foes. Never has this been more important \nthan today in the midst of the war on terror. The Army Field Manual \nauthorizes interrogation techniques that have proven effective in \nextracting lifesaving information from the most hardened enemy \nprisoners. It is consistent with our laws and, most importantly, our \nvalues. Let's not forget that al-Qaida sought not only to destroy \nAmerican lives on September 11, but American values, our way of life, \nand all we cherish.\n  We fight not just to preserve our lives and liberties, but also \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\nvalues. We will never allow the terrorists to take those away. In this \nwar--that we must win, that we will win--we must never simply fight \nevil with evil.\n  This amendment would establish the Army Field Manual as the standard \nfor interrogation of all detainees held in DOD custody. The manual has \nbeen developed by the executive branch for its own uses, and a new \nedition, written to take into account the needs of the war on terror \nand with a new classified annex, is due to be issued soon. This \namendment would not set the field manual in stone. It could be changed \nat any time.\n  The advantage of setting a standard for interrogation based on the \nfield manual is to cut down on the significant level of confusion that \nstill exists with respect to which interrogation techniques are \nallowed. The Armed Services Committee has held hearings with a slew of \nhigh-level Defense Department officials, from regional commanders to \njudge advocate generals to the Department's deputy general counsel. A \nchief topic of discussion in these hearings was what specific \ninterrogation techniques are permitted, in what environments, with \nwhich DOD detainees, by whom and when. The answers have included a \nwhole lot of confusion. If the Pentagon's top minds can't sort these \nmatters out, after exhaustive debate and preparation, how in the world \ndo we expect our enlisted men and women to do so?\n  Confusion about the rules results in abuses in the field. We need a \nclear, simple, and consistent standard, and we have it in the Army \nField Manual on interrogation. That is not just my opinion but that of \nmany more distinguished military minds than mine. I refer to a letter \nexpressing strong support for this amendment signed by 28 former high-\nranking military officers, including GEN Joseph Hoar, who commanded \nCENTCOM; GEN John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff; RADM John Hutson and RADM Don Guter, who each served as the \nNavy's top JAG; and LTG Claudia Kennedy, who served as Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Army Intelligence. These and other distinguished officers \nbelieve the abuses at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and elsewhere took place \nin part because our soldiers received ambiguous instructions which in \nsome cases authorized treatment that went beyond what the field manual \nallows, and that had the manual been followed across the board, we \ncould have avoided the prisoner abuse scandal.\n  Why wouldn't any of us do whatever we could to have prevented that?\n  By passing this amendment, our servicemembers can follow the manual \nconsistently from now on. Our troops deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from 29 retired military \nofficers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  September, 2005.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We strongly support your proposed \n     amendments to the Defense Department Authorization bill \n     concerning detainee policy, including requiring all \n     interrogations of detainees in DOD custody to conform to the \n     U.S. Army's Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation (FM \n     34-52), and prohibiting the use of torture and cruel, inhuman \n     and degrading treatment by any U.S. government agency.\n       The abuse of prisoners hurts America's cause in the war on \n     terror, endangers U.S. service members who might be captured \n     by the enemy, and is anathema to the values Americans have \n     held dear for generations. For many years, those values have \n     been embodied in the Army Field Manual. The Manual applies \n     the wisdom and experience gained by military interrogators in \n     conflicts against both regular and irregular foes. It \n     authorizes techniques that have proven effective in \n     extracting life-saving information from the most hardened \n     enemy prisoners. It also recognizes that torture and cruel \n     treatment are ineffective methods, because they induce \n     prisoners to say what their interrogators want to hear, \n     even if it is not true, while bringing discredit upon the \n     United States.\n       It is now apparent that the abuse of prisoners in Abu \n     Ghraib, Guantanamo and elsewhere took place in part because \n     our men and women in uniform were given ambiguous \n     instructions, which in some cases authorized treatment that \n     went beyond what was allowed by the Army Field Manual. \n     Administration officials confused matters further by \n     declaring that U.S. personnel are not bound by longstanding \n     prohibitions of cruel treatment when interrogating non-U.S. \n     citizens on foreign soil. As a result, we suddenly had one \n     set of rules for interrogating prisoners of war, and another \n     for ``enemy combatants;'' one set for Guantanamo, and another \n     for Iraq; one set for our military, and another for the CIA. \n     Our service members were denied clear guidance, and left to \n     take the blame when things went wrong. They deserve better \n     than that.\n       The United States should have one standard for \n     interrogating enemy prisoners that is effective, lawful, and \n     humane. Fortunately, America already has the gold standard in \n     the Army Field Manual. Had the Manual been followed across \n     the board, we would have been spared the pain of the prisoner \n     abuse scandal. It should be followed consistently from now \n     on. And when agencies other than DOD detain and interrogate \n     prisoners, there should be no legal loopholes permitting \n     cruel or degrading treatment.\n       The amendments proposed by Senator McCain would achieve \n     these goals while preserving our nation's ability to fight \n     the war on terror. They reflect the experience and highest \n     traditions of the United States military. We urge the \n     Congress to support this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joseph Hoar, USMC (Ret.), General John Shalikashvili, USA \n           (Ret.), General Donn A. Starry, USA (Ret.), Lieutenant \n           General Ron Adams, USA (Ret.), Lieutenant General \n           Robert G. Gard, Jr., USA (Ret.), Lieutenant General Jay \n           M.

Baldock, USN (Ret.), Former Vietnam POW \n           Commander Phillip N. Butler, USN (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The second part of this amendment should not be \nobjectionable to anyone since I am actually not proposing anything new. \nThe prohibition against cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment has \nbeen a long-standing principle in both law and policy in the United \nStates. Before I get into why the amendment is necessary, let me first \nreview the history.\n  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states \nsimply:\n\n       No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which \nthe United States is a signatory, states the same. The binding \nConvention Against Torture, negotiated by the Reagan administration and \nratified by this body, prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment. On last year's DOD authorization bill, the Senate passed a \nbipartisan amendment reaffirming that no detainee in U.S. custody can \nbe subject to torture or cruel treatment, as the U.S. has long defined \nthose terms. All of this seems to be common sense, in accordance with \nlongstanding American values. But since last year's DOD bill, a strange \nlegal determination was made that the prohibition in the Convention \nAgainst Torture against cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment does not \nlegally apply to foreigners held outside the United States. They can \napparently be treated inhumanely. This is the administration's \nposition, even though Judge Abe Soafer, who negotiated the Convention \nAgainst Torture for President Reagan, said in a recent letter that the \nReagan administration never intended the prohibition against cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment to apply only on U.S. soil.\n  What all this means is that America is the only country in the world \nthat asserts a legal right to engage in cruel and inhuman treatment. \nBut the crazy thing is, it is not even necessary because the \nadministration has said it will not engage in cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment as a matter of policy. What this also means is that \nconfusion about the rules becomes rampant again. We have so many \ndiffering legal standards and loopholes that our lawyers and generals \nare confused. Just imagine our troops serving in prison in the field.\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\n  The amendment I am offering simply codifies what is current policy \nand reaffirms what was assumed to be existing law for years. In light \nof the administration's stated commitment, it should require no change \nin our current interrogation and detention practices. What it would do \nis restore clarity on a simple and fundamental question: Does America \ntreat people inhumanely? My answer is no. And from all I have seen, \nAmerica's answer has always been no.\n  I travel a lot around the world, usually at taxpayers' expense. \nEverywhere I go, I encounter this issue of the treatment of prisoners \nand the photos of Abu Ghraib and what is perceived in the world to be \ncontinued mistreatment of prisoners. It is harming our image in the \nworld terribly. We have to clarify that that is not what the United \nStates is all about. That is what makes us different. That is what \nmakes us different from the enemy we are fighting. The most important \nthing about it is not our image abroad but our respect for ourselves at \nhome.\n  Let me close by noting that I hold no brief for the prisoners. I do \nhold a brief for the reputation of the United States of America. We are \nAmericans. We hold ourselves to humane standards of treatment of \npeople, no matter how evil or terrible they may be. To do otherwise \nundermines our security, but it also undermines our greatness as a \nnation. We are not simply any other country. We stand for something \nmore in the world, a moral mission, one of freedom and democracy and \nhuman rights at home and abroad. We are better than these terrorists, \nand we will win. The enemy we fight has no respect for human life or \nhuman rights. They don't deserve our sympathy. But this isn't about who \nthey are; this is about who we are. These are the values that \ndistinguish us from our enemies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a difficult subject to discuss, \nand as the minority leader indicated, no one is more qualified to talk \nabout this than the Senator from Arizona.\n  It is with some trepidation that I try to explain to him the position \nof the administration and with which I happen to agree. The problem is \nnot the goal of the Senator from Arizona; the problem is the way it \nwould be carried out under this amendment. This amendment would require \nthat the field manual be changed. Currently the field manual has a \ngeneral description of the techniques of interrogation, and it allows \nflexibility to determine what will be used in terms of interrogation \ntechniques based upon the circumstances that exist. We know that \nterrorists train their people to deal with the techniques of our \ninterrogation, so those techniques change under various circumstances.\n  One of the situations I would call to the attention of the Senator \nfrom Arizona is as we have visited with our people in the field, now we \nhave a unique circumstance of having multinational and multiagency \nteams that are in the field. The question comes down to who has custody \nor effective control of a person. Particularly I remember one team we \nsaw which had five different nationalities including the intelligence \nagencies and military agencies of those nations. If this becomes law, \nit is my opinion that those teams will be handled so that the United \nStates does not have custody, does not have control, and the kind of \ntreatment we seek will not be given to people who are made prisoners by \nmultinational teams that are searching out terrorists throughout the \nworld.\n  This is a different war now. I believe we are seeing the beginning of \na crusade against freedom from the militant terrorist Islamic entities \nthroughout the world. We see the suicide bombers. We see the people who \nare inflicting terrible damage from Indonesia, the Philippines, to all \nthroughout the Central Command, and we have teams out trying to find \nthese people.\n  Of course, one of their first jobs is to interrogate anyone they \ncapture to try to see if we can find out where the rest of them are and \nhow they are functioning. If this amendment passes, the United States \nwill not have effective control of those people. It will be impossible \nto interrogate under the systems we have used in the past because we \ncannot list in a field manual all of the interrogation techniques that \nwill be used. It takes thousands of pages anyway. But the techniques \nvary upon the circumstances and the physical location of the people \ninvolved.\n  I have some memory from World War II in China when I witnessed some \nof our people--I was just a pilot, but I was conveying some of these \npeople from place to place who had been tortured, and I can tell you \nthey were brutally treated by the Chinese when we were taking these \npeople from place to place and they had prisoners. Some of them were \nnot Chinese. They were prisoners obviously of Japan. We had freed some \nof them, and they were--I have memory that those who were freed were \nstill the responsibility of the United States.\n  But as a practical matter, what do you do with regard to a law that \nsays that all of the techniques must be listed in the field manual; \nregardless of nationality or physical location, if an individual is in \nthe custody or physical control of the United States, they shall be \nsubject to only the means of interrogation listed in the field manual.\n  I appreciate very much what the Senator is trying to do. I think most \nof us have gone down to Guantanamo to satisfy ourselves that what is \nhappening down there is in accordance with our concepts. Those people \nare totally under the custody of the United States, and certainly from \nmy point of view what we saw when we were down there, we were convinced \nthey were receiving the kind of treatment and the interrogations were \nnot such that they would be affected by this amendment.\n  It is the people in the field, not people really handling prisoner \ncamps or handling interrogation of those persons who are seized by our \nforces and brought to a camp or brought to a place, a jail such as we \nall know has gone wrong in Iraq--but I am talking the people in the \nfield now, multinational teams, and their job is to find out what these \npeople who are captured know in order to prevent further acts of \nterrorism. It is a very touchy thing to deal with, I know, to really \ntalk about it.\n  The administration has told us that they are complying with all the \nconstitutional, statutory, treaty obligations that apply to U.S. \ninterrogation practices. They are telling us that they know the \nConvention Against Torture requires the United States to ensure that \ntorture is a crime whether committed anywhere by a U.S. national or to \nprevent any of the entities that are under the control of the United \nStates from any acts of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or \npunishment. We totally agree with the efforts of the Senator from \nArizona in that regard, and the President has directed the Armed Forces \nto treat any detainee humanely and comply with the appropriate and \nconsistent military procedures that are consistent with the Geneva \nConventions.\n\n  That is a given. But this amendment goes further. This amendment will \ncover those entities with multiple nationalities, multiple agencies, \nand because of the circumstances our people in the past have taken \ncontrol of these, and some of the activities of the other nationalities \ninvolved would not be consistent with this amendment. I say what will \nhappen in the future is we will just not take control of them. This \nwill be a deterrent to our people from taking the leadership, and as \nthey do, they will do everything they can to comply with the Geneva \nConventions. It is those circumstances, the new type of entities we use \nto combat terrorism that worries the administration. So I can say--and \nI know the Senator from Arizona understands--it is the position of the \nadministration that this amendment goes too far.\n  We will not make a point of order. There is no point of order that I \nknow will apply to it anyway. But I do believe it is a matter that \nought to be approached with caution. What does a multinational team do \nif they pick up a prisoner who they believe can give them information \nas to the location of terrorists who have committed severe acts of \nterrorism? The decision will be made, I am sure, that we not take \ncustody. The custody will go to other nationalities involved in the \nteam. We will have no control. I believe the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona is going to carry, but I believe we\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nhave to give serious consideration to the implications I have just \nmentioned, and I hope the Senate will keep that in mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, No. 1, I would like to recognize that \nSenator Stevens, who has so honorably served our country, is genuinely \nconcerned about the extent of this amendment. For those of you who are \nlistening, Senator Stevens was a World War II pilot. He has gone in \nharm's way in defending his country. We have in the Chamber his \ncounterpart on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, a Medal of \nHonor winner, and the Senator occupying the chair is a former POW. The \nfood chain is going down when I am speaking. But what I want to try to \ndiscuss today is from a lawyer's point of view and really from a \ncitizen's point of view.\n  I have had the honor for the last 20-some years to be a member of the \nJudge Advocate General's Corps of the Air Force, a prosecutor, a \ndefense counsel, and I am now a Reserve military judge. That experience \nhas been a wonderful experience. I have received more out of it than \ngiven. Wearing the uniform in any capacity is quite an honor, and to be \na military lawyer has been one of the highlights of my life. I have \nnever been shot at. I had some clients who probably wanted to kill me. \nBut other than that, I do understand this debate pretty well. To me, it \nis not much of a debate. We have as a nation adopted the position that \nSenator McCain described when it comes to how you handle people in your \ncare and custody.\n  One thing I would respond to Senator Stevens is that the Army Field \nManual has sort of been the bible for interrogation for decades. If you \nare worried, and I think it is a fair question, is there anything in \nthe Army Field Manual that would unfairly restrict the ability of the \nUnited States to gain good information and defend ourselves from a \nbunch of rogue thug murderers, the answer is no. You don't have to \ntrust me there. Go to Gitmo and ask the question of the people who are \ndoing the interrogation of these terrorists: Is there anything in the \nArmy Field Manual as written or being drafted that would impede your \nability to gather good information? And the answer they told me was no.\n  So what is the value of having it? The value of having \nstandardization when it comes to interrogation, detention, and \nprosecution is of immeasurable benefit to the force because, as Senator \nMcCain indicated, a lot of the people implementing these policies when \nit comes to interrogation, detention, and prosecution are in harm's way \nthemselves. One of the things we have learned in this whole war on \nterror is that this Nation needs to have effective interrogation \ntechniques, effective detention policies, and effective prosecution \ntools to hold the terrorists responsible because you have two \naudiences.\n  No. 1, you have the terrorist community. I want every terrorist to \nknow, if you are not killed on the battlefield and you are captured, \nthings are going to happen to you. You are going to be interrogated \naggressively, but we are going to treat you humanely, not because we \nworry about your sensitivities but because we don't want to become who \nwe are interrogating. So we are going to keep that in place.\n  The President has said whether the Geneva Convention applies or not \nwe are going to treat everybody in our charge humanely, not because of \nthem but because of us. And the debate here is what happens when \nsomebody in your charge is not covered by the Geneva Conventions. It is \neasy when someone is a legal combatant. We know what the rules are. We \nhave the Geneva Conventions. We have been a signatory for 60 years. The \nArmy Field Manual covers that situation. The war on terror is \ndifferent. Vietnam was different. We had people who were lawful, whom \nwe were able to interrogate, detain, and prosecute without changing who \nwe were.\n  The Army Field Manual as a one-stop shop to guide the way we handle \nlawful combatants and enemy combatants is absolutely necessary if for \nno other reason than to protect our own troops. That is why we are \ndoing this. That is one of the main reasons--to make sure that your own \ntroops don't get in trouble because they are confused.\n  I have been a military lawyer for 20 years. We have confused people \nabout as much as you can possibly confuse them. And this all started \nwith the Bybee memo. I think we need to know the history of where we \nhave been, to find where we are before we take corrective action.\n  Right after 9/11, this Nation was shocked and shaken. We tried to \nmake sure we could secure our freedom and security and do a balancing \nact, and we have done a pretty good job of it. How can you be secure \nand still free? How can you fight the worst enemy and still not become \nthe worst of yourself? I think you can.\n  The Bybee memo was an effort by people at the Justice Department to \ntake international torture statutes that we had ratified and been party \nof and have the most bizarre interpretation basically where anything \ngoes. It was an effort on the part of the Department of Justice lawyers \nto stretch the law to the point the law meant nothing. And early on in \nthis process, those in uniform who happened to be military lawyers \nstood up and spoke.\n  I am going to read from General Sandkuhler, Brigadier General of the \nU.S. Marines, who was one of the judge advocates to review this change \nin policy, this very liberal interpretation of what torture might be. \nHe said:\n\n       The common thread among our recommendation is concern for \n     servicemembers. OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] does not \n     represent the services; thus, understandably, concern for \n     servicemembers is not reflected in their opinion. Notably, \n     their opinion is silent on the UCMJ and foreign views of \n     international law.\n\n  The general is telling the civilians that we live in a different \nworld. This is a complex process, and if we interpret a torture statute \nin the way you are suggesting, we are going to get our own people in \ntrouble.\n  He says:\n\n       We nonetheless recommend that the Working Group product \n     accurately portray the services' concerns that the \n     authorization of aggressive counter-resistant techniques by \n     servicemembers will adversely impact the following:\n       a. Treatment of U.S. servicemembers by Captors and \n     Compliance with International Law.\n\n  We have been the gold standard. We take this moral high ground to \nmake sure if our people fall into enemy hands that we will have the \nmoral force to say, You better treat them right. If you don't practice \nwhat you preach, nobody listens. Sometimes that does not happen, but \nyou don't want to erode the principle because it puts people at risk.\n  Criminal and Civil Liability of DOD Military and Civilian Personnel \nin Domestic, Foreign, and International Forums.\n  All the reasons all the JAGs wanted to push back is that you are \ngoing too far if you interpret the statutes as being proposed by the \nDepartment of Justice. Some of the techniques violate the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice.\n  Senator Stevens is concerned about joint operations. Here is the \nrule: If you are wearing America's uniform, you are going to be judged \nby American standards. You will never be prosecuted unless you do \nsomething inconsistent with our law. If you are part of an \ninternational group and wondering what to do with a prisoner in front \nof you, I suggest we let our troops know there are rules they must \nfollow, and if they see anything they think is out of bounds, report \nit.\n  The best thing we can do for anybody operating in the war on terror \nis give them clarity about what to do in very stressful situations. \nThere is the combat role. What do you do with somebody who is captured? \nYou do what the President says: You treat them humanely, you \ninterrogate them by standards we can live by that will not erode our \nmoral authority.\n  Where have those standards been in the last 50 or 60 years? The Army \nField Manual. You can change the Army Field Manual to adapt techniques \nto the war on terror. There is a classified section of the Army Field \nManual. There is nothing about its adoption that limits the ability to \naggressively interrogate people to get good intelligence. But if you \nwant to torture people, the Army Field Manual says no and the President \nsays no. It is now time for Congress to say no, and that is what this \namendment is about.\n  Congress has been AWOL when it comes to the war on terror in terms of\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\ninterrogation, detention, and prosecution, and we have done it in a way \nthat weakens our Nation. We are the strongest when all three branches \nare on the same sheet of music. It is important, if we are going to win \nthis war on terror, not to give the moral high ground to your enemy and \nto have laws that every branch of Government understands and the people \nimplementing these laws are not confused and they will not get in \ntrouble by following what we have said. Congress has been AWOL. It is \nnow time for Congress to step up to the plate and offer assistance in \nthe war on terror to the administration. That is exactly what we are \ndoing.\n  I asked Judge Roberts, during the confirmation process, about this \nwhole line of questioning. I said:\n\n       Do you believe that the Geneva Convention, as a body of \n     law, that it has been good for America to be part of that \n     convention?\n       ROBERTS: I do, yes.\n       GRAHAM: Why?\n       ROBERTS: Well, my understanding in general is it's an \n     effort to bring civilized standards to conduct of war--a \n     generally uncivilized enterprise throughout history; an \n     effort to bring some protection and regularity to prisoners \n     of war in particular. And I think that's a very important \n     international effort.\n\n  It is an important international effort, and al-Qaida should not be \nconsidered a lawful combatant under Geneva Conventions. But it is about \nus, as Senator McCain said. When we catch someone who is not under the \nGeneva Conventions, it is important that our people not only follow the \ndictates of the President--treat them humanely--but they know what to \ndo. We are giving confusing policies in this new war on terror, this \nhybrid between a lawful combatant, enemy combatant, and regular \ncombatant. We need to standardize our techniques.\n  How do we do that to make America the strongest? How can we \neffectively do that? We get the Congress involved, we get the \nadministration involved, and we get the courts involved. Right now we \nhave two court cases that are all over the board. Judges are telling \nus--Justice Scalia in one of the court cases is screaming out that \nCongress has been absent here. Congress needs to speak because the \ncourts are not equipped to run Guantanamo Bay. The courts are not well \nequipped to interpret military policy, and they need guidance from \nCongress.\n  I asked Justice Roberts about that. One of his favorite Justices is \nJustice Jackson. Justice Jackson in the Youngstown steel case basically \nsaid that the executive branch is at its strongest when it has the \nexpressed or implied consent of Congress.\n  When I met with Judge Roberts on this whole issue about detention, \ninterrogation, and prosecution of enemy combatants, he said this is an \narea where the courts would welcome congressional involvement.\n  As a result of us being AWOL in Congress, there is a Supreme Court \ndecision, 5 to 4, giving enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay habeas \ncorpus rights. They are noncitizens, and they are able to go to Federal \ncourt because there is no clear direction from Congress about how to \ntreat these people. Mr. President, 185 of them have lawyers, and they \nare absolutely overrunning the place. To me, it is absurd that an enemy \ncombatant, noncitizen terrorist has habeas corpus rights, and the \nreason they do is because we are giving no guidance to the courts about \nhow we want these people treated.\n  I believe it is now time to give guidance to the courts, to the \ncountry, to the international community, to those in uniform serving \nus, and to the terrorists about what we are going to do, and Senator \nMcCain's amendment has got it. It is the authority that has been \nmissing in this great effort to win the war on terror. It is now \nbringing standardization into an area which had been previously \nchaotic. Every military lawyer who has been looking at the policies \nproposed has come away confused.\n  Let me tell you unequivocally that the military legal community \nunderstands what Senator McCain is doing and wholeheartedly adopts his \nefforts, that not only would it be good for the Congress to speak with \nthe same authority as the President, but it would help the courts, and \nit would be good for our troops if they had the protection of \nstandardization.\n\n  If you want to help our troops who are trying to win this war on \nterror, give them the cover they need and the guidance they need. Do \nnot throw them to the wolves. We have had people prosecuted because \nthey have been given an impossible task. They have been given the task \nof interpreting laws that make no sense. And if you really do want to \nstand by the troops, give them guidance. Give them the guidance and the \ntools they can use to get good information, not bad information, and \nget information in a way that does not embarrass our Nation and put us \nat risk.\n  Abu Ghraib has been a giant step back, a huge step back, and one of \nthe reasons we had Abu Ghraib is because nobody there knew what they \nwere doing. They were not trained. They were overwhelmed. They did not \nhave consistency when it came to interpreting the interrogation \npolicies because the policies made no sense. Some people are in jail \nnow. Most of them are in jail because of their own misconduct. Some \npeople have had their careers ruined because they are trying to \ninterpret policies nobody can understand.\n  That is a huge deviation from the way we conducted war for 50 to 60 \nyears, and we paid the price. We are allowing courts to come in and do \nthings they are not equipped to do because we have been AWOL as \nCongress. The best thing we can do to win this war is have policies \nthat allow us to effectively interrogate, detain, and prosecute \nterrorists without ceding the high ground. And this amendment is a \nstart.\n  I am going to introduce every JAG memo written about the original \npolicies. Their concern is we are putting our own people at risk.\n  This is General Rives, my current boss:\n\n       Should any information concerning the exceptional \n     techniques--\n\n  And they were exceptional--\n\n     become public, it is likely to be exaggerated/distorted in \n     both the U.S. and international media. This could have a \n     negative impact on international, and perhaps even domestic, \n     support for the war on terrorism. It could likewise have a \n     negative impact on public perception of the U.S. military in \n     general.\n\n  This was written 6 February 2003. He was foretelling what was going \nto happen. These are not ACLU lawyers. This is a Marine Corps general \nand a two-star general in the Air Force who dedicated their lives to \ndefending their country and holding us up to be the great Nation we \nare.\n  I urge my colleagues to please adopt this amendment overwhelmingly. \nIt will do a great service to future Presidents. It will be a great \nturning point in the war on terror. It is needed. It is a simple \namendment. It uses the Army Field Manual as the bible for interrogation \nfor lawful combatants and enemy combatants. You can write it the way \nyou need to. It does not lock us into a position that would be \nundermining our efforts to get good intelligence. It simply will be a \ndocument that covers how we behave in every known situation from \nGuantanamo Bay to the battlefield in Afghanistan. It will be something \nthat will help our troops understand what they can and cannot do. It \nwill make us stronger as a nation.\n  The second part of the amendment is the most important. It says that \nwe as a nation will do what the President said: We will treat everybody \nin our charge humanely whether they deserve it or not because, as \nSenator McCain said, it is about us, it is not about them. And it is \nnow time for Congress to speak. It will help us in court. When the \ncourts understand that the Congress has come up with a plan in support \nof the administration to interrogate detainees, they will give great \ndeference to that situation. When Congress is absent, they are going to \nbe confused, and they are going to do some things they really do not \nwant to do.\n  This is a very important moment in the war on terror. This brings us \nback into the light out of the darkness. It allows us to interrogate \nenemy combatants, unlawful combatants in a way to get good intelligence \nwithout undermining who we are as a people. It is necessary, it is \nlegally necessary. It will strengthen our hand in court. It is very \nnecessary to create certainty out of confusion for our troops.\n  One thing I can say with absolute certainty is that we have let the \ntroops down when it comes to trying to give them guidance about what to \ndo in very stressful situations. We are trying\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nto give them the armor they need to protect themselves from a terrible \nenemy. We are trying to give them the intelligence they need to get \nahead of the enemy. The best thing we can do is give them the guidance \nthey need to make sure we can win this war on terror and never lose the \nmoral high ground.\n  I urge every person to think long and hard about this amendment. To \nvote no on this amendment, in my opinion, dramatically weakens us as a \nnation. To vote yes reinforces our values, provides good guidance to \nmake sure we get good intelligence, and protects our own people from \nbeing prosecuted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is an honor to serve in the same \nbody with the Senator from Hawaii, a Congressional Medal of Honor \nwinner, and with the Senator from Arizona because of his distinguished \nservice in Vietnam. Whenever the Senator from Alaska, a pilot in World \nWar II, who devoted most of his career here to understanding our \ndefense policies, urges caution, I try to listen and pay attention. But \nI rise today in support of the amendment by the Senator from Arizona to \nthe Defense appropriations bill, and I ask unanimous consent to be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate \nabout whether it is appropriate for Congress to set the rules on the \ntreatment of detainees. I have listened carefully, but for me the \nquestion isn't even close.\n  The people, through their elected representatives, should set the \nrules for how detainees and prisoners under U.S. control are treated \nand interrogated. In the short term, the President can set the rules, \nbut the war on terror is now 4 years old. We do not want judges making \nup the rules. We Republicans often say we don't like to see judges \nlegislating from the bench. So for the longer term, the people should \nset the rules. That is why we have an independent Congress. That is our \njob. In fact, the Constitution says quite clearly that is what Congress \nshould do. Article I, section 8, of the Constitution says that Congress \nand Congress alone shall have the power to make ``Rules concerning \nCaptures on Land and Water.'' So Congress, as the Senator from South \nCarolina said, has a responsibility to set clear rules here.\n  But the spirit of this amendment is really one that I still hope the \nWhite House will decide to embrace. In essence, as has been pointed \nout, the amendment codifies military procedures and policies--\nprocedures in the Army Field Manual and procedures regarding compliance \nwith the Convention Against Torture signed by President Reagan. These \namendments uphold or codify policies and procedures the administration \nsays we are following today and intend to follow moving forward.\n  As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, his amendment would do two \nthings: One, prohibit cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or \npunishment of detainees. It is in specific compliance with the \nConvention Against Torture that was signed by President Reagan. The \nadministration says we are already upholding that standard when it \ncomes to treatment of detainees, so this should not be a problem.\n  Secondly, the McCain amendment states simply that the interrogation \ntechniques used by the military on detainees shall be those specified \nby the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. The military, \nnot Congress, writes that manual. We are told that the technique \nspecified in the manual will do the job. Further, it is under revision, \nas has been pointed out, to include techniques related to unlawful \ncombatants, including classified portions that will continue to give \nthe President and the military a great deal of flexibility.\n  If the President of the United States thinks these are the wrong \nrules, I would hope he would submit new rules to Congress so that we \ncan debate them and pass them. I made this same suggestion in July, but \nno alternative rule has been suggested so far. I am one Senator who \nwould give great weight to the President's views on this matter.\n  This has been a gray area for the courts over time. In this gray \narea, the question is, Who should set the rules? In the short term, \nsurely the President can. In the longer term, the people should, \nthrough their elected representatives. We are their elected \nrepresentatives. It is time for us to act. It is time for us to set the \nrules. We do not want courts legislating from the bench and writing the \nrules. That leaves us to do our job.\n  In summary, it is time for Congress, which represents the people, to \nclarify and set the rules for detention and interrogation of our \nenemies. If the White House would prefer different rules, I hope the \nPresident will tell us what rules and procedures he needs to succeed in \nthe war on terror.\n  If the argument is whether it is appropriate for Congress to set \nclear standards, I believe Congress should set standards and will vote \nto support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain amendment. \nThere has been a lot of discussion about the new challenges we face in \ndealing with organized terrorist cells around the world. The complexity \nand the nature of those terrorist threats requires us to engage in ever \nmore combat activity that is nonconventional. We want to make sure we \ndo what we can to secure transportation and infrastructure, that we do \nwhat we can to deploy technology, that we improve our preparedness. But \nit does not change the fact that in dealing with terrorism our greatest \nasset or our greatest tool will be intelligence gathering. Intelligence \ngathering will require direct engagement with and interrogation of \nsuspects, trying to gather information that can help us disrupt these \nnetworks.\n  We are trying to gather information that can help us prevent future \nattacks. That process of interrogation, needless to say, is complex and \nchallenging. We have seen many of the problems and some of the abuses \nthat have been documented by some of the previous speakers.\n  I think this calls out for a process that is more clear and better \ndefined; interrogation tools, techniques, and procedures that we can be \nsure are applied consistently in the field. That is why I think this \namendment is so important. That is why I think we have a fundamental \nobligation to support this amendment or at least some approach to \nclarify these processes, standards, and procedures used for \ninterrogation.\n  I can think of two basic reasons that this is important and that it \nwill benefit our troops and our country. First, by establishing clear \nlines, procedures, and process for interrogation, we help our own \ntroops, whether working in the uniformed services or working in covert \noperations or other intelligence-gathering activities. We can be sure \nthat they know what the allowances are, that they know what the process \nis, that they know what the procedure is, and, in effect, we provide \nthem with appropriate protection and safeguards in doing their job.\n  In a similar way, we provide those individuals with protection in the \nfield of combat should they be taken as a prisoner of war. We want to \nmake sure our enemies do not have justification for using any \ninterrogation techniques that we would consider to be improper, cruel, \nor inhumane.\n  First, we are providing protection and establishing this clarity. \nSecond, I think we are sending an important message to our allies and \nour adversaries--a message that while the legal standards that are \nenshrined in the Constitution do not apply to everyone in the world, \nour commitment to these basic principles of life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness, our commitment to basic principles of human \ndignity and human rights do apply and we must find ways to define these \nstandards, to clarify this commitment, even in the area of \ninterrogating enemy combatants and interrogating potential terrorists, \nsuspected terrorists, in the field.\n  So we send a clear message to our allies and adversaries that our \ncommitment to these principles is real, that our desire to establish \nuniform standards is real.\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n  I do not know, not having the experience of some of my colleagues, \nwhether this is the perfect standard, whether the requirements and the \nprecise language in this amendment are ideal, but I think this is a \nfair-minded approach that allows the military itself, through its code \nof conduct, to establish these definitions that allows for the \nestablishment of a classified annex to deal with covert operations, \ndeal with the most sensitive of captives and the most sensitive of \ninterrogations so that we are not undermining the intelligence \ngathering that we are attempting to facilitate.\n\n  In fact, the approach that is taken has been endorsed, as was \nindicated by the Senator from Arizona, by many who have had very close \nand intimate experience with this type of interrogation. In the letter \nthat Senator McCain entered into the Record there were two particular \npoints that were made that I want to underscore, and that is, first, \n``the abuse of prisoners hurts America's cause.'' I think that is just \na fundamental and important underlying point in this debate, that \nprisoner abuse hurts our cause. It hurts the moral arguments we are \ntrying to make, the political arguments we are trying to make, and it \ndoes put our own men and women serving in uniform or in intelligence-\ngathering operations at risk.\n  Second, the United States should have one standard for interrogating \nenemy prisoners that is effective, lawful, and humane. That point \nbrings me back to the concern that we send a clear message to our \nallies and adversaries that our commitment to human dignity and human \nrights is universal.\n  So I am pleased to support the amendment. I think it is a very \nimportant first step. I think it gives the military the flexibility \nthat it deserves, and I hope the military will use that flexibility \nwell to add clarity, standards, process, and procedure that will enable \nus to continue to interrogate prisoners and continue to gather \nintelligence in dealing with these terrorist networks around the world, \nbut do it in a way that is consistent with the intent, the principle, \nand the philosophy of our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n1977, which has been offered by Senator McCain, the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Graham, Senator Hagel, Senator Smith, and Senator Collins. \nFirst, let me commend Senator McCain for the courage that he has shown, \nagain, in offering this amendment. There is not a single person in \nCongress who can speak with more authority than Senator John McCain on \nthe treatment of prisoners of war.\n  I have come to this floor many times to address this issue, but my \nvoice is weak compared to his. He has lived this experience in a way \nthat none of us ever have or ever will. I believe his voice should be \nlistened to more than some because he has given so many years of his \nlife to this country and suffered as a prisoner of war personally.\n  This should be a noncontroversial amendment. It really requires two \nvery simple and straightforward things: First, that the treatment of \ndetainees comply with the Army's Field Manual on Interrogation; and, \nsecond, that the United States may not subject anyone in our custody to \ntorture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. It is that \nstraightforward.\n  This amendment would affirm our Nation's very important, longstanding \nobligation not to engage in torture or other cruel treatment. This \nstandard is enshrined in our U.S. Constitution and in several treaties \nwhich our Nation has adopted as the law of the land.\n  Just as important, this amendment would make the rules clear for our \nsoldiers so they know what the standards are that they should follow in \nthe treatment of detainees. We owe this to our troops. If they are \ngoing to risk their lives every day in defense of our country, we \nshould give them standards of conduct that are clear and unequivocal.\n  The prohibition on torture and other cruel treatment is deeply rooted \nin the history of America. Our Founding Fathers made it clear in the \nBill of Rights that torture and other forms of cruel treatment are \nprohibited.\n  These principles have even guided us during the times of great \nnational testing. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln asked \nFrancis Lieber, a military law expert, to create a set of rules to \ngovern the conduct of U.S. soldiers in the Civil War. The result was \nthe Lieber Code. It prohibited torture and other cruel treatment of \ncaptured enemy forces. It really was the foundation for the Geneva \nConventions.\n  After World War II, the United States took the lead in establishing a \nnumber of treaties that banned the use of torture and other cruel \ntreatment against all persons at all times. There are no exceptions to \nthis prohibition.\n  The United States has ratified these treaties, including the Geneva \nConventions and the torture convention. They are the law of the land.\n  Twice in the last year and a half, I have authored amendments to \naffirm our Nation's longstanding position that torture and other cruel \ntreatment are illegal. Twice the Senate unanimously approved my \namendments. Both times the amendments were killed behind closed doors \nof conference committees. Both times these amendments, which I offered \nand which were accepted by the Senate, were stricken from the bill at \nthe insistence of the administration.\n  As I understand it, the administration does not support Senator \nMcCain's amendment. I sincerely hope that after this debate, they will.\n  Why would the administration oppose an amendment that affirms our \nlongstanding obligation not to engage in torture or cruel, inhumane, \nand degrading treatment? Sadly, it is because the actions that they \nhave taken on this critical question have been unclear and \ninconsistent.\n  In early 2002, Alberto Gonzales, who was then-White House Counsel, \nrecommended to President Bush that the Geneva Conventions should not \napply to the war on terrorism. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, who was then-Secretary of State, objected \nstrenuously to Attorney General Gonzales' conclusion. He argued that we \ncould effectively fight the war on terrorism and we could live by the \nGeneva Conventions, which have been the law of the land in America for \nover half a century.\n  Unfortunately, the President rejected Secretary Powell's wise counsel \nand instead accepted Attorney General Gonzales' recommendations. In \nFebruary of 2002, he issued a memo determining that the Geneva \nConventions would not apply to the war on terrorism.\n  Then the administration unilaterally created new policies on the use \nof torture. I am referring to, among other things, the well-known Bybee \nmemo of August 1, 2002, which has been publicly disclosed. They have \nclaimed that the President has the right to set aside the law that \nmakes torture a crime. They have narrowly defined torture as limited \nonly to abuse that causes pain equivalent to organ failure or death.\n  They claim that it is legal to subject detainees to cruel, inhuman, \nand degrading treatment even though Congress has ratified the torture \nconvention, which explicitly prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment. This fact was verified by Attorney General nominee Gonzales \nduring confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in \nresponse to a question which I asked him directly.\n\n  Despite all of this, the administration continues to insist that \ntheir policy is not to treat detainees inhumanely.\n  What does this mean? Recently, I asked Timothy Flanigan this \nquestion. He was the Deputy to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales. \nMr. Flanigan has been nominated to be the Deputy Attorney General, the \nsecond highest law enforcement official in the Nation. Mr. Flanigan \nsaid inhumane treatment is ``not susceptible to a succinct \ndefinition.''\n  I asked him whether the White House had provided any guidance to our \ntroops on the meaning of inhumane treatment. He acknowledged that they \nhad not.\n  I asked Mr. Flanigan about specific abuses. I asked him: would it be \ninhumane to beat prisoners or subject them to mock executions? He said, \n``It depends on the facts and circumstances.''\n  I cannot imagine facts and circumstances in which it would be humane \nto subject a detainee to a mock\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nexecution. Last week an editorial in the Washington Post called Mr. \nFlanigan's answers to my questions, ``evasive legalisms in response to \nsimple questions about uncivilized conduct.''\n  How are our service men and women supposed to know how to treat \ndetainees when high-ranking administration officials do not seem to \nknow or refuse to respond to these direct questions?\n  The administration acknowledges that some people held by our \nGovernment have been mistreated. Some have been tortured. They say \nthese abuses were committed by a few bad apples, rogue soldiers on a \nnight shift.\n  But is it any wonder that people have been abused when the \nadministration and Congress do not make it clear that American policy \nprohibits subjecting detainees to cruel and degrading treatment? Is it \nany wonder that people have been abused when we refuse to repudiate un-\nAmerican practices such as beating detainees? The administration should \nnot point the finger of blame at our troops for the logical \nconsequences of muddled and often contradictory policies.\n  I have been to Iraq. I have spent time with our troops. I have been \nhumbled by their courage and sacrifice. I have visited Walter Reed \nHospital many times. I have spoken with young soldiers who have \nsuffered horrible injuries in the war, and I have attended funerals for \nsoldiers who lost their lives in this war, many from my own home State.\n  Our troops around the world and their families at home deserve our \nrespect, admiration, and support.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a brave U.S. serviceman stepped forward to say \nthat he and other American soldiers need clear rules and guidance on \nhow to deal with detainees. CPT Ian Fishback is a graduate of West \nPoint. He served in combat both in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was so \ndisturbed by what he had experienced that he wrote to our colleague, \nSenator McCain. The letter is now public. It was published in the \nWashington Post last week.\n  Senator McCain entered part of the letter into the record earlier \ntoday. Let me read a little more of the letter, which speaks so \npowerfully and eloquently to our soldiers' need for guidance and \nleadership. Listen to what Captain Fishback wrote:\n\n       For 17 months I tried to determine what specific standards \n     governed the treatment of detainees. . . . Despite my \n     efforts, I have been unable to get clear, consistent answers \n     from my leadership about what constitutes lawful and humane \n     treatment of detainees. I am certain that this confusion \n     contributed to a wide range of abuses including death \n     threats, beatings, broken bones, murder, exposure to \n     elements, extreme forced physical exertion, hostage-taking, \n     stripping, sleep deprivation and degrading treatment. I and \n     troops under my command witnessed some of these abuses in \n     both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n  This administration should stand by the time-honored Geneva \nConventions and the torture convention, rules that have served us well \nin the past, rules that our soldiers are trained in and understand. To \nreplace them with vague directives to treat detainees humanely fails to \nprovide basic guidance that our troops desperately need.\n  Listen to what Captain Fishback also wrote:\n\n       I can remember as a cadet at West Point, resolving to \n     ensure that my men would never commit a dishonorable act, \n     that I would protect them from that type of burden. It \n     absolutely breaks my heart that I failed some of them in this \n     regard.\n\n  It breaks my heart to think that this soldier, risking his life for \nAmerica in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now reaching out to us because we \nhave failed to provide him with guidance. I am thankful that Senator \nMcCain has stepped forward, along with you, Mr. President, and many \nothers in this Chamber, to give him that guidance.\n  Captain Fishback is an honorable man. Like the overwhelming majority \nof the fine men and women who serve our country, he has not failed. We \nhave failed--to give him clear direction in his conduct as a soldier.\n  The administration has failed to set clear rules for the treatment of \ndetainees. We need to step in and clarify these with the amendment \noffered by Senator McCain. Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment are \nprohibited. The Army Field Manual governs the treatment of detainees. \nSenator McCain's amendment will make that clear.\n  In the past, the administration has opposed amendments that affirm \nthat cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is illegal because they \n``would have provided legal protections to foreign prisoners to which \nthey are not now entitled.''\n  But the administration is not correct in this assertion. Cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment is already prohibited by the torture \nconvention.\n  Their reasoning is revealing, however. They do not seem to understand \nthe real issue at stake in this debate. This is not about legal \nprotections for foreign prisoners. It is about who we are as a people. \nTorture is not American; abusing detainees is not the American way. Our \nbrave men and women in uniform understand this, and the plaintive plea \nof Captain Fishback makes that clear.\n  I correspond with another soldier who served in Iraq and started \nsending me e-mails late at night about what was really happening on the \nground. He keeps in touch with me now from time to time. He recently \nwrote to me and said:\n\n       We need to go back toward a strict application of the \n     Geneva conventions. That is where our honor lies and that is \n     what I was taught since the day I joined the service.\n\n  Retired RADM John Hutson served our country for 28 years, and for the \nlast 3 years of his career he was the Judge Advocate General, the top \nlawyer of the Navy. He worked with me on the amendments I authored. He \nsupports Senator McCain's amendment. In a letter to me he wrote:\n\n       Clarion opposition to torture and other abuse by the U.S. \n     will help protect U.S. troops who are in harm's way.\n\n  Former Congressman Pete Peterson, a good friend of mine and many in \nthis body, was also a prisoner of war in Vietnam, like Senator McCain. \nHe was in prison for 6.5 years.\n  In a letter to me in support of our efforts he wrote:\n\n       Congress must affirm that America stands by its moral and \n     legal obligation to treat all prisoners, regardless of \n     status, as we would want the enemy to treat our own. Our \n     courageous men and women deserve nothing less.\n\n  Let me close finally by a quote from Captain Fishback's letter.\n\n       Some argue that since our actions are not as horrifying as \n     Al-Qaeda's, we should not be concerned. When did Al Qaeda \n     become any type of standard by which we measure the morality \n     of the United States? We are America, and our actions should \n     be held to a higher standard, the ideals expressed in \n     documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the \n     Constitution. . . .If we abandon our ideals in the face of \n     adversity and aggression, then those ideals were never really \n     in our possession. I would rather die fighting than give up \n     even the smallest part of the idea that is ``America.''\n\n  We are so fortunate to have men of his dedication and character \nserving our country in uniform. We owe it to him, we owe it to the \nhundreds of thousands of men and women who serve us every single day \nand risk their lives, to set clear rules so they know how to treat \ndetainees in custody.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of Senator McCain. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from Arizona. I commend Senator McCain for his \nleadership on this important issue. This amendment prohibits the cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of persons under custody \nor control of the U.S. Government. In other words, it outlaws the \ntorture of prisoners by agents of the United States, regardless of \ntheir geographic location.\n  I am, and always have been, opposed to the use of torture. I believe \nthat our brave men and women serving in the Armed Forces share this \nview. Now more than ever, we must make it absolutely clear to our \nallies and our enemies that the United States does not and will not \ncondone this practice. This amendment does that in no uncertain terms. \nIt acknowledges and confirms existing obligations under our own \nConstitution and the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n  Let me be clear on another point. I am committed to fighting \nterrorism and protecting our citizens and troops at home and abroad. I \nhave the utmost respect, gratitude and admiration for our troops who \nare fighting on the frontlines of the War on Terror, and I have no \nintention of undermining the important job that they do.\n  But the use of torture does not enhance our national security. In \nfact, senior U.S. military officers have argued that practicing torture \ncan place\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nU.S. troops in grave danger--especially if they are taken prisoner. In \nworking to keep our Nation and troops safe, we must not lose sight of \nthis critical truth.\n  The United States should set an example for the international \ncommunity. Senator McCain's amendment reaffirms a fundamental value of \nthe American people--that torture is morally reprehensible and has no \nplace in this world. I am proud to support this affirmation, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator McCain's \namendment to provide clear guidance for the treatment of detainees in \nU.S. custody. This administration has steadfastly refused to address \nthe black mark on our Nation caused by its interrogation policies and \nthe resulting abuse of detainees. Congress needs to take action.\n  Our credibility and reputation as a world leader in human rights \nsuffers from our unwillingness to openly address the flaws in our \nsystem. More importantly, the failure to provide clear guidance on the \ntreatment of detainees puts our own troops at risk and undermines their \nefforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. I commend my colleagues across the \naisle who are attempting to address this problem, despite resistance \nfrom members of their own party and the strong opposition of the White \nHouse. The President has threatened to veto any legislation that would \nregulate the treatment of detainees, claiming that it would impinge on \nhis Commander-in-Chief authority. I fail to see how a bill requiring \nthe humane treatment of detainees--the same treatment the President \nclaims they now receive--would impinge on his authority in any way.\n  It is Congress's right under the Constitution to issue regulations \ngoverning the armed forces. This was something I asked Chief Justice \nRoberts at his confirmation hearings, and he agreed ``that Congress can \nmake rules that may impinge upon the President's command functions.'' \nHe answered, ``Certainly . . . the Constitution vests pertinent \nauthority in [this] area in both branches. The President is the \nCommander-in-Chief . . . On the other hand; Congress has the authority \nto issue regulations governing the armed forces, another express \nprovision in the Constitution.''\n  Senator Graham said on the floor this morning that, ``Congress has \nbeen AWOL when it comes to the war on terror in terms of interrogation, \ndetention and prosecution, and we've done it in a way to weaken our \nNation.'' I agree with my friend, the Senator from South Carolina. \nWithout congressional action, the problem of prisoner abuse will \ncontinue to fester.\n  We continue to learn of abuses from press reports and the court-\nordered release of government documents in response to Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, litigation. Documents that were recently made \npublic by the FOIA case demonstrate why Senator McCain's amendment is \nnecessary.\n  These documents reveal a troubling pattern of abuses that occurred \nbecause soldiers did not know what was acceptable under this \nadministration's vague detention and interrogation policies. Several of \nthe documents are transcriptions of interviews of military personnel in \nIraq that show a systematic failure of the Pentagon to properly train \nsoldiers on how to treat detainees. One report describes soldiers who, \nbecause of a lack of guidance and training from their command, engaged \nin ``interrogations using techniques they literally remembered from \nmovies.'' Another document describes the shooting of an Iraqi detainee \nin U.S. custody. The report concludes that ``this incident could have \nbeen prevented if [the soldier] had better training.''\n  Another report, released last week by Human Rights Watch and based on \nfirsthand accounts of soldiers in the 82nd Airborne Division, details \nthe widespread abuse of Iraqi detainees by soldiers at Camp Mercury, a \nforward operating base near Falluja, Iraq. The report states that \ndetainees were severely beaten and mistreated from 2003 through 2004, \neven after the photos from Abu Ghraib became public. The witnesses \nclaim that detainees were abused at the request of military \nintelligence personnel as part of the interrogation process, but also \nclaim that the abuse occurred simply as a way for troops to ``relieve \nstress.'' One soldier allegedly broke a detainee's leg with a baseball \nbat. In another incident, detainees were stacked into human pyramids \nand denied food and water. It is time for this administration to \nfinally acknowledge that such incidents were not the isolated acts of a \nfew bad apples. These horrific acts were not isolated incidents on the \nnight shift at Abu Ghraib. Unfortunately, similar acts occurred at \nlocations throughout Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  A group of 28 senior military officers, including General John \nShalikashvili, recently wrote to Senator McCain in support of his \namendments addressing detainee treatment. That letter stated, ``The \nabuse of prisoners hurts America's cause in the war on terror, \nendangers U.S. servicemembers who might be captured by the enemy, and \nis anathema to the values Americans have held dear for generations. Our \nservicemembers were denied clear guidance, and left to take the blame \nwhen things went wrong. They deserve better than that.'' I hope the \nPresident will consider these words before he vetoes a bill that \ncontains Senator McCain's amendment.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator McCain's \namendment No. 1977 regarding the treatment of individuals who are in \nthe custody or control of the United States.\n  I cosponsored this amendment because the men and women making \nsacrifices to defend our country deserve clear standards for the \ntreatment of detainees under U.S. control. It is the responsibility of \nboth the Executive and Congress to provide clear guidance and \nleadership that will direct the actions of our troops.\n  We have failed to meet this obligation. Soldiers continue to report \nthat the lack of clear guidance has created an atmosphere of confusion \nand uncertainty around the world. Our failure to confront this issue \nputs our troops at greater risk of abuse and mistreatment and \nundermines our credibility.\n  This amendment will strengthen our ability to fight those who \nthreaten the United States. This amendment codifies into law that the \nArmy Field Manual must be used as the standard for interrogations. In \naddition, the amendment codifies that the U.S. will not subject \ndetainees to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that protects our troops and upholds \nthe standards that this country has held to since the beginning of our \nRepublic.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. \n1977, offered by my colleague, Senator McCain.\n  This amendment would bring much-needed clarity to the rules governing \nhow Americans treat captured prisoners and detainees.\n  It will make clear that the Geneva Conventions apply to all people \nheld in the custody of the Department of Defense.\n  It provides a workable definition of ``cruel and inhumane,'' based on \nthe rules which govern how we treat criminals in the United States, and \nbased firmly in the constitutional prohibitions of cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  Most importantly, it sets rules that are clear, simple and in accord \nwith basic American values.\n  First, let me make clear my view that in this modern world of \nasymmetric warfare, non-state actors, and unconventional threat, there \nis an absolute necessity to have a program to securely hold prisoners \nand effectively interrogate them to provide timely intelligence.\n  But in my judgment, the current system is not working.\n  Over the course of the past 4 years, there has been a great deal of \nconfusion over the policies and practices of the United States towards \nindividuals the Government has taken into custody.\n  This confusion has been evident at the highest levels of \ndecisionmaking at the Pentagon, with memoranda authorizing this \ntechnique or that technique being issued and rescinded within weeks of \none another.\n  The confusion has been noted here in the Senate. I sit on two \ncommittees with jurisdiction, and have sat through hours and hours of \nhearings and briefings--our Nation's policy with respect to detainees \nand prisoners of war is still unclear to me.\n  Frankly, the administration's repeated statements about ``wherever\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\npossible adhering to law'' are confusing and unhelpful.\n  And the confusion has filtered down to the front lines.\n  Seventeen months ago, enlisted members of the 82nd Airborne Infantry \nDivision--honorable men risking their lives in Iraq--asked their \ncommanding officer what the rules were for the treatment of prisoners.\n  For 17 months, their commander, CPT Ian Fishback, diligently searched \nfor the answer up and down his chain of command. Here is what he has \nfound, and I quote:\n\n       We've got people with different views of what ``humane'' \n     means and there's no Army statement that says ``this is the \n     standard for humane treatment for prisoners to Army \n     officers.'' Army officers are left to come up with their own \n     definition of humane treatment.\n\n  Captain Fishback and his men have a right to clear guidance. Their \nsacrifices entitle them to be allowed to do their job. An infantryman \nshould not need to be a graduate of a law school to know what to do \nwith a prisoner.\n  What this amendment does is to provide clarity.\n  It is incumbent on Congress to provide this clarity. In fact, we have \na constitutional mandate to do it.\n  Article VII, section 8 of the Constitution states that Congress shall \nhave the power to ``make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water,'' \nand also ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land \nand naval Forces.''\n  Our men and women in combat badly need this legislation. But there is \nmore at stake here than immediate military necessity.\n  Our soldiers and our Nation have a long and honorable tradition of \nethical behavior. For more than 200 years we have prided ourselves on \nbeing different than our adversaries in war. Simply put, there are some \nthings that Americans do not do, not because it is illegal, or some \nlawyer says we cannot, but because it is wrong.\n  The laws of war, codified in the Geneva Conventions, represent a bare \nminimum of acceptable behavior toward captives. The United States has \nconsistently championed the Geneva Conventions for over a century, \nknowing that our behavior is a beacon to the world, and that our \nadherence to principle--as well as projecting American values--saves \nAmerican lives.\n  I am not naive. I do not expect our current enemy to respect the \nGeneva Conventions. Our captured troops cannot expect humane treatment \nat the hands of al-Qaida. But make no mistake--the eyes of the world \nare still on us, and our policies have real consequences.\n  Even now, millions of young Muslims around the world are evaluating \nthe United States. They are deciding whether to take up arms against \nus, or whether to work with us towards a peaceful resolution with \nliberty and justice for all. We must show them, clearly, emphatically, \nthat the rhetoric of democracy and freedom is not empty. We must show \nthem that we are a government of laws, clearly written, openly \npromulgated and fairly enforced.\n  Captures and interrogations are part of war and, no less than other \ntools of war, must be wielded intelligently, humanely, and within a set \nof rules for warfare that govern all who serve in uniform--whether \nprivates or generals, seamen or admirals.\n  Our men and women in uniform, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and at \nGuantanamo Bay, have the right to clear, direct and lawful leadership.\n  This amendment is good policy, is just, and is long overdue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I thank my friend and colleague from \nSouth Carolina for his comments in support of this amendment. He does \noccupy a unique position in this body, having served 20 years--6\\1/2\\ \nyears on active duty as an Air Force lawyer and member of the JAG \nCorps, and remains in the Reserves to this day. He obviously brings a \nperspective to this issue which is very important.\n  I think the Senator from South Carolina described the confusion that \nexisted over a period of time about this whole issue of treatment of \nprisoners. There was a set of instructions issued which were in effect \nfor a couple of months, which were strongly objected to by the \nuniformed legal corps in the Pentagon. Yet their concerns were \noverridden.\n  The Senator from South Carolina quoted one of them. Another one was \nby RADM Michael Lohr, the Navy's Judge Advocate General. He said the \nsituation at the American prison in Guantanamo, Cuba, might be so \nlegalistically unique that the Geneva Conventions and even the \nConstitution did not necessarily apply. But, he asked,\n\n       Will the American people find we have missed the forest for \n     the trees by condoning practices that, while technically \n     legal, are inconsistent with our most fundamental values?\n\n  General Rives said if the White House permitted abusive \ninterrogations at Guantanamo Bay, it would not be able to restrict them \nto that single prison. He argued that soldiers elsewhere would conclude \nthat their commanders were condoning illegal behavior. And that is \nprecisely what happened at Abu Ghraib after the general who organized \nthe abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo went to Iraq to toughen up the \ninterrogation of prisoners there.\n  I think it is clear that the White House ignored those military \nlawyers' advice a couple of years ago. We now have, thanks to the \nyearlong effort of the Senator from South Carolina, those \ncommunications of deep concern to every uniformed JAG in the Department \nof Defense, about the issuance of instructions which basically violated \nour commitment to the Geneva Conventions.\n  In order to have the record complete, a couple of months later those \nwere rescinded and different orders were issued at that time. But what \nif you are at the end of the chain and you get these kinds of mixed \nmessages?\n  So I thank the Senator from South Carolina for pointing out from his \nunique perspective how important this is, since it is the men and women \nwho are in the JAG Corps who are responsible for prosecuting those who \nviolate Geneva Conventions, and they need clear guidance; or defending \nsomeone who is accused of violating them, as our men and women of the \nmilitary are entitled to defense just as they are subject to \nprosecution.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I appreciate the \ndefense of the Senator from Alaska of the administration's position on \nthis issue. I do not think he has been well informed by the \nadministration, particularly concerning the Army Field Manual.\n  The Army Field Manual has a classified section which would not be \navailable to anyone except for those who have a need to know. The Army \nField Manual has been used for decades. The Army Field Manual is being \nrevised as we speak to try to meet the new challenges we face. But the \nArmy Field Manual, I am confident, will be in keeping with the \nfundamental commitments we have made.\n  All my career I have supported the rights and prerogatives of the \nCommander in Chief. We need a strong President, and in wartime this is \nmore important than ever. I understand the administration would want to \npreserve the President's flexibility and wartime powers, and I do not \nbelieve that we can afford to have 535 Secretaries of State, \nSecretaries of Defense, or even Presidents of the United States.\n  I would like to point out the Congress not only has the right but the \nobligation to act. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the \nUnited States, clause 11:\n\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water[.]\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       . . . make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water[.]\n\n  Someone is going to come down to the floor and say that applied back \nin the time of the Framers of the Constitution; it didn't apply to \ntoday. At least from my point of view, unless there is an overriding \nneed to change the Constitution of the United States--if that clause of \nthe Constitution no longer applies, then lets amend the Constitution \nand remove it; otherwise, lets live by it.\n  The Congress has the responsibility:\n\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\n\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water[.]\n\n  I do not see how anyone could view this as an unwarranted \nintervention in an issue such as this. The courts, as the Senator from \nSouth Carolina pointed out so well, are asking us--that well-known \nliberal judge, Justice Scalia, has said we need the Congress of the \nUnited States involved in this issue. We, the courts, cannot do it \nourselves.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, if we do not fulfill \nour constitutional role, we are negligent. We owe it to our troops and \nour country to speak on this issue.\n  I very much respect my friend, the Vice President of the United \nStates, Vice President Cheney. He and I have been friends for many \nyears. I respect the way that he carefully guards the prerogatives of \nthe President. But on this issue, I hope he and others would understand \nthat we are dutybound to take action.\n  I would like, again, to refer back to Captain Fishback. He is what I \nview as the tip of the iceberg that exists in the military today. They \nknow how important this war on terror is. They are the ones who are \nfighting it. Captain Fishback served in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and \nthe ones I hear from are men and women in the military who have a very \nstrong commitment to winning the war on terror. They have laid their \nlives on the line to win it. But they want clear, unequivocal \nguidelines as to how to treat prisoners of war.\n  I would like to believe that this is the last war in which the United \nStates will ever be involved. I would like to believe that from now on, \nafter we win this war on terror, we will have peace and the United \nStates will never send its men and women in harm's way again.\n  History shows me otherwise. What happens in the next conflict when \nAmerican military personnel are held captive by the enemy and they make \nthe argument, with some validity, that we have violated the rules of \nwar? What happens to our men and women in the military then?\n  There are some who will say they wouldn't respect the rules of war, \nanyway. If they are not sure they are going to win, as the Germans \nweren't in World War II, they might treat our prisoners according to \ncertain standards if we insist upon those standards.\n  I think there is a lot at stake. I respect the position of the \nadministration, that these should be under the authority and \nresponsibility and would erode the flexibility of the President of the \nUnited States. I don't believe so.\n  This amendment basically restates what we have been practicing for \ncertainly all of the 21st and the 20th centuries.\n  I think we owe it to the people, these brave young Americans such as \nCaptain Fishback, who want and deserve a clarification in the way they \ncan carry out their responsibilities and duties as they travel into \nharm's way.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Tennessee, \nthe Senator from Illinois, and my friend from South Carolina for their \neloquent statements on this issue.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this Senator doesn't agree with anything \nthat has been said about the applicability of this provision to anyone \nin the military uniform. Most of the speakers have talked about men and \nwomen in the armed services. The amendment goes much further than that.\n  But first, the problem is it requires the field manual to list every \ntype and means of interrogation. Thousands of pages will be required. \nPeople will be prosecuted in military courts if they don't know every \nsingle one of them, if they even cross the line by accident. This idea \nof listing all of the possible ways to interrogate a person is \nimpossible. I say that should be changed. Maybe they should issue from \ntime to time additional items to go in the field manual. But to require \nthat no one can use a means of interrogation not listed in advance when \nwe are involved in a war on terror and we are dealing with terrorists \nis wrong.\n  Beyond that, this deals with any person--not any military person. The \nGeneva Conventions were originally intended to deal with military \nprisoners. This is dealing with anyone who is intercepted now anywhere \nin the world who, regardless of nationality or physical location, is in \ncustody or physical control of the United States because a person who \nis American happens to be there.\n  Again, I mention these teams I have met with, and I respect \nmultinational teams. This, in effect, says that an American is \nresponsible for anything done by any member of that team. That, to me, \nis wrong.\n  What is more, I think it is wrong to presume there is no place in \nthis country or in the operation of this country where we should not \nhave the ability to deal with terrorists on their own ground.\n  These are vicious people, suicidal people. I do not think they should \nbe accorded the rank and treatment of men and women in uniform from \nother nations. That is what this amendment does. I shall oppose it. I \nmay be all alone, but I shall oppose it because I think there is a \nplace in our operations against individuals involved in the war on \nterrorism where we deal with them as they deal with us.\n  These are not military people. They may not even be American \nnationals who are working for us in an undercover way, but this says we \nare responsible for treating all these people according to the Geneva \nConventions and according to processes listed in the U.S. Army Field \nManual. That is wrong. That is all simply wrong, and I shall oppose the \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2004\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself \n     and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2004.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the President to utilize the Combatant Status \n   Review Tribunals and Administrative Review Board to determine the \n           status of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.(a) Authority To Utilize Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunals and Administrative Review Board To Determine Status \n     of Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.--The President is \n     authorized to utilize the Combatant Status Review Tribunals \n     and a noticed Administrative Review Board, and the procedures \n     thereof as specified in subsection (b), currently in \n     operation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to determine the \n     status of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including \n     whether any such detainee is a lawful enemy combatant or an \n     unlawful enemy combatant.\n       (b) Procedures.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     procedures specified in this subsection are the procedures \n     that were in effect in the Department of Defense for the \n     conduct of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and the \n     Administrative Review Board on July 1, 2005.\n       (2) Exception.--The exceptions provided in this paragraph \n     for the procedures specified in paragraph (1) are as follows:\n       (A) To the extent practicable, the Combatant Status Review \n     Tribunal shall determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, \n     whether statements derived from persons held in foreign \n     custody were obtained without undue coercion.\n       (B) The Designated Civilian Official shall be an officer of \n     the United States Government whose appointment to office was \n     made by the President, by and with the advise and consent of \n     the Senate.\n       (3) Modification of procedures.--The President may modify \n     the procedures and requirements set forth under paragraphs \n     (1) and (2). Any modification of such procedures\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\n     or requirements may not go into effect until 30 days after \n     the date on which the President notifies the congressional \n     defense committees of the modification.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``lawful enemy combatant'' means person \n     engaging in war or other armed conflict against the United \n     States or its allies on behalf of a state party to the Geneva \n     Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, \n     dated August 12, 1949, who meets the criteria of a prisoner \n     of war under Article 4 of that Convention.\n       (2) The term ``unlawful enemy combatant'', with respect to \n     noncitizens of the United States, means a person (other than \n     a person described in paragraph (1)) engaging in war, other \n     armed conflict, or hostile acts against the United States or \n     its allies, regardless of location.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank Senator Stevens for allowing me \nto do this. I appreciate that we have a busy day.\n  I totally understand where he is coming from about the interrogation \namendment. I come out on a different side. This amendment deals with \nthe combat status review procedure at Guantanamo Bay. I think it is \nvery necessary. I think it strengthens what the administration is \ntrying to do when it comes to enemy combatants. I think it helps the \nadministration in court and is good policy for the country.\n  No. 1, I totally agree with the President that a member of al-Qaida \nshould not be given Geneva Conventions status. I say to my friend from \nAlaska that Senator McCain's amendment doesn't confer Geneva \nConventions status on enemy combatants. It standardizes the \ninterrogation techniques. The Army Field Manual has a section for \nlawful combatants, those covered under the Geneva Conventions, and it \nwill have a provision for unlawful combatants. Al-Qaida should not be \ngiven Geneva Conventions status. The Geneva Conventions and the \nsignatories to the convention set the rules for the conduct of war. An \nunlawful enemy combatant is someone who goes around the battlefield \nwithout a uniform, doesn't represent a nation--a terrorist, for lack of \na better word. They do not deserve the protection of the Geneva \nConventions because they are cheating. But they do, in my opinion, \ndeserve what the President said--not so much because they deserve it \nbut because it is about who we are.\n  The President said even enemy combatants--members of al-Qaida--will \nbe treated humanely. When we capture somebody on the battlefield--\nthroughout the world because the whole world is the battlefield in the \nwar on terror--most of the people we are dealing with are not part of \nthe uniformed force, not like the Iraqi Army.\n  The President said early on these people will be humanely treated but \nthey will not be given Geneva Convention status. He is absolutely \nright. When we catch someone, say, in Afghanistan, who is a member of \nal-Qaida or some other terrorist network, certain people, once \nscreened, go to Guantanamo Bay. The people at Guantanamo Bay have been \nparticipating in the allegations, or they have been participating in \nterrorist activities, supporting terrorist organizations as an unlawful \nenemy combatant. They are not uniformed soldiers.\n  We are reviewing everyone that comes to Guantanamo Bay to see if they \ndeserve the status ``enemy combatant.'' The term ``enemy combatant'' \ncame out of World War II when we had a Supreme Court case recognizing \nthat term for German saboteurs who landed, I think, in Florida and were \ntrying to do sabotage throughout the United States. These six or seven \nGermans were not in uniform. They were tried by a military commission.\n  We have a military commission at Guantanamo Bay that I totally \nsupport. And I think enemy combatant status was a result of that \nSupreme Court case. They were given that determination.\n  What we are trying to do is streamline interrogation techniques to \ndeal with both lawful and unlawful combatants. That helps our troops, \ngives them guidance.\n  The second thing we are doing with my amendment is legitimizing, \nthrough congressional action, what the administration has done at \nGuantanamo Bay. The administration, in my opinion, has put together a \nvery good, thorough process to look at each person that comes to \nGuantanamo Bay to determine whether or not they should be classified as \nenemy combatants because if they are classified as enemy combatants, \nthey can be detained indefinitely and taken off the battlefield.\n\n  The due process rights afforded an enemy combatant have been up to \nthe Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court, for the most part, has \nblessed the procedure. There have been some concerns expressed by the \nCourt.\n  My amendment tries to, one, legitimize what the administration has \ncreated at Guantanamo Bay in terms of a review process to determine who \nis an enemy combatant and who is not. We made two small changes. We \nhave learned in the past that sometimes people have been because of a \nsingle statement made, while in the hands of a foreign agency, a \nforeign country, that was given under duress. The amendment says that \nif a civilian is to determine enemy combatant status in a statement \nfrom a foreign interrogation, you have to prove that the statement was \nnot unnecessarily coerced. Most Americans, I think, agree with that, \nand the people at Guantanamo Bay agree with that.\n  Second, the civilian who will determine from the appeal process \nwhether or not the enemy combatant status, which is reviewed annually, \nshould be held, would be appointed by the Senate as a Presidential \nappointment. Gordon England is doing it now, and he is a Presidential \nappointee. That continues the trend. I think it would be good to have \nthe Senate involved.\n  What does this mean, very briefly? It means we can go to the world \nand say we have a procedure in place at Guantanamo Bay that will \ndetermine who an enemy combatant is and that these procedures are \nblessed by the courts, they are blessed by the Congress, and they are \nblessed by the administration. It would be good to be able to say, as a \nnation, that all three branches of Government--the executive branch, \nthe judicial branch and the legislative branch--have all agreed on \nprocedures to take enemy combatants off the battlefield and give those \npeople who are suspected of being enemy combatants due process rights \nconsistent with whom we are as a people and give enough flexibility to \nthe military to make sure these people do not go back to the fight.\n  The truth is, several hundred have been captured and released. The \nprocess is working very well at Guantanamo Bay. I compliment the \nadministration for setting up a combat status review process that has \nbeen changed a couple of times. It is eminently fair. This amendment \nblessed that process. It has two small changes. It would strengthen the \nprocess, and it would end this never-ending court debate about what to \ndo.\n  The courts have been telling us, Congress, if you got involved, it \nwould help us figure out what we should be doing. Justice Scalia, as \nSenator McCain indicated, screamed out, in a dissenting opinion \ngranting habeas corpus rights to enemy combatants, that the courts are \nill-equipped to run this war. Now, with this amendment, the Congress \nwill bless what the administration has put in place, making small \nchanges which will strengthen the administration's hands in the court. \nThe courts will feel more comfortable ratifying this process, and we \nwill be a united nation, a united front in all three branches of \nGovernment when it comes to dealing with enemy combatants.\n  It is very important that anyone who engages in unlawful enemy \ncombatant activities against this Nation be taken off the battlefield \nand kept off the battlefield as long as necessary to make us safe. They \ndeserve a certain amount of process because whom we are as a people and \nthe process we are blessing gives them very adequate due process \nrights.\n  This amendment strengthens those rights. They deserve to be taken off \nthe battlefield, and people engaging in unlawful enemy combatant \nactivities should be taken off the battlefield as long as necessary to \nprotect our country.\n  Second, they deserve to be prosecuted in some instances. There are \nthree things we are trying to accomplish. We are trying to standardize \ninterrogation techniques to protect our own troops and have a one-stop \nshopping for what the rules are. That is through Senator McCain's \namendment. We are trying to keep the moral high ground, as expressed by \nthe President,\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nto say we are not torturing people, we are not going to treat people \ninhumanely because that weakens us. The bottom line, it is not the \nright way to get good information and weakens us. The more \nstandardization the better.\n  When it comes time to keep people off the battlefield, with this \namendment we are stronger as a nation because Congress will have \nblessed what the administration has done.\n  In that regard, I offer this amendment as a way to bring clarity to a \nsituation that is very important in the war on terror. We need to keep \nenemy combatants, once they have been lawfully determined to be an \nenemy combatant, off the battlefield as long as it takes to secure this \nNation. This amendment helps to do that.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am informed there are objections from \nMembers of the Committee on Armed Services to this amendment. I urge \nthem to come over and defend their position.\n  This Senator was prepared to accept the amendment. It may be subject \nto a point of order. I am not sure. I do believe there are detainee \nitems in the House-passed bills that would be germane under the \ncircumstances, but it is another example, I might say, of the problems \nwe get into when items that pertain to legislation end up on \nappropriations bills.\n  We are not really prepared to debate the amendment. I urge Members of \nthe Committee on Armed Services who wish to do so to debate this \namendment.\n  My only question is--I know the Senator is an extremely good \nattorney--has the phrase ``unlawful enemy combatant'' been used in any \nother portion of our laws of the Geneva Conventions?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. It is in the Geneva Conventions. There is a section \nabout unlawful enemy combatant, illegal enemy combatant.\n  The conventions are set up to confer status on signatories and to \nmake sure that people who engage in unlawful activity are not covered. \nThe people who wear civilian clothes that go in the population and \nengage in terrorist activity have never been covered under the \nconvention. Under the convention, that is the definition they are \ngiving.\n  The administration has used the term that has been legitimized by the \ncourts for quite a while now in international law. In the review \nprocess at Guantanamo Bay, they will take the person off the \nbattlefield. They have to make a case whether they fit the definition \nof enemy combatant. Each year they can challenge the designation. What \nwe are doing in this amendment is basically blessing that procedure, \nrequiring two more things.\n\n  One, the idea that the Senate will confirm the person who will \nultimately have the release authority or the appeal authority to enemy \ncombatant status; and two, prohibit the use of a single statement to \nhold somebody as an enemy combatant who was in a foreign government's \nhands, unless we can show the statement was not a result of torture.\n  We have learned from our experience at Guantanamo Bay that would be a \ngood change.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator know how many detainees have been \nbrought to trial in Guantanamo Bay?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Of all the people we have detained--over 500--no one has \nbeen brought to trial yet. Two will be brought to trial in November.\n  One of the reasons that we cannot bring people to trial is because \nthe Federal courts have issued a stay on prosecutions that has now been \nlifted. We are moving forward.\n  There is another Supreme Court case dealing with the due process \nrights of determining whether a person is an enemy combatant. The \nprocedure is in place at Guantanamo Bay and has been generally blessed \nby the Court because they have been stayed on those proceedings, too.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, aren't there two different \nCourt decisions now that are in direct contravention of each other as \nto the disposition of these cases?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes there is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could the Senator describe those.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There was a stay by Federal district judge, staying \nmilitary commission trials. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals overrode \nthe lower court. That has gone up to the Supreme Court right now. I am \nconfident the Supreme Court will legitimize military commissions, maybe \nwith some changes.\n  This amendment deals with detaining somebody who is not being \nprosecuted yet, who may be prosecuted, but keeping them off the \nbattlefield because we have determined they are an unlawful enemy \ncombatant. The review process to make that determination I feel very \ncomfortable with. And there are some small changes in the amendment. \nThe courts have told us this is an area where Congress needs to act. \nThe courts have many cases, not just one, challenging the Guantanamo \nBay procedures and determining unlawful enemy combatant. Justice Scalia \nsaid in the dissenting opinion, if this were an area where Congress \nspoke, the courts would welcome their involvement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I guess \nmy fundamental question is, aren't things in one heck of a mess?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The legal status of military commissions and the combat \nstatus review process are in legal limbo unnecessarily.\n  If you read these opinions, they are a hodgepodge of different \ndissenting and concurring opinions. The one common theme is the courts \nare suggesting to Congress we get involved.\n  When it comes to combat status review, I am totally convinced, after \ntalking with now Chief Justice Roberts, this would be an area where the \ncourts would welcome congressional involvement. He said to me in the \nhearings that the President or the executive branch is at its strongest \nwhen they have the implied or express support of the Congress.\n  So the purpose of this amendment, if I may say very briefly, is for \nCongress to legitimize what is going on at Guantanamo Bay about \ndetermining enemy combatant status, legitimizing that review process by \nmaking some changes. If we would do that, I am convinced the courts \nwould welcome that involvement and a lot of this litigation would end \novernight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, has this matter been \ndiscussed in the Committee on Armed Services?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have discussed it with one of the cosponsors of the \namendment, Senator Warner, yes. I have been to Guantanamo Bay with \nSenator Warner and others, where we have talked about this. Yes, sir, I \nam very sure that the chairman knows about this because he is a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, that is another question. We were \nprepared to accept the amendment because--I don't claim expertise in \nthis area; it is not within our jurisdiction. It is legislation on an \nappropriations bill, but I don't intend to raise an objection to it.\n  Has this been discussed, on a bipartisan basis, in the committee?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I was under the assumption the amendment was going to be \naccepted, as you were, and now I have been told there are some concerns \nfrom the minority on the committee. I have talked extensively about \nthese series of amendments. They all work in conjunction with each \nother. Senator McCain's amendment standardized interrogation techniques \nand what we as a people want to live by--we do not want to torture \npeople. We are not going to torture people.\n\n  My amendment standardizes and makes small changes to the \ndetermination of who is an enemy combatant and who is not, because you \nkeep people at Guantanamo Bay indefinitely under this procedure. It \nneeds to be blessed by Congress. The third thing we do, later on, is \ndeal with military commissions, actually how you try these people.\n  So I was under the understanding, I say to the Senator, that not only \nwas Senator Warner a cosponsor of these two amendments, but that \neverybody was on board. The point here is to give the courts some \nguidance to bring about legal certainty where there is a legal mass, as \nSenator McCain indicated. So I don't know why anybody is objecting.\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I believe the Senator's amendment has \nreal merit. I find no objection to it. It has been conveyed to me by \nthe administration. We still have a very small difference--it sounds \nlike a big difference--on the McCain amendment. But we have no \ndifference on this amendment. We are prepared to accept it, unless \nsomeone comes over here and finds a way to articulate an objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor his cooperation. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his \nunique and very important perspective on this issue. But I also point \nout it is very unfortunate--very unfortunate--the Senator from South \nCarolina has to put this on an appropriations bill. I do not want to \nget off the subject too much, but there is something wrong with our \nprocess here that I have to, for my amendment, find some narrow \ngermaneness in order to get around my commitment to not authorize on an \nappropriations bill. Technically, I am not authorizing on an \nappropriations bill.\n  It is very unfortunate the Senator from South Carolina has to \nauthorize on an appropriations bill. There may be some objection from \nsomeone in the minority. There may be some question. That is because we \nare not going through an orderly process. This should have been as an \namendment on the authorization bill, and that should have been taken \nup. If someone did not like it, they could have voted to take it out. \nNow we are in a process where the Senator from South Carolina has to \nput it in.\n  Our system here is broken, and we need to properly authorize. I \ncertainly am not blaming the Senator from Alaska. He has his \nresponsibility to get the appropriations bill done. But there is \nsomething wrong when we are in a war--in a war; Americans' lives are on \nthe line as we speak--and somehow we do not have room in our agenda to \nauthorize the training, the equipping, the benefits, the pay, all of \nthe things that go with an authorization bill, including the amendment \nof the Senator from Carolina.\n  A lot of us have repeatedly decried that this process of legislating \nis so badly broken today that we cannot even take care of the men and \nwomen in the military in an orderly fashion. It cries out for fixing. I \nwould hope at some point we, as a body, would fix this system so we \nauthorize before we appropriate funds. Again, this is meant as no \ncriticism of the Senator from Alaska. He is playing the hand he is \ndealt. But there is something very badly wrong when we are in a war and \nsomehow we cannot find time in our agenda and ought to authorize the \nmuch-needed pay raises, equipment, training, and all of the other \nthings that go along with the authorization of our Nation's defenses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from South Carolina for bringing focus to this issue. \nThey are approaching this issue in different ways, but it is a matter \nof enormous importance and consequence. Both Senators, as members of \nthe Armed Services Committee, remember the good deal of thought, work, \nand consideration given this subject matter by the Armed Services \nCommittee under the guidance of Senator Warner and Senator Levin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Madam President, now is time for action. That is why I rise to speak \nin strong support of the McCain amendment and urge our colleagues to \nunderstand it and to give it strong support as well.\n  As we know, nearly 2 years ago, American soldiers at Abu Ghraib were \nstruggling to figure out how to handle the hundreds of detainees who \nwere pouring into that facility. They had no guidance. They had no \ndirections to regulate that treatment. In the absence of that guidance, \ntheir treatment of detainees deteriorated into cruel and inhumane and \ndegrading treatment.\n  They documented their cruelty, and the images are still horrifying--\nan Iraqi prisoner in a dark hood and cape, standing on a cardboard box \nwith electrodes attached to his body; naked men forced to simulate sex \nacts on each other; the corpse of a man who had been beaten to death, \nlying in ice, next to soldiers smiling and giving a ``thumbs up'' sign; \na pool of blood from the wounds of a naked, defenseless prisoner \nattacked by a military dog.\n  The reports of widespread abuse by U.S. personnel was initially met \nwith disbelief and then incomprehension. But the reports are too \nnumerous to ignore. We had reports of detainees in Afghanistan shackled \nto the floor, left out in the elements to freeze to death. We have had \nreports of detainees in Guantanamo who were subjected to sexual \nhumiliation.\n  Human Rights Watch recently released a report based on the statements \nof three soldiers, one officer and two noncommissioned officers, in the \n82nd Airborne who described how their battalions routinely used \nphysical and mental torture as means of intelligence gathering and \nstress relief--torture as a sport.\n  They stand in sharp contrast to the values America has always stood \nfor: our belief in the dignity and worth of all people, our unequivocal \nstance against torture and abuse, our commitment to the rule of law. \nThe images horrified us and severely damaged our reputation in the \nMiddle East and around the world.\n  Instead of taking responsibility for what happened, the generals and \nsenior administration officials tried to minimize the abuse as the work \nof ``a few bad apples''--all conveniently lower rank soldiers--in a \ndesperate effort to emphasize the role of senior military officials in \nexposing the scandal and insulate the civilian leadership from \nresponsibility for changing the rules.\n  It is clear what the results of those changes were. CPT Ian Fishback, \na West Point graduate and officer in the 82nd Airborne, wrote: Despite \nmy efforts, I have been unable to get clear, consistent answers from my \nleadership about what constitutes lawful and humane treatment of \ndetainees. I am certain that this confusion contributed to a wide range \nof abuses including death threats, beatings, broken bones, murder, \nexposure to elements, extreme forced physical exertion, hostage taking, \nstripping, sleep deprivation and degrading treatment.\n  For nearly 2\\1/2\\ years--from August 2002 until December 2004--the \nexecutive branch of our Government operated under the assumption that \nit was not bound by the law that prohibits torture. The Office of Legal \nCounsel promulgated an official opinion stating that the President and \neveryone acting under his Commander-in-Chief authority was free to \nignore this law. It states:\n\n       Any effort to apply [the anti-torture statute] in a manner \n     that interferes with the . . . detention and interrogation of \n     enemy combatants . . . would be unconstitutional.\n\n  This opinion was adopted and implemented by the CIA and the \nDepartment of Defense. Effectively, what it was saying was that for \nanybody who was operating under the DOD, if the purpose of their \ntorture was to get information, then it was basically all right. If the \npurpose of the torture was to bring harm, then it would be illegal. But \nthat decision by the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of \nJustice effectively said: The school is out. People can do anything \nthey want to with any detainee. And that was the rule for 2\\1/2\\ years. \nIt is called the Bybee memorandum. We have had extensive hearings on \nthat in both the Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee.\n  This opinion was adopted and implemented by the CIA and the \nDepartment of Defense. Harold Koh, a leading scholar of international \nlaw and dean of Yale Law School, who served in both the Reagan and \nClinton administrations, called it ``the most clearly legally erroneous \nopinion'' he has ever read. That is in reference to the Bybee \nmemorandum that was requested by the CIA and the Department of Defense, \nthrough the Attorney General, from the Office of Legal Counsel, to give \nthem a memorandum to effectively permit wholesale torture. They \nreceived that memo, and they used it\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\nto gut our long-standing laws. That Bybee memo was the law of the land, \neffectively, in the CIA and the Department of Defense for 2\\1/2\\ years. \nWe saw what the results were. The McCain amendment would make sure that \nwill not happen again.\n  Our political leaders made deliberate decisions to throw out the \nwell-established legal framework that has long made America the gold \nstandard for human rights throughout the world. The administration left \nour soldiers, case officers, and intelligence agents in a fog of \nambiguity. They were told to ``take the gloves off'' without knowing \nwhat the limits were, and the consequences were foreseeable.\n\n  In rewriting our human rights laws, the administration consistently \noverruled the objections of experienced military personnel and \ndiplomats. The Secretary of State, Colin Powell, warned the White \nHouse:\n\n       It will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice \n     in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the \n     protections of the law of war for our [own] troops.\n\n  Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the rules could \nlead to so-called ``force drift'', in which, without clearer guidance, \nthe level of force applied to an uncooperative detainee might well \nresult in torture.\n  William Taft, the State Department Legal Advisor in President Bush's \nfirst term, recently called it a source of amazement and disappointment \nthat the Justice Department severely limited the applicability of the \nGeneva Conventions to the detainees. In an address at American \nUniversity, he said the decision to do so:\n\n     unhinged those responsible for the treatment of the detainees \n     . . . from the legal guidelines for interrogation . . . \n     embodied in the Army Field Manual for decades. Set adrift in \n     uncharted waters and under pressure from their leaders to \n     develop information on the plans and practices of al Qaeda, \n     it was predictable that those managing the interrogation \n     would eventually go too far.\n\n  And they did.\n  The Judge Advocates General echoed Mr. Taft's concerns. On July 14, \n2005, the JAGs appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nSubcommittee on Personnel. In response to questioning by my friend \nSenator Graham, the witnesses acknowledged that the Justice \nDepartment's policy embodied in the Bybee torture memorandum's \ndefinition of torture was a violation of international and domestic law \nand alarmed the Judge Advocates General who reviewed it.\n  Their alarm was well founded because their concerns were overruled by \nGeneral Counsel William Haynes, who issued the Defense Department's \nApril 2003 Working Group Report. The report twisted and diluted the \ndefinition of ``torture,'' claimed that military personnel who commit \ntorture may invoke the defenses of ``necessity'' and ``superior \norders,'' and advised military personnel that they are not obligated to \ncomply with the Federal prohibition on torture.\n  Senator Graham himself accurately assessed the impact of the civilian \nauthorities when he told the JAG officers at the hearing: I think it is \nfair to say that the Department of Defense was secondary to the \nDepartment of Justice in a political sense, and that was our problem. \nIf they had listened from the outset, we wouldn't have had a lot of the \nproblems that we have had to deal with in the past.\n  The President is not an emperor or a king. His administration is not \nabove the law or accountability, and he is certainly not infallible.\n  The single greatest criticism of this administration's detention and \ninterrogation policies is that it failed to respect history, the \ncollective wisdom of our career military and State Department \nofficials, and that it holds far too expansive a view of executive \nauthority. In short, the White House suffers from the arrogance of \nthinking they knew best and abandoning the long-standing rules.\n  As Captain Fishback wrote:\n\n       We owe our soldiers better than this. Give them a clear \n     standard that is in accordance with the bedrock principles of \n     our nation.\n       We are America, and our actions should be held to a higher \n     standard, the ideals expressed in documents such as the \n     Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n\n  The McCain amendment takes a strong step forward to giving our troops \nthat standard. I hope it is supported. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Captain Fishback's letter, which was published in the \nWashington Post, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am a graduate of West Point \n     currently serving as a Captain in the U.S. Army Infantry. I \n     have served two combat tours with the 82nd Airborne Division, \n     one each in Afghanistan and Iraq. While I served in the \n     Global War on Terror, the actions and statements of my \n     leadership led me to believe that United States policy did \n     not require application of the Geneva Conventions in \n     Afghanistan or Iraq. On 7 May 2004, Secretary of Defense \n     Rumsfeld's testimony that the United States followed the \n     Geneva Conventions in Iraq and the ``spirit'' of the Geneva \n     Conventions in Afghanistan prompted me to begin an approach \n     for clarification. For 17 months, I tried to determine what \n     specific standards governed the treatment of detainees by \n     consulting my chain of command through battalion commander, \n     multiple JAG lawyers, multiple Democrat and Republican \n     Congressmen and their aides, the Ft. Bragg Inspector \n     General's office, multiple government reports, the Secretary \n     of the Army and multiple general officers, a professional \n     interrogator at Guantanamo Bay, the deputy head of the \n     department at West Point responsible for teaching Just War \n     Theory and Law of Land Warfare, and numerous peers who I \n     regard as honorable and intelligent men.\n       Instead of resolving my concerns, the approach for \n     clarification process leaves me deeply troubled. Despite my \n     efforts, I have been unable to get clear, consistent answers \n     from my leadership about what constitutes lawful and humane \n     treatment of detainees. I certain that this confusion \n     contributed to a wide range of abuses including death \n     threats, beatings, broken bones, murder, exposure to \n     elements, extreme forced physical exertion, hostage-taking, \n     stripping, sleep deprivation and degrading treatment. I and \n     troops under my command witnessed some of these abuses in \n     both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       This is a tragedy. I can remember, as a cadet at West \n     Point, resolving to ensure that my men would never commit a \n     dishonorable act; that I would protect them from that type of \n     burden. It absolutely breaks my heart that I have failed some \n     of them in this regard.\n       That is in the past and there is nothing we can do about it \n     now. But, we can learn from our mistakes and ensure that this \n     does not happen again. Take a major step in that direction; \n     eliminate the confusion. My approach for clarification \n     provides clear evidence that confusion over standards was a \n     major contributor to the prisoner abuse. We owe our soldiers \n     better than this. Give them a clear standard that is in \n     accordance with the bedrock principles of our nation.\n       Some do not see the need for this work. Some argue that \n     since our actions are not as horrifying as Al Qaeda's, we \n     should not be concerned. When did Al Qaeda become any type of \n     standard by which we measure the morality of the United \n     States? We are America, and our actions should be held to a \n     higher standard, the ideals expressed in documents such as \n     the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n       Others argue that clear standards will limit the \n     President's ability to wage the War on Terror. Since clear \n     standards only limit interrogation techniques, it is \n     reasonable for me to assume that supporters of this argument \n     desire to use coercion to acquire information from detainees. \n     This is morally inconsistent with the Constitution and \n     justice in war. It is unacceptable.\n       Both of these arguments stem from the larger question, the \n     most important question that this generation will answer. Do \n     we sacrifice our ideals in order to preserve security? \n     Terrorism inspires fear and suppresses ideals like freedom \n     and individual rights. Overcoming the fear posed by terrorist \n     threats is a tremendous test of our courage. Will we confront \n     danger and adversity in order to preserve our ideals, or will \n     our courage and commitment to individual rights wither at the \n     prospect of sacrifice? My response is simple. If we abandon \n     our ideals in the face of adversity and aggression, then \n     those ideals were never really in our possession. I would \n     rather die fighting than give up even the smallest part of \n     the idea that is ``America.''\n       Once again, I strongly urge you to do justice to your men \n     and women in uniform. Give them clear standards of conduct \n     that reflect the ideals they risk their lives for.\n           With the Utmost Respect,\n\n                                           Capt. Ian Fishback,\n\n                                           82nd Airborne Division,\n                                       Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1992\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, more than 2,000 years have passed since \nCicero said, ``Endless money forms the sinews of war.''\n  Let me repeat what I have said. More than 2,000 years have passed \nsince Cicero, a great Roman senator, said, ``Endless money forms the \nsinews of war.''\n  How astute he was to point that out and how little the times have \nchanged. Today, the United States is engaged not just in one war but \ntwo wars. The first of the two wars began 4 years ago when our country \nwas invaded. Our country was attacked by 19 hijackers sent on their \ndeadly mission by Osama bin Laden. That war continues today in \nAfghanistan. That is a war that was thrust upon us. That was a war in \nwhich the United States was invaded by 19 hijackers, not one of whom \nwas from Iraq--not one. That war, as I say, was thrust upon us. The \nUnited States was invaded. The United States was attacked and thousands \nof Americans lost their lives. That is the war that I support. That is \nthe war that I supported from the beginning.\n  But there is also another war, a war which the United States started, \na war in which the United States was the attacker. We didn't wait to be \nattacked; we attacked another nation. We invaded, the United States \ninvaded another nation that did not pose a threat, a direct and \nimmediate threat to our national security. We, the United States, \ninvaded another country that did not act to provoke our invasion.\n  Since March 19, 2003, our troops, Americans troops, have been sent \ninto the breach in Iraq, a country which had no connection--none--no \nconnection to the September 11 attacks on our country. I was against \nour policy with reference to the invasion of that country, Iraq. I was \nagainst that. That country did not pose an immediate threat to our \nnational security, no. I said so then and I was right. No weapons of \nmass destruction were found. No weapons of mass destruction have been \nfound to this day there in Iraq.\n  I hold no brief for Saddam Hussein, but we acted under the \nunconstitutional doctrine of first strike. The first strike doctrine, \nthat is the doctrine that we followed. That is the doctrine that got us \ninto Iraq. It is unconstitutional on its face. Why? Because the \nConstitution says Congress shall have power to declare war.\n  How can it be constitutional if a President, one man, Republican or \nDemocrat or independent or whatever, can declare war if Congress has \nnothing to say about it, if Congress has no opportunity to debate it?\n  I do not question the inherent power of any President to defend our \ncountry. Congress may be out of town. Congress may be in recess. If we \nare invaded, of course, he has the power to act. But that was not the \ncase here.\n  I and 22 other Senators voted against shifting that power to declare \nwar, that constitutional power to declare war from the Congress to a \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\nand that law is still on the books. It has not been repealed.\n  We can talk about that at another time, but let me say today, these \ntwo wars have cost the lives of many Americans. In the first war, the \none being fought in Afghanistan and elsewhere against Osama bin Laden, \n243 American troops have given their lives in the line of duty. I \nsupport our efforts in that war. I have done so from the beginning.\n  In the second war, the war in Iraq, 1,934 young men and women have \nperished. I disagree with the policy that sent our troops to Iraq, but \nI join with all other patriotic Americans in supporting the men and the \nwomen who have been sent to Iraq. I don't support the policy that sent \nthem there, but I support those men and women. They went, they heeded \nthe call, they did their duty, and they are still doing their duty. Of \ncourse I support them. I join with all other Americans in supporting \nthem and honoring those men and women who have paid the ultimate price \nin service to the United States.\n  In addition to lives lost, these wars have also cost our country a \nfortune, a colossal fortune in our national wealth. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, the Congress has already appropriated \n$310 billion to pay for these two wars. The Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill being debated now in the Senate adds another $50 billion \nto that figure. Most observers believe that tens of billions more \ndollars will be required in a matter of months. Who knows, before it is \nall over, we may find that the ultimate cost in Treasury may amount to \n$1 trillion. Who knows, when we think of all the things that must be \ndone. We have to replenish the equipment that has worn out, that has \nrusted, that has been destroyed--the military equipment. Our own \nmilitary people will have their requests in this year, next year and \nthe next year and the next year, for money to replace that equipment.\n  Could we fight another war if we should be invaded today? Would we be \nprepared to fight another war? Could we?\n  If these estimates are accurate, the cost of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan could easily exceed $400 billion by early next year--$400 \nbillion. That is $400 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. \nThat is a lot of money, isn't it?\n  Once again, ``Endless money forms the sinews of war.''\n  That is simply the visible part of the cost of the war. We are \nslowly, slowly but surely, coming to realize that there are financial \ncosts to the war that are buried deep within the Government's ledgers. \nIn June, the Department of Veterans Affairs admitted to a major \nshortfall in its budget. Working together with Senator Craig and \nSenator Murray, I supported an amendment to add $1.5 billion in \nemergency funds to the veterans health care budget. My colleagues and I \nthen worked to add $1,977,000,000 to the VA budget for the fiscal year \n2006.\n  Why? Why? Why is the VA running short of funds?\n  Part of the reason lies in the fact that the administration did not \nbudget enough funds to take care of troops coming home from these wars \nwith serious injuries. But there is more. These injured veterans have \nearned compensation from the VA for their wounds.\n  According to the Defense Department, more than 15,000 troops have \nbeen wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress is yet to see a full \nestimate of the costs of these veterans' benefits.\n  There is also the matter of revenue that the Government coffers will \nnever see because of the deployment of our troops to these wars. Troops \nserving in combat zones are exempt from income taxes. National \nGuardsmen and reservists often must do without their higher civilian \npay during their deployment. No one would argue that wounded veterans \nshould not receive compensation from the VA or the troops in war zones \nought to pay taxes while they are risking their lives for our country. \nBut the American people are not being told about these hidden costs of \nthese wars. Why? Why is that?\n  The fact is, the administration has never provided the Congress with \na budget estimate of what the war is costing the American taxpayers. \nSome may argue that the budget resolution passed in Congress by the \nthinnest of margins included $50 billion for the cost of the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. That is true. That money is in there. The $50 \nbillion also appears in this appropriations bill. But that estimate is \njust a number made out of whole cloth. The President did not request a \nsingle dime for the wars in his budget estimate submitted to Congress \nin February--not one thin dime, not even one copper penny. Instead, \nCongress picked a number out of thin air--$50 billion--and stuck it in \nthe budget resolution.\n  That number is not backed up by any number crunching, any careful \nanalysis, or any budgetary data. It doesn't even match up with the \nnumbers prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates \nthat $85 billion will be required to fight these wars next year, nor is \nthat $50 billion paid for. This $50 billion is simply added to our \nnational debt, a debt that will have to be paid by our children and our \nchildren's children.\n  I say one more time, ``Endless money forms the sinews of war.'' I am \nquoting Cicero, of course.\n  The administration needs to budget for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It should not be sufficient for Congress to pick a number \nout of a hat, appropriate funds to match that number, and hope that our \ntroops will be taken care of. The administration needs to step up to \nthe plate and tell Congress and the American people how much it expects \nto spend on the war, what the money will be used for, and how our \nNation is going to foot the bill. It may be easier said than done, but \nwe ought to do our best.\n  To some observers, the importance of budgeting for the war may seem \nlike a furor over how much paper should be pushed around in Washington, \nDC. Although the terms used in this debate are arcane--how many people \noutside the beltway know anything, or much at least, about emergency \nsupplementals, the budget process, or outlays and budget authority--the \nprinciples are vitally important to our country.\n  There is an important principle that a country must share the burdens \nof war among its citizens. Think back to World War II and what was \nasked of the American people in that conflict: victory gardens, \ndaylight savings, gasoline rationing, and on and on. We do not see \nanything like that today. Quite the opposite. For the first time in \nAmerican history, our Nation has cut taxes during a time of war.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have forced great sacrifice.\n  Let me say that again.\n  These wars--the war in Afghanistan, which I support, the war in Iraq, \nwhich I have never thought we should engage in--have forced great \nsacrifice among those who serve our country, and their families as \nwell. Our troops risk life and limb while their spouses, their parents, \nand their children pray for their safety and for their return home. It \nis these troops and their families who have had so little relief from \nthe burdens of these wars.\n  Last year, Congress passed a law to compensate Americans for spending \nup to $1,000 out of their own pockets to send body armor, boots, \ngloves, and other equipment to troops serving overseas. But the \nPentagon still has not implemented this law, giving short shrift to \nthose who have done the most to support our troops. These families have \nnot been recompensed for their support of the troops. Why is the \nDefense Department bureaucracy so slow to implement this law? Why? Why \nis the Defense Department bureaucracy so slow to implement this law? It \nought to be a priority to help these Americans who have done so much to \nhelp our troops.\n  The sacrifices demanded by the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nfalling disproportionately on the few. The President has said our \nNation is at war. No. Our Nation is not at war. Our military is at war. \nYes. The National Guard, the men and women in the military, they are at \nwar but not the Nation. We scarcely hear much about it.\n\n  Our troops are shedding their blood, and their families are doing so \nmuch to support them. Meanwhile, the average American goes about his \nday-to-day business with little interruption, only to pause in solemn \nreflection upon the occasional news report about the tragic death of \nanother soldier from his community.\n  When Winston Churchill rallied his country in World War II, he urged \nthe British to ``defend our Island, whatever\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\nthe cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the \nlanding grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets.''\n  It was a call not just to English soldiers to fight but for the \ncountry to share the burden of the struggle.\n  What a stark contrast to the wars we are in today in which so little \nis asked of the American people compared to what is demanded of our \nmilitary personnel. In light of the incredible toll of these wars on \nour country, it is time to rethink that unfair balance of sacrifice.\n  Three times before, the Senate has voted to urge the administration \nto budget for the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so that \nthere may be a debate about how the President intends to spread the \nsacrifice fairly among all Americans. Three times, the Senate has voted \nto urge the administration to budget for the cost of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and three times that call has not been honored, it has \nbeen dismissed. The enormous cost of keeping hundreds of thousands of \ntroops fighting in two wars, each of them half a world away, continues \nto be a black hole in the President's budget.\n  Congress and the American people keep hearing the same old line: The \nadministration cannot budget for the cost of the war because the true \ncost is unknowable. The Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, when he was \nasked about the cost, said the cost is unknowable. Of course, he is \nright. It is unknowable, but surely the administration has some \nestimate somewhere. Surely the Defense Department has some estimate, \nand it has had some estimate--some estimate of what the war was going \nto cost.\n  We have heard that the cost is unknowable. We have heard that many \ntimes before. But it strains one's belief to argue that the Secretary \nof Defense, with legions of bureaucrats and accountants at his \ndisposal, cannot make an estimate of how much it will take to support \nour troops for the fiscal year that began last week. With 18,000 \nAmerican troops in Afghanistan and 149,000 troops in Iraq who are \nrisking their lives each and every day, one would think that the \nPentagon could muster the courage to estimate how much money it will \ntake to support our fighting men and women. We are talking about an \nestimate.\n  The amendment that I offer to the Defense appropriations bill again \nstates the sense of the Senate that the President should budget for the \nwar. We have been at these two wars a long time now. I could understand \nhow he might not be able to budget for the first few months of a war, \nbut we have been at these wars a long time and we still see no budget \nfor them. Still the American people do not know. Whatever is requested \nof the Congress, the administration does it with supplemental \nappropriations bills. There are not very thorough hearings on \nsupplemental appropriations bills. They say: We spent this much and we \nhave to appropriate.\n  The American people do not realize the cost of these wars. So let me \nsay again, the amendment I offer to the Defense appropriations bill \nstates it is the sense of the Senate that the President should budget \nfor these wars. President Roosevelt did it for World War II, President \nJohnson did it for Vietnam, President Clinton did it for Bosnia, \nPresident Bush did it for Kosovo, and it is time to do it for Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Let the American people know how much of their hard-earned tax \ndollars will be needed for these wars. Let Congress debate how these \ncosts must be borne. Let our Government take a responsible approach on \nhow we pay for our troops in the field.\n  I urge my colleagues to once again support the President, support my \namendment, and urge the President to budget for the war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold may have \nhis name added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1992\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1992.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1992.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on budgeting for ongoing \n   military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere overseas)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-87), the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287), and the Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \n     on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005 (Public Law 109-13) each \n     contain a sense of the Senate provision urging the President \n     to provide in the annual budget requests of the President for \n     a fiscal year under section 1105(a) of title 31, United \n     States Code, an estimate of the cost of ongoing military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in such fiscal year.\n       (2) The budget for fiscal year 2006 submitted to Congress \n     by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for \n     fiscal year 2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or \n     Afghanistan.\n       (3) According to the Congressional Research Service, there \n     exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing \n     military operations in the annual budget requests of the \n     President following initial funding for such operations by \n     emergency or supplemental appropriations Acts, including--\n       (A) funds for Operation Noble Eagle, beginning in the \n     budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year \n     2005;\n       (B) funds for operations in Kosovo, beginning in the budget \n     request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) funds for operations in Bosnia, beginning in budget \n     request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (D) funds for operations in Southwest Asia, beginning in \n     the budget request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (E) funds for operations in Vietnam, beginning in the \n     budget request of President Johnson for fiscal year 1966; and\n       (F) funds for World War II, beginning in the budget request \n     of President Roosevelt for fiscal year 1943.\n       (4) In section 1024(b) of Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n     Tsunami Relief, 2005 (119 Stat. 252), the Senate requested \n     that the President submit to Congress, not later than \n     September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2006 setting forth detailed cost \n     estimates for ongoing military operations overseas during \n     such fiscal year.\n       (5) The President has yet to submit such an amendment.\n       (6) The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006, as \n     reported to the Senate by the Committion on Appropriations of \n     the Senate on September 28, 2005, contains a bridge fund of \n     $50,000,000,000 for overseas contingency operations, but the \n     determination of that amount could not take into account any \n     Administration estimate on the projected cost of such \n     operations in fiscal year 2006.\n       (7) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that fiscal year 2006 cost of ongoing military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could total \n     $85,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal \n     year 2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas, \n     including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be \n     included in the annual budget of the President for such \n     fiscal year as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of \n     title 31, United States Code;\n       (2) the amendment to the budget of the President for fiscal \n     year 2006, requested by the Senate to be submitted to \n     Congress not later than September 1, 2005, by section 1024(b) \n     of Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n     Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, is necessary \n     to describe the anticipated use of the $50,000,000,000 bridge \n     fund appropriated in this Act and set forth all additional \n     appropriations that will be required for the fiscal year; and\n       (3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing \n     military operations overseas should be provided in \n     appropriations Acts for such fiscal year through \n     appropriations to specific accounts set forth in such \n     appropriations Acts.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I have indicated the purpose of the amendment and the \nintent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, did the manager of the bill have something?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It would be the intent of the managers of the bill to \nindicate to Senator Byrd that we would be pleased to accept that \namendment when the time comes. We will leave up\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\nto Senator Byrd when he wants to have the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator indicated he would be willing to have the \namendment considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1992) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is similar to an amendment we have carried in the \nbill before. We appreciate the Senator's position. It is the position \nof the Senate. The President has decided otherwise, but we hope next \nyear the regular Defense bill will include the moneys for the ongoing \nwar on terrorism.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nthe great State of Alaska for his statement. I thank the very great \nSenator from the State of Alaska for his statement and his support. I \nalso thank our colleague on this side of the aisle, the other manager \nof the bill, Senator Inouye, for his support.\n  Incidentally, may I say I guess I am the only remaining person in \nCongress who voted for the entry of both Alaska and Hawaii into the \nUnion. Praise God, I did that in each case. These are two fine \nSenators, two of the greatest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by paying my respect to the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who has for several years now on \nthe subject of Iraq been perhaps the most forceful and eloquent and \nprescient Member of the Senate with respect to the events there. He has \nbeen consistent. He has been strong. All Members in the Senate are \nenormously respectful of his voice and his leadership on this issue.\n  I know for the Senator from West Virginia, the years I have been \nhere, there has been no more stalwart, dedicated, reliable defender of \nAmerica's interests anywhere in the world. There has been no one who \nhas stood up more for our young men and women in uniform. I know this \njourney he has taken with respect to his feelings about the war were \nnot easy, and they were contrary in some ways to that long record on \nthe surface. But it is when you get below the surface and look at some \nof the continuity of his thinking about the Constitution, about our \nobligations as Senators, and about the fundamental reasons why you send \nyoung men and women to fight anywhere that you see that, indeed, what \nhe is fighting for now is as consistent with what he has fought for \nthroughout his record and career in the Senate. I thank him for that \nand pay my respect to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his observations, for his loyalty to his country, for \nhis service to his country, and for the costs to his human self. For \nthat great service, I thank him. And I thank him for the statement he \nhas just made.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2033\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending amendment, and I call up amendment numbered 2033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bayh, \n     Mr. Durbin, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, \n     and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 2033.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy \n                          Assistance Program)\n\n       At the end of title VII, insert the following:\n\n                Administration for Children and Families\n\n\n                   Low Income Home Energy Assistance\n\n       For making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), \n     $3,100,000,000, for the unanticipated home energy assistance \n     needs of 1 or more States, as authorized by section 2604(e) \n     of the Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(e)), which amount shall be made \n     available for obligation in fiscal year 2006 and which amount \n     is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n       Sec. __. Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An imminent emergency is confronting millions of low-\n     income individuals in the United States who are unable to \n     afford the cost of rising energy prices.\n       (2) Prior to the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, \n     individuals in the United States were facing record prices \n     for oil, natural gas, and propane. Hurricane Katrina damaged \n     platforms and ports and curtailed production at refineries in \n     the Gulf of Mexico, the source of almost \\1/3\\ of United \n     States oil output, further raising energy prices.\n       (3) The Short Term Energy Outlook report of the Energy \n     Information Administration of the Department of Energy states \n     that the ranges for expected heating fuel expenditure \n     increases for the winter heating season of 2005-2006 are--\n       (A) 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the \n     Midwest;\n       (B) 17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South;\n       (C) 29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the \n     Northeast; and\n       (D) 39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest.\n       (4) According to the National Energy Assistance Directors \n     Association, heating costs for the average family using \n     heating oil are projected to hit $1,666 for the 2005-2006 \n     winter heating season. Those costs would represent an \n     increase of $403 over those costs for the 2004-2005 winter \n     heating season, and an increase of $714 over those costs for \n     the 2003-2004 winter heating season. For families using \n     natural gas, prices are projected to hit $1,568 for the 2005-\n     2006 winter heating season, representing an increase of $611 \n     over those costs for the 2004-2005 winter heating season, and \n     an increase of $643 over those costs for the 2003-2004 winter \n     heating season. States need additional funding immediately to \n     help low-income families and seniors to ensure that they can \n     afford to heat their homes.\n       (5) The Mortgage Bankers Association expects that steep \n     energy costs could increase the number of missed mortgage \n     payments and lost homes beginning later this year.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nKennedy, Jack Reed, Dorgan, Jeffords, Mikulski, Lautenberg, Corzine, \nKohl, Bayh, Durbin, Cantwell, Clinton, Schumer, Baucus, Harry Reid, \nDayton, Stabenow, Harkin, Coleman, Snowe, Dodd, Levin, and Bingaman. I \nask unanimous consent that all of their names be added to the amendment \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know there is a reluctance, and I \nunderstand it, by the managers of the bill to have an amendment on a \nsubject that does not fit neatly and squarely and automatically under \nthe bill. As they know, the number of legislative opportunities here \nare very few now, and we are on the appropriations track. This \namendment has been authorized already, so it is authorized. The \nquestion is what we are going to do to effect it.\n  This is an amendment to deliver $3.1 billion of emergency funding--I \nemphasize ``emergency'' funding--to the Low-Income Heating and Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  The tight natural gas market and the devastating impact of the recent \nhurricanes have resulted in what everyone knows and feels in their \npocketbooks are unusually high fuel prices and very high fuel price \nforecasts for the foreseeable future. According to the Energy \nInformation Agency, families are going to pay about 77 percent more for \nnatural gas in the Midwest, 18 percent more for electricity in the \nSouth, and 33 percent more for heating oil in the Northeast. Heating \noil costs for the average family using heating oil are expected to hit \nabout $1,066 during the upcoming winter. That is $403 more than last \nwinter, and it is $714 more than the winter heating season of 2003-\n2004.\n  Rapidly rising energy costs have an incredibly negative impact on the \nability of low- and even middle-income but fixed-income individuals to \nbe able to meet their demands. High prices are forcing working families \nto choose warmth over other basic necessities, or in the South, in \ncertain seasons, obviously, cool. Those are tough choices to make. The \nNational Energy Assistance Directors' Association found that 32\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\npercent of families sacrificed medical care last year in order to be \nable to meet those prices, 24 percent failed to make rent or meet \nmortgage payments, and 20 percent went without food for at least a day. \nWe have a whole bunch of people in America who are giving up food or \nrent or medical care in order to be able to pay for the home heating \noil.\n  Hurricane Katrina is a stark reminder of precisely what happens when \nthe Government does not prepare ahead of time for disaster. We have an \nopportunity now to prepare ahead of time. If we do not act now, \nfamilies are going to be forced to choose between medical care and heat \nduring the winter. That is just around the corner. In November, it \nbegins to get cold in a lot of States. The fact is, having to choose \nbetween a warm house or a full stomach for your children is not a \nchoice anyone in America, the wealthiest nation on the face of the \nplanet, wealthiest industrial nation, ought to welcome.\n  The number of households receiving what is known as the LIHEAP \nassistance has increased from about 4.2 million in fiscal year 2002 to \nmore than 5 million this year, which is the highest in 10 years. LIHEAP \napplications are expected to increase very significantly this winter. \nYet the funding levels for LIHEAP are not keeping pace. LIHEAP's buying \npower is significantly less than when it was established. According to \nthe Government's Consumer Price Index, what cost $100 in 1982 cost just \nshy of $200 in 2004. Using the CPI calculation for inflation, that \nmeans that a $1.8 billion appropriation for LIHEAP in 1982 should have \nbeen a $3.7 billion appropriation in 2004. LIHEAP currently serves less \nthan 15 percent of those people who are eligible in the country.\n  I understand this amendment can be blocked procedurally. I know that. \nI hope that will not happen. It is a bipartisan amendment. It is not my \npreference to attach it to this bill, but it is our only option with \nthe recess coming up in a few days. After the comments of the Secretary \nof Energy this week that the administration has no plans of asking \nCongress for more money, we have no choice but to say this is on the \ncongressional agenda, this is on our radar.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment to add $3.1 \nbillion for LIHEAP in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. It is \nemergency funding. It does not require an offset as a result. It is an \nemergency. It is the amount we have authorized. It represents the \namount we need. It is critical funding to avoid a looming but \nabsolutely preventable crisis for millions of American families who \nhave been hard hit by the additional costs of fuel oil and the \ndiminishing affordability of home heating oil as the winter approaches.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2005\n\n (Purpose: To curtail waste under the Department of Defense web-based \n                             travel system)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and call up Coburn amendment No. 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2005.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     obligated or expended for the further development, \n     deployment, or operation of any web-based, end-to-end travel \n     management system, or services under any contract for such \n     travel services that provides for payment by the Department \n     of Defense to the service provider above, or in addition to, \n     a fixed price transaction fee for eTravel services under the \n     General Services Administration eTravel contract.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an issue that came to my attention \nnot long after I was sworn in as a Senator. I hope the American public \npays attention to the system I am getting ready to describe because way \ntoo many things in the Federal Government are bought this way.\n  The goal of the Defense Travel System was a worthy goal. It said: We \ntravel so much, we ought to have a system that gets us the best fare \nand can do that on a routine basis so we can save money when Defense \nDepartment employees travel. They contracted with a firm to develop \nthat system. It was not necessarily a competitive bid contract either.\n  What this amendment does is prohibit money from being spent on \noperations and further development of the system because, quite \nfrankly, it does not work. It works less well than any private travel \nsystem that is out there now. It works less well than the GSA's travel \nsystem.\n  We are now close to $500 million being spent with one contractor to \ndevelop a system that does not work. The system did not work at the \nfirst development stage, which cost $47.3 million, and the Defense \nDepartment bailed them out. It did not work. It has never met the \nrequirements or the efficiency or the savings that it was supposed to \nmeet.\n  It is kind of similar to one of those things you get into and you \nkeep hoping it will work, keep hoping it will work, and then it does \nnot work. Well, the American taxpayers are now on the hook for almost \n$500 million.\n  The Defense Department does not even own this program. That was \nrecently changed so the contracting law could be avoided, in terms of \ngoing after this contractor on it, because it was not competitively \nbid, because it was not managed properly.\n  When you review the DTS system, in 2002, the DOD Inspector General \nsaid it should be shut down unless a cost-benefit analysis was prepared \nthat showed the worthiness of its continuation. No analysis has ever \nbeen conducted. That was in 2002, and we had only spent about $100 \nmillion on it. We are now at $500 million. There is no cost-benefit \nanalysis that has been done. Every Defense Department employee can \ntravel cheaper following some other system than this system. We do not \nown it. We keep paying for it. We keep paying for the development of \nit.\n  The American taxpayers are getting hooked, and yet when we are \nfinished with it, we are still not going to have a system that is as \ngood as what is in the private sector. It is a boondoggle, at best.\n  Program Assessment and Evaluation testified they were unable to \ncomplete an analysis because the DTS office had not even kept enough \ndocumentation of their own expenditures to make a reliable assessment.\n  We have big contracting problems in the Defense Department, and this \nis the best example I know of that ought to be eliminated tomorrow.\n  At the end of the seventh year of an 8-year contract, a cumulative \ntotal of 370,000 travelers had utilized DTS out of 5.6 million annual \nDOD travelers. So for $500 million, over the 7 years, we have had \n370,000 travelers. It has cost us $1,500 per ticket, not counting the \nprice of the air fare.\n  There is not anybody in America who would look at this, with any \ncommon sense, and say we ought to continue this boondoggle.\n  The utilization rate for the current calendar year under the Defense \nTravel System is at 15 percent. That means only one in eight employees \nof DOD uses this system to buy a ticket. And then they do not always \nget the best price.\n  In order to break even with the costs of DTS annualized--in other \nwords, its annual cost--90 percent of DOD employees would have to use \nit. They are not using it. DTS costs $40 to $50 million per year in \noperations and maintenance. Orbitz does not come close to it. The GSA \naccounting system does not come close to it. None of them come close to \nit. Yet we are continuing to spend $50 million of the American people's \ntaxpayer dollars before we get the first ticket. So it is a system that \ndoes not work. It is broken. The contracting mechanism is broken. Yet \nwe still have people who are going to come to the floor to defend a \nsystem that is broken.\n  Travel executive Robert Langsfeld testified at the hearing that DTS \nperformed less effectively than any--any--civilian e-travel system. We \nhave $500 million in it, and it is unending on what we are going to \nhave, and it still\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\nworks worse than any private e-travel system. We have spent half a \nbillion dollars.\n  The Federal Government has also spent this money on a system that is \nnot even reliable. It might work one day and does not work the next. It \nmight get you the best fare, it might not.\n  Unlike DTS, GSA e-travel contracts do not pay operations and \nmaintenance for the programs. They only pay a per-transaction fee.\n  So for what was a good idea that turned sour, we continue to pour \nunspoiled milk on soured milk, and it becomes soured milk. So we \ncontinue to spend money on it.\n  The Government still does not own DTS, as I said. It is an \nintellectual property--computer software and source codes. Last year, \nJudge George Miller of the Federal Court of Claims decided he would not \neven look into allegations of violations of the Competition in \nContracting Act because the software and source codes are owned by the \ncontractor. So if the contract were opened for bidding and another \nbidder was awarded the contract, the Government would have nothing left \nbut a $500 million loss.\n  But last week, before the hearing, the contractor promised to \ntransfer ownership of this intellectual property to the Defense \nDepartment at the end of the contract period, if requested. The reason \nfor this, obviously, is to maintain the fiction that the open bidding \non the contract in 2006 is on the level. It is not. There is no open \nbidding. It violates the very laws that were put on the books to try to \nmaintain competition in contracting. Ownership of DTS bounces around to \nwherever it is most convenient for avoiding serious scrutiny.\n  One of the secret changes in the contract that was alleged to have \nviolated the Competition in Contracting Act was the shift from a fee \nper transaction, as we do with all the civilian e-travel systems, to a \ncost plus guaranteed profit for the contractor. That has proven they \nare inept at developing a system. So now we have even changed the \ncontract. Now that we spent $500 million on it, we are now going to \nchange it. We are not going to hold them accountable. We are going to \nguarantee them a profit for incompetency and inefficiency. It is fair \nto have Defense contractors reimbursed on the same terms as civilian \ncontractors and agency contractors who are doing the same thing. My \namendment will permit that, and only that, a cost per service.\n  Another secret contract change was an agreement by the Government to \npay $43.7 million that had been spent in development costs by the \noriginal contractor. We got absolutely nothing for that money. It just \ncovered the losses suffered by the contractor in trying to do something \nthey were not capable of doing, and they are still not capable of \ndoing, rather than to go into the private sector and buy one that was \nalready developed.\n  This is money the Government was not obliged to pay under the \noriginal contract, but we paid it anyway. We paid it anyway--$47 \nmillion. We are trying to pay for Katrina now. We are trying to fund \nthe war in Iraq. We have a $500 million boondoggle that does not work, \nand we will have people defend that on the Senate floor. The fact is, \nthey can't compete. That is what the testimony of the GAO is. That is \nwhat the testimony of everybody is. They do not even compete. And now \nthey are only at a 15-percent utilization rate.\n  Failure carries no negative consequences when we contract this way. \nWhen we contract this way, we violate our oaths as the defender of the \ntaxpayers of this country to spend their money wisely. I know I am up \nagainst a powerful defense contractor as I attack this process. I want \nto support our defense contractors. I want to make sure they are there \nto help us fight and win and defend our freedoms, both here and abroad. \nBut this is the kind of garbage that needs to come out of the \ncontracting system. It is the kind of thing that we need to put on the \nfloor and say: Defend this. Defend it. You cannot defend it. It is \nindefensible that we would spend a half a billion dollars trying to get \nan e-travel system, when they are out there working nine times better \nthan anything this program has developed.\n  I am hopeful the Members of this body, and the American public, more \nimportantly, will call this body, will secure this body's attention on \nissues just like that. If we are going to not steal from our \ngrandchildren, then we have to be about cleaning up the contracting \nprocess in the Pentagon. This is a good first step in doing that.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nDoes the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. COBURN. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Oklahoma. We \nhave been in Iraq for over 3 years. We have been asking for \ninvestigations of these no-bid contracts to these large companies. We \nhave to have Congress accept its responsibility with oversight \nhearings. More oversight hearings have been held by party caucuses in \nthe Senate than by actual committees looking at these same companies we \nthink are profiteering and ripping off taxpayers.\n  Congress has a responsibility, too, not just the Department of \nDefense. We have a responsibility in the Senate. We ought to bring this \nmessage to both of our caucuses and say, When are we going to have \noversight hearings on those contracting with the Pentagon and making \nmillions of dollars and not making us stronger as a nation?\n  I salute the Senator from Oklahoma. It is a delicate subject. He has \nthe courage to bring it before us.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nIraq as well. I come each and every week. The reason I came the first \nweek was that back home in Illinois someone said: I watch a lot of C-\nSPAN. Why don't you talk about the war in Iraq? Why doesn't anybody \ncome to the floor and talk about the men and women dying over there? \nShouldn't that be brought up every day in the Senate--our sons and \ndaughters, husbands and wives, the bravest and best are dying every day \nin Iraq?\n  I thought to myself: How can we be in the middle of a war and go \nabout business as usual on Capitol Hill? We should be talking about \nthis every single day because the war goes on every single day.\n  This morning, the Pentagon released these figures as of 10 o'clock: \n1,942 Americans have been killed in Iraq; 14,902 have been wounded. I \nhave been to these hospitals--Walter Reed, the veterans hospitals back \nin the Midwest--and I have seen these brave men and women who have come \nhome wounded and, trust me, many of those wounds are extremely serious. \nThey have come home with amputations, serious head injuries, and \npsychological scars.\n  Since the Iraqi elections last January, which were greeted by all of \nus with a great deal of praise for the bravery of the Iraqi people, \nsince those elections took place, 507 of these American soldiers have \ndied, 507 funerals in America. The numbers keep climbing. Some days it \nis one at a time. Other terrible days it is five or six. Mr. President, \n1,942 Americans killed in Iraq; almost 15,000 wounded.\n  So I will keep coming to the floor to address this issue, to make \nsure we never forget these men and women and the sacrifice that they, \ntheir families, and people who love them make every single day.\n  I don't want to pretend for a moment this was brought up to me over \nthe weekend. I don't want to pretend for a moment this is the only \ndeath and suffering in Iraq. There are innocent Iraqi people who die \nevery day as well. We cannot even put a number on it. I said to my \nstaff: Go to the United Nations, go to the Red Cross, go to some group \nand tell me how many Iraqis have died since our invasion of Iraq.\n  They cannot come up with a number. Some estimates are very different. \nThe Brookings Institution, which is recognized as a nonpartisan \nresearch organization, puts the estimate between 14,000 and 24,000 \nIraqis who have been killed since the start of the war. Others have \nestimates that go much higher. We don't know. We don't know how many \ninnocent people have died as a result of this war or how many died \nbecause of criminal violence.\n  Iraqis still die every day. Just this last week, we had three \ncoordinated car suicide bombs that went off in a single marketplace. \nYou have seen the\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nphotos. You have seen the people, crushed with grief--the mothers, the \nfriends, and fathers, standing next to the mutilated corpses of these \nvictims. These bombs that were detonated recently were staggered to \nexplode at different times so they killed as many innocent people as \npossible. This is a tactic we have seen over and over again in Israel. \nNow it has come to pass in Iraq on a regular basis. It is despicable, \nit is depraved conduct. It is an example of inhumane cruelty.\n  These attacks on American soldiers and on the innocent Iraqis \nunderline the importance of our mission there and the need for us to be \nprepared to bring this to the right conclusion. We need to have better \ntraining and equipment of the Iraqi security forces and Iraqi police. \nThey must not only have the capability to defend themselves, they must \nhave the will to defend themselves.\n  Last week, General Abizaid, Commander of the Central Command, and \nGeneral Casey, Commander of United States and coalition forces in Iraq, \ntestified before Congress. They disclosed a piece of information that \nhad been classified for a long period of time, but they finally brought \nit out to the American people, and we can speak to it on the floor. It \nis a piece of information we have known from our classified briefings \nfor some time, and it is this: Of over 100 battalions of Iraqi Army \nforces in existence today in Iraq, exactly 1 battalion is ready to \nfight independently--1 out of over 100. That is an incredible number. \nBillions of dollars that we put in there, promises to the American \npeople that Iraqi soldiers will stand and fight so our soldiers can \ncome home, and as of last week, these two generals testified in open \nsession that one battalion is combat ready as an independent force.\n  President Bush has said over and over: As Iraqi forces stand up, we \nwill stand down. There is only one Iraqi battalion. That is about 1,000 \nsoldiers. Only 1 battalion standing up; 146,000 American soldiers \nstanding up. They are trying to bring peace to a country that is \nobviously not ready to defend itself and may not be for a long time.\n\n  Many Members on this side of the aisle and the other side are stating \nvery clearly that we need assessments, not platitudes, when it comes to \nthe situation in Iraq. We need to know how many Iraqi forces must be \ntrained so we can start bringing home American troops. We need to know \nwhen this administration expects we will reach that number. The fact is \nover the last 6 months, despite all the promises that have been made, \nstill only one battalion is ready to fight, and the American people \nneed to know the cost, not just in these graphic human terms, but in \nterms of dollars being spent: $5 billion a month in Iraq. We \nappropriated $18 billion for the reconstruction of war-torn Iraq, and I \nremind my colleagues that when we debated that, I don't recall a single \nSenator coming to the floor and saying: We have to cut spending in some \nother area before we rebuild Iraq. No, they save that argument for the \nrebuilding of America after Hurricane Katrina. But we put the $18 \nbillion in place.\n  Yet when you read the press accounts of the average families in Iraq \ntoday, they tell you that life is so much worse than it was a few years \nago--no electricity, no sewage, no regular water, no security on the \nstreets, fears that their children will be kidnapped on the way to \nschool. They are trying to leave if they can find a way out. That is \nthe real situation in Iraq on the ground today despite the heroic \nefforts of our men and women in uniform. Our men and women in uniform \nhave not failed; the political leaders have failed--failed to come up \nwith a plan which said after Saddam Hussein is gone, this is how we \nwill end this war. Sadly, we were not prepared to answer that question, \nand our soldiers have paid the price.\n  I am told the President this week will be giving a speech to America \nabout Iraq. It is time for some answers, specific answers, and it is \ntime for accountability. Let's get beyond the generalities. We are \ntalking about real human lives--our sons and daughters--and we need \nspecific answers.\n  I respectfully suggest the President ought to address four issues: \nFirst, how many Iraqi forces must be capable of operating on their own \nbefore we can start bringing American soldiers back home, and how soon \nwill we reach those goals?\n  Second, what specific measures will the Bush administration take \nbefore and after the October 15 constitutional referendum to forge the \nnecessary political consensus and reconcile the growing sectarian and \nreligious differences?\n  Three, what efforts has President Bush made or will he make to bring \nin broader international support? The coalition of the willing has been \nshrinking ever since the invasion of Iraq. It is American soldiers and \nsome British soldiers and a few others willing to stand and fight and \nsecure this country. What is this administration doing, if anything, to \nbring in Muslim forces so we can blunt the criticism that we are \nsomehow a force of occupation, unwelcome in this Muslim country?\n  Fourth, how should the American people assess the progress in \nreconstructing Iraq? What are the tangible results of the billions of \ndollars American taxpayers have provided for Iraq? How is this money \nbeing accounted for?\n  I made the point earlier to the Senator from Oklahoma that we have \nyet to have a serious oversight hearing about the no-bid contracts in \nIraq. Haliburton, all of the names we have heard over and over again, \nmultimillion and billion-dollar contracts, and we won't even ask the \nhard questions as to whether the money is being well spent. We are \nshirking our responsibility, our congressional oversight \nresponsibility.\n  I hope the President goes beyond generalities in his speech. Let's \nget down to specifics. Let's say to the American people and the \nsoldiers they love: This is our plan for bringing our troops home from \nIraq.\n  I hope this speech is an announcement that we have a new strategy, a \nstrategy for success, a strategy for our soldiers to come home. Staying \nthe course is not a new strategy. I hope on Thursday the President \nspeaks truth to the American people. I hope he offers honest and \nrealistic assessments of what we face.\n  On October 15, the people of Iraq will vote on a constitution. If it \npasses, there will be parliamentary elections in December. If it is \nrejected, the constitutional process will start all over again in \nDecember.\n  There is a lot of speculation about what might happen. A constitution \nalone is not going to stop the violence, but if the constitution can \nlead to a unified country or the notion of nationhood making any sense, \nthen that constitution is a step in the right direction.\n  Sadly, this nation of Iraq is a nation of many different groups who \nhave yet to show us they can come together, and until they do, it is \nunlikely we can bring our troops home.\n  There were 23 of us in the Senate who voted against the use-of-force \nresolution; 23 of us--1 Republican and 22 Democrats who had serious \nquestions about this decision by this administration to invade Iraq. \nMany of us felt we needed a broader alliance. Many of us felt the \ninformation given to the American people prior to the invasion was \nmisleading about weapons of mass destruction, nuclear threats, and \nalliances with al-Qaida.\n  Sadly, in the 3 years since, we found that information was just plain \nwrong. Information given to the American people to ask them to give \ntheir sons and daughters in combat was just plain wrong. And here we \nstand today.\n\n  Iraq is a diverse place. The war has made the differences among \nreligious and ethnic groups so much more than they were even before our \ninvasion. To add to these internal tensions, I know there are many \nneighbors of Iraq who don't want to see that nation succeed. It is a \nmean neighborhood, no question. Syria, Iran, and others clearly are \nfomenting trouble, making a terrible situation even worse.\n  The enemies of Iraqi progress in unity would like to see this \ndivision and chaos continue. The Sunnis, the Shi'as, the Kurds, and 24 \nother recognized groups have the future of Iraq in their hands. The \nquestion is whether they believe they have the possibility of becoming \na nation and defending themselves.\n  Many Sunnis did not participate in the last election to choose those \nwho wrote the constitution. We have been told as late as today that \nthey are rewriting the constitution 10 days before the election in the \nhopes of winning Sunni support.\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\n  It is hard to believe this is going to result in what we hope for, \nbut I pray it will. A stable Iraq, moving forward, controlling its own \ndestiny, is the best thing for that country and the best thing for \nAmerica.\n  There are a lot of reasons why the Sunnis oppose the constitution. \nThey represent 20 percent of the population, but they represent about \n90 percent of these insurgents who are causing these attacks every day, \nkilling innocent Iraqis and our men and women in uniform. Most Sunnis \nare not insurgents; they are peace-loving people. But they are being \noverrun by forces they cannot control.\n  There is a fight over oil. The oil is primarily in Shi'a and Kurdish \nterritory. The Sunnis resent that fact. They want to make certain the \nriches of that country are shared.\n  The constitution postpones a lot of critical decisions to a later \ndate, but this constitution is the fundamental underlying law that \ncould guide Iraq in its future.\n  I am told that when we take a look at the militias and forces in \nIraq, we find they are basically split into different factions. Only \none battalion combines Iraqis. The others are Kurdish battalions and \nShi'a battalions and Sunni battalions. It does not give a positive \nfeeling about this nation moving forward toward one common country.\n  I hope we can see the changes that are being proposed in this \nconstitution result in its passage and support by all of the different \nforces that can make Iraq a nation on its own feet.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell told President Bush before the war: \nYou break it, you buy it. That is not entirely true. We may well have \nbroken Iraq from what it once was, but we cannot and do not own it. We \nare unwelcome tenants at this moment in that country, but we need to \nstart thinking about when we will return, and we need to have the hope \nand the aspirations of the people of Iraq in our minds and be prepared \nto accept them.\n  President Bush has a chance tomorrow to tell us that there is a new \ncourse, a course that will stop the killing of innocent American \nsoldiers, a course which will avoid those who are wounded and suffering \nas a result of this war in Iraq, and a course which will bring to an \nend quickly the insurgency which kills so many innocent Iraqis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 7:30 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed, provided further that no second-degree \namendments be in order to the amendments prior to the votes. The first \nis the Warner amendment No. 1955, which is defense of germaneness; the \nsecond is Bayh amendment 1933; the next is McCain amendment 1977. \nProvided further that there be 6 minutes equally divided for debate \nprior to each of the above ordered votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might just make a parliamentary inquiry of the \nChair. Our distinguished colleague from Connecticut has been waiting \nfor a period of time. I wish to respect that, but I ask following his \nremarks if the Senator from Virginia could be recognized for the \npurposes of a colloquy with the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not sure if I still have the floor. I say to my \ncolleague from Connecticut that I will speak for about 10 or 12 minutes \nand then will yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that I follow my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Did we understand that the Senator from Illinois wants \nanother 15 minutes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had the floor and has that right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course, I recognize that. I was just trying to be \ninformed as to how the rest of us can plan our schedules. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut might well desire what period of time?\n  Mr. DODD. I would say to my colleague, I hope maybe it is 15 minutes \nor so. Depending upon the reaction of the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the committee, maybe even less time than that. I will try to \nbe brief because I know the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nMichigan are interested in having a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the interest of keeping business \nmoving, I am going to yield the floor at this point and return at a \nlater moment. I will let the Senator from Connecticut take the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1970\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his \ngraciousness. I thank my colleague from Virginia as well for his \nconsideration, and I will try to be brief.\n  I call up amendment No. 1970 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1970.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve the authority for reimbursement for protective, \nsafety, and health equipment purchased for members of the Armed Forces \n                   deployed in Iraq and Central Asia)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Reimbursement for Certain Protective, Safety, \n     or Health Equipment Purchased by or for Members of the Armed \n     Forces for Deployment in Operations in Iraq and Central \n     Asia.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall reimburse a member of the Armed \n     Forces, or a person or entity referred to in paragraph (2), \n     for the cost (including shipping cost) of any protective, \n     safety, or health equipment that was purchased by such \n     member, or such person or entity on behalf of such member, \n     before or during the deployment of such member in Operation \n     Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, or Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom for the use of such member in connection with such \n     operation if the unit commander of such member certifies that \n     such equipment was critical to the protection, safety, or \n     health of such member.\n       (2) Covered persons and entities.--A person or entity \n     referred to in this paragraph is a family member or relative \n     of a member of the Armed Forces, a non-profit organization, \n     or a community group.\n       (3) Regulations not required for reimbursement.--\n     Reimbursements may be made under this subsection in advance \n     of the promulgation by the Secretary of Defense of \n     regulations, if any, relating to the administration of this \n     section.\n       (b) Protective Equipment Reimbursement Fund.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is hereby established an account \n     to be known as the ``Protective Equipment Reimbursement \n     Fund'' (in this subsection referred to as the ``Fund'').\n       (2) Elements.--The Fund shall consist of amounts deposited \n     in the Fund from amounts available for the Fund under \n     subsection (f).\n       (3) Availability.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available \n     directly to the unit commanders of members of the Armed \n     Forces for the making of reimbursements for protective, \n     safety, and health equipment under subsection (a).\n       (4) Documentation.--Each person seeking reimbursement under \n     subsection (a) for protective, safety, or health equipment \n     purchased by or on behalf of a member of the Armed Forces \n     shall submit to the unit commander of such member such \n     documentation as is necessary to establish each of the \n     following:\n       (A) The nature of such equipment, including whether or not \n     such equipment qualifies as protective, safety, or health \n     equipment under subsection (c).\n       (B) The cost of such equipment.\n       (c) Covered Protective, Safety, and Health Equipment.--\n     Protective, safety, and health equipment for which \n     reimbursement shall be made under subsection (a) shall \n     include personal body armor, collective armor or protective \n     equipment (including armor or protective equipment for high \n     mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicles), and items provided \n     through the Rapid Fielding Initiative of the Army, or \n     equivalent programs of the other Armed Forces, such as the \n     advanced (on-the-move) hydration system, the\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\n     advanced combat helmet, the close combat optics system, a \n     Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a gun scope and a \n     soldier intercommunication device.\n       (d) Limitation Regarding Amount of Reimbursement.--The \n     amount of reimbursement provided under subsection (a) per \n     item of protective, safety, and health equipment purchased by \n     or on behalf of any given member of the Armed Forces may not \n     exceed the lesser of--\n       (1) the cost of such equipment (including shipping cost); \n     or\n       (2) $1,100.\n       (e) Ownership of Equipment.--The Secretary shall identify \n     the circumstances, if any, under which the United States \n     shall assume title or ownership of protective, safety, or \n     health equipment for which reimbursement is provided under \n     subsection (a).\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     amounts for reimbursements under subsection (a) shall be \n     derived from any amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Exception.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act and available for the procurement of equipment for \n     members of the Armed Forces deployed, or to be deployed, to \n     Iraq or Afghanistan may not be utilized for reimbursements \n     under subsection (a).\n       (g) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 351 of the \n     Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375; 118. Stat. 1857) is \n     repealed.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is old business in the sense of what I \nam bringing up was a matter considered a little over a year ago on \nsimilar legislation. I regret that I have to come back again this year. \nMy colleagues voted unanimously a year ago to adopt this amendment or \nan amendment very much like it. The other body as well agreed to this \namendment during conference between the two bodies. It became the law \nof the land.\n  The amendment basically said that for those men and women in uniform \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan who purchased--or family members, \nneighbors, or others--essential equipment that they needed in their \nrole as service men and women, it would be reimbursed up to a maximum \namount of $1,100 over a relatively limited period of time. The \namendment was straightforward, clear-cut, and enjoyed the strong \nsupport, I might add, of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, as well as others who believed this was the right thing \nto do.\n  At the time, the Pentagon objected to the amendment, offered talking \npoints against it, and said it was unmanageable to have a reimbursement \nprogram for equipment that our service men and women were having to \neither buy themselves or having bought for them by family members or \nothers.\n  Over the last year and almost a half, I have had some 15 or 16 \nexchanges and correspondence with the leadership of the Pentagon. Up \nuntil today, and I mean literally this afternoon, there had been almost \nno response to this requirement of law. As of today--and I will get to \nthis in a minute--they have decided to issue some regulations. It is \nnot a coincidence that they are offering those proposed regulations the \nvery day I am offering the amendment again on the floor. There is an \nold expression, ``I was born at night but not last night,'' and I would \nlove to believe that this was strictly a matter of timing, but I am \nconcerned that basically there is still a resistance to the idea that \nour service men and women ought to be receiving the kind of equipment \nthey need, particularly in a war zone.\n  As we all know, and again I am stating the obvious, we are at war. \nThe safety and protection of our troops in the field could not be a \nmore serious issue for every single one of us. So why is it that the \nPentagon has repeatedly failed to adequately equip these men and women? \nAs far back as June of 2003, the military was regularly reporting that \nup to a quarter of the troops deployed to Iraq were short of critical \nbody armor needed to protect themselves from shrapnel and AK-47 fire.\n  Just this last June, the Marine Corps Inspector General estimated \nthat 30,000 marines in Iraq needed twice as many heavy machine guns, \nmore fully protected armored vehicles, and more communications \nequipment to perform their operations successfully than they were \ngetting. Let me repeat: 30,000 marines in Iraq need twice as much heavy \nequipment in some areas as they are getting.\n  The Army has had so many troubles mass-producing body armor that it \neventually lost as many as 10,000 armored plates as reported by the \nArmy Inspector General's Office.\n  Most frustrating of all is that as casualties mounted due to roadside \nbombs or, in DOD parlance, the improvised explosive devices, IEDs, we \nfound that the Pentagon had gravely underestimated the necessary armor \nneeded to protect Army and Marine ground vehicles.\n  At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in March of 2004, Acting \nArmy Secretary Les Brownlee--a good friend of mine, I might add--\ntestified that the Army had not made fortifications of humvees a \npriority, saying:\n\n       We simply were not prepared for that kind of \n     counterinsurgency that attacked our convoys.\n\n  As a result of all of these failures, our soldiers, our sailors, our \nairmen and marines, were forced to take matters into their own hands in \nfar too many cases.\n  As early as 2003, the Army's own Soldier Systems Command reported \nthat soldiers, particularly infantrymen, were paying an average of $400 \neach out of their own pockets for their equipment that their civilian \nleaders had failed to provide them. Again, the Soldier Systems Command \nreported those statistics and that the figure did not even include \npersonal body armor that was being purchased. Because they saw the \nPentagon failing our troops, servicemembers and their families have all \npitched in to pay for protective gear, even vehicle armor, so they did \nnot have to see their own people going off to war without the equipment \nthey need to keep safe.\n  Things seemed to come to a head when in December of 2004 a soldier \nasked Secretary Rumsfeld about having to sift through garbage dumps for \nscrap metal for Army vehicle armor. The Defense Secretary cavalierly \nreplied:\n\n       You have to go to war with the Army you have, not the Army \n     you want.\n\n  Of course, we all recall the reaction of the public to that \nstatement. It was very negative, to put it mildly.\n  Two weeks ago, my office received a call from a constituent I will \ncall Gordon, his first name. Gordon is a good American. He is a former \nmayor of a small town in Connecticut and a Vietnam veteran. He asked \nthat he be identified only by his first name because he is afraid of \nretribution against his son. His only son is a lance corporal, recently \ndeployed in Iraq, in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\n  A loyal Republican, Gordon is not looking for Government handouts or \nto be challenging the President of the United States. He just wants his \nson to be safe. That is why last month he contacted the online store \nDiamond Back Tactical and ordered combat gear for his son totaling \n$683.36. His purchase included lower back double-plated body armor, CAT \nNAPP body armor for the lower torso and pelvis area. He willingly paid \nfor the order in full, as would any parent, I suggest. But why is it \nthat this family had to place a purchase order on their own? And how \ncan we bear to let good Americans such as Gordon pay this price when \nthere should be regulations on the books providing reimbursements for \nthese kinds of purchases if we are not going to make them on behalf of \nthese young men and women ourselves?\n  Last week, I met another marine, SGT Todd Bowers, now a reservist \nattending George Washington University, who has already pulled two \ntours in Iraq. On his last deployment, Sergeant Bowers said he was \nfired on by a sniper. It was not the gear provided by the Marine Corps \nthat saved his life but, rather, a $600 rifle scope that his father had \njust purchased at a gun show in Arizona and a pair of goggles he \nhimself bought for $100. The bullet from the insurgent's gun lodged \ninto Sergeant Bowers' scope rather than his skull, and the goggles \nguarded his eyes from scattering shrapnel. Thank goodness Sergeant \nBowers' father made these purchases. But why is it these concerned \nparents had to make these purchases on their own? And what about the \nhundreds of military families without the resources to buy these items? \nAre we going to allow these sons and daughters, husbands and wives in \nuniform to go without the battlefield equipment that is essential for \ntheir safety?\n  This is not a new issue. In fact, we have been sounding the alarm to \nSecretary Rumsfeld and the Pentagon's\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\nleadership for several years now. To address inadequate equipment \nsupplies, in 2003, I proposed an amendment to the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to resolve $322 million in shortfalls \nin critical health and safety gear, identified by the Army itself, \nincluding body armor, camelback hydration systems, and combat helmets. \nUnfortunately, the administration opposed this legislation, and the \namendment was defeated along party lines.\n  Last year, we tried a different approach--requiring the Pentagon to \nreimburse military personnel, their families, and charities that bought \nequipment for military servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fortunately, \nin June of 2004, despite ardent objections, I might add, of the \nDepartment of Defense, this body approved that amendment 91 to 0.\n  On October 9, 2004, this body approved the final version of that \nbill, and the President signed it into law, including a requirement for \nthe Secretary of Defense to implement a reimbursement program by \nFebruary 25 of this year. It is now October 5, 2005, nearly a year \nafter this provision became the law of the land, over 7 months after \nthe Defense Department was required by law to set up a system for the \ntroops to receive compensation for the protective gear they purchase \nfor use in combat, equipment they bought because the Government failed \nto provide it. All of this time has passed and still the administration \nhas failed to comply with the law.\n  My office has made dozens of contacts to the Pentagon, both in phone \ncalls and in letters, and still we heard nothing back and still little \naction has been taken. Maybe they thought they could just ignore the \nlaw or that I might just go away. Instead, under pressure from renewed \npress interest on this issue, the Defense Department finally issued \nearly guidelines--guess when. Today--for implementing the reimbursement \nprogram just over 7 months late.\n  The regulations are incomplete, with provisions for reimbursement for \nonly a select few items. If one needs any proof that DOD is once again \ncoming up short, all one needs to do is look at the list of \nreimbursement items. It does not include the gun scope that saved Todd \nBowers' life. It does not include the gear that Gordon bought for his \nson. It does not even include items that were purchased in an attempt \nto protect humvees with what has been called ``hillbilly armor,'' as \ndepicted by this New York Times story in May of 2004.\n  In this story, a community in New Jersey went out as a community and \nbought a lot of this body armor to use on the floor of humvees to \nprotect the young men and women from their own State from those \nproblems, such as bombs going off that were taking so many lives. This \ngoes back to that date. They would not be included in the list provided \nby the Pentagon.\n\n  As I understand it, there are still no plans for each of the military \nservices to actually enforce these regulations. The Pentagon's \nleadership has done everything in its power, unfortunately, to stop \nthis measure from being implemented, either by circulating talking \npoints against my amendment last year or merely failing to implement \nthe statute as it was enacted a year ago. Why should they stop now, I \nask?\n  In their talking points to Congress last year, the Department of \nDefense actually said that it ``set an unmanageable precedent,'' and \nthat it would actually ``encourage servicemembers and their loved ones \nto purchase equipment on their own.''\n  Such arguments seem absolutely appalling to me. It is the Pentagon's \nfailure to equip our soldiers that is causing servicemembers to go out \nand buy equipment, not legislation promoting reimbursement for gear \nthat should have been provided anyway. If only the Defense Department's \nleadership had kept its commitment to protect our troops, I would not \nbe taking the measures I am taking today.\n  I regret to say I am telling only part of the story. It seems not \nonly the Pentagon miscalculated what the needs are of our troops, but \nit also underestimated the need to fix the problem in short order. At \nthe time I originally introduced my amendment, in June of 2004, the \nPentagon leadership pledged they would have all the equipment needs \naddressed by July 31, 2004. All troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwould have adequate protective gear, they claimed. All appropriate \nvehicles would have the necessary body armor, they said. And according \nto the Pentagon, all our deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines could rest assured that their equipment needs would be met. We \ntherefore crafted our amendment to reimburse troops for purchases only \nmade between September 11, 2001, and July 31, 2004.\n  But, as many military members and their family members such as Gordon \nor Todd Bowers will tell you, private purchases of critical gear are \nstill occurring every day. We owe it to our troops to make sure that \nthey are adequately compensated for these purchases. For all of those \nreasons, I introduced this additional legislation that I hope will move \nthis Government into action.\n  Let me briefly describe what it does. First, since Secretary Rumsfeld \nhas demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to comply with the law, \nwe take out of his hands the requirement to devise the reimbursement \nprogram, and instead we leave it up to the individual troops' unit \ncommanders to decide which equipment need is worthy of reimbursement. \nIf the unit commander thinks it is necessary, they can say reimburse \nfor it. If they say no, you don't get reimbursed. Leave it to your unit \ncommanders. No one knows the needs of our troops better than the \ncommanders deploying alongside our fighting men and women.\n  Rather than waiting for some bureaucrat at the Pentagon to decide \nwhat kind of armor our soldiers and marines should be entitled to, it \nis far more appropriate, in my view, to leave that up to their company \ncommanders or squadron leaders.\n  My colleagues should have no objections to this requirement, since \nthey endorsed the unit commanders' discretion in the original version \nof the amendment that was unanimously passed by this body in 2004.\n  Second, as I have already stated, in spite of the Pentagon's \nassurances, the military has not yet met the troops' armor and \nequipment needs so the legislation I am offering today will allow \nreimbursement for equipment purchases made at any time in support of \noperations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom, not just the period \nbetween September 11, 2001, and June 31, 2004, as originally \nrecommended by the Department of Defense.\n  Words cannot adequately express this Senator's frustration that in \nthe year 2005, the most powerful nation on Earth cannot even see to it \nthat its military personnel have the safety equipment they need while \ndeployed in harm's way. I believe we owe it to our troops to do the \nright thing and to pass this measure. This legislation has already \nreceived the endorsement of several national military organizations, \nincluding the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, National Guard Association of the United \nStates, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard.\n  I particularly thank Retired Brigadier General Green for his strong \nendorsement of this bill, along with Retired Master Sergeant Kline of \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard for their strong \nendorsement. They appeared with me a few days ago at a press conference \nin which I announced I was going to offer this amendment and gave very \nstrong statements in support of this effort.\n  Again, I do not want to take up a lot of time. We have already \nadopted this amendment a year ago, virtually the same amendment. I \nregret I am back again more than a year later urging similar action. \nBut, again, I point out it has taken far too long for some response to \nthis. Again, if the problem were over with, if it were not ongoing, I \nwould not offer the amendment. I would be disappointed the \nadministration or Pentagon did not comply with last year's law but, as \nI testified, we have problems every single day in this area. The \nPentagon needs to get to business on this.\n\n  Today they have all of a sudden come up with a proposed set of \nregulations, but I point out no gun scopes, no humvee protection, no \nGPS receivers, no radios. These and other items that are being \npurchased by our troops are included on our list. It is a step in the \nright direction but occurring on the very day I am offering the \namendment\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nis not mere coincidence, in my view. I thank them for their action \ntoday, but we need to do more.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. I hope my colleagues will make \nthis a unanimous vote here to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a procedural matter?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Just to correct an error to the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 1895, 1996, 2017\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have sent modifications to the desk on \namendments 1895 for Senator Bingaman, 1996 for Senator Mikulski, and \n2017 for Senator Bennett. I didn't know the amendments had already been \nsent to the desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent these amendments, as submitted, be agreed \nupon and not the modifications I sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1895) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of September 29, 2005.)\n  The amendment (No. 1996) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of October 4, 2005.)\n  The amendment (No. 2017) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of October 4, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1970\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend our distinguished colleague from Connecticut. I \nwould say, knowing him through these many years and enjoying a warm and \ncordial friendship, his indignation was in full control and modest in \ncomparison to other periods, but he is absolutely right. Were I in his \nposition, I would be indignant about the fact that you have tried \nassiduously to urge the Department to follow the law which I was \nprivileged to work with you in putting into effect last year. That law \nwas Section 351 of the Defense bill last year. It set forth, as the \nSenator has in this bill, much the same relief for the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces who, on their own initiative, have gone out and \nexpended, and indeed their families have contributed, sums of money.\n  I am very much in favor of this. I hope the managers of the bill will \nsee fit to accept it. But I do urge upon the managers and my colleague \nfrom Connecticut that consideration be given to a clause which was in \nthe law last year. I will read it:\n\n       The protective safety or health equipment was purchased by \n     the member during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, \n     and ending on July 31, 2004.\n\n  That enables some period of time within which we have an \nunderstanding of what was involved in the expenditures. We, in the \nlegislative body, call that a sunset provision. It is not found in the \npending amendment.\n  Having had modest service myself, as a sailor and so forth, \ninconsequential though that be, I know a little bit about the life of a \nservice person. The modern GI, this generation, I guess as great as any \ngeneration we have ever witnessed in the history of the country--\nbelieve me, leave it to them and they can figure out a lot of things \nthat presumably are better than provided by the military.\n  The Senator pretty well restricted himself to those essential things \nwith which I agree. But if we leave this open, we enable these young \nmen and women, proudly wearing the uniform today, to buy a whole lot of \nthings. Next thing you know we are going to have an open door for a lot \nof things to be purchased.\n  A wrong, in my judgment, was done in the early procurement system of \nthis equipment, failure to have it, failure to deliver it in a timely \nway to some of our troops, and you have made that clear today, as have \nother Senators on the floor. But I say, I do believe consideration \nshould be given to some terminal date--maybe through 2006--in which to \ngive the military the chance to make certain that everything that can \nprotect the life is there, and there is no requirement for these young \npeople to go out and purchase it on their own.\n\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, for his support. You were tremendously helpful. At a time \nwhen the Pentagon was resistant, the chairman of the committee and \nothers stood up and said we should do this--regrettably, we should be \ndoing this.\n  We have done two things a little differently in this amendment. The \nchairman pointed it out. One, we removed the decision from the Pentagon \nto the field commander to make a decision on what is reimbursable or \nnot, on the theory, as a squadron leader or platoon leader, field \ncommander, they are in a better position to decide whether or not an \nitem a soldier may purchase should be reimbursable, rather than someone \nat the Pentagon who would not have a firsthand knowledge of the kind of \nequipment.\n  Second, we limit the amount that can be collected. This is not an \nunlimited amount. Some of these items would be in excess of the \nlimitations we put in the amendment. That is what we had last year.\n  Third, I am willing to consider some outlying date. The reason we \nlimited it last year was because of the assurances we had been given \nthat, in fact, the problem no longer existed. In fact, it still exists. \nI am prepared to accept an appropriate time, 2006 or something.\n  I hope we do not have to come back to this amendment, but the idea of \nhaving some outside date as a parameter, I am willing to accept that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could regain the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the adoption of the amendment in hopes that the \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut, with two extraordinary \nveterans of military life, can sit down and work this out in a mutually \nsatisfactory manner.\n  Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, we have been \nrecognized, the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan, to \nconduct a colloquy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we would like to dispose of this \namendment if it is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. We yield for the parliamentary desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am constrained to say that even back in World War II \nwe bought some of our own stuff and thought the Government should pay \nfor it. No one did. The question is, How much should we be able to \nspend? We will work it out. I urge the Senator to allow us to adopt \nthis now by voice vote so it will not be involved in the cloture \nprocess tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1970) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1955\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my \ndistinguished colleague, the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  During the course of yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee on appropriations, Mr. Stevens, and myself participated in \na parliamentary situation, whereby the Senator from Virginia sent an \namendment to the desk. It was actually filed. I asked it be called up \nand it was.\n  At that time, there was an objection interposed by the Senator from \nAlaska, referring to the Congressional Record of today, at page S10967.\n  We went through the parliamentary situation, whereby I desired to \nhave the amendment considered. The Senator from Alaska objected. \nWhereupon, I raised the question of germaneness to the amendment, and \nit was referred to the Parliamentarian.\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\n  I would like to read exactly what the Parliamentarian stated on this \noccasion. I stated: ``the Parliamentarians have advised,'' and I stress \nthat word ``advised''--``the Parliamentarians have advised'' that in \nthe Parliamentarians' opinion ``there is sufficient language in the \nHouse bill to permit Senator Warner to assert the defense of \ngermaneness with respect to his amendment numbered 1955.''\n  I ask, at this moment in time, a parliamentary inquiry. Has the \nSenator from Virginia correctly stated what was put forth to the Senate \nthrough the Chair? And, if so, what is the nature of the vote that is \nnow before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has adequately stated the \nstatement that was made with respect to that issue.\n  The Senate will vote whether or not the amendment is germane under \nthe provisions of rule XVI.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would that be as requested by the Senator from Alaska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank the \nParliamentarian.\n  I took this action, frankly, on behalf of the men and women in the \nArmed Forces. Our Nation is engaged in war--a war on terror with two \nvery major engagements, one in Afghanistan and the other of larger \nproportions in Iraq.\n  We have men and women in far-flung posts all over the world, men and \nwomen on the high seas, men and women back here training, and the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and their families look to the Congress \nof the United States to provide for their needs. That is clearly set \nforth as our responsibility in the Constitution.\n  The Committee on the Armed Services was established by this body for \nthe purpose of examining the President's budget, examining a wide realm \nof other issues that come before us, and preparing each year a bill \nknown as the authorization bill for a certain year--in this case it is \n2006. Our committee did that and unanimously reported out favorably to \nthe floor that bill. That bill was taken up by this body and debated \nfor a series of days. Some 30 amendments by colleagues were accepted. \nThey are part of the amendment that is now pending and is the subject \nof this vote this evening.\n  There came a time when it was the judgment of the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader that this bill would be taken down to give a \nhigher priority to appropriations bills. That is a leadership decision. \nThereafter, Senator Levin and I worked with our leadership in an effort \nto get our bill back at a specific place on the calendar so that it \ncould be considered by the Senate. It had been our hope that that \nopportunity would have been given to us prior to the appropriations \nbill. All of us who have been privileged to work on these bills through \nthe years--this is the 27th year in which I have been privileged to \nwork. The same number of years of my colleague--recognize the value of \nthe authorization bill being passed prior to the enactment of the \nappropriations bill.\n  Given that situation, realities are such that we were not able to get \nit up. We are now faced with the need to exercise every option under \nthe rules to get our bill considered. Although it is an extraordinary \nprocedure and it has only been done once in 1988, I think we at this \njuncture, given the indefinite time in which our bill could be taken \nup, and the short period in which, presumably, the Congress is going to \nremain in session, have to seize this opportunity at this time to have \nour bill considered in conjunction with the appropriations bill.\n  For that purpose, I filed the amendment, amended it to take out \nsection B which relates to the Department of Energy, and section C \nwhich relates to MILCON, leaving section A which is those provisions \nwhich dovetail and support many provisions of this appropriations bill \nwhich is pending here today.\n  I have heard the distinguished managers of the appropriations bill \ntime and time again in previous years, as in this year, explain the \ndesirability of having the authorization bill acted upon prior to the \nappropriations bill.\n  I readily acknowledge to the managers of the appropriations bill the \nessential requirement to get passed as quickly as possible--hopefully, \nbefore this recess--the requirements for the ongoing financial needs of \nthe Department of Defense. They are critical.\n  I have not put this on to that bill as a dilatory measure. And to \nexpedite consideration of the authorization bill, I carefully selected \na series of amendments, originally numbered 110 amendments, and filed \nthem at the desk in two managers' amendments, the purpose of which was \nto say to our colleagues they are your amendments. Senator Levin and I \nhave reconciled such differences as existed such that we both now \nagree--the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia--that \nthey are ready for enactment on our bill through the vehicle \ntraditionally used of a managers' amendment requiring just one single \nvote, if necessary. We can perhaps incorporate them into the underlying \nbill--but one vote on these packages.\n  Given the changes in circumstances of germaneness, it was necessary \nfor the Senator from Virginia to prepare a third amendment, which I \nwill now file with the clerk. It is permissible under the unanimous \nconsent, and I send to the desk about 100 amendments, which, in the \njudgment of myself and others, are germane to the bill. Therefore, I \nsend that to the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \nsure that is in order. I would like to reserve the right to object to \nthis when the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point in time, parliamentary \ninquiry: Does not the standing unanimous consent allow a Senator to \nfile an amendment in the second degree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments in the second degree may be \nfiled. They are not subject to----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: I thought we had an understanding \nthat there would be no amendments filed after a specific time. This is \na second-degree amendment. We did not permit second-degree amendments \nat that time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have to say in fairness that I have \nchecked with the Parliamentarian each step of my procedure yesterday \nand today. I have checked, and it was the interpretation given to me, \nas frequently given to Members of this body by the Parliamentarians, \nthat the unanimous consent did not prohibit, as the Chair just \nannounced, the filing of second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was not my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that the transcript will be \nreviewed, and the Chair also advises that he is not aware of a \nprohibition of filing second-degree amendments at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Chair repeat that a little louder, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Virginia \nthat the transcript will be reviewed, and the Chair, as of this moment, \nprior to reviewing that, is unaware of the prohibition on second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Against the filing of second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. That is precisely what I asked the Presiding Officer \nto accept, and I think your ruling is consistent with the request of \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n\n  We can proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In terms of the content of the package----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Without losing his right to the floor, I want to see if I \ncan clarify what I understand to be in the package which was sent to \nthe desk. My understanding is on the underlying amendment which the \nSenator filed and which I cosponsored that the sections of our Defense \nauthorization bill relating to energy and to military construction have \nbeen removed.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that the purpose of this package is to remove any \namendments relating to those two subjects from the managers' package.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. I would add that it was for the\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\npurpose, at a subsequent time if the Senate enables this amendment of \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan jointly put up, \nwhich is our annual authorization bill, that we would then ask this \namendment be brought up of 101 amendments by our colleagues and be \nattached to our authorization bill by having one vote, if necessary, on \none amendment, which encompasses by management procedure 100 amendments \nby our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is still recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is still a unanimous consent request before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I have not made one, I say to the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request before \nthe Senate. The Senator from Alaska is reserving the right to object, \nand that unanimous consent is asked for. Is there objection to the \nunanimous consent by the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still reserve the right to object because I don't \nunderstand what the Senator is doing. The Senator filed a portion of \nthe Defense authorization bill as an amendment. He then filed a \nseparate package of amendments--some 80 amendments--to that amendment. \nNow he has filed another set of amendments--as amendments to what?\n  In any event, we thought we had an understanding that there would be \nno second-degree amendments filed under this procedure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may try----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would prefer the Chair rule.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the distinguished Senator from Alaska that the \nChair has ruled that the----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Then I object. I just object.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could clarify what I am trying to do----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Chair understand that I object to the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's understanding is that the Senator \nfrom Virginia has the right to file amendments for printing and that \nthey be called up.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He is not proposing those amendments at this \ntime. Therefore, it does not require unanimous consent to have that \ndone.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What the procedure is doing is making sure that an \namendment is offered by every Senator in the place. The two Senators \nwho are not managers of the present bill are offering their package as \nmanagers of their bill in order to get support of the Senate to attach \nthis amendment in the first place. It is a procedure I have not seen in \nmy 38 years here in the Senate, and I object to their procedure. But I \nmay not be able to be heard on it. I believe this is a very odd \nprocedure. Now the two Senators are saying they are the managers of the \nbill and they are going to accept 108 amendments to our bill. We \nhaven't even read them. We don't know what they are. We don't know how \nmany more amendments will likely come to these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for an inquiry \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could inquire----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has a perfect right \nto submit amendments to be printed. They have not been called up. \nTherefore, they are not in order at this time to be offered, but they \nmay be submitted for printing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is the request of the Senator from \nVirginia. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for a question without losing \nhis right to the floor, my understanding of the amendments which have \njust been printed is those are amendments to the Senator's amendment, \nnot to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is my understanding correct that the amendment which was \njust sent to the desk to be printed are amendments to Senator Warner's \namendment, not amendments to the bill itself?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. In the event the Senate \nconcurs in the position of both of us with regard to the forthcoming \nvote and the Senate agrees as to germaneness, it is my intention to \ncall up my amendment, which is the 2006 armed services bill, and at \nthat time to put on it a managers' amendment--jointly, the two of us--\nwhich is the third pending amendment at the desk. We will discard the \nother two amendments because this third amendment has been carefully \ndrawn to have those amendments, as the Senator from Michigan said, \nthose amendments relative to part A, which constitutes the amendment at \nthe desk at this time. It will be the subject of a vote, and not parts \nB and C.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: Are not these amendments that the \nSenator struck from the amendment as he offered it--there is a section \nB and C now of the authorization bill, which was struck from the \namendment? That was the understanding. They would not be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no knowledge of the substance of \nthe amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  This third amendment I have filed is simply a consolidation drawing \nfrom the first amendment of 80-some amendments, and the second, I \nthink, was 18 to 20. Only those amendments in this third filing are \nones relative to part A. All amendments relative in the earlier \npackages--the first and the second I filed--basically were part A, but \nthere were some relevant to parts B and C, so I removed those. Because \nif there is a challenge at the time I bring it up--assuming the Senate \nin its vote sustains the judgment of the Senator from Virginia and \nothers that there is germaneness in our underlying amendment--then I \nseek to amend that with this third package which constitutes only \namendments related to part A, such as if there is another challenge on \ngermaneness I will not be burdened down by sections B and C.\n  In no way does this third filing in any way try to restore parts B or \nC. To the contrary, it takes out all amendments which are related to B \nand C, so hopefully if I have a further challenge on germaneness, it \ncan be sustained, that they are germane.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To try to clarify this, what the Senator from Virginia \ncalls part 3 is a skinned-down version of 1 and 2, eliminating from 1 \nand 2 those provisions which might violate the understanding which \nexisted that there would not be any provisions in this package that \nrelated to the energy piece and to the MILCON piece. The effort being \nmade by the Senator from Virginia, as I understand it, is not to add \nsomething into this part in violation of an understanding, but is to \nmake sure that parts 1 and 2--that this modification complies with the \nunderstanding that the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nVirginia had; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the statement is correct.\n  I would not use the word ``understanding.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize for that statement.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is exercising his rights in a very courteous \nway throughout.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But in terms of the representation of what was in the \npackage, it did not contain in packages 1 and 2 anything relative to \nthe Energy and MILCON bills. The effort of this printed package is to \nmake sure the proposed amendments to your amendment comply with your \nrepresentation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. The third filing consists \nof amendments only relative to part A in the hopes--if we have another \nchallenge at the time we try to amend it. So now the Senate is faced \nwith a tough call on this vote. I fully appreciate for my colleagues \nthe difficulty of trying to evaluate how Members should vote.\n  In all fairness, this Nation is at war. The men and women of the \nArmed Forces are watching ever so carefully what the Congress is doing. \nI am fearful if we do not avail ourselves of this opportunity to put \nour bill on--which has been done once before--and hopefully add those \namendments which are very important to many Senators, that\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\nthis could be misconstrued not only at home, not only abroad by the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, but indeed there could be some \npuzzlement throughout the world as to where is the Congress in \nsupporting the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  This is a critical time. We must do it. I say to my good friend, it \nis not an effort in any way to undermine the Senator's efforts to get \nthis appropriations bill through. By the incorporation of these 100 \namendments, together with the 30-some amendments which have already \nbeen adopted by the Senate the previous time we had this bill on the \nfloor, there will not be forthcoming a massive number of amendments \nwhich in the end could result in a further drawing out of the time \nneeded to have this body exercise its judgment on the appropriations \nbill.\n  I plead with my colleagues to have an understanding of the imperative \nnature to act upon this bill promptly. It underlies much of what the \nSenator is trying to do in the appropriations bill. It is needed \nauthorization language.\n  I see my colleague who has joined me in this, if the Senator wishes \nto go ahead. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thought the unanimous consent request would be a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is what we have, a colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How long will the colloquy go on? It has been going on \n30 minutes--20 minutes, anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time has been offered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I assure the Senator from Alaska I will be brief. I simply \njoin in the plea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join the Senator from Virginia in making a plea to our \nappropriators here, the managers on the bill, to understand the \nsituation in which we find ourselves. That is, we had a bill in the \nSenate which the Republican leader decided for reasons which were very \nclear at the time that the bill would be pulled down. It was left in \nlimbo. And the request is whether we will now have an opportunity to \nvote on a bill which does so much for the men and women in the \nmilitary. We cannot think of any other way we can bring up the \nauthorization except by offering it as an amendment to the \nappropriations bill, which is pending.\n  It has met the threshold of germaneness, we are assured. The Senate \nwill decide whether it is germane. But the Parliamentarian has advised \nthe Senator from Virginia that it meets the threshold.\n  So now with the provisions in this bill--the pay provisions, the \nspecial pay provisions, the bonuses, the death gratuity enhancement, \nthe increased life insurance, the health care provisions, the TRICARE \nprovisions--we could go on and on--there are critically important \nprovisions in this bill to the men and women in the military.\n  We have men and women in the military with their lives at risk in \nIraq and Afghanistan and now we have an additional responsibility in \nthe gulf. We have so much at stake. Usually appropriators and the \nauthorizers have been able to work together. I hope that will continue \nnow. Somehow or other I hope we will be able to figure out a way----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can finish the sentence.\n  I hope we can find a way consistent with the wonderful relationship \nwhich has existed between appropriators and authorizers in the defense \narea, that we can find a way to get this authorization bill before the \nSenate. We have tried to get it freestanding, without success. This is \nan opportunity to bring this bill to the Senate.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, we have over 100 items which have \nbeen cleared. That is not done for any sinister reason. That is done \nfor a very simple way to expedite this bill so that the appropriators \nare not confronted with 100 amendments. The appropriators should not be \nconfronted with an authorization bill where there are 150 amendments \npending.\n  The Senator from Virginia and this Senator have tried very hard to \naccommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle so we could help the \nappropriators, so we could represent to the appropriators that we would \nnot be confronted with 100 or 150 amendments, but that a managers' \npackage would be able to resolve most of those amendments. That has \nbeen done. It has been done in good faith.\n  I hope that somehow or other the managers of this bill can find a way \nto help us bring this bill to the floor. There will not be more than \nperhaps a dozen amendments that would be offered to this bill, we \nthink, because we believe we can work out most of the other amendments. \nThat is my plea to the appropriators and to our good friends, the \nSenators from Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan maintains the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  We have worked these many years together and we have tried to work in \nthe spirit of what is best, as our managers of the appropriations bill, \nfor the men and women of the Armed Forces. I plead, give not just the \nmanagers a chance, but give the Senate, I say to our managers, the \nchance to show that they are not going to come up here with a whole lot \nof amendments to drag this appropriations bill down, trying to attach \nthose amendments to our amendments.\n  We have worked hard for weeks to compile this list of 100 amendments. \nWe do not know of any others out there--there are some, but not massive \nnumbers--that are going to come in and literally capsize this \nappropriations bill. Give it a chance. After a day or so here, if the \nleadership finds factually that the Senate is taking steps, and is \nwithin their right to try and put second degrees on, and that is an \nimpediment to finishing the bill by Friday, I am sure we can sit down \nwith the two leaders and work out a solution.\n  I simply say, give us not just a chance but give the Senate as a body \na chance to show responsibility to enact the annual authorization bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Mr. President, I endorse strongly the McCain amendment. I have been a \ncosponsor from the beginning. I have looked into this situation. At one \ntime when I was privileged to be Secretary of the Navy when the war in \nVietnam came to an end, I dealt extensively with the prisoner issue and \ntheir families in that tragic era of our history. I have had some \ninsight into this situation which enables me to give the strongest \npossible endorsement to this amendment by the Senator from Arizona, a \nvery respected member of this Senate and a man with an extraordinary \nrecord in the armed services of the United States.\n  The McCain amendment provides us with the opportunity to better \nensure our Nation's military does not repeat the errors, faults and \nmisdeeds we have seen occur at military detention facilities overseas \nas we fight this war on global terrorism.\n  As General Abizaid told us last week this will be a long war against \nterrorists and our Armed Forces must have clear and understandable \nstandards.\n  The McCain amendment has two parts of equal vital importance, both \ncritical. The first establishes clear rules for the conduct of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines involved in interrogation \noperations. It does not add new approaches or techniques, it merely \ntakes Army doctrine which is our clearest guidance on conduct of \ninterrogations and makes it our military standard as set forth in the \nArmy Manual.\n  Clearly the Constitution gives Congress a role to play in the \ncreation of rules pertaining to the treatment of detainees. Article 1, \nsection 8 provides that the Congress shall have power to make rules \nconcerning captures on land and water, and also to make rules for the \ngovernment and regulation of the land and naval forces. Rules for \ntreatment and interrogation of detainees clearly falls within this \nauthority given to Congress by the Constitution.\n  The second part of the McCain amendment speaks to American values. It \ntells our soldiers, sailors, airman, and marines, our allies, and the \nrest of the world that the cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or \npunishment are not part of the American character.\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nOur standards against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or \npunishment are deeply rooted in our Bill of Rights. Ultimately it is \nour uniquely American character that must be embedded in our American \nway or war.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent I be listed as a cosponsor of the \nMcCain amendment relative to the treatment of detainees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment on \ninterrogation standards because it protects our troops. Major General \nFay, in his investigation into the role of military intelligence in the \nprisoner abuses at Abu Ghraib, found that DoD's development of multiple \npolicies on interrogation operations for use in different theaters or \noperations confused Army and civilian interrogators at Abu Ghraib.'' \nThis confusion over what standards applied contributed to the horrific \nabuses of detainees. This confusion has put our troops at risk of being \nsubjected to abusive treatment should they ever be captured.\n  Senator McCain's amendment would protect our troops by establishing a \nsingle, uniform standard for interrogations. This is consistent with \nthe recommendations of Major General Fay. Senator McCain's amendment \nalso requires that detainees in U.S. custody shall not be subjected to \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment. This is \nconsistent with the high standards to which our military is trained, \nwith how we expect our soldiers to be treated if they fall into enemy \ncustody, with our international obligations, and with our cherished \nvalues as Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could make certain I still remain a cosponsor of the \nMcCain amendment that is now the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the majority leader laid out a plan for \nthe consideration of the Defense authorization bill. It was before the \nSenate for 4 days or a little bit longer. There were over 200 \namendments offered to that bill and it was brought down.\n  The Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Committee on Armed \nServices, came to me and asked if I would object if they put their bill \non this bill with a time agreement, with specific amendments with time \nlimits on each amendment. Senator Inouye and I discussed that and we \nsaid we would have no objection.\n  We were then informed that was not possible. The Senator from \nVirginia said he would like to offer his amendment to this amendment \nfor the purpose of putting pressure on the majority leader to make an \narrangement to call up this bill.\n  I urged him not to do that, as a matter of fact. We met off the floor \nand he said he was going to do it. He indicated he was going to delete \na portion of that bill as he offered it. He did not inform me that the \nreason for that deletion was because the Parliamentarian had advised \nhim that the bill would be subject to a point of order on the basis of \ngermaneness if he did it. So he eliminated the two provisions of the \nbill that might be subject to germaneness. The Parliamentarian has now \nadvised that the Senator from Virginia has a right to raise the defense \nof germaneness and the Senate will vote on that at 7:30.\n  Beyond that, the concept now of bringing in 108 amendments to the \nbill when there are still amendments outside--I ask unanimous consent \nthat we adopt the amendments offered by the Senator from Virginia and \nthat no further amendments from the authorization bill be permitted to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That proves it. The Senators do not know how many of the \nother 200 amendments are going to come out here on this bill. I have \nstated time and time again this bill must be passed and sent to \nconference before we leave this week. We will not leave this week until \nwe finish this bill. I have told the Senate time and time again the \nemergency supplemental is attached to this bill for Iraq and the war on \nterror and Afghanistan. Those items must be approved by the President \nno later than November 15.\n  We had a supplemental for the past fiscal year, 2005. This is the \nsupplemental for 2006, and 2006 started October 1. We have a continuing \nresolution we are operating on for the basic operations of the Defense \nDepartment, but there is no continuing operation for the supplemental \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on terror.\n  This must be passed. The Committee on Armed Services knows this. The \nSenator from Virginia, I must correct. Never before in history has a \nbill been offered to the appropriations bill and been subject to \namendment.\n  We have taken the authorization bill twice during my time on the \nAppropriations Committee in full, already agreed to by the committee, \nand taken it to conference. We have never accepted a portion of a \nDefense authorization bill and left it open to amendment. Why? The \nSenate can see right now why. The managers have not reached an \nagreement on their bill. The committee has not reached an agreement on \ntheir bill.\n  The bill is subject to amendment, and there are over 200 amendments \nat the desk now that were filed against the armed services bill. They \nhave picked out 108 of them, and they have approved them. They never \nconsulted with us on what they did, but they have approved them and \noffered them now as an amendment. As they offer the amendment, there \nare other amendments that come in now because of the circumstance of \nhow many they have picked out and the ones they have not picked out.\n  Does the Senator believe Senators who offered other amendments that \nyou will not accept will not come here and ask us to accept them? No. \nThey know that. And Senator Levin said there may be some out there, 10 \nor 12. Well, how long are 10 or 12 amendments going to take when you \nare on the authorization bill and we are not handling that bill; they \nare.\n  I think the Senate has to realize the procedure we are in now. If we \nstart down this road, then every time there is a Defense appropriations \nbill someone who has not gotten a bill passed in terms of another 1 of \nthe 12 subcommittees--there are 13 on appropriations--is going to come \nin and say: We want to put our bill on your bill, but, by the way, it \nwill be subject to amendment. You can call up your bill. We can't call \nup our bill because it is not ready to be called up.\n  Now, an armed services bill, when it comes here, is a great bill. It \ntakes a long time. We know how long it takes. Our bill usually takes--\none year it took 3 hours. Most years it takes less than a day. Why? \nBecause we are a bipartisan subcommittee. When this bill came out of \nthe subcommittee, it came out unanimously. Not one Senator voted \nagainst it. When it came out of the full committee, it was unanimous. \nNot one Senator voted against it.\n  The two of us have run a bipartisan team now since 1981. This is the \nfirst year that this has been done. I hope the Senate says: We do not \nwant to do it this way because this is opening the door to an entirely \nnew process of using a bill that must be passed as a vehicle to take on \na bill that cannot be passed. If they could pass their bill, they would \nhave done it. They would have proved to the majority leader they had \namendments, and they could have agreed to them.\n  That is not our problem. That should not be the appropriators' \nproblem. We have a timeframe. We have 13 bills. We are supposed to get \nthem all done once each year. We have had years when we did not even \nhave an authorization bill, and we survived it. We have had many years \nwhere they passed their bill months after we passed the Defense \nappropriations bill, and we survived it.\n  But this year--this year--because we are at war, this is absolutely \nwrong, absolutely wrong. I hope the Senate listens to me. We have to \npass this bill before we leave to go home for this recess for these \nholidays next week. If we do not, we do not have the ability, once we \nget back, to pass it and then get to conference and then get it to the \nPresident in time for the money to be available to use to support our \npeople in the field.\n  Now, people say: Well, wait a minute, you can reprogram money. We are \nin a period of a continuing resolution.\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nThere is no money that can be reprogrammed. You cannot reprogram money \nnow. We do not have 2006 money to reprogram. There is no emergency \nmoney to reprogram. The emergency money is in part of this bill that \nhas to be passed.\n  Now, I am getting a little mad. I do not mean to be too mad, but I \nmean to be very angry and disturbed at the process. The Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan know better than to do this. You \nknow better than to do this. It is time for us to realize we have \nsoldiers and sailors, marines, the Coast Guard in the field now. The \nmoney to support them is running out. The reason it has not run out is \nbecause we did reprogram some money before September 30 we had \navailable then. There is no more money to reprogram to take care of \nthis war.\n  Now, I do not know how I can express it any more bluntly than that. I \nhope the Senate will listen to us and vote against this concept that \nthis bill is germane to this bill to start with. It is not germane. It \nis a whole authorization bill minus the MILCON and energy portions. But \nit is still the whole authorization bill, which is subject to \namendment. As I said, there are over 100 amendments out there that \nMembers have filed already against this bill.\n  Now, I will be pleased to take this, if there are no more amendments. \nThat was the understanding to start with: We would take their bill if \nthey had a time agreement, a time to vote for certain on it. I think we \nhave gone too far.\n  My friend from Hawaii--I do the shouting; he does the thinking--may \nwant to say something more. But I tell you, I am really basically \ndeeply concerned about the future of our men and women in uniform if we \ntreat their money portion of this process this way. This is the \nauthorization process. This is policy. We went into that on another \namendment today. I don't know much about all the precedents in terms of \nthe Geneva Conventions and what is in the Army Field Manual. Those \namendments--I respect the Senator from Arizona. The Armed Services \nCommittee people do. We know what is in here for money.\n  The Senator's bill does not pertain to money. It does have some \nauthorizations, but that is all right. They can be passed later after \nwe pass our bill. No one is going to be harmed. But there is going to \nbe a great deal of harm if we do not get this bill passed and sent to \nconference and get it to the President soon after we get back from this \nrecess.\n  Now, I do not know how we can do anything more than just say, once \nagain, the Senator from Virginia has embarked on a course that has \nnever been done before. He said it had been done before. It has never \nbeen done. Never before has a part of an authorization bill been \nintroduced to this bill, or any other bill for that matter, that was \nsubject to amendment. We do not operate that way. I can remember taking \na bill that stood off the floor that far because it had so many \nauthorization bills in it that could not get through, but we took them \nbecause they were ready, complete. They were complete. They were ready \nto go, and they took them in an omnibus bill.\n\n  But this is not an omnibus bill. This is one bill. This is a bill for \nthe appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n2006, plus the emergency supplemental funding for the war in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the war on terror. Under those circumstances, I am \nappalled that the two Senators would proceed this way. And I tell the \nSenator from Virginia, our friendship is very close to the brink--very \nclose to the brink--because I believe my job is to get this bill \npassed, and get it passed as a bill we know we can go to conference on, \nand get it done and be ready when we get back.\n  If we were to take this portion of this bill, the Defense bill, to \nconference, we could not finish the conference until they were \nfinished. And that is definitely not proper.\n  I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, much as I would prefer to have amity and \ncomity on this floor and be able to accommodate the concerns of my dear \nfriend from Virginia, I must say that I fully agree with my chairman, \nMr. Stevens of Alaska. This procedure will set a terrible precedent, \none that we will regret in the years to come.\n  If you look at it very carefully, it will take away some of the \nrights of people with minority views. So I would hope that another step \nbe taken--I do not know what it is--where we can resolve this matter. I \nwould hope the leadership of the Senate realizes the seriousness of \nwhat we are confronting at this moment. It affects the future of this \nland, and I am not being dramatic.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my two very dear and old friends, \nI tender any apologies, but I have acted strictly in accordance with \nthe rules, exercising the right that any Senator has. I feel it is \nimperative because we are a nation at war. We have diligently tried to \nget up our bill, and this is an option I felt under the rules was open \nto me, and I have followed it.\n  There was a time, as Senator Stevens did correctly state--and he was \ncorrect in his statements--that we had hoped there would be an \nagreement between the two sides on what few remaining amendments to our \nbill, over and above the 100-plus that are in the amendment up here, \ncould be acted upon expeditiously. I still feel there are but a few \namendments out there and that we can--Senator Levin and I--resolve \nthem.\n  I know parts B and C are essential to be enacted into law before this \nsession concludes. I would assume at some point in time the leadership \nwill enable us to bring up sections B and C, at which time such other \namendments as colleagues may have can be brought forth and resolved at \nthat point in time.\n  But I think it is imperative to act now on the core section of the \narmed services bill. I would hope our colleagues would see that we are \ngiving the whole Senate a chance--not just the managers of the bill but \nthe whole Senate a chance--to show the men and women of the Armed \nForces, the people of this Nation, that we can, in these times of \nemergency, act in a bipartisan way to reconcile a problem such as this, \nand that if our amendment remains, after the vote at 7:30, and is \nbrought up, that there will not be forthcoming a deluge of amendments \nwhich, in effect, would impair the ability of these two managers to get \nthis essential piece of legislation acted upon prior to the \ncommencement of the recess, and that there will be a future time with \nparts B and C, when they will be able to bring forth such additional \namendments as they believe are necessary to be enacted in the 2006 \narmed services bill; that is, sections B and C would be the tree on \nwhich those amendments could be affixed.\n  So I say to my good friend, I have acted as I feel duty calls. You \nhave stated very clearly the facts. And now I entrust the Senate to \nmake the decision that is right for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my last word on this, before we come on \nthe 6 minutes before the vote at 7:30, will be this: There are two \npackages of amendments before the desk. Under any normal procedure, \nSenator Inouye and I would review those amendments. We have not seen \nthem. We have not even gotten a copy of them. Normally we would have \nhad a copy of them, at least. But we do not know how many of those are \nin conflict with our own bill.\n  The two Senators have acted as managers of a part of our bill because \nthey offered their bill as an amendment. What procedure is this? How \ncan we assure the Senate what is in this bill? How can we even be \nprepared to go to conference on this bill when we do not know what is \nin those two packages? There are three portions here. We know what is \nin the part A, which was part of the authorization bill, but these \namendments, we don't know what they are. We may have already accepted \nsome of them. I do not know.\n  But I think it is really a strange procedure that anyone would \nsuggest, by offering an amendment, that control over the bill go to \nmembers from other committees and, in doing so, they clear amendments \nthat we will have to defend in conference, theoretically, as Members of \nthe Senate, but we do not know what is in them. No one knows what is in \nthem. Normally, a package like that, if they had their bill out\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nhere, the Defense authorization bill, they would have a bill in front \nof us, wouldn't they? As a matter of fact, I think the rules require \nit. But now there are amendments offered at the desk, and I do not \nthink they have given anyone a copy of the amendments.\n  I think this procedure violates the rules of the Senate. I am not \ngoing to get into the problem of that yet because we are going to vote \non germaneness. Germaneness does not eliminate the points of order we \nmay have against those amendments later. But as a practical matter, \nthis is a really odd procedure, and one that is bound to, as the \nSenator from Hawaii said, lead to processes in the future that will be \ntotally unmanageable.\n  I urge the Senate to think about this as we approach the vote at 7:30 \np.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: Did not the Senator from Virginia \non Monday file an amendment in the nature of a managers' amendment with \n60 amendments and they have been at the desk since that period of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be a matter of public record. The \nChair does not keep a record.\n  Mr. WARNER. A matter of public record. Then yesterday I filed a \nsecond amendment with about 18 in the nature of a managers' amendment, \nand they were in the public record.\n  I say to my good friends, the amendment I filed today, the third one, \nis nothing more than taking from each package only those amendments \nwhich have been at the desk, filed, and consolidating them in a third \npackage.\n  I say to my friend, I am in no way trying to be devious at all. Those \namendments have been a matter of public record Monday, Tuesday, and \ntoday's amendment simply is a consolidation of all of those that have \nbeen at the desk in that period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Rhode Island is \nwaiting, and I will be very brief. First, it is not a happy day for \nthis body when we are in this kind of imbroglio where we are unable to \naccept as an amendment on an appropriations bill the authorization for \nthe men and women who are fighting in our Nation's defense around the \nworld. It seems to me the least we can do, however this is sorted out, \nis to have the distinguished leaders--Senators Stevens, Inouye, Levin, \nand Warner--sit down and see if there is a way to work this out. It may \nrequire the participation of the respective leaders. But we should not \nbe in a situation where the best option is to attach an entire \nauthorization bill as an amendment to an appropriations bill. It is a \nsad commentary on the way we do business.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I can ask the indulgence of my friend \nfrom Rhode Island for 1 minute, I would like to read a statement into \nthe Record.\n  It reads:\n\n                           GEN Colin L. Powell, USA (Retired),\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 5, 2005.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I have read your proposed amendment to \n     the Defense Appropriations Bill concerning the use of the \n     Army Field Manual as the definitive guidance for the conduct \n     of our troops with respect to detainees. I have also studied \n     your impressive statement introducing the amendment.\n       I fully support this amendment. Further, I align myself \n     with the letter written to you by General Shalikashivili and \n     a distinguished group of senior officers in support of the \n     amendment.\n       Our troops need to hear from the Congress, which has an \n     obligation to speak to such matters under Article I, Section \n     8 of the Constitution. I also believe the world will note \n     that America is making a clear statement with respect to the \n     expected future behavior of our soldiers. Such a reaction \n     will help deal with the terrible public diplomacy crisis \n     created by Abu Ghraib.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Colin Powell.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will pay very careful attention to our former \nSecretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I do not \nhave to tell any of my colleagues of his outstanding and superb record \nof service to this Nation and the depth of his knowledge as it pertains \nto this and many other national security issues.\n  I am very grateful he has come forward with this statement, and I \nhope my colleagues will pay attention to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to \ncommend my long-time friend, Senator McCain, for the initiative he has \ntaken. It has been a privilege for me and many others to join him in \nthis effort. I think what he stated here should be taken into \nconsideration by every Senator tonight as they cast his or her vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2033\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, rising energy prices could financially wipe \nout working-class families and seniors this winter. We are about to see \nan extraordinary runup in prices that imperil the ability of many \nfamilies simply to keep their homes warm during this coming winter.\n  In New England, the average cost for a family using heating oil is \nprojected to hit $1,666 during the upcoming winter. This represents an \nincrease of $403 over last winter's prices and $714 over the winter \nheating season of 2003-2004. That is an extraordinary increase in the \ncost families have to spend to heat their homes.\n  For a family using natural gas in the Midwest, prices are projected \nto hit $1,568, representing an increase of $611 over last year's prices \nand $643 over the price of the 2003-2004 heating season.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association, looking at this data, expects steep \nenergy costs could increase the number of missed payments and lost \nhomes this year. So we have observers who are fearful that this huge \nenergy shock could cause families to, indeed, lose their homes.\n  In America, no family should be forced to choose between heating \ntheir home or putting food on the table for their children. No senior \ncitizen should have to decide to either buy lifesaving pharmaceuticals \nor pay their electric bill. But, unfortunately, low-income working \nAmericans are facing these decisions this winter.\n  In some respects, this is a tidal wave, not of rising water but of \nrising energy prices which is a consequence of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  For this reason, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kerry, and I offered an \namendment to the Defense Department appropriations bill to provide $3.1 \nbillion in emergency funds for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, known as LIHEAP. This funding will provide our Nation's most \nvulnerable--low-income families, seniors, and disabled individuals--\nwith affordable energy this winter. Again, we saw and were shocked as a \nnation to see rising waters imperil the most vulnerable in our society \non the gulf coast. Well, these rising energy prices will do the same \nthing by threatening the most vulnerable people through the Northeast, \nthrough the Midwest, through every area of the country that anticipates \ncold weather this winter.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us to secure $3.1 billion in additional \nLIHEAP funding.\n  In September, I, along with over 20 of my colleagues, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, sent a letter to the President urging that \nhe include additional funding for LIHEAP in a supplemental \nappropriations bill for Hurricane Katrina. We sensed, as he sensed, \nthat one of the consequences of Katrina was a severe shock to our \nenergy sector with complementary increases in prices. So I believe it \nis appropriate to deal with this issue now. We are waiting not only for \nthe supplemental for Katrina, but also dealing with it on this \nparticular appropriations bill.\n  On Monday, I was dismayed to learn that President Bush currently does \nnot have plans to request additional LIHEAP funds this year. States are \nbracing for a crisis caused by a lack of affordable energy, and this \nfunding will ensure low-income families and seniors will have safe, \nwarm homes this winter.\n  President Bush, I strongly urge that you reconsider. The warning has \nbeen issued. Will you once again ignore a looming crisis facing \nAmerica?\n  In addition to LIHEAP funding, there are other steps that Congress \nand the administration need to take to address our Nation's high energy \ncosts. First, we need to pass Senator Cantwell's Energy Emergency \nConsumer Protection Act to ban price gouging at the\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\ngas pump in the wake of natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  Second, we need to pass Senator Dorgan's Windfall Profits Rebate Act \nwhich imposes a temporary windfall profits tax on big oil companies and \nuses the revenues to provide a rebate to American consumers to help \noffset the higher cost of oil and gasoline products.\n  Total energy spending for the Nation this year will approach $1 \ntrillion, 24 percent higher than in 2004. Energy will claim the biggest \nshare of U.S. output since the end of the oil crisis 20 years ago. Oil \nand natural gas companies are making record profits, while energy \nprices are overcoming and overtaking workers' salary increases. This is \nwrong.\n  We also must fix those bankrupt energy policies that provide oil and \ngas companies with billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury for \nproduction. These tax breaks should be repealed to pay for LIHEAP and \nconservation programs that help American energy consumers, not big \nbusiness.\n  The Federal Government must lead by example also. The President \ncalled on Americans to reduce their energy consumption and conserve \noil. I know American families are up to this challenge and will \nrespond. But Americans have the right to expect that their President \nand their Government will also make sacrifices.\n  The President should implement a Federal savings target to \ndemonstrate a serious commitment to improving our Nation's energy \nsecurity. He should set a 40-percent savings target for Federal \nagencies by 2020. Over the past few years, the Federal Government has \nreduced its petroleum consumption by less than 1 percent. We can and we \nmust do better.\n  As a nation, we must step back and evaluate our priorities. Now is \nnot the time to cut funding for social programs such as LIHEAP, \nMedicaid, and food stamps that support working families and seniors \nwhile the President and Members of the Senate continue to push for \nirresponsible tax breaks. We must prioritize, and the most vulnerable \namong us must be considered first.\n\n  Millions of Americans are struggling each day to make ends meet. They \ndeserve our support. I hope the President and this Congress will heed \nthis warning and help build an energy safety net for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1963\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of the Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Lautenberg, I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1963.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to maintain a website \n listing information on Federal contractor misconduct, and to require \n  reports on Federal no-bid contracts related to Iraq reconstruction)\n\n       On page 220, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 8116.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2016\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk on behalf \nof Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Shelby, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2016.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the transfer from the Army of authority relating \n               to the tactical unmanned aerial vehicles)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

(a) Implementation of IMT-2000 3G Communications \n     Capabilities.--Of the amount appropriated by title II under \n     the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Air Force'', up to \n     $10,000,000 may be used by the United States Northern Command \n     for the purposes of implementing IMT-2000 3G Standards Based \n     Communications Information Extension capabilities for the \n     Gulf States and key entities within the Northern Command Area \n     of Responsibility (AOR).\n       (b) Implementation of IMT-2000 3G Communications \n     Capabilities.--Of the amount\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\n     appropriated or otherwise made available by title III under \n     the heading ``Other Procurement, Air Force'', up to \n     $20,000,000 may be used by the United States Northern Command \n     for the purposes of implementing IMT-2000 3G Standards Based \n     Communications Information Extension capabilities for the \n     Gulf States and key entities within the Northern Command Area \n     of Responsibility (AOR).\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we consider many important amendments \nto this underlying bill, I will take just a moment to speak about this \namendment which I offer that will call the attention of my colleagues \nto the important investments that we should be making in \ninteroperability and communications.\n  As my colleagues know, we have had a very recent disaster along the \ngulf coast that has made quite apparent the lack of a communications \nsystem that is adequate to handle natural disasters of this magnitude \nand even manmade disasters that we could contemplate. So this is quite \nserious. I know there are many committees of the Senate and the House \nthat are working very hard on this issue right now.\n  Since Katrina and Rita and even before these terrible hurricanes and \nthe subsequent flooding of this region, which has been devastating, we \nhave known for some time that we have to get a better system of \ncommunication. Our military has some interesting and very promising \ninitiatives underway that could truly help us at this time. That is \nbasically what this $30 million amendment will do, is dedicate or \nallocate $30 million to U.S. Northern Command for the purposes of \nimplementing IMT-2000 3G Communications Capabilities. The IMT-2000 3G \nStandards will be used for the Gulf States and key entities within the \nNorthern Command Area of Responsibility, AOR.\n  We have many needs that have shown themselves out of this storm and \nout of the subsequent disaster. It would be hard even for the Senator \nfrom the State that was most directly hit to have to list them in an \norder of priority because they are overwhelming and they are so great: \nwater, food, electricity, housing, direct help to our local \ngovernments. We will debate that as these days unfold, and we will \ndebate that as these weeks and months unfold.\n  One thing I am positively sure of is that the communications system \nwe had in this country did not work well in 9/11. It did not work well \nfor the hurricanes that hit the Presiding Officer's State in such a \ndevastating way only a year or two ago, and it did not work well for \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, which experienced one of the worst \nnatural disasters in the history of the country.\n  To address the devastating problems caused by the lack of \ncommunication, $30 million is a small investment. I offer this \namendment and ask, as we move through the next few days of \nconsideration of this Defense bill, if we would please take a very \ncareful look at the importance of this amendment.\n  I submit the amendment for the Senate's consideration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment pending which I would \nlike to speak to. I will not call up this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The unanimous consent agreement was to set aside the \nquorum call. I wanted to find out if the Senator is going to be \noffering it now. I wanted to get the floor if he is. If not, I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I am only going to \nspeak to my amendment and will offer it at a later time, and I will \nprobably take in the range of 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will not object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, military personnel are under tremendous \npressure to be physically fit. The conditions under which they work and \ntrain are often harsh and demanding, making physical strength and \nendurance essential.\n  This pressure makes dietary supplements particularly attractive to \nmembers of our Armed Services, especially products marketed for weight \nloss and performance enhancement.\n  Finding these products on base is easy. A 2004 report on dietary \nsupplements in the journal Military Medicine notes that a newly \ndeployed U.S. Air Force base had eight different dietary supplements \nstocked on its shelves that were marketed for weightlifting and energy \nenhancement just 5 months after it opened. Six of these products \ncontained the notorious supplement ephedra.\n  This article appeared in Exchange and Commissary News last month. It \ndescribes a store where the ``supplement category is located on the \nmain aisle at the front of the store, indicative of its importance to \nour customers.''\n  Thermogenic's Extreme Thermo Rush is one of the most popular items. \nExtreme Thermo Rush contains 200 mg of caffeine. That is the equivalent \ncaffeine in five cans of Coca-Cola. In addition, this drink contains \n200 mg of Citrus Aurantium, which is an ephedra-substitute that was \nfound by a group of University of California scientists to increase \nheart rate among healthy people. It is a stimulant. These scientists \nreleased a report in April saying that dietary supplements containing \nCitrus Aurantium could have some of the same adverse health effects \nassociated with ephedra products.\n  Let's look at just how many service members are taking supplements.\n  As you can see from this chart, a 1999 study by the U.S. Army \nResearch Institute for Environmental Medicine found that 85 percent of \nthe 2,200 male soldiers surveyed reported use of dietary supplements.\n  A similar study conducted by the Department of the Navy found that 89 \npercent of Marines have used supplements. When broken down by category, \nthe survey showed that 26 percent of Marines took supplements \ncontaining stimulants.\n  Most dietary supplements are safe and provide health benefits to \nthose who take them.\n  I am not on the warpath against a daily vitamin tablet. I take my \nvitamins every day. I don't know if it helps to make me healthy, but it \nmakes me feel better to take them and I do, and I think everyone should \nhave the right to make that decision. But we are talking about a \ndifferent category of dietary supplements. We are not talking about \nmultivitamins or minerals, we are talking about stimulants.\n  Some of these supplements, these stimulants, can cause serious harm. \nOf greatest concern are those containing stimulants such as ephedra and \ncitrus aurantium, which are often marketed for energy promotion, \nperformance-enhancement, and weight loss. The Navy released a list of \nserious problems they had encountered among sailors and officers \nrelated to dietary supplements recently. The list includes health \nevents such as death, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, severe \nchest pain, and becoming increasingly delusional. These are over-the-\ncounter products sold nominally to make you more energetic or to lose \nweight which when taken result in these conditions: shortness of \nbreath, rapid heart rate, severe chest pain, and becoming delusional, \nand in one or two cases, probably more, actual death. Unfortunately, \nmost of the time adverse events such as these are never known to the \nFood and Drug Administration or to the public because not only is there \nno premarket safety review of these products, there is not even a \nmandatory adverse-events reporting to the FDA.\n  Consider this: If you walk into a drugstore to fill a prescription \nthe doctor has given you, the prescription is filled, you go home, you \nhave a bad reaction to that drug, and you go back to the hospital or \ndoctor because of that reaction. That is reported to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The FDA can then look across America and say: Wait a \nminute, we are finding people who have adverse reactions to this drug \nover and over again. We better take a closer look at it or take it off \nthe shelf because it could be dangerous. So the prescription drugs you \nbuy have an adverse-event report requirement. In other words, if you \nsell the product in America and somebody gets sick or dies, you have to \ntell somebody. You have to report it to the Government.\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\nSo if, in fact, it is a dangerous product, it is removed from the \nshelf.\n  Then let's go back to the beginning. In order to put a product on the \nshelf like a prescription drug, they have to be tested in advance by \nthe Food and Drug Administration for two things: safety and efficacy. \nIn other words, if you take the normal dosage, would the normal person \nbe safe in taking it? I think we want to know that. And second, is that \ndrug which you just took for arthritis really helpful when it comes to \nthe condition of arthritis? Efficacy.\n  But the dietary supplements we are talking about are never tested in \nadvance. They are not tested as to whether they are safe. There is no \nFDA review of clinical data. There is no requirement manufacturers \nproduce it. And when it comes to efficacy, we find time and again that \nthese companies, many of them fly-by-night operations by people with \nlimited resumes and limited talent selling so-called supplements with \nall sorts of health claims, turn out be not even close to effective for \nwhat they charge or what they say they can achieve. Here you have a \nwhole category of dietary supplements without testing as to their \nsafety, without testing to make sure they actually do what they say \nthey are going to do, for sale. Where? All over America, in every \ndrugstore you walk into, and some gas stations. If you go into a \nconvenience store or gas station, don't be surprised to see dietary \nsupplements on the counter. I bet you think as a consumer they couldn't \nsell those in America if they were not safe. Yes, they could. There is \nno requirement they be safe. There is no requirement they be tested.\n  So you think, I guess if somebody ever got sick, they would be \nreported to the Government, and the Government would take them off the \nshelf. There is no requirement in the law to report, even if a person \ndrops dead from taking a dietary supplement. It is, in fact, the \nbiggest gamble a consumer can take for many of these dietary \nsupplements. There has been no testing. There are very few, if any, \nquality standards to certify what they say on the label happens to be \nwhat is inside the bottle. There is no testing to determine if it is \neffective. There is no report if it turns out it is harmful.\n  I referred several times in this statement to ephedra, supplements \ncontaining ephedra. The military across the United States took ephedra \noff its shelf at the end of 2002 because between 1997 and 2001 at least \n30 Active-Duty personnel died after taking it. Ephedra is something \nmost people are aware of. Ephedra was this dietary supplement, this \nnaturally occurring substance similar to the drug ephedrine, which \npeople took and which was a stimulant. Over the years, we found out it \nwas dangerous to a lot of people. Thirty Active-Duty military personnel \ndied. Many others did as well. It turns out that ephedra was then \nbanned in Canada. You cannot buy it in Canada.\n  The American Medical Association suggested we ban it here in the \nUnited States, too, because it is too dangerous to be sold as a dietary \nsupplement. But the industry that makes these products is extremely \npowerful. As I recount to you what happened with ephedrine, you will \nfind out why.\n  After 7 years of effort, the FDA finally banned ephedra in 2004. At \nthat time, 150 deaths were linked to that product. But one Federal \ncourt in Utah this past April called into question the FDA procedure, \nand marketers of these products have hit the street with advertising: \nEphedra Is Back. Look at this. Natural Life Nutrition Center in \nCincinnati, OH, days after this court decision in Utah: ``Ephedra Is \nBack.'' You can buy your ephedra products again. They put up the sign \nto try to lure customers back. The court in Utah said the FDA had \nfailed to justify its rule banning ephedra, particularly at lower \ndoses, particularly 10 milligrams or less per day.\n\n  The FDA has said it will continue to enforce its ban except for doses \n10 milligrams or lower, but less than 2 weeks after the ruling, just to \nshow you how toothless the Food and Drug Administration is when it \ncomes to dietary supplements, I had one of my staffers get on the \nInternet and see if we could buy some ephedra in larger doses. This \nstaffer bought 30 pills containing 200 milligrams each from a company \nwith a post office box in Boonville, MO.\n  The Federal Drug Administration, after this Utah court decision, \nsaid: OK, we will let you sell ephedra, but it can't be in doses in \nexcess of 10 milligrams. It turns out that there is no enforcement \nwhatsoever. You can continue to buy this ephedra over the Internet in \n200-milligram doses, which could be very dangerous, if not lethal.\n  The FDA has announced it is appealing this ruling on ephedra, but \nclearly its hands are tied as it waits for a decision. That is why we \nneed to step in. Congress needs to address this problem. We may not \nsolve it with this bill, but we can do something to protect our men and \nwomen in uniform. We should be protecting everyone in America, but this \nbill addresses our men and women in uniform, and that is what my \namendment addresses.\n  The intent of my amendment is to protect American soldiers from \ndietary supplements containing stimulants that have unknown adverse \neffects. This amendment will disallow funds from being used by military \nstores to sell dietary supplements containing stimulants in cases where \nit is made known to the Department of Defense that the manufacturer \ndoes not have a policy of reporting their serious adverse events to the \nFDA's Special Nutritional Adverse Event Monitoring System.\n  We know this happens. Manufacturers collect information, and we know \nit because of this infamous Metabolife case. You maybe remember the \nMetabolife brand. It was all over television, magazines, newspapers, \nselling Metabolife. It was something that was going to make you \nhealthier and thinner and give you more energy.\n  About 5 years ago, Metabolife, a dietary supplement company \nspecializing in diet products containing ephedra, told Congress it had \nreceived no reports of people taking their products who experienced \nserious injury or death. Guess what. They lied. After the company was \nsued, it was revealed that Metabolife had actually received over 16,500 \nadverse events of Metabolife with ephedra. Many reports were serious. \nThey knew that more than 100 people had died from their product. They \nmisled Congress. They told us they had not received any information of \npeople taking their product and experiencing serious injury or death. \nFinally, when they were sued, the information came out.\n  The FDA collects that kind of information on prescription drugs and \nover-the-counter drugs. If they learned that something was being sold \nin America that killed 100 people or injured 16,000 people, they \nclearly would take action. But this industry is so powerful here in \nWashington that they conceal this information. They will not share it \nunless they are forced in a lawsuit.\n  You think to yourself, Why hasn't Congress risen to its \nresponsibility of protecting consumers? Why don't we at a minimum \nrequire these companies to report it when these dietary supplements \nharm people seriously or kill them?\n  Frankly, this Congress is in the thrall of this industry, and it has \nshown for so many years. I went to the floor, this floor, last year to \naddress the same issue. Some of my colleagues came to the floor and \nsaid: Oh, we can't wait to join you. This is a great idea, adverse-\nevent reporting. Here we are again a year later and nothing has \nhappened. The same Senators who said, ``We can't wait to work with \nyou'' can't return phone calls when it comes to this issue.\n  My challenge to them is this: If you truly want to keep dangerous \nproducts off the market, if you happen to believe they are healthy \nproducts and don't hurt anybody, why are you afraid of adverse-event \nreporting? If it is good enough for the major pharmaceutical companies, \nwhy isn't it good for the nutritional supplement industry?\n  I hope my colleagues will come to the Chamber and understand that we \nare putting our men and women in uniform at risk by selling these \ndietary supplements which are being used by so many men and women in \nuniform and are dangerous. They are dangerous to their health.\n  The Institute of Medicine issued a report last year recommending that \nadverse-event reporting become mandatory for dietary supplement \nmanufacturers--the Institute of Medicine. Here is what they said:\n\n       [W]hile spontaneous adverse event reports have recognized \n     limitations, they have considerable strength as potential \n     warning signals of problems requiring attention, making \n     monitoring by the FDA worthwhile.\n\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\n\n  The Institute of Medicine recommended that Congress amend the 1994 \nsupplement act, DSHEA, to require manufacturers of supplements to \nreport to the FDA in a timely manner any serious adverse event \nassociated with the use of their products.\n  The supporters of the amendment which I offer include the American \nDietetic Association, the American Osteopathic Association, Consumers \nUnion, Center for Science in the Public Interest, the American Society \nfor Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, and the American Society of \nPharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n  It wasn't that long ago that a starting pitcher for the Baltimore \nOrioles dropped dead. He was a man trying to lose some weight taking \nthe ephedra stimulant, and obviously it cost him his life.\n  The same thing happened in my part of the world in central Illinois, \nwhere a 16-year-old boy getting ready for a football game wanted to \nhave performance enhancement and goes down to the local gas station and \nbuys over the counter an ephedra product, takes it and washes it down \nwith a Mountain Dew and ends up dying from a heart attack--a healthy \n16-year-old boy.\n  Now we have our men and women in uniform all across the United States \nwalking into these base exchanges wanting to make sure they are at peak \nphysical condition to serve this country and buying these dietary \nsupplements which claim to enhance performance and give them new energy \nor perhaps lose some weight not realizing they are risking their lives \nevery time because the shoddy manufacturers who sell these products do \nnot report to the Government when people get sick and die because of \nthese dietary supplements.\n  How long is it going to take us? How many Americans have to die \nbefore we accept responsibility for the consumers of this country? They \ntrust us. They expect the Food and Drug Administration to be there, \nwhen it is needed, to report on these dangerous supplements. But we \nhave let them down for more than 10 years since it was passed. We \nshould not let them down when it comes to this bill. Let us start by \nprotecting our men and women in uniform. Let us start by not letting \nthem be in danger by buying the products on the shelves in these PXs or \ncommissaries that are not good for them. That is, I think, the least we \ncan do, and then let us not stop there. Let us move across America to \nsay we are going to stand behind consumers; that we are going to stand \nbehind children and families so that when they buy something in a \ndrugstore in America that is supposed to be good for their health, they \nknow their Government has at least the interest and has taken the time \nto make sure it is safe.\n  This is not some wild, crazy idea I have. It is an idea backed up by \nthe leading medical organizations in America, and it is one that \nreflects the reality of the danger of these products.\n  I invite my colleagues to support amendment No. 2035, which I have \nintroduced, when it comes up for consideration at a latter point in \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today with mixed feelings on what I \nheard because this was brought up under the Defense authorization bill. \nI talked to the Senator from Illinois, and we agreed that we would work \non something--that would actually do something. We have been doing \nthat, but with a slight interruption from Katrina. Now it is being \noffered again. And in the same way, I have mixed emotions because I \nprobably ought to suggest to the Senator from Alaska to take this \namendment because it will not achieve anything. We have an opportunity \nto do something and to achieve something. But this amendment will not \ndo that.\n  Of course, it brings some attention to the fact that there may be \nsome adverse reaction to dietary supplements. That is important. The \ndiscussion is important. If we had more time for discussion, we ought \nto have a lot of discussion on it, but we don't have a lot of time. I \nwill try to keep my remarks brief on this.\n  This amendment would withhold funding from any store on a military \ninstallation or a commissary store--most of those are on military \ninstallations as well--that sells any dietary supplement containing a \nstimulant unless the manufacturers of the supplement submits reports on \nserious adverse events associated with the supplement. If they don't, \nwe shut down the action on the base. But that is definitely not the \nonly place you can buy dietary supplements. What we merely do is invite \nmilitary people to go off base to get their dietary supplements--and \nthey will.\n  It is important that we get reporting done so people will know if \nsomething is having an adverse effect on their health.\n  I recognize the Senator from Illinois has strong concerns about \nadverse reporting for dietary supplements, and so do several other \nSenators. Senator Hatch and Senator Harkin have been working diligently \non this. Both of them are on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and that is the committee of jurisdiction on this particular \nissue.\n  We have been working on it. I share his interest on the issue. It is \nimportant that we maintain the safety of dietary supplements that \nbenefit so many Americans. I mention that this isn't the first time \nthis has been offered.\n  I hope he will withdraw his amendment, and we may move on without \nhaving to go through the difficulty of a vote.\n  As I said, I question the effectiveness of achieving such reporting \nby withholding legal products only from men and women in uniform and \ntheir families while the same products are available to the civilian \npopulation. That is unfair to our soldiers and we should not support \nit. Punishing our soldiers is not the way to ensure the safety of \ndietary supplements. A piecemeal approach does nothing to protect the \ncivilian population from products that are being withheld from the \nmilitary population.\n  This amendment places the regulation of dietary supplements in the \nhands of the Secretary of Defense and cuts the Food and Drug \nAdministration out of the loop.\n  I would like to point out that the FDA is already taking aggressive \nsteps to regulate stimulants that are dietary supplements, including \nthe banning of ephedra.\n  We should be sure that requiring additional reporting does not \ninadvertently derail those enforcement efforts.\n  Finally, the Appropriations Committee has included for fiscal year \n2006 funding of approximately $5.5 million for the Center for Food \nSafety and Nutrition Adverse Events Reporting System. That includes \napproximately $1.7 million for dietary supplements. That is over $1 \nmillion more than the amount in the budget request. The Senate is \nalready moving in the right direction on this issue.\n  I wish to point out that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct is squarely within the HELP Committee's jurisdiction.\n  I know that Senator Durbin has worked with Senators Hatch and Harkin \nand myself to develop a proposal on mandatory adverse events reporting \nfor dietary supplements. I wish to work with the Senator from Illinois \nand my fellow committee members, especially Senators Hatch and Harkin, \nto see how we might address the issue in my committee through regular \norder.\n\n  I respectfully ask the Senator from Illinois to withdraw his \namendment and work with the HELP Committee on this issue. If not, I \nwill have to oppose the amendment. I think it will take up unnecessary \ntime when we can do it considerably more effectively and without \npunishing in a big way the servicemembers in uniform while we allow the \ncivilian population to do whatever they want.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Last year when I offered this amendment, Senator Hatch \ncame to the floor. Senator Harkin joined afterwards. They conceded that \nthey thought it was not a bad idea, if you sell dietary supplements in \nAmerica, and somebody is harmed, seriously injured or dies as a result, \nthat the manufacturer of that dietary supplement should report that \nevent to the FDA so that they can see if there is a pattern, if it is \nsomething that might lead to a decision to take something off the \nmarket.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Wyoming: Does he agree with \nthat?\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\nDoes he think that is a reasonable standard to ask the dietary \nsupplement manufacturers to report truly adverse events such as is \nrequired of the pharmaceutical companies today?\n  Mr. ENZI. I said before that I think it is very important for us to \ncome up with a piece of legislation that does that on and off military \nbases, so there is a reporting of adverse events so that FDA can take \naction when it is affecting people, and have enough information to be \nable to tell whether they are acting properly or not. We do have an \nagency that is designed to do that. It is not the Department of \nDefense.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I agree \nwith the Senator. This is not the way to address it. I thought it was \nthe only way to bring the subject up before the Senate. I wish to ask \nthe Senator from Wyoming, whom I respect and I have worked with and we \nhave been able to work out some very serious difficulties in the past \nand I know he genuinely wants to reach solutions, can the Senator from \nWyoming give me his assurance that he will try to schedule hearings in \nthe consideration of this issue on a timely basis before his committee \nso that we can raise this issue in a thoughtful way and address it \nbeyond the Department of Defense?\n  Mr. ENZI. I can give the Senator assurances that we will deal with \nthis issue. If you check with members of my committee, you will find \nthat because of Katrina and pensions and all of the health issues that \nwe have now, and all of the education, higher education and Head Start \nwe are trying to work our way through, that we have gone to a system of \nroundtables instead that allows us to bring in more people with more \ninformation so we can learn more from them in order to be able to deal \nwith these issues in a knowledgeable way.\n  It has been working. I appreciate the cooperation of Senator Kennedy, \nwho is ranking member on my committee, for this approach of being able \nto gather information so that we can do effective legislation quicker. \nAs the Senator probably noticed, we have a lot of bills which we are \nworking on, and it is because we have gone through a mechanism where we \nare working in a very bipartisan way to gather information. This is a \nbill of some priority for us.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, I \nsalute the Senator. What he says is true. He has done an excellent job \nin joining both sides of the aisle with bipartisanship in finding \nsolutions and getting things done. I am sorry we can't say that for all \nof us in the Senate. We could probably learn a lot the way the Senator \nfrom Wyoming approaches it. I don't want to suggest that the Senator \nchange his approach. If the Senator from Wyoming will give me his \nassurance that this is a priority, that he will try to bring it up \nbefore his committee in a timely way when appropriate, I understand he \nhas other priorities, if he will give me that assurance, I will \nwithdraw this amendment. I hope we can work together from this point \nforward.\n  Mr. ENZI. I assure the Senator that we can work together, and it will \nbe put into the prioritization. It is already in the prioritization of \nthe committee. We are handling the emergencies first.\n  I apologize for the 2-week delay we had while we are working on \nKatrina. Staff is working on this one, along with the staff of the \nSenator from Illinois. We will do it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment No. 2035.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my colleague and friend from \nIllinois leaves the floor, I want to thank him for his leadership on \nthis very important issue, in fact, for so many people in our country. \nI also wish to thank Senator Enzi for indicating his desire to make \nthis a priority within his committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1937\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Thune, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Lincoln, \n     Mr. Corzine, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Bayh, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 1937.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that future funding for health care for former \n members of the Armed Forces takes into account changes in population \n                             and inflation)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Funding for Veterans Health Care to Address \n     Changes in Population and Inflation.--Chapter 3 of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 320. Funding for veterans health care to address \n       changes in population and inflation\n\n       ``(a) By the enactment of this section, Congress and the \n     President intend to ensure access to health care for all \n     veterans. Upon the enactment of this section, funding for the \n     programs, functions, and activities of the Veterans Health \n     Administration specified in subsection (d) to accomplish this \n     objective shall be provided through a combination of \n     discretionary and mandatory funds. The discretionary amount \n     should be equal to the fiscal year 2005 discretionary funding \n     for such programs, functions, and activities, and should \n     remain unchanged each fiscal year thereafter.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMurray, Kerry, Kennedy, Dayton, and Biden be added as cosponsors of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to thank both the chairman and \nranking member, Senator Inouye, for their leadership on this \nlegislation. I am very supportive of the Defense appropriations bill. \nAnd I appreciate all of the hard work and leadership they have brought \nto this point in this important legislation.\n  I come to the floor this evening to fix a broken promise to our \nveterans, a promise our country made to the men and women who serve our \ncountry in the armed services. They put their lives on the line to \nprotect us, as we know, and in exchange we have a sacred obligation to \nextend to them the honors and benefits and the health care benefits \nthey have earned through their service.\n  I have met with men and women from Michigan and across the country \nwho are recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, as many of my \ncolleagues have. Some have suffered minor injuries that will not have a \ndramatic impact on the rest of their lives. Others though, because of \ntheir injuries, will need years of rehabilitation and face considerable \nobstacles as they return to their civilian lives.\n  We owe these men and women our continued support so that they can \nrecover from their injuries and lead productive lives.\n  Today's soldiers are tomorrow's veterans--and America has made a \npromise to these brave men and women to provide them the care they \ndeserve. They deserve the respect and support of a grateful nation when \nthey return home.\n  We also owe it to the men and women who have fought in America's \nprior conflicts to maintain a place for them in the VA system so they \ncan receive the care they need, as well. We need to keep our promise to \nour veterans, young and old.\n  Together we can do better for our men and women who have served our \ncountry. We must consider the ongoing costs of medical care for \nAmerica's veterans as part of the continuing cost of our national \ndefense. The long-term legacy of the wars we fight today is the care of \nthe men and women who have worn the uniform and are willing to pay the \nultimate price for their nation.\n  Senator Johnson, Senator Thune, and I are offering an amendment today \nto provide full funding for VA health care to ensure the VA has the \nresources necessary to provide quality health care in a timely manner \nto our Nation's disabled veterans. The Stabenow-Johnson-Thune amendment \nprovides guaranteed funding for America's veterans from two sources.\n  First, the legislation provides an annual discretionary amount that \nwill be locked in for future years at the 2005 funding level. Second, \nin the future, the VA receives a sum of mandatory funding that is \nadjusted year to year based on changes in demand from the VA health \nsystem and the rate of health care inflation.\n  This funding mechanism will ensure that the VA has the resources it \nneeds to provide a steady and reliable stream of resources to care for \nAmerica's veterans. It will also ensure that Congress will continue to \nbe responsible for the oversight of the VA health system as it does \nwith other Federal programs funded directly from the U.S. Treasury.\n  This amendment will bring funding for veterans health care into line \nwith almost 90 percent of Federal health care spending which is \nmandatory rather than discretionary. One of our greatest \naccomplishments as a nation is that every American knows when they \nenter their golden years, when they reach 65 or if they are disabled, \nthey receive the health care they need. Medicare is a universal and \ncomprehensive system that benefits a person for their life's work. Our \nveterans deserve the same. We can do better for them by ensuring that \ntheir service is repaid with reliable health care benefits.\n  I thank the cosponsors of this amendment for their support: Senators \nJohnson, Thune, Akaka, Dayton, Nelson, Lautenberg, Salazar, Lincoln, \nCorzine, Baucus, Landrieu, Jeffords, Bayh, Bingaman, Murray, Kerry, \nKennedy, and Biden.\n  In July, I offered this amendment to the 2006 Defense authorization \nbill. Unfortunately, the Defense authorization bill was pulled from the \nSenate at that time. While we are working out whether this will be \nincluded in this particular bill, it is important to offer my amendment \nagain at this time. The amendment has been endorsed by the Partnership \nfor Veterans Health Care Budget Reform, a group of major veterans \nservice organizations that has been working to provide a reliable \nstream of health care for America's veterans over the last 2 years. It \nincludes the American Legion, the AMVETS, the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation, Disabled American Veterans, Jewish War Veterans of the \nUnited States, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, all of them together asking us to get this right for our \nveterans.\n  The problem we face today is that resources for veterans health care \nare falling behind demand. We have more veterans being created, more \nmen and women coming home from the wars. Yet the funding is falling \nbehind. Shortly after coming into office, the President created the \ntask force to improve health care delivery for our Nation's veterans. \nThe task force found historically there has been a gap between the \ndemand for VA care and the resources to meet the needs of our veterans. \nThe task force also found that:\n\n       The current mismatch is far greater . . . and its impact \n     potentially far more detrimental both to the VA's ability to \n     furnish high quality care and to the support that the system \n     needs from those it serves.\n\n  The task force released its report in May of 2003, well before we \nunderstood the impact of the men and women fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the impact that would have on our VA system.\n  If the mismatch between demand and resources was bad in May of 2003, \nimagine what it is today. Over 360,000 brave soldiers have returned \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, and over 86,000 have sought health care from \nthe VA. There are an additional 740,000 military personnel who served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan who are still in the service. This next \ngeneration of veterans will be eligible for VA health care and will \nplace additional demands on a system that is already strained. These \nare promises we need to keep.\n  In addition, each reservist and National Guard member who has served \nin Iraq is eligible for 2 years of free health care at the VA. The \nadministration has in its own way admitted they do not have sufficient \nresources to provide adequate care for our veterans. While they would \nnot until recently admit there were shortfalls, they have for years \nattempted to ration care and cut services at the expense of our \nveterans. We can do better than that.\n\n  In 2003, the VA banned the enrollment of new priority 8 veterans. For \nthe past 3 years, I fought attempts by the administration to charge \nmiddle-income veterans a $250 enrollment fee to join the VA health care \nsystem and a 100-percent increase in prescription drug copays. This \nyear, the administration also proposed slashing Federal support for the \nState veterans homes from $140 million to $12 million. The head of the \nGrand Rapids Home for Veterans and the D.J. Jacobetti Home For Veterans \nin Marquette tells me these cuts would be devastating.\n  The fiscal year 2005 and 2006 VA health care budgets are a case study \nin why Congress should guarantee reliable and adequate resources \nthrough direct spending.\n  Last March, the President submitted an inadequate fiscal year 2005 \nbudget request for VA health care to Congress that fell $3.2 billion \nshort of the recommendation of the independent budget, an annual \nestimate of critical veterans health care needs by the coalition of \nleading veterans organizations.\n  In fact, in February 2004, Anthony Principi, then the Secretary of \nVA, testified before Congress that the request the President submitted \nto Congress fell $1.2 billion short of the amount he had recommended. \nIt then fell to Congress to again increase the amount provided to the \nVA for health care. The\n\n[[Page S11101]]\n\nfinal amount Congress provided to the VA for health care was $1.2 \nbillion over the President's request, but it was still not enough to \nmeet their immediate needs.\n  In April of this year I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Murray \nto the fiscal year 2005 supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq and \nAfghanistan to provide $1.9 billion for veterans medical care, \nespecially for those soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nDuring the debate on the amendment we were again told that the \nPresident's budget was sufficient but, in fact, on April 5, Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson sent a letter to the Senate that \nsaid:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need supplemental \n     funds for FY2005 to continue to provide timely, quality \n     service that is always our goal.\n\n  I was proud to cosponsor an amendment in June, however, to provide an \nadditional $1.5 billion for veterans health care because they finally \nadmitted there was a gap in funding for this year. Finally, they \nadmitted, in fact, the veterans health care system was not adequately \nfunded this year. I was pleased we were able to add dollars under an \nemergency spending measure, to be able to fill the gap this year.\n  As it turned out, we received more bad news from the administration \non July 14, when the administration requested another $300 million for \nthis year and a whopping $1.7 billion for next year. The total \nshortfall for this year and next was nearly $3 billion, 3 billion short \nof where we should be in adequately funding health care for our \nveterans.\n  At the end of July, I was pleased to support the conference report \nfor the Interior appropriations which included the $1.5 billion this \nyear that the Senate has twice unanimously supported. Further, in \nSeptember, I supported the Senate's Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill which provided a total of $33 billion for \nveterans health care. This is $1.1 billion more than the administration \nrequested and $2.5 billion more than the House version of the \nlegislation for veterans health care.\n  I tell this to make two points: First, it is clear that the demand \nfor veterans health care is increasing, and a good portion of this \nincrease can be attributed to men and women seeking care after they are \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second is to show despite the \nbest intentions of the VA and Congress, the VA does not have a reliable \nand dependable stream of funding to provide for veterans health care \nneeds. We should not have to pass an emergency funding bill to give our \nveterans the health care they need and deserve.\n  In 1993, there were about 2.5 million Americans in the VA health care \nsystem. Today there are more than 7 million veterans enrolled in the \nsystem, over half of which receive care on a regular basis. Despite the \nincrease in patients, the VA has received on average a 5-percent \nincrease in appropriations over the last 8 years. My amendment will fix \nthis problem and ensure that each year we provide the funding necessary \nto care for our veterans in a timely manner that is separate from the \nuncertainty and the ups and downs of the congressional calendar.\n  At last count, at least 86,000 men and women have returned from Iraq \nand have sought health care from the VA. We can safely assume that this \nnumber will reach hundreds of thousands. This bill provides the \nresources our troops need to prepare and defend our country in Iraq. We \nmust not forget about them when they return home and put on a veteran's \ncap. We must ensure that we keep our promises to them when they come \nhome as veterans. Let's stop this up-and-down roller coaster of \nemergency spending measures, of budgets that do not match with need \nyear to year. We owe our veterans better than that. Together, we can do \nbetter than that.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues for this very important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to do this, but as we have \nexamined this amendment of the Senator, we find this requires this \nspending to become a part of the mandatory process of expenditures. It \nrequires funds to come out of the Treasury to implement this section, \nand in effect it becomes a matter that we believe is subject to a point \nof order under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that \nprovides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation \nunder the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution of the budget. I make \nthat point of order.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move to waive the applicable sections of the \nCongressional Budget Act for the purpose of considering my amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will have a request for votes to \ncommence at 7:30, but first I offer a managers' package, as we call it, \nwith modifications.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1914; 1972; 1962; 1979, as Modified; 1976; and 1945, En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk, for Senator Nelson of Florida, \namendment No. 1914, for surface sonar dome windows; for Senator Dodd, \namendment No. 1972, for countermeasures to nerve agents; for Senator \nLieberman, amendment No. 1962, for defense manufacturing technology; \nfor Senator Chambliss, amendment No. 1979, as modified, for \nenvironmental cleanup; for Senator Lott, amendment No. 1976, for \nlightweight ammunition; and for Senator Roberts, amendment No. 1945, \nfor intelligence scholars.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments en \nbloc? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1914; 1972; 1962; 1979, as modified; 1976; and \n1945) were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1979\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLIS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment, \nNo. 1979, as modified, to H.R. 2863.\n  Camp Wheeler, near Macon, GA, was a World War II Army facility which \nhas a proud history of training American soldiers. Unfortunately, and \nlike many formerly used defense sites in the United States, there is \nunexploded ordnance on the former Camp Wheeler site that, today, \nthreatens the safety of people who live in the vicinity. This amendment \nwould earmark $600,000 to clean up Camp Wheeler.\n  The unexploded ordnance at Camp Wheeler was found during an \ninspection sponsored by the Savannah District of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. The Corps has indicated that cleanup of Ordnance Operable \nUnit No. 1 at Camp Wheeler, which is in a neighborhood in Twiggs \nCounty, GA, is the No. 1 munitions cleanup program in the State of \nGeorgia.\n  I have worked with the Corps over the past several months on this \nproject, and my staff has received briefings and updates from the Corps \non a regular basis.\n  Since filing my amendment, the Corps has announced that $1.5 million \nin fiscal year 2005 funds will be used to conduct cleanup at Camp \nWheeler. Additionally, the Corps of Engineers has assured me that there \nare funds available in their budget to work toward completion of \ncleanup of Ordnance Operable Unit No. 1 at Camp Wheeler in the fiscal \nyear 2006 budget.\n  This amendment will ensure that the necessary funds are spent on this \nproject and that the Camp Wheeler cleanup is completed as the Corps of \nEngineers has promised.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at 7:30 we \nwill start with the vote on Senator Warner's submission of the Defense \nauthorization bill as an amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We already have an agreement to have 3 minutes on each \nside on that amendment, Senator Bayh's amendment No. 1933, and Senator \nMcCain's amendment No. 1977, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are working on a modification to Senator Reed's \namendment. We then also have Senator McCain's amendment, which is \namendment No. 1978. And we have Senator Graham's amendment, which is \n2004.\n  I say to the Senator, are you prepared to accept that amendment now?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2004\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham's \namendment No. 2004 be laid before the Senate so we might consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. It is \npending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I withdraw that request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2033\n\n  Mr. President, is it in order for me, as manager of the bill, to move \nto table Senator Kerry's amendment No. 2033 at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not presently pending. The \nSenator may ask for the regular order with respect to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table Senator Kerry's amendment \nwhich deals with LIHEAP and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be put into \nthe schedule to be developed by the leadership as to the time at which \nthat vote will occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as to the amendment offered by Ms. \nStabenow, I have made the point of order. At what time would that vote \noccur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the vote has not yet been \nscheduled.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would it be all right with the Senator if we ask for it \nto be scheduled according to the leadership in this process this \nevening?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. That is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I say to the Senator, Mr. President, if I may respond to \nhis question, we are waiting for Senator Byrd to make a statement. But \nhe is not ready at this time, so the Senator may proceed. He should be \nready in about 5 or 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we in this country have the highest standards of \nconduct in our legal system, and our military has the highest standards \nof behavior as they deal with prisoners with whom they come in contact.\n  Have problems occurred? Yes, they have. Has that occurred in every \nwar we have ever been involved in, that any nation has ever been \ninvolved in? Unfortunately so.\n  But I want to take a few minutes now to express my deep feeling that \nwe do not have a program of systematic abuse of prisoners going on by \nour U.S. military; that they are maintaining the discipline of our \ntroops; and that\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\nthey are, day after day, subjecting themselves to personal risk--not \nfiring randomly or rapidly but hesitating to make sure innocents are \nnot injured, and have complied with the most extensive set of \nrequirements dealing with prisoners that any nation and army has ever \nhad in the history of the world. Our military has taken disciplinary \naction time and time and time again if anybody violates those \nstandards.\n  We should all remember that event that made a good bit of news when a \nfine Army colonel was in a combat area taking fire and captured an \nenemy, and to save the lives of his troops, as his soldiers later \ntestified, he fired a gun beside the head of a captured prisoner in \norder to frighten him and see if he would provide information that \nmight be of value in saving the lives of the American soldiers he \ncommanded. He was kicked out of the Army for it. The news media did not \ndiscover this occurrence. The military did and acted upon it.\n  We all heard about Abu Ghraib, and the sick and unacceptable behavior \nthat went on in that prison. But I remember distinctly that within one \nday of the information being brought to the commanders of our soldiers \nin Iraq, an investigation was commenced. Within 3 days, they had made a \npublic announcement to the world that there had been allegations of \nabuse in Abu Ghraib and that an investigation was ongoing. And it was \nmonths--2 or 3 months--later that these pictures came out.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because the military took the \nallegations seriously from the beginning. They were not reacting to the \nrelease of pictures that embarrassed them. Rather, they immediately \ninitiated the investigation about what happened on this midnight shift \nby these soldiers who lost discipline in Abu Ghraib and abused \nprisoners in a way that is unacceptable to us.\n  Those guards, have all been tried and convicted. The Wall Street \nJournal, just a couple of days ago, published an op-ed entitled ``The \n`Torture Narrative' Unravels.'' It noted that the trial and conviction \nof PFC Lynndie England, who was sentenced as the ``leash girl'' for her \nactivities there, ``was relegated to the innards of newspapers.'' That \ndid not make any big news--the Army's professional, proper response to \na lack of discipline.\n  The op-ed goes on to note that ``by one of the greatest leaps of \nlogic ever seriously entertained in our national discourse, those \nmemos''--that were written by the Department of Justice in analyzing \nwhat the President's proper powers were with regard to the detaining of \nenemy soldiers, who are not lawful combatants--that it was ``one of the \ngreatest leaps of logic ever seriously entertained in our national \ndiscourse'' to say that memos as part of a discussion in the Department \nof Justice of the United States had anything to do with those soldiers \nin Iraq carrying out that abuse.\n  But that is what was alleged. It was during a campaign season, I \nunderstand, and it resulted in calls for the resignation of Secretary \nRumsfeld and, I guess, to call for the removal of the President of the \nUnited States before the election.\n  We had one Senator, whose name is known all over the world, say: \n``Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management, U.S. \nmanagement.''\n  I submit that was a slander on our troops and our soldiers who are in \nharm's way because we sent them there. We asked them to go there to \ndefend the legitimate national interests of our country. We put them at \nrisk, and when we say things about them that are not true, to suggest \nto the world that we have systemic abuse in our military. Those charges \nplace them at greater risk. It makes it harder for us to negotiate \npeace treaties with people who are suspicious of us. They believe these \nthings.\n  When we have Members of the House and the Senate and political \nleaders in our country making irresponsible and unfounded charges \nagainst the military, that they are systematically abusing prisoners, \nit is wrong. It ought to stop, and I feel strongly about that.\n  Oh, we remember those comments, when all the pictures of the abuses \nwere leaked and were made available. They said higher-ups were \ninvolved, it went all the way to the Secretary of Defense, and that \nthese people were using interrogation techniques according to some memo \nwritten somewhere, and that it was all part of poor leadership and \nmismanagement, and our military discipline was not being maintained.\n  Remember those comments? It could not be just the lower-ranking \nsoldiers; ``why don't you prosecute the higher ups?'' We heard Senators \nsaying that time and again.\n  It just was not so. This is what the Wall Street Journal article \nsaid. They quote the judge when PFC Lynndie England was before the \ncourt. The judge asked her this: ``You feel that by doing these things \nyou were setting conditions for interrogations?''\n  Remember that allegation, that the abuses of these prisoners were \ncarried out to set them up, to prime them to be interrogated by the \nArmy interrogators or other interrogators, and that this was part of a \nsystemic plan to soften up the prisoners so they could be interrogated? \nSo the judge asked her under oath--she could use this as a defense:\n\n       You feel that by doing these things you were setting \n     conditions for interrogations?\n\n  Her answer:\n\n       No, sir.\n\n  So the judge responded:\n\n       So this was just a way to embarrass them?\n\n  Referring to the prisoners.\n  And she replied:\n\n       Yes, sir.\n\n  Or consider the testimony of SP Jeremy C. Sivits. He pled guilty, \ntoo, as I recall. This is what Sivits said about their behavior in that \nprison:\n\n       Our command would have slammed us. They believe in doing \n     the right thing. If they saw what was going on, there would \n     be hell to pay.\n\n  I will say right now, every one of these Senators who has been \ncomplaining that this misbehavior in the prison was a direct result of \nsome sort of approved interrogation techniques by the Secretary of \nDefense or the President or the Department of Justice, and they were \noverruling JAG officers somewhere in doing these things, is not so.\n  I was a prosecutor for quite a long time. I am telling you, when you \nhave somebody being prosecuted and you are accusing them of a crime--I \nknow the chairman has been a prosecutor--and they have an excuse or \ndefense, don't they say it? They say: It wasn't my fault; they told me \nto do it; I was following orders. These people did not say that. They \ntook their medicine, they were tried and convicted or pled guilty, and \nmany are serving a very long sentence in jail for that misbehavior.\n  It embarrassed the soldiers. I had soldiers tell me: This is an \nembarrassment to me. We worked our hearts out to make Iraq a better \nplace, and this was an embarrassment to us. It undermined our ability \nto do our job.\n  They were angry with these people who misbehaved. They were glad to \nsee them prosecuted. It galls me that we have people suggesting this \nwas the policy of our Army. It is not correct.\n  We had the complaints about Guantanamo Bay, that there were \nsystematic abuses going on down there. By the way, we have had over 25 \nhearings in this Senate and in the House dealing with prisoner abuse. \nWe have had more hearings on this issue than we have had on how to win \nthe war. In addition to that, there have been 10 major reviews, \nassessments, inspections, and investigations. I mean major reviews. We \nhad those generals and admirals who conducted the reviews before our \ncommittees. We interviewed them, and we made them explain their \nreports. Mr. President, 16,000 pages of documents have been delivered \nto the Congress, and 1,700 different interviews were conducted. \nDetentions, operations, enhancement, oversight training--all those \nissues were brought up. There are 390 criminal investigations completed \nor ongoing.\n  People who are responsible for misbehavior are being held to account. \nIf I thought our military was not responding well, I would be very \nconcerned. I have seen law officers involved with a bad criminal, and \nthat person runs and they chase him and have to wrestle him down. They \nare so pumped up sometimes they do more to that person they have \napprehended than they should. Maybe they beat them. You have to contain \nthe felon, but sometimes you go too far. I have seen abuse\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\ncases filed against them. It breaks your heart sometimes because you \nknow the police officers lost control in tough conditions and went too \nfar, but they have to be disciplined because we do not allow that in \nour country.\n\n  The same is true for our soldiers. It is easy for us to talk about \nwhat it is like being out in combat, having your life at risk. Some of \nus might lose some of our discipline, too. We don't excuse it. We \nunderstand it.\n  The activities at Guantanamo have been proven to involve only two or \nthree incidents that have been indefensible, and action has been taken \nconcerning those.\n  Also, we have had tremendous evidence of how good the conditions are \nthere, how well they are being fed, their full rights to conduct their \nreligious expression openly and freely, and the other things that have \ngone on.\n  Now we have a letter pop up from a Captain Fishback who has made \nallegations concerning the 82nd Airborne. I don't know the full details \nof it. I will quote a small portion. We heard all these complaints that \nsay that he has submitted proof of systemic abuses in the prisons. This \nis a New York Times article, and the New York Times has made a full-\ntime effort to try to root out and expose and publicize any misbehavior \nthat has occurred there. They have gone too far, sometimes, in my \nopinion. But this is what the New York Times says:\n\n       Captain Fishback said he had seen at least one \n     interrogation where prisoners were being abused.\n\n  I don't know what ``abused'' means. I am a former prosecutor. What \ndoes ``abused'' mean? Did they shake him? Did they respond to being \nspit on by prisoners, as many of our guards have been? Did they injure \nhim in some way? I think if they were beaten, he would have said they \nwere beaten. He didn't say that. He used a far more general term, that \nthey were ``abused.''\n  Then he goes on to say that he was told about other ill-treatment of \ndetainees by his sergeant. ``Ill-treatment,'' what is that? He didn't \nsay they were beaten, shot, killed, wounded, or tortured.\n  An investigation is being undertaken of these allegations. It is odd, \nthough, when asked to name the sergeants and the people who conducted \nthe activity so they could follow up and investigate and make sure \npeople who did wrong were disciplined, Captain Fishback refused to \ndisclose the names of the sergeants, one who left the Army and the \nother who has been reassigned because he did not want to reveal his \nidentity.\n  It is hard for the Army to investigate if the guy making the \ncomplaint, telling Human Rights Watch and the New York Times all these \npoints, will not tell the Army what actually occurred.\n  I am dubious, for complex technical reasons, of the amendment that \nhas been offered today and which we will vote on later tonight because \nI am not sure it makes good legal sense to have a law that is a moving \nlaw, it seems to me, that complies with the Army regulations. Army \nregulation is going to change, and you have a law and the law is going \nto change while the regulation changes? A statute is supposed to be \npermanent. As a lawyer, I am troubled by that. I don't think this is a \nnecessary action. I don't intend to vote for the amendment for that \nreason and a number of other complex reasons.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Alaska that \nwe had a unanimous consent request that was agreed to that the Senator \nfrom Illinois would be recognized. Does the Senator from Alaska have a \nrequest other than the previous regular order?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was not on the floor, apparently, when that occurred. \nWe had previously indicated the Senator from West Virginia would be \nrecognized. May I inquire from the Senator from Illinois how much time \nhe would like?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I request 7 or 8 minutes, but as my \nesteemed colleague from West Virginia knows, I am happy to defer to him \nif we do not have enough time before the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois be recognized for not to exceed 10 minutes and then the \nSenator from West Virginia be recognized for not to exceed 15 minutes, \nand then I be recognized following the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Obama pertaining to the introdution of S. 1821 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions,'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized but should be aware of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand. I rise in an attempt to modify the \nunanimous consent agreement, with the agreement of the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor not longer than 4 minutes, to be immediately followed by the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have had to come to this Chamber many \ntimes and have had the privilege of doing so since 1987 when I entered \nthis body. I never thought I would have to come to the Senate floor to \ndefend the integrity and the reputation of a brave young American who \nhas put his life on the line for his country defending the freedom of \nAfghan and Iraqi people.\n  The remarks of the Senator from Alabama concerning his allegations of \nabuse and his disparagement of his word and his conduct is \nunacceptable. This young man, Captain Fishback, served in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, is a member of the 82nd Airborne, was highly decorated, and \nhad the courage to come forward because of his deep-seated dedication \nto this Nation and his desire to see that we do the right thing in the \ntreatment of prisoners of war.\n  He says very eloquently:\n\n     . . . Do we sacrifice our ideals in order to preserve \n     security? Terrorism inspires fear and suppresses ideals like \n     freedom and individual rights. Overcoming the fear posed by \n     terrorist threats is a tremendous test of our courage . . .\n\n  Captain Fishback is a noble, brave young American. He does not \ndeserve to be disparaged on the Senate floor by any Senator, and the \nSenator from Alabama owes him an abject and deep apology.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1955\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will vote within the next few \nminutes on a procedural motion relating to the amendment offered by \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin. This amendment proposes to add much \nof the Defense authorization bill to the Defense appropriations bill. \nThe Defense authorization bill is most complex legislation. The bill \ndeals with a broad array of policy matters, ranging from providing for \nincreased pay and benefits for our troops to changing laws relating to \nnuclear nonproliferation programs to authorizing military construction \nprojects and so on.\n  The committee report that accompanies this bill is 494 pages in \nlength. It is legislation that deserves close scrutiny, full and open \ndebate, and an opportunity to freely amend. If this motion carries and \nthe amendment is adopted, the Senate will only have a bobtailed debate \nof just a few hours on this very important bill.\n  I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee as well as the \nAppropriations Committee. I attended a portion of the markup of the \nDefense authorization bill which lasted several full days. Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin conducted the markup in an exemplary \nbipartisan manner, and I commend them for their outstanding efforts. \nThey are always fair and very considerate of others and always \ncourteous to every other Senator.\n  The bill was reported from the committee on May 12 of this year, and \nit was brought to the floor on July 20. For reasons which have been \nwidely discussed, the Defense authorization bill was pulled from the \nfloor on July 27, after only five votes on amendments to the bill. The \nSenate could have finished consideration of the Defense authorization \nbill within a matter of 2 or 3 days or perhaps a week, if necessary,\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\nif the leadership had not pulled it from the floor.\n  This was a precipitous act, and because of this precipitous action \nmost Senators have had no opportunity to offer amendments and no \nopportunity to receive votes on their amendments. That is not the way \nthe Senate ought to operate. That is not the way the Senate used to \noperate. We used to have full and open debates on this floor, take a \nweek perhaps or 2 weeks on a bill this size. As I have stated, here is \nthe history of this important legislation.\n  The matter before the Senate is whether to allow the Defense \nauthorization bill to be added to the Defense appropriations bill as an \namendment. What a way for the Senate to operate. What a way to conduct \nthis important business of the people. This is not the way the Senate \nis supposed to conduct its business. This is a forum for free, open, \nand unlimited debate. This is how the Senate is so different from other \nupper bodies throughout the world today. This is why the Senate is such \nan incredibly powerful and important forum of free debate, open debate, \nunlimited debate, the full airing of legislation, time to ask \nquestions, time to answer questions, time to explain, explore, \ndeliberate, and time to offer amendments. What a travesty.\n  The Senate is an institution sui generis, one of its kind in this \ncountry, a forum where there can be free, open, unlimited debate, \nfreedom of debate, freedom of speech. So the Senate is an institution \nwhere freedom of speech, freedom of debate, and the freedom to amend \nreign.\n  Attaching such a massive bill, the Defense authorization bill, to \nanother important bill, the Defense appropriations bill, will mean that \nthe Senate will never have an opportunity to focus its undivided \nattention on the important matters of the Defense authorization bill. \nThis is a travesty on freedom of debate. It is a travesty that strikes \nat the heart of the Senate: freedom of speech, freedom of debate, and \nfreedom to amend.\n  Freedom of speech has its roots buried in antiquity. Henry the Fourth \nin 1407 said that the members of commons would have freedom of speech. \nThey could say whatever was on their minds about the king, if \nnecessary. Freedom of speech, there it was in the English Declaration \nof Rights, February 3, 1689. And there it was, in the English Bill of \nRights, placed there on December 6, 1689: Freedom of speech. The \nfreedom of commons to speak on any subject, not to be questioned \nelsewhere in the English House of Commons, and that freedom of speech \nis enshrined in the American Constitution.\n\n  Here we are putting a limitation and we are self-imposing it--on \nourselves. I am a member of both the Armed Services Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee, and I believe there is a great importance to \nallowing the Senate to consider the authorization bill and the \nappropriations bills separately. Debate about funding our military \nshould take place on the appropriations bill and debate about defense \npolicy should take place particularly on the authorization bill. They \nare both important bills, and they should be considered separately.\n  The Defense authorization bill should be brought to the floor of the \nSenate for debate and amendment as a freestanding bill, not as a \nmassive rider to another bill, the appropriations bill. There ought to \nbe a debate about the important matters addressed by the Defense \nauthorization bill. Let there be amendments and let there be votes \nabout such important matters as health care benefits for National \nGuardsmen and about the war in Iraq.\n  The immediate question before the Senate is procedural in nature, but \nthe heart of the matter is whether the Senate will allow parliamentary \nmaneuvers to conduct an end run around how important legislation should \nbe considered on the floor of the Senate.\n  If the Defense authorization bill is attached to the Defense \nAppropriations Committee bill, these important and controversial \nmatters will not have a full hearing on the floor of the Senate. \nInstead, any changes that may be made to the Defense authorization bill \nwill only occur behind closed doors in a large, unwieldy conference \ncommittee. That is not the right place for debate on these important \nissues. These issues should first be debated on the floor of the Senate \nas they were on the floor of the House many months ago, but even more \nso because this is the forum for free speech--freedom of debate. The \nSenate should not be cutting corners on the legislative process because \nwhat ends up being cut out is the freedom of speech, freedom of debate, \nand freedom to amend.\n  It is also worth noting that the amendment now pending does not \nencompass all of the provisions of the Defense authorization bill. The \nsections of the bill that relate to military construction projects and \nnuclear weapons issues have been left out. Those are very important \nmatters, considering the base closure round that occurred this year and \nthe multitude of important matters relating to the thousands of nuclear \nweapons that the United States still possesses.\n  What would happen to these provisions of the Defense authorization \nbill? Would they be left in limbo or would they be slipped into a \nconference report in the dark of night, never to receive any debate on \nthe floor of the Senate? That is the wrong way to go.\n  I have very great affection for Senator Warner and Senator Levin. I \nserve on their committee, the Committee on Armed Services. They are \nknowledgeable and able leaders of the Armed Services Committee. But I \noppose this effort to attach the Defense authorization bill to the \nDefense Appropriations Committee bill. It is the wrong way to go, the \nwrong thing to do. It shortchanges debate. It shortchanges the American \npeople, in that they will not be fully informed as to what is in each \nbill. Their representatives, their elected representatives in this \nSenate, will not have had an opportunity to fully debate, to answer \nquestions, to ask questions, and to amend freely.\n  What is happening to the Senate? What is happening to the Senate, I \nask? What is happening to freedom of debate in the Senate? What is \nhappening to an orderly process, the legislative process by which the \nelected representatives of the people in the Senate have a full \nopportunity to debate, to ask questions?\n  Woodrow Wilson said the informing aspect was as important as the \nlegislating aspect of the Senate, the informing aspect. And debate \nbrings out information that the American people need and that they are \nentitled to.\n  So what is happening to this Senate? I think all Senators should stop \nand think about this question. Those of us who have been here many \nyears have seen the Senate when it was somewhat different than it is \ntoday. There was time to debate. We just weren't in session 3 days a \nweek and then gone; in 3 days a week, out 4 days a week, and the 3 days \na week often begin with a vote, which is kind of a bed-check vote at 6 \no'clock in the evening on Tuesday. So you have, really, nothing on \nTuesday but a bed-check vote anymore, and then Wednesday and Thursday. \nWhat a shame.\n  What is happening to the Senate? What is happening to this forum, \nthis forum of freedom of debate, freedom of speech, freedom to amend--\nwhat is happening to this Senate, and why?\n  I am sorry that the Senate is going in this direction. What is \nhappening? This institution has built its distinguished reputation, its \ndistinguished character on the principle of freedom to debate--freedom \nof debate, freedom of speech, freedom to amend.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for another \n5 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator, we are \nscheduled to start at 7:30, and 6 minutes before that was equally \ndivided between the Senator from Virginia and myself. So the Senator \nhas probably about 3 minutes that he could proceed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, if I could have 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Three more minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the Senate has begun to fall short on those important \nconstitutional principles. We have just a handful of votes each week \nand then the rush is on to get out that door, out that door, out this \ndoor here--get out. The rush is on to wrap up business on an artificial \ntimetable.\n  So what has happened to the Senate? The American people need to know.\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nWhy can't the Senate take the time for important debates on the \nimportant issues before our Nation. Our troops are at war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They are doing an outstanding service for our country. The \nSenate ought to give its undivided attention to each of the bills that \nrelate to our troops. If the members of the National Guard are able to \nput their lives on hold to go fight for our country overseas, then the \nSenate ought to be able to surely spare whatever time it takes to \ndebate the Defense appropriations bill and the Defense authorization \nbill as freestanding measures. America deserves that. Our troops \ndeserve that.\n  The Defense authorization bill ought to be brought up as a \nfreestanding measure so that the Senate may work its will on that \nlegislation. It should be open to debate and amendment. That is why I \noppose the motion on the defense of germaneness for the Warner-Levin \namendment. The Senate should not cut corners on the legislative \nprocess.\n  Therefore, I shall vote no on the motion on the defense of \ngermaneness, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.\n  Let's stand up for freedom of speech in this Senate, freedom of \ndebate, freedom to offer amendments. Let's do right by the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thought I had a unanimous consent to do \na series of modifications in the managers' package. I ask unanimous \nconsent I be able to proceed now for 10 minutes, to take care of this \nmanagers' package?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask if I might be given, as a matter \nof personal privilege, 2 minutes to respond to the statement of Senator \nMcCain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Does the Senator from \nAlaska so modify his request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. With the understanding that the Senator has 2 minutes, I \nthen have 10 minutes, and then the 6 minutes starts before the 7:30 \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has asked that \nI apologize for disparaging Captain Fishback in my earlier remarks. I \ndo not believe I did so in any way. The Captain has a distinguished \nrecord in the military. Nobody questions that.\n  I did note, however, that his allegations contained in the New York \nTimes article said that he had:\n\n     . . . seen at least one interrogation where prisoners were \n     being abused and was told about other ill treatment of \n     detainees by his sergeants.\n\n  In my statement I simply raised the question of what ``abuse'' meant \nprecisely, and whether, by implication, if this was a basis for a \ncharge, as the newspapers were making and others were, that there was \nsystematic abuse of prisoners--which I do not believe to be the case.\n  I did note that, when asked to name the individual sergeants who \nadmitted they had been misbehaving or that bad activities had occurred, \nhe refused to give those names.\n  If something is in error about that--I simply quoted from the New \nYork Times--I would be pleased to apologize. But I think those in this \nSenate who have accused the up-and-down members of the chain of command \nof the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marines, and Department of Defense of \npromoting policies to abuse prisoners, they ought to think about \nwhether they should apologize. I believe that accusation is false.\n  I thank the chairman and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2002; 1986, as Modified; 2028; 1906, as Modified; 1899, \n                     as Modified; and 2008, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have managers' package No. 3 before the \nSenate. This includes a Grassley amendment No. 2002 for the \nmultipurpose utility vehicle; a Voinovich amendment No. 1986 for the \nMillennium Gun System, as modified; a Graham amendment No. 2028 for \nmoldable armor; a Feingold amendment No. 1906 for civilian linguists, \nwhich contains a modification; an Akaka amendment No. 1899, transition \nassistance programs, which contains a modification; and a Cantwell \namendment No. 2008 for infrared countermeasures improvement.\n  I ask the Chair lay those amendments before the Senate for \nconsideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe amendments en bloc.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for their consideration, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object. I do \nnot know if I have seen that amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought the Senator had.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not object.

Mr. President, our military is first in the world, \nbecause of the quality and training of our personnel and because of the \ntechnological sophistication of our equipment and weaponry. A large \nportion of the best civilian scientific minds in the Defense Department \nare nearing retirement age.\n  I rise to thank my colleagues for their support and adoption of the \namendment Senator Collins and I offered to ensure that the Department \nmaintains the workforce that it needs to stay globally competitive and \ninvests in crucial research and development efforts.\n  Our amendment includes $10 million to double the committee's funding \nfor the Department's current SMART Scholars program, which is \nessentially an ROTC program for the agency's civilian scientists. This \nrepresents a $17.8 million increase over the $2.5 million funding level \nprovided last year--the program's first year in existence.\n  It increases by $30 million the Department's funding of basic \nresearch in science and technology, to ensure that its investment in \nthis field is maintained and our military technology remains the best \nin the world.\n  Our amendment provides sufficient funding for the full cost of \ncollege scholarships and graduate fellowships for approximately 100 \nscience, technology, engineering, and math students. It increases basic \nresearch in the Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, and National Defense \nEducation Program. It is supported by more than 60 of the most \nprestigious institutions of higher education in America.\n  Defense Department-sponsored research has resulted in stunningly \nsophisticated spy satellites, precision-guided munitions, stealth \nequipment, and advanced radar. The research has also generated new \napplications in the civilian economy. The best known example is the \nInternet, originally a DARPA project.\n  Advances in military technology often have their source in the work \nof civilian scientists in Department of Defense laboratories. \nUnfortunately, a large percentage of these scientists are nearing \nretirement. Today, nearly one in three DOD civilian science, technical, \nengineering, and mathematical employee is eligible to retire. In 7 \nyears, 70 percent will be of retirement age.\n  Another distressing fact is that the number of new scientists being \nproduced by our major universities at the doctoral level each year has \ndeclined by 4 percent over the last decade. Many of those who do \ngraduate are ineligible to work on sensitive defense matters, since \nmore than a third of all science and engineering doctorate degrees \nawarded at American universities go to foreign students.\n  It is unlikely that retiring DOD scientists will be replaced by \ncurrent private industry employees. According to the National Defense \nIndustrial Association, over 5,000 science and engineering positions \nare unfilled in private industry in defense-related fields.\n  The Nation confronts a major math and science challenge in elementary \nand secondary education and in higher education as well. We are tied \nwith Latvia for 28th in the industrialized world today in math math \neducation, and that is far from good enough. We have fallen from 3rd in \nthe world to 15th in producing scientists and engineers. Clearly, we \nneed a new National Defense Education Act of the size and scope passed \nnearly 50 years ago.\n  At the very least, however, the legislation before us needs to do \nmore to maintain our military's technological advantage. Last year, \nover 100 ``highly rated'' SMART Scholar applications were turned down \nbecause of insufficient funding. Our amendment has sufficient funds to \nsupport every one of those talented young people who want to learn and \nserve.\n  It also increases the investment in basic research in science and \ntechnology. Investments by DOD in science and technology through the \n1980s helped the United States win the cold war. But funding for basic \nresearch in the physical sciences, math and engineering has not kept \npace with research in other areas. Federal funding for life sciences \nhas risen fourfold since the 1980s. Over the same period, \nappropriations for the physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics \nhave remained essentially flat. Funding for basic research fell from \nfiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 2004 by more than 10 percent in real \nterms.\n  The Defense Science Board has recommended that funding for Science \nand Technology reach 3 percent of total defense spending, and the \nadministration and Congress have adopted this goal in the past. The \nboard also recommended that 2 percent of that amount be dedicated to \nbasic research. We must do better, and our amendment makes progress on \nthis issue.\n  I thank my colleagues for recognizing the importance of this \namendment and for their support in its adoption. I hope that we will \ncontinue to see similar increases in these programs in the future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1955\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 6 \nminutes equally divided before the Senate's consideration of the Warner \namendment. Senator Warner seeks a Senate vote on whether his amendment \nis germane to the bill. But before that occurs, it is my understanding \nthe leaders may want to use some of their leadership time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 6 minutes of debate divided on \nthe\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\ngermaneness of the Warner amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I shall divide my time equally with my \ncolleague Senator Levin, ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. President, the question of germaneness has already been, in a \nsense, ruled on by the Parliamentarians who said in their judgment it \nis germane. The question is simply do we or do we not at this time, \nwhen our Nation is at war, bring up on the appropriations bill section \nA of the authorization bill?\n  I simply say to my colleagues, I trust you--I trust you to look at \nthis extraordinary circumstance in which we are a nation at war, \nneeding this bill to send a message. And I trust you that the amendment \nprocess will not be abused and that we can in a reasonable period of \ntime accommodate those amendments that might be offered as second-\ndegree amendments, and that your bill can go forward with the vitally \nneeded appropriations funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the only way we are going to be able to \nconsider the Defense authorization bill, apparently, this year is if we \noffer this as an amendment and then amend it. You heard from the \nSenator from Alaska earlier today that this would open up the bill, the \nappropriations bill, to amendments, that they would be unlimited. We \nheard the opposite argument from our dear friend from West Virginia \nthat this would restrict amendments on the authorization. The only way \nwe are going to be able to have debate on amendments on the \nauthorization bill is if we consider the authorization bill now.\n  The leader, in his wisdom, pulled down the authorization bill when it \nwas pending. As far as I know, there is not a decision on his part to \nbring that authorization bill back to the floor. How I dearly wish we \ncould have a separate authorization bill. But we are not going to get \nit, except in this process.\n  It is amendable. I assure my friend from West Virginia that the only \nway we are going to debate the authorization bill on the floor of the \nSenate and offer amendments is if we follow this process. It is \namendable. It is debatable. It is free speech at its utmost. The \nalternative is the absence of debate on the authorization bill.\n  We have been able to clear about 100 amendments, plus. We do that in \nthe ordinary process. We do that every year on the authorization bill. \nWe try to accommodate our colleagues. We have gone through that \nprocess. There are another dozen or so amendments which we would have \nto consider that we know about.\n  Let us follow that process. There is so much in this bill that is \nneeded. There is a health provision in this bill and a lot of other \nprovisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying, very succinctly, \na vote against this issue of germaneness is not a vote against defense. \nThis is the Defense appropriations bill. It is meant to carry the money \nto the Department of Defense and all of those involved in defense. It \nis not meant to carry the authorization. That is what rule XVI is all \nabout. What we are looking at now is the Defense authorization bill \nbeing brought to this bill in part. This is not the whole bill. This is \njust part A; B and C were left out.\n  This is not going to finish debate on the authorization bill. It will \nonly take up a part of it. There are a whole series of amendments that \nhave been offered to the authorization bill, and, as a matter of fact, \nSenator Warner has offered now two packages of amendments that have \nbeen approved by himself and Senator Levin. But they have not been \nconsidered, as far as we are concerned, as amendments to the \nappropriations bill. But that is what they want. They want us to accept \ntheir portion of the bill plus their amendments to the bill without any \nconsideration for anybody. This is 108 amendments en bloc, not agreed \nto by the managers of this bill but agreed to by the would-be managers \nof the Defense authorization bill.\n  Offering the authorization bill to this bill without an agreement is \nan enormous precedent. I have been involved now 38 years, almost. It \nhas never happened in my career, that a bill was brought to the \nappropriations bill and offered and then subject to amendment.\n  Often, we have taken whole bills at times and taken them to \nconference. Even that has been objected to by some. But normally we \nhave taken omnibus bills. The authorizers are trying to make this an \nomnibus bill.\n\n  There are also other bills waiting in the wings that haven't been \nheard. What are we going to do with them if this process is to be \nfollowed?\n  But again, I want to note that a vote to find that this is germane--\nand I think I understand the question of what Senator Warner said about \nwhat the Parliamentarians have done.\n  I make a parliamentary inquiry: Has the Parliamentarian ruled that \nthis amendment is germane or just that it is subject to being found \ngermane by the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian has advised that the \nSenator may raise a defense of germaneness.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Defense of germaneness is available to the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is then submitted to the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A vote against this position of the Senator from \nVirginia would not be overturning the Chair, would it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What we have here is a situation where it is critical \nthat we finish this bill this week. Let me tell you why.\n  This bill is the supplemental appropriations bill for Defense for \nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on terror. We are in a \ncontinuing resolution period. There is no money in the continuing \nresolution for that part. I hope the Senate will understand that this \nauthorization bill has no place in this bill as a bill to become \namended by the processes of the Senate in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask to speak on leader time.\n  We will in a very few minutes be coming to a vote on the question of \ngermaneness on the Warner amendment. I want to take a few minutes to \ncomment on two issues. One is what we have been talking about over the \nlast 30 or 45 minutes; that is, the Defense authorization bill. And \nsecondly, I want to make a quick comment on the germaneness issue.\n  We heard the distinguished Senator from West Virginia argue very \nstrongly to have a freestanding Defense authorization bill come to the \nfloor, and that is the most appropriate way to handle that bill. I \nagree to that. In fact, we have tried to do that in the past. We spent \nabout 4 days on the floor, and at that time, because we had well over \n100 amendments, took it off the floor to be addressed at some point in \nthe future.\n  We heard from the Senator from Michigan saying the only way that we \nbelieve we can deal with this is by offering it as an amendment, which \nhas been done to the appropriations bill. I want to make it very clear \nI disagree with that.\n  First, Defense appropriations: I think the appropriate way of dealing \nwith this very important bill is to have it as a freestanding piece of \nlegislation. As I mentioned, we have attempted to do that in the past, \nand I have been trying very hard to do that over the last couple of \nweeks. We had an offer on the floor that both the Democratic leader and \nthe chairman and ranking member are well aware of, as most Members in \nour caucus are; that is, we would bring the Defense authorization bill \nto the floor as a freestanding bill, with 12 amendments to either side \nwith second-degree amendments allowed under a time agreement.\n  Those amendments we have asked to be related or within the \njurisdiction of that particular committee. That is what we have been \nworking with. We have been waiting and working all day. We have for the \nlast about 8 or 9 days been waiting for a response from the other side \nof the aisle. I understand the other side of the aisle cannot agree \nwith that unanimous consent request. I do propound it, in large part, \nto let all of our colleagues know we have been working on it, and we \nfeel strongly\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nthere is a way to bring this Defense authorization bill up freestanding \nwith appropriate amendments.\n\n  With that, I will, at this point in time, propound that unanimous \nconsent to make this clear. I ask consent, when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1042, the Defense authorization bill, it be \nconsidered under the following limitations. All of the pending \namendments be withdrawn and the bill be considered as follows: The only \nfirst-degree amendments in order be up to 12 amendments to be offered \nby the two leaders or their designees; provided further that the \namendments be within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed \nServices and that these amendments be subject to second degrees, which \nare to be relevant to the amendment to which they have offered; \nprovided further that the first-degree amendments be limited to 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form, with any second degrees \nlimited to 30 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  I further ask that there then be 2 hours of general debate on the \nbill divided between the two managers; provided further that the \namendments be offered on a rotating basis, and if an amendment is not \navailable at the conclusion of the previous amendment, then the \namendment no longer be in order.\n  Finally, I ask consent, at the expiration of that time and the \ndisposition of the above amendments, the bill be read the third time \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on the passage of the bill as amended, \nif amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Of course, I am going to object, but I want to use some of \nmy leader time to talk about the travesty before the Senate at this \ntime.\n  The Committee on Armed Services completed their work on this bill \naround the 1st of May, give or take a day or two. For 5 months, we have \nbeen trying to get this bill to the floor. For Members to cry crocodile \ntears that this might take an extra day or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, we need \nonly look at the history of the Senate.\n  I heard the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia. I agree with \nhim. Can anyone imagine the Senate not having time to do the Defense \nauthorization bill? We have men and women, as we speak, being shot at \ndriving down roads and darkened streets in Iraq not knowing if they \nwill make it home--because of a roadside bomb--home to their billet for \nthat evening.\n  We have almost 2,000 men and women who have been killed in Iraq. We \nhave had 15 to 20,000 wounded. Shouldn't we take a little time to talk \nabout the work done by the duly constituted committee of the Senate, \nthe Committee on Armed Services, take a look at what we need to do on a \npolicy basis?\n  I am a proud member of the Committee on Appropriations. I have been \non this committee since the day I got here. I am proud of it. It is the \nbest committee in the Senate. But the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations does not run everything around here. Other committees \nwork as hard as we do and have the right to have the matters they work \non in committee heard.\n  We have devoted basically one day to this bill. It was pulled because \nof gun liability.\n  Now, in years past, we have worked our way through this. It has not \nbeen easy, but we have done it. The 10-year average: in the last 10 \nyears, we have averaged 133 amendments, and we have averaged 14 \nrollcalls per bill. Why? Because we have had the same managers for a \nlong time. They know how to work through these amendments. There is \nsome give-and-take and some unhappy people, but we respect these two \nmen. We work our way through it. That is the way it has been for 10 \nyears.\n  The average for hours of debate on this bill is 47\\1/4\\ hours. We \nhave spent as much as 88 hours. When did we do that? Last year. We \nspent 88 hours on this bill last year. We had 196 amendments.\n  The point I make is that the real issue here--my two dear friends, \nthe senior Senator from Virginia and the senior Senator from Michigan, \nthink it is defense matters. It is not. It is Katrina. That is what it \nis about. We want to have a vote on an independent bipartisan \ncommission to figure out what went wrong down in the gulf coast. We \nhave not been allowed to have a vote on that. All we want is a vote. \nThe only way we can do it is have a bill of substance, not one on an \nappropriations bill, so we can offer the amendment.\n  So this is a system that works just fine. The Senate was not set up \nto be convenient. It was not set up to have short periods of time to \nwork. It was set up to do the business of this country. It has worked \npretty well for more than 200 years.\n  One of the things we have traditionally done in time of war or peace \nis the Defense authorization bill.\n  So here it is, I have been to this floor I don't know how many times, \nbut many, many times since last May, saying, Let's do a defense \nauthorization bill. I can remember talking about one of my trips to the \nhospital and seeing the people in bed and how I felt I owed them \nsomething to come here and ask for time to hear their views. And they \nhave views as to what is good and bad in Iraq. I have been here many \ntimes. I have added up weeks with the ranking member trying to get some \nway to the floor. And here at this time of night, as we are winding \nthings down, we get a unanimous consent request that everyone knows is \ngoing to be objected to.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia pretty well knows how to express \nhimself. He may come from coal-mining families. He may have been an \norphan. But he knows how to talk. He explained in very good detail why \nwe cannot have the Senate run similar to the House of Representatives.\n  I want the record to reflect that the Defense authorization bill \nshould have been debated a long time ago. We are ready to debate it any \ntime. We are willing to enter into time agreements on amendments, but \nto come here tonight and say we are going to do 12 amendments, does \nanybody object--what I should have done is not object and have that \nside of the aisle watch them go to the ceiling. They would not like it \neither.\n  I am standing here and saying, I not only object, I object 1,000 \ntimes, until we get back to being Senators and doing things the way we \nhave done.\n  The number of amendments, 196 last year. We spent 16 days on it; in \n2003, 5 days, 75 amendments; back in 1997, 8 days, 120 amendments, 44 \nhours. Couldn't we spend a little bit of time on this bill?\n  The answer is, no, we are going to do the appropriations bill.\n  I know appropriations. As I have said, I have been on the committee \nfor a long time. But as much as I love my committee assignment--it is \nthe only committee I have anymore; I gave them all up with this job, \nbut I love the Committee on Appropriations. I repeat, there are other \ncommittees that are as important as the Committee on Appropriations. \nThe problem is, we have strict rules of how appropriations bills are \nhandled, for obvious reasons.\n  I want the record to reflect I do my best, and sometimes that is not \ngood enough, to be a partner with my friend, the majority leader. I \ndon't want this statement I make to reflect on him personally. I am \ntalking about the process that comes about as a result of him being a \nleader. I don't like the process. I think we could have done it better. \nI think we should have done this bill. I could be wrong, but I say to \nmy chair and my distinguished friend, I think the only amendment we \nhave had in this is one dealing with Boy Scouts--four others--and that \nwas offered by the distinguished majority leader. I know it is well-\nintentioned, but I don't think it had much to do with the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Let's let the record reflect I object. I object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the objection we heard was to a unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. REID. I have a unanimous consent request that I should have made, \nthat we resume consideration of Defense authorization upon disposition \nof the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the unanimous consent I propounded that was \nobjected to by the other side is exactly what we have been working on \nthe last couple of weeks. It did say we would have a freestanding bill \nto bring a very important bill to the floor. We have spent several \ndays, I believe 4 days, on\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\nthat bill in the past. I had 24 amendments, 12 to either side, plus \nsecond-degree amendments, of which there is no limit for. But it was \nobjected to.\n  We will continue to work in that regard because I believe at some \npoint we will be able to address that bill. What we will vote on, in \nhopefully a couple of minutes, is the germaneness of the Warner \namendment, the authorization bill. The real challenge is if this bill \nis ruled germane, it will bog down what we are trying to do. There can \nbe an endless number of amendments that are attached if it is germane; \n130 have been filed. There would be unlimited second-degree amendments \nthat could be applied toward the Warner amendment if that is found to \nbe germane.\n  The appropriate way to deal with the Warner amendment is as a \nfreestanding authorization bill. I agree with Senator Warner. We need \nto do that, and we will work toward that in the future. I am \ndisappointed the other side will not allow us to do it as a \nfreestanding bill. Institutionally, if we start taking the huge \nauthorization bills and start dumping them into the appropriations \nbill, the appropriations process, which is already difficult enough, is \ngoing do come to a grinding halt.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to vote that the Warner amendment be \nnot germane, joining the chairman and the ranking Member of the bill as \nwell as Senator Byrd, that this is not germane, and if it is not \ngermane, it will allow us to continue on with the Defense \nappropriations bill in a disciplined way to complete, hopefully, by the \nend of Friday.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Amendment No. 1933 offered by the Senator from \nIndiana. There will be 6 minutes evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation under the \nfiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, under the previous order, this is a 10-\nminute vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, Senator Kennedy, for \nhis steadfast support of this amendment. I thank our colleague, Senator \nStevens, both for his courtesy at this moment and also because while we \nmay have a substantive disagreement about this amendment, I know his \nheart is in the right place.\n  This amendment ensures that our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will \nhave the equipment they need to accomplish their mission while keeping \nthem out of harm's way. In deciding how to vote, I ask my colleagues to \nconsider three things. First, the lesson of Katrina and regrettably the \nlesson of Iraq is that our Nation, when lives are at stake, must always \nplan for the worst, even as we hope for the best. Unfortunately, this \nhas not happened in Iraq. On the contrary, our Armed Forces have \nconsistently underestimated the need for armored vehicles in that \ntheater of war. Nine times they have underestimated the need. They are \nno longer entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Regrettably, Walter \nReed Army Hospital and other military hospitals are filled with the \nconsequences of these errors. Let us not make that mistake again.\n  I ask my colleagues to recall the image of that brave soldier who \nstood up in a conversation with our Secretary of Defense, complaining \nabout what he referred to as ``hillbilly'' armor, talking about our \nbrave troops having to search through garbage dumps for the ability to \ndefend themselves from hostile attack. We owe them better than that. \nBetter than that is exactly what this amendment will provide. I ask for \nSenators' favorable consideration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague once \nagain, Senator Bayh, in sponsoring this amendment, No. 1933, which \nincreases funding for the procurement of armored Tactical Wheeled \nVehicles for the Army.\n  Together, Senator Bayh and I have worked very hard together to make \nsure our soldiers have what they need. In April of this year, the \nSenate added $150 million for additional armored vehicles in the Iraq \nSupplemental.\n  Now we want to work together to keep our troops in the field properly \nequipped and also make sure they have the proper equipment on hand at \nhome to train with prior to going overseas. The money in this amendment \nwill make sure that the Army's pre-positioned stocks are re-constituted \nafter over 2\\1/2\\ years at war.\n  There are also funds for the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort \nPolk, LA. The Joint Readiness Training Center provides advance level \njoint training for the Army's Active and Reserve Component, Air Force \nand Navy forces. The training they receive simulates what they will \nface when deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This issue has been divisive for far too long. All of us support our \ntroops. We obviously want to do all we can to see that they have proper \nequipment,\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\nvehicles, and everything else they need to protect their lives and \ncarry out their missions.\n  It's scandalous that the administration has kept sending them into \nbattle year after year in Iraq without adequate equipment. It's \nscandalous that desperate parents and wives here at home have had to \nresort to Wal-Mart to try to buy armor and mail it to their loved ones \nin Iraq to protect them on the front lines. Secretary Rumsfeld has \nrarely been more humiliated than on his visit to Iraq last December, \nwhen a soldier had the courage to ask him why the troops had to \nscavenge scrap metal on the streets to protect themselves. The cheer \nthat roared out from troops when he asked question said it all.\n  More than 400 troops have already died in military vehicles \nvulnerable to roadside bombs, grenades, and other notorious improvised \nexplosive devices.\n  Many of us have visited soldiers at Walter Reed and Bethesda and seen \nthe tragic consequences of inadequate armor. We want to ensure that \nparents grieving at Arlington National Cemetery no longer ask, ``Why \nweren't more armored humvees available?''\n  It's taken far too long to solve this problem. We have to make sure \nwe solve it now, once and for all. We can't keep hoping the problem \nwill somehow go away.\n  In a letter last October 20, General Abizaid said, ``The FY 2004 \nSupplemental Request will permit the services to rapidly resolve many \nof the equipment issues you mentioned to include the procurement of . . \n. Humvees.''\n  We have been told for months that the Army's shortage of Up-Armored \nHumvees was a thing of the past. The Army could have, and should have, \nmoved much more quickly to correct the problem. As retired General Paul \nKern, who headed the Army Materiel Command until last November, said, \n``. . . It took too long to materialize.'' He said, ``In retrospect, if \nI had it to do all over, I would have just started building up-armored \nHumvees. The most efficient way would have been to build a single \nproduction line and feed everything into it.''\n  In April, GAO released a report that clearly identifies the struggles \nthe Pentagon has faced. In August 2003, only fifty-one Up-Armored \nHumvees were being produced a month. It took the industrial base a year \nand a half to work up to making 400 a month. Now the Army says they can \nnow get delivery of 550 a month. The question is, why did it take so \nlong? Why did we go to war without the proper equipment? Why didn't we \nfix it sooner, before so many troops have died?\n  According to GAO, there are two primary causes for the shortage of \nup-armored vehicles and add-on-armor kits.\n  First, a decision was made to ramp-up production gradually rather \nthan use the maximum available capacity.\n  Second, funding allocations did not keep up with rapidly increasing \nrequirements. Obviously, the Pentagon was still being influenced by its \ncakewalk mentality.\n  The GAO report specifically states that Pentagon decision-makers set \nthe rate at which both up-armored Humvees and armor kits would be \nproduced, and did not tell Congress about the total available \nproduction capacity. GAO was unable to determine what criteria were \nused to set the rate of production. In both cases, additional \nproduction capacity was available, particularly for the kits.\n  The delay was unconscionable. Without this amendment, the production \nrate of Up-armored humvees could drop off again later this year. We \nneed to guarantee that we are doing everything possible to get the \nprotection to our troops as soon as possible. We owe it to them, to \ntheir families here at home and to the American people.\n  We need to make sure our troops overseas have the best equipment \navailable to protect them in combat. They also need to have the same \nequipment to train with at the Joint Readiness Center and the money in \nthis amendment will ensure that happens.\n  The amendment contributes significantly to this goal, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on a recent trip to Iraq, we saw the up-\narmoring taking place in country. They are doing it now in specially \ncreated circumstances there. But beyond that, we have funded the total \ncapacity of the plants in the United States to produce up-armor. We \nhave done everything we can. If we can find additional capacity, we \nhave another supplemental coming in the spring, we will join the \nSenator in urging more money. But we have used every dollar we can for \nup-armoring in the plants and in facilities. You should see the Oshkosh \nplant over there. They are up-armoring trucks and all sorts of vehicles \nnow in country.\n  I urge the Senate to understand this amendment is duplicative. We \nalready provided the maximum amount before us that we can possibly \nspend with the existing capacity of the system now, $240 million for \nhumvees, $150 million for the Army tactical wheeled vehicle. In \naddition to that, we are sending strikers now. We visited strikers in \nthe Mosul area. They are enormous systems, and they are already \narmored. They don't have to be up-armored. We need more strikers, more \narmored vehicles, but we are doing the best we can. And we are using \nevery bit of capacity the system has. This amendment will be \nduplicative of that funding.\n  I oppose the Senator's amendment despite my admiration for him and \ninsistence that we do the maximum possible in armoring our vehicles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Bayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank my colleague from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 1933.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What is now the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 6 minutes evenly divided before \na vote with respect to the McCain amendment No. 1977.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, war is an awful enterprise and I know \nthat. I do not think I am naive about how severe are the wages of war \nand how terrible are the things that must be done to wage it \nsuccessfully. It is a grim, dark business, and no matter how noble the \ncause for which it is fought, no matter how valued their service, many \nveterans spend much of their subsequent lives trying to forget not only \nwhat was done to them and their comrades but some of what had to be \ndone by their hand to prevail.\n  I do not mourn the loss of any terrorist's life, nor do I care if in \nthe course of serving their noble cause they suffered great harm. They \nhave pledged their lives to the intentional destruction of innocent \nlives, and they have earned their terrible punishment in this life and \nthe next.\n  What I do regret, what I do mourn, and what I do care very much about \nis what we lose, what we, the American service man and woman, and the \ngreat Nation they defend at the risk of their lives, when by official \npolicy or by official negligence we allow, confuse, or encourage our \nsoldiers to forget that the best sense of ourselves, that which is our \ngreatest strength, that we are different and better than our enemies, \nthat we fight for an idea, not a tribe, not a land, not a king, not a \ntwisted interpretation of an ancient religion but for an idea that all \nmen are created equal and endowed by their Creator with inalienable \nrights.\n  I have been asked before where did the brave men I was privileged to \nserve with in Vietnam draw the strength to resist to the best of their \nability the cruelties inflicted on them by our enemies? Well, they drew \nstrength from our faith in each other, from our faith in God, and from \nour faith in our country.\n  Our enemies did not adhere to the Geneva Convention. Many of my \ncomrades were subjected to very cruel, very inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment, a few of them even unto death. But every single one of us \nknew and took great strength from the belief that we were different \nfrom our enemies, that we were better than them, that if the roles were \nreversed, we would not disgrace ourselves by committing or \ncountenancing such mistreatment of them. That faith was indispensable \nnot only to our survival but to our attempts to return home with honor. \nMany of the men I served with would have preferred death to such \ndishonor.\n  The enemies we fight today hold such liberal notions in contempt as \nthey hold in contempt the international conventions that enshrine them, \nsuch as the Geneva Conventions and the Treaty on Torture. I know that. \nBut we are better than them, and we are stronger for our faith, and we \nwill prevail.\n  I submit to my colleagues that it is indispensable to our success in \nthis war that our service men and women know that in the discharge of \ntheir dangerous responsibilities to their country they are never \nexpected to forget that they are Americans and the valiant defenders of \na sacred idea of how nations should govern their own affairs and their \nrelations with others, even our enemies.\n  Those who return to us and those who give their lives for us are \nentitled to that honor. Those of us who have given them this onerous \nduty are obliged by our history and by the sacrifices, the many \nterrible sacrifices, that they have made in our defense. We are obliged \nto make clear to them that they need not risk their honor or their \ncountry's honor to prevail; that through the violence, chaos, and \nheartache of war, through deprivation and cruelty and loss, they are \nalways Americans, and different, better, and stronger than those who \nwould destroy us. God bless them as He has blessed us with their \nservice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on leader time. I thank \nSenator McCain for his efforts on this very important issue that we \nhave been debating, talking about, and focusing upon for a long period \nof time. It is an important matter that affects both our American \nreputation abroad and the conduct of our military personnel in this \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  It is important to state that the performance of American \nservicemembers in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere around the globe has \nbeen outstanding, has been inspiring, and truly representative of the \nbest our Nation has to offer. This amendment strives to establish \nuniform standards for the interrogation of prisoners and detainees as a \nmeans for helping ensure our service men and women are well trained, \nwell briefed, knowledgeable of their legal, professional, and moral \nduties and obligations. Therefore, I fully support the purpose and \nintent of this amendment, and although I understand it may require some \nfine-tuning to prevent any unintended consequences, I do intend to vote \nfor it with that in mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am compelled to speak in opposition to this amendment, \nalthough I wholeheartedly agree with what the Senator from Arizona has \nsaid. It was a marvelous statement made by a man who has every reason \nto say exactly what he said. I support what the majority leader has \nsaid, but there is a classified annex to the Army Field Manual that is \nnot spelled out in this amendment, and there are people who are not in \nuniform who may not even be citizens of the United States who represent \nus in very strange and dangerous places, whose lives may be put in \njeopardy by the process that is spelled out in part of this amendment. \nI speak for them.\n  I honor all service men and women, and I really believe they should \nabsolutely follow the lifestyle of the Senator from Arizona, as well as \nhis statement tonight. But as the leader has said, there are some \nchanges that have to be made if we are to be faithful to those people \nwho live in the classified world and will be covered by the classified \nannex that, if one reads the amendment, is not covered here.\n  I have to do my best to make sure that when we get to conference \npeople understand that there is that problem. Therefore, I shall oppose \nthe amendment and try to straighten it out in conference. I know it \nwould pass.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1977.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

We may have to have our \ncloture vote after adjournment at about 11:55. We would vote about \n12:55 or 1:05 on cloture. Because if we are to have 30 hours and still \nfinish by the time some people want to leave on Friday, it has to start \nat that time or else we have to get unanimous consent to shorten the \ntime. If we vote tomorrow morning at 10, we will be here until 6 \no'clock or 7 o'clock Friday afternoon. Just a warning--not yet. We are \nstill trying to work it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment would prohibit for 1 year \nthe transfer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend for a moment. The \nSenate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would prohibit, for 1 year, \nthe transfer of $23 million in cash to the Government of Uzbekistan.\n  Just this year, the government of President Islam Karimov has taken a \nnumber of actions so alarming, that one would think this body would be \nconsidering sanctions, not how to transfer millions of taxpayer dollars \nto this government.\n  In May, the government massacred up to 1,000 people, mostly unarmed \nmen, women, and children protesting the government's corruption, lack \nof opportunity, and continued oppression. The government has rejected \nall calls for an independent international inquiry and blamed a foreign \nconspiracy for the protest. It even placed blame on the United States \nfor the events, saying that rebels received money from the U.S. embassy \nin Tashkent.\n  The Uzbek government launched a campaign of anti-American propaganda \nafter its massacre, staging rallies to denounce the United States. \nPresident Karimov suggested that the U.S. was behind not just the event \nin Andijan but also served as the ``scriptwriters and directors'' of \nthe ``colored revolutions'' in other countries.\n  In July, Karimov's government announced that the U.S. will no longer \nhave access to the K2 base in Uzbekistan, and evicted all U.S. troops \nfrom the country. In addition, his government has terminated \ncounterterrorism cooperation with the United States.\n  This week the EU announced that it will impose sanctions against \nUzbekistan. But the Pentagon wants to send $23 million to pay past \nbills. Paying our bills is important. But more important is America \nstanding up for itself; avoiding the misimpression that we overlook \nmassacres; and avoiding cash transfers to the treasury of a dictator \njust months after he permanently evicts American soldiers from his \ncountry.\n  We should postpone the cash payment to the Government of Uzbekistan \nfor 1 year, at which point the Congress can decide whether to renew the \nprohibition or make the payment. If it had not been authorization, I \nwould have said until a complete and thorough investigation of the \nmassacre was conducted.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I ask the Senator from Arizona, would he allow us to \nadopt this by voice vote?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be pleased.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senate proceed to consider this by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to vitiating the yeas and \nnays?\n  Without objection, the yeas and nays are vitiated.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1978) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending business.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2033\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Kerry \namendment No. 2033. A motion to table has been made. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will permit me to do so, \nsection 402 of the House Concurrent Resolution 95 of the 109th \nCongress, the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution budget, created a \npoint of order against an emergency designation on nondefense spending.\n  The amendment contains nondefense spending with an emergency \ndesignation.\n  Pursuant to that section 402 of S. Con. Res. 95 of the 108th \nCongress, the fiscal year 2005 concurrent resolution on the budget, I \nmake a point of order against the emergency designation contained in \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, wasn't there an order already in place for \nthe motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. KERRY. Wasn't there an order already in place for the motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would take precedence over the point of \norder.\n  Mr. KERRY. I believe that is accurate. I ask for the yeas and nays, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: If the motion is not tabled, it \nis still subject to a point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order can be made.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Collins, Byrd, Obama, and Salazar be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment is an emergency response to \nthe natural gas shortage and crisis that has raised prices all across \nthe country. In the South, there has been a 17-percent increase in \nelectricity costs. In the Midwest, there has been a 69-percent natural \ngas increase. And in New England, the heating oil prices have gone up \n29 percent. The industry tells us that there will be an average of a \n$600 increase per family. For people on fixed incomes, when you add \nthat to the cost of tuition increases, gasoline increases, and health \ncare increases, it is unaffordable.\n  The National Energy Assistance directorate has told us that 39 \npercent of those individuals in the country who are low income went \nwithout medical care in order to be able to pay those bills. Twenty \npercent didn't pay their rent or their mortgage.\n  I ask colleagues to approve this $3.1 billion emergency LIHEAP \nallocation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sadly, the gap between rich and poor has \nbeen widening in our society. The number of persons living in poverty \nin the Nation has increased from 31 million in 2000 to 37 million \ntoday, including 13 million children. Two main parts of the problem are \nthat wages are stagnant, and the long-term unemployment rate is at \nhistoric levels. After Hurricane Katrina revealed the plight of \nminorities, the ``silent slavery of poverty is not so silent any \nmore.''\n  For many, the American dream has turned into a nightmare. Families \nstay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet. Parents wonder how \nthey will feed their children and pay their bills.\n  Significant numbers of Americans live year-round with the constant \nthreat of power shut-offs because they can't pay their energy bills, \nand there is no relief in sight. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, energy prices are likely to continue to increase.\n  The outlook for the coming winter is bleak. Heating oil will probably \ncost a third more than the already high prices Americans paid last \nyear. Families who use natural gas to heat their homes will also pay \nmore. The average 2005 price for residential natural gas is estimated \nto be 21 percent higher than it was in 2004.\n  These are not just abstract numbers. They represent real burdens on \nreal\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\npeople. Minorities, the elderly, and the disabled, and many others are \nforced to make painful choices between heating their homes and paying \nfor food, healthcare, and rent. The good news is that a highly \nsuccessful Federal program is available to prevent the poorest of poor \nfrom making impossible tradeoffs. LIHEAP grants money to low-income \nfamilies who can't afford the steep cost of energy. The number of \nAmerican households receiving LIHEAP assistance has increased from over \n4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year, the highest level in 10 \nyears.\n  Ninety-four percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one member who \nis elderly, disabled, a child under the age of 18, or is a single \nparent with a young child. Seventy-seven percent of LIHEAP recipients \nreport an annual income at or below $20,000 and 61 percent of \nrecipients have annual incomes at or below the Federal poverty line.\n  The bad news is that these fortunate recipients comprise only 18 \npercent of the eligible population. In Massachusetts, the participation \nrate is 22 percent, which is still unacceptably low.\n  Last year in Worcester, the city's Community Action Council provided \nfuel assistance to 9,660 households, but it processed applications for \nalmost 11,000 households before the funds ran out. Many of the unserved \nhouseholds were made up of the working poor, the elderly, the disabled, \nand children.\n  In Franklin and Hampshire counties in Massachusetts, over 6,000 \nLIHEAP applications were processed. The Franklin Community Action \nCorporation reported that emergency applications and payment requests \nincreased this past winter. They told me that this was by far their \nmost stressful year.\n  Across the United States, families are suffering from high energy \nprices. There are far too many stories of families that were eligible \nto receive LIHEAP, but didn't because the money just wasn't there. Here \nare just a few examples.\n  A single father just lost his job on June 15 and has three children. \nHis electric bill was $117.33, but he is unable to pay it because he \nisn't receiving unemployment compensation, or any other income. He is \nlooking for work every day. Even if he is hired soon, his electricity \nmay be turned off before he gets his first paycheck.\n  A grandmother taking care of three grandchildren, ages 14, 11, 5 had \nan electric bill for $195. Her monthly income is $904. The house is \ntotally electric, so the bills will probably be going higher. The \ngrandmother also has extra medical expenses, but she too was turned \naway.\n  It is wrong to let people like this suffer. So how does the \nRepublican leadership in Congress respond? By cutting or freezing funds \nfor essential low income programs.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita upended the lives of millions of citizens \nin the Gulf region, and the administration was right to release \nemergency energy funds for the areas that were devastated. But, their \nresponse to the looming energy crisis is far less.\n  The administration and the House of Representatives closed their eyes \nto the needs of the poor. The House sent the Senate a continuing \nresolution which froze funding for the LIHEAP program. The current \nfunding obviously isn't enough. Nineteen percent of current LIHEAP \nrecipients say they keep their home at a temperature they feel is \nunsafe or unhealthy. Eight percent of recipients report that their \nelectricity or gas was shut off in the past year for nonpayment.\n  The continuing resolution also cut the Community Services Block Grant \nby 50 percent. These funds are used by many community action agencies \nto administer the LIHEAP program.\n  According to ABCD, a community action agency in Massachusetts, since \nthe outreach and application process for LIHEAP is handled through the \nABCD neighborhood network, funding cuts will mean that access to this \ncritical survival resource will shrink by more than 70 percent. Up to \n10,500 households--out of a current total of 15,000 recipients--may not \nget their benefits.\n  Those in Congress who care about this issue sent an urgent request to \nthe President to increase the funds, but our request has gone \nunanswered. In a news conference earlier this week, a reporter asked \nEnergy Secretary Bodman if the administration plans to ask Congress for \nmore funds for assistance for low-income families and seniors. \nSecretary Bodman replied, ``At least at this point in time, that's not \non the agenda.''\n  The administration may not think the needs of the poor deserve to be \non their agenda, but the States do. They are trying to do their part. \nIn Massachusetts, State legislators want to add $20 million in State \nfunds to LIHEAP, to supplement Federal funds.\n  Governors are stepping forward to acknowledge the problem. A \nbipartisan group of 28 Governors, led by Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, \nand Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, recently sent a letter to Congress \nurging additional emergency funds for LIHEAP. They know the importance \nof this issue first hand, and so should we.\n  Congress needs to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling \nto make ends meet. We have the ability to tell the elderly, and the \ndisabled, and many others that we have heard them, and that we won't \nleave them shivering in the cold this winter. LIHEAP provides a \ncritical service to desperate families who have nowhere else to turn \nfor basic energy help, and LIHEAP is indispensable in filling that \nneed. I strongly support this amendment to increase these emergency \nfunds. We can't shortchange LIHEAP and all the people who need our help \nthe most. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, because we had a time agreement that gave \neach side time before a vote, the point of order I made is subject to \nthat time agreement, as I understand it. But now we will be faced with \ntwo votes. Does the Senator wish to have two votes on this amendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am happy to change the order to serve the \npurposes of the Senate.\n  Pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95, which is the concurrent \nresolution on the budget, I move to waive section 402 for the purposes \nof the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate \nthe vote to table and that we proceed on the motion to waive the point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 250 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka \n     Baucus\n     Bayh \n     Biden \n     Bingaman \n     Boxer \n     Byrd \n     Cantwell \n     Chafee \n     Clinton \n     Coleman \n     Collins \n     Conrad \n     Dayton \n     DeWine \n     Dodd \n     Dorgan \n     Durbin \n     Feingold \n     Feinstein\n     Harkin \n     Jeffords \n     Johnson \n     Kennedy \n     Kerry \n     Kohl \n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg \n     Leahy \n     Levin \n     Lieberman \n     Lincoln \n     Lugar \n     Mikulski \n     Murray \n     Nelson (FL) \n     Obama \n     Pryor \n     Reed \n     Reid \n     Rockefeller \n     Salazar \n     Santorum \n     Sarbanes \n     Schumer \n     Snowe \n     Specter \n     Stabenow \n     Talent \n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander \n     Allard \n     Allen \n     Bennett \n     Bond \n     Brownback \n     Bunning \n     Burns \n     Burr \n     Carper \n     Chambliss \n     Coburn \n     Cochran \n     Cornyn \n     Craig \n     Crapo \n     DeMint \n     Dole \n     Domenici \n     Ensign \n     Enzi \n     Frist \n     Graham \n     Grassley \n     Gregg \n     Hagel \n     Hatch \n     Hutchison \n     Inhofe \n     Inouye \n     Isakson \n     Kyl \n     Lott \n     Martinez \n     McCain \n     McConnell \n     Murkowski \n     Nelson (NE) \n     Roberts \n     Sessions \n     Shelby \n     Smith \n     Stevens \n     Sununu \n     Thomas \n     Thune \n     Vitter \n     Voinovich \n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this question, the yeas are 50, the nays \nare 49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S11117]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding rule XXII, the \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture occur following the last scheduled \nvote in this sequence, with the mandatory live quorum waived.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I want the record spread \nwith my appreciation to the Senators from Louisiana for allowing the \nSenate to move forward. We were going to work through the night and \nearly in the morning to come up with something that would help satisfy \ntheir tremendous needs. I appreciate their cooperation so we do not \nhave to be here at 1 o'clock in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. For the information of our colleagues, what this means is \nwe will vote on the Stabenow amendment next. Immediately following \nthat, we will go to the cloture vote. Following that, there will be no \nmore rollcall votes tonight.\n  Throughout tomorrow we will have plenty of opportunity for \ndiscussion, for debate. We will be voting throughout tomorrow, as well. \nThere will be no more rollcall votes after the Stabenow vote and \ncloture vote tonight which will immediately follow the Stabenow vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I announce we will have a managers' package. We will \nconsider amendments that might be taken by voice vote after this last \nscheduled vote.\n  I have already made the point of order against the Stabenow \namendment. To be sure the record is clear, I make the point of order \nagainst the Kerry amendment and I ask it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The emergency designation has been stricken \nfrom the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the record clear I made the point of order on the \nStabenow amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inform the Senator an \nemergency point of order has been stricken from--we are still on the \nKerry amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And I asked it be dropped, now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained under the \nBudget Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1937\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, is the record clear about my making a point of \norder to the Stabenow amendment? If not, I renew the point of order \nunder 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. The amendment requires \nspending in excess of the committee's 302(b) allocation for the fiscal \nyear concurrent resolution of the Budget, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for the \npurpose of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask colleagues to support the \nStabenow-Johnson-Thune amendment that guarantees funding for our \nveterans for health care. It takes it out of the annual appropriations \nprocess where every year we are wrestling with whether the funding is \navailable. This year alone already we have had one emergency \ndesignation of $1.5 billion because the veterans health care budget was \nunderfunded this year. We know there are concerns about next year.\n  This amendment would do two things. First, the legislation provides \nan annual discretionary amount that would be locked in for future years \nat the 2005 funding level. Then in the future, the VA would receive a \nsum of mandatory funding that would be adjusted year to year based on \nchanges in demand from the VA health care system as well as rate of \ninflation.\n  This is incredibly important. We should not be arbitrarily picking \nnumbers in terms of funding veterans health care. It should be based on \nthe brave men and women who have served who come on home and put on a \nveteran's cap. We have more and more coming home from Afghanistan and \nIraq every day. Each and every one of them has been promised health \ncare. The way to guarantee we keep our promise is to pass this \namendment.\n  I urge agreement.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, our veterans deserve all a grateful nation \ncan give them. Over the last 6 years we have increased the Veterans \nbudget by over $3 billion a year. Although the Senator from Michigan is \nright about the dustup this year, we still did it because America is \ngrateful for those who serve in harm's way.\n  While all veterans are entitled, should we start a new entitlement \nprogram, one that is now out of control, that we cannot monitor on a \nyearly basis as we do through the appropriating process and the \nauthorizing process? The Senator is proposing a new entitlement \nprogram. But she is also saying something else. She is not saying those \nwho served is the baseline of the formula. She is saying those who are \nentitled. And there is a very real difference between those who are \nentitled and eligible versus those who seek service because of need. We \npay for those who seek service based on their eligibility. We do not \ncreate a new entitlement program.\n  Ask yourselves, do you want to create a new entitlement program or do \nyou want to do what we are doing now, providing the necessary resources \non an annual basis to meet the needs of America's veterans?\n  I ask Members to vote no. Do not waive the Budget Act. Do not create \na new entitlement program and basically take it out of the hands of the \nCongress and put it in the hands of the VA. That is not what I think \nour veterans would want us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I did not hear the last ruling of the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment falls on the point of order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, the next pending business is the cloture vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding we will convene \nabout 9:30 in the morning. We will be prepared to stay tonight if any \nSenators wish to discuss amendments following the cloture vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could the Presiding Officer tell us how many amendments \nhave\n\n[[Page S11118]]\n\nbeen filed and how many of them would fall as nongermane? Could the \nChair just give us some idea, some estimate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note that the Parliamentarian \ndoes not have that information at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can we have an idea as to how many are filed? Can we get \nthat information?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are approximately 140 amendments filed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I cannot vote for cloture on this bill because it would make it \nimpossible to consider highly important amendments for our troops and \ntheir families and amendments to enhance our Nation's security.\n  One hundred twenty amendments are filled. The Parliamentarian can't \ntell us even how many are relevant but, because they are not \ntechnically germane, will not be permitted to come to a vote if cloture \nis invoked.\n  The stakes for our security in the middle of war are too great not to \ntake an extra few days to consider important relevant amendments.\n  I vote to take those extra few days rather than to prematurely end \ndebate. I will vote against cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEPOT MAINTENANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the \n     Air Force reflects the essential requirements for the Air \n     Force to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic \n     technical competence, thereby ensuring an effective and \n     timely response to national defense contingencies and \n     emergency requirements;\n       (2) since the publication of the Depot Maintenance Strategy \n     and Master Plan of the Air Force in 2002, the service had \n     made great progress toward modernizing all 3 of its Depots, \n     in order to maintain their status as ``world class'' \n     maintenance repair and overhaul operations;\n       (3) 1 of the indispensable components of the Depot \n     Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the Air Force is the \n     commitment of the Air Force to allocate $150,000,000 a year \n     over 6 years, beginning in fiscal year 2004, for \n     recapitalization and investment, including the procurement of \n     technologically advanced facilities and equipment, of our \n     Nation's 3 Air Force depots; and\n       (4) the funds expended to date have ensured that \n     transformation projects, such as the initial implementation \n     of ``Lean'' and ``Six Sigma'' production techniques, have \n     achieved great success in dramatically reducing the time \n     necessary to perform depot maintenance on aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Air Force should be commended for the \n     implementation of its Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master \n     Plan and, in particular, meeting its commitment to invest \n     $150,000,000 a year over 6 years, since fiscal year 2004, in \n     the Nation's 3 Air Force Depots; and\n       (2) the Air Force should continue to fully fund its \n     commitment of $150,000,000 a year through fiscal year 2009 in \n     investments and recapitalization projects pursuant to the \n     Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2004, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To require the President to submit the procedures for Status \n  Review Tribunals and Administrative Review Boards to determine the \n           status of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n              PROHIBITION ON RETIREMENT OF F-117 AIRCRAFT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting my friend \nfrom Alaska, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense, for producing a terrific bill. H.R. 2863, the fiscal year 2006 \nDefense appropriations bill, is a strong piece of legislation that \nsupports the men and women of the Armed Forces and strengthens our \nsecurity. I would also like to recognize my colleague, the junior \nSenator from New Mexico, who joins us today.\n  I want to raise the issue of the F-117 Stealth Nighthawk aircraft. \nReport 109-69 to S. 1042, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2006, recommends a provision prohibiting retirement of F-\n117 aircraft in fiscal year 2006. I know that my colleague from New \nMexico is aware of this recommendation as well.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am aware of this recommendation and note that it \nfurther describes the F-117 as the only stealthy tactical aircraft \ncapable of delivering certain precision munitions currently in the \ninventory. Clearly, this is a very important capability for national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with my colleague's assessment about the \nstrategic value of the F-117 and note that this recommendation is \nfurther validated by the House-passed H.R. 2863 which retains the \nPresident's budget request for F-117 upgrades and adds $11.1 million in \noperations and maintenance funding to retain the 10 aircraft scheduled \nfor retirement. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman for his \nviews concerning the Air Force's recommendation to retire 10 F-117s in \nfiscal year 2006.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with the Senators from New Mexico that the F-\n117 is of critical importance to the Nation's precision strike \ncapability. Furthermore, I agree with the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee recommendation that it is premature to retire any F-117s at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished chairman for his views on \nthis important matter.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman as well, and look forward to \nworking with him; the ranking member, Senator Inouye and Senator \nDomenici on this issue in the future.\n\n\n                            SSI Eligibility\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, currently there are service members in our \nArmed Forces with disabled dependents who have lost or are in danger of \nlosing Supplemental Security Income, SSI, eligibility or benefits. This \nissue not only affects our regular active duty service members, but our \nmobilized National Guard and Reserve service members as well.\n  Supplemental Security Income is a Federal income supplement program, \nfunded by tax revenues, designed to provide cash to meet basic needs \nfor food, clothing, and shelter for aged, blind, and disabled people.\n  Under current law, section 1612(a) of the Social Security Act, only \nmilitary basic pay is counted as earned income for the purposes of \ndetermining SSI eligibility and benefit amount. Special pay and \nallowances are counted as unearned income. As a result, a disabled \nchild or spouse of a service member can lose SSI eligibility or have a \nbenefit reduction due to the way military compensation is presently \ncounted.\n  Because a significant portion of a service member's compensation \nincludes special pay and allowances,\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\nmilitary compensation generally results in more countable income for \nSSI purposes than comparable wages earned by a civilian. Accordingly, a \nchild or spouse of a service member could be ineligible for SSI while \nthe child or spouse of a civilian worker could be eligible for SSI \nbased on comparable gross wages.\n  The problem is particularly acute when a member of the National Guard \nor Reserves is called to active duty and begins to receive full \nmilitary pay, including special pay and allowances. In some cases, the \nmilitary pay alone is sufficient to cause a reduction of SSI benefits \nor a loss of eligibility for the disabled dependent. This means that at \nthe critical point when the service member is called away from his or \nher family in the service of our country, SSI benefits may be reduced \nor stopped.\n  In consideration of the special hardships facing military families in \na time of war and to provide more financial security for these \nfamilies, I have offered an amendment that proposes a statutory \nexclusion for all types of special pay and allowances received by \nservice members serving on active duty regardless of duty station. At a \ntime when military service members and their families are making such a \nhuge sacrifice for our country, it is vital that this step be taken to \nprotect SSI eligibility for these families.\n  Under this proposed statutory change, only basic pay, earned income, \nwould be used to determine SSI eligibility for a disabled child or \nspouse of the service member. All compensation provided by special pay \nand allowances, including the basic allowance for housing, BAH, would \nbe excluded. Excluding all special pay and allowances would eliminate \nthe disadvantageous income counting that results from treating a \nsubstantial portion of military compensation as unearned income.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the Senator from Nebraska. The provisions \nof the Social Security Act need to be addressed in order to ensure \nSupplemental Security Income eligibility and benefits are not \ninadvertently taken away from those in the armed services when they \nneed them most.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we will \nresume consideration of this bill tomorrow following the opening of the \nSenate at 9:30 a.m. as soon as possible. It will be my intention to ask \nthat any votes that are to be taken on this bill be stacked until \napproximately noon or 12:30 in order that the committees may meet in \nthe morning. There has been a specific request for that to happen. It \nis my understanding that there will be a request later that the time \nconsumed for cloture be consumed during the period of temporary recess \nthis evening on into tomorrow morning; is that the understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That unanimous consent request has not yet \nbeen propounded or agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am assured that will be the case.\n\n\n                            Notice of Intent\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing that it \nis my intention to move to suspend paragraph 4 of rule XVI for the \npurpose of proposing to the bill, H.R. 2863, a bill making \nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2006, and for other purposes: amendment No. 2040.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, October 4, 2005 \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n\n                                 CROWS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to bring up an important subject \ninvolving our soldiers in harm's way. In my State of Colorado and \nacross the country, our fighting men and women have suffered casualties \nwhile on patrol in armored vehicles. Typically, the gunner sitting on \ntop of the vehicle is at more risk from being hit both because he or \nshe is visible to the enemy and because he or she is not as protected \nas those troops inside the armored vehicle.\n  I recently received an e-mail from a Colorado soldier serving in \nIraq. This brave young man wrote me concerning the combat death of his \nfriend. His friend was riding in the gunner's seat when his Humvee was \nsubjected to an improvised explosive device attack. He feels that his \nfriend might still be alive if that Humvee had a Common Remotely \nOperated Weapons Station--CROWS--and he wanted me to know about it and \nsee if anyone here in Washington could do something about it.\n  I think we can do something about it, and with the help of my \ncolleagues from Hawaii and Alaska, we will do something about it.\n  The CROWS can be mounted on a variety of vehicles, including Humvees. \nIt allows the operator to acquire and engage targets while protected \ninside the armored vehicle from enemy fire and IED attacks. It works \nwith a variety of machine guns. The sensor suite allows both day and \nnight time operation.\n  This appropriations bill, as it stands now, allocates $75 million out \nof the emergency supplemental for the military to purchase CROWS. The \nHouse Defense appropriations bill provides no funding for CROWS, which \nis disheartening. The DOD's program manager has advised me that the \nPentagon supports spending $206 million for the CROWS system over the \nnext year.\n  My goal is for the military to be able to purchase thousands of these \nsystems, but at the moment our production capability is only on the \norder of 10 systems per month. We have to do better. I ask my \ncolleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee \non Appropriations, for their leadership and assistance in sustaining \nthe Senate's position when they get to conference on this matter with \nthe House.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, like all proud Americans, I share my \ncolleague's concern for the safety and well being of our troops. IED \nattacks are a very real threat to our troops and it is our \nresponsibility as Members of Congress to help protect our brave men and \nwomen fighting overseas. I will work in conference to ensure that we \ncan maintain the Senate's funding level to purchase CROWS for our \ntroops.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Colorado and \nHawaii for their work on this issue. They are right. We will continue \nto support these systems that provide our service members with the \nforce protection they need.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their leadership on this issue--and for their careers of \nservice to and sacrifice for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11120-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

They are the people and the offices who make the jobs of \nthe 100 Members of this Chamber more pleasant and more productive.\n  I cannot even imagine how this institution could function without the \nSenate Disbursing Office. In addition to serving as the finance office \nof the Senate, this office maintains our retirement, health insurance, \nlife insurance, and other human resource programs. For the past 7 \nyears, this most important Senate office has been headed by the \nSenate's highly capable Financial Officer, Mr. Tim Wineman.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Wineman will soon be leaving us. He is retiring on \nOctober 14. Therefore, I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's \ntime to thank Mr. Wineman for his service, to express my appreciation \nfor his outstanding work, and to say that we will miss him.\n  Mr. Wineman was born and raised in the Washington, DC, metropolitan \narea, graduating from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. On October 19, \n1970, he started work as a payroll clerk in the Senate Disbursing \nOffice; he remained in this office for the next 35 years. In September, \n1976, Mr.\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n\nWineman was promoted to payroll supervisor. Four years later, in \nAugust, 1980, he was promoted to the position of assistant financial \nclerk. On May 1, 1998, he became the Financial Clerk of the U.S. Senate \nDisbursing Office, that is, the Senate's Financial Officer.\n  His has been an extraordinary career, during which he has earned the \npraise of those who work under and with him in the Disbursing Office, \nand the respect of other Senate staffers and Members of this Chamber. \nDuring his service in Senate financial leadership positions for the \npast two decades, Mr. Wineman has overseen the technological renovation \nof the Senate's financial affairs and has had a hand both in the Senate \nbudget process and the Senate appropriation's process. And he proved \nhimself to be an invaluable resource to Senate leadership on both sides \nof the aisle. He will be missed and will be very difficult to replace.\n  I want to congratulate and thank Mr. Wineman for his extraordinary \ndedication to the work and traditions of the Senate. And I want extend \nto him and Pat, his wife of 36 years, my fondest wishes, and ask the \nLord's blessings as they embark upon this new phase of their lives.\n  I understand that after relaxing and enjoying a stress-free \nenvironment for the next 6 months, Tim plans to spend his retirement \nplaying golf and traveling. I urge him to do it. He deserves it. He has \nearned it.\n\n                       ``It Makes No Difference''\n\n     It makes no difference who sang the song,\n     If only the song was sung;\n     It makes no difference who did the deed,\n     Be they old in years or young;\n\n     If the song was sweet and helped a soul,\n     What matters the singer's name?\n     The worth was in the song itself,\n     And not in the world's acclaim.\n\n     The song and the deed are one,\n     If each be done for love;\n     Love of the work, not love of self,\n     And the ``score'' is kept above.\n     It makes no difference who did the deed,\n     Be they old in years or young;\n\n     If the song was sweet and helped a soul,\n     What matters the singer's name?\n     The worth was in the song itself,\n     And not in the world's acclaim.\n\n     The song and the deed are one,\n     If each be done for love;\n     Love of the work, not love of self,\n     And the ``score'' is kept above.\n     --Author Unknown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11121-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE PASSING OF COLONEL CLARENCE LEE TURNIPSEED, JR.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last month, COL Clarence Lee Turnipseed, \nJr., passed away. He was the father of my good friend, and one of the \nSenate's best and most indispensable workers, Mrs. Dot Svendson, who \nworks in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. With the death of \nColonel Turnipseed, the State of Alabama has lost an outstanding \ncitizen and our Nation has lost a true patriot.\n  Born September 18, 1914, in Union Springs, AL, Clarence Turnipseed \ngraduated from Auburn University in 1935. That same year he was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and began a \nremarkable and important military career. During World War II, he \nserved as a battery commander and battalion staff officer of the 42nd \nField Artillery Battalion of the Fourth Infantry. On June 6, 1944, \nCaptain Turnipseed participated in the momentous D-Day landing on Utah \nBeach in Normandy. A few months later, he participated in the Battle of \nthe Bulge. He was eventually promoted to the rank of colonel, served as \ncommander of the 87th Maneuver Area Detachment in Birmingham, AL, and \nwas an instructor at the Command and General Staff College in Fort \nLeavenworth, KS.\n  A grateful Nation recognized Colonel Turnipseed's long and productive \nmilitary career by presenting him with a number of awards and honors. \nThose included the Bronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal, the \nAmerican Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the \nEuropean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.\n  Colonel Turnipseed also had an important and productive civilian \ncareer in banking and business. He worked in a number of banks and \nfinancial institutions in Alabama. In 1968, he became president and \nchief executive officer of the First National Bank in Brewton. He \neventually held a number of offices in the Alabama and American Bankers \nAssociations, including president of the Alabama Bankers Association \nand vice president of the American Bankers Association. In 1973, he \nbecame director of the Birmingham Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank in \nAtlanta, and 3 years later was named Alabama's Small Business Advocate.\n  I extend Erma's and my most heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Svendson \nand to her brother, Clarence Lee, and to her sisters, Rebecca and \nMargaret.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11121-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF WEIRTON, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on July 30 and 31, the First Christian \nChurch of Weirton, WV celebrated its 175th anniversary. I wish to take \na few minutes of the Senate's time to extend to this house of worship, \nwhich came into existence in 1830, 33 years before West Virginia was \neven a State, my be1ated but sincere and heartfelt congratulations.\n  For 175 years, the First Christian Church of Weirton has served our \nLord and ministered to the needs of the region by providing comfort and \nsupport to those in need. It has provided aid and assistance to \nunemployed steel workers, to flood victims, and to those in need. It \nhas provided a place of faith and hope for all.\n  I regret that I was not able to participate in what I am sure was a \nmost glorious celebration, but I do want to recognize and thank the \nFirst Christian Church of Weirton for its wonderful service to our \nLord, and to our beloved State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11121-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On August 18, 2003, in Washington, DC, Elviv Augusto Perez Morales \nwho lived and dressed as a woman, was allegedly killed. According to \npolice, he was allegedly killed by Antonie Jacobs who had paid for sex \nunder the impression he was dealing with a woman. Upon learning that \nthe prostitute was really a man, the customer returned and allegedly \nshot the prostitute.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11121-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11121-S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT, S. 1197\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the full Senate has \nfinally taken up, considered and passed the reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act, S. 1197, bipartisan legislation that will \nfurther our goal of ending domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking. The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act \nover a decade ago marked an important national commitment to survivors \nof domestic violence and sexual assault. I am proud to join Senators \nBiden, Hatch, Specter, and others as an original cosponsor of this \nimportant measure, which currently has 58 cosponsors in total. I want \nto especially recognize Senator Biden for his commitment to ending \nviolence against women and children.\n  Earlier in my career as a prosecutor in Vermont, I witnessed the \ndevastating effects of domestic violence. Violence and abuse affect \npeople of all walks of life every day and regardless of gender, race, \nculture, age, class or sexuality. Such violence is a crime and it is \nalways wrong, whether the abuser is a family member, someone the victim \nis dating, a current or past spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend, an \nacquaintance or a stranger.\n  The National Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691,710 \nnonfatal, violent incidents committed against victims by current and \nformer spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends--also\n\n[[Page S11122]]\n\nknown as intimate partners--during 2001. Of those incidents, 85 percent \nwere against women. The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence \nagainst women has fallen steadily since 1993, when the rate was 9.8 \nincidents per 1,000 people. In 2001, the number fell to 5.0 incidents \nper 1,000 people, nearly a 50-percent reduction but still unacceptably \nhigh. Tragically, however, the survey found that 1,600 women were \nkilled in 1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend, while in \n2000 some 1,247 women were killed by their intimate partners.\n  According to the annual Vermont Crime Report, the number of forcible \nrapes reported in Vermont increased in 2004 to the highest level in 7 \nyears, while the amount of violent crime remained unchanged and overall \ncrime fell by about 5 percent from 2003. Reported incidents of rape \nrose by 58 percent, from 117 in 2003 to 185 in 2004. The average age of \nthe victim was 21, 47 percent of victims were younger than 18 years \nold, in 74 percent of the cases the perpetrator was an acquaintance of \nthe victim, and in a quarter of the cases the defendant was a family \nmember or intimate partner of the victim. In only 1 percent of the \ncases was the perpetrator a stranger. These figures cause me great \nconcern because violent crime has declined nationwide during that same \ntime period. Numbers like these are why reauthorizing VAWA is so vital.\n  Our Nation has made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in \nrecognizing that domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes. We \nhave responded with better laws, social support, and coordinated \ncommunity responses. Millions of women, men, children and families, \nhowever, continue to be traumatized by abuse, leading to increased \nrates of crime, violence and suffering.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has provided aid to law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors, helped stem domestic violence and child \nabuse, established training programs for victim advocates and \ncounselors, and trained probation and parole officers who work with \nreleased sex offenders. Now we on the Judiciary Committee and then the \nrest of our colleagues in Congress have the opportunity to reauthorize \nVAWA and make improvements to vital core programs, tighten criminal \npenalties against domestic abusers, and create new solutions to other \ncrucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault. This is an \nopportunity to help treat children victims of violence, augment health \ncare for rape victims, hold repeat offenders and Internet stalkers \naccountable, and help domestic violence victims keep their jobs.\n  Included in VAWA 2005 are reauthorizations of two programs that I \ninitially sponsored that are vital to helping rural communities battle \ndomestic violence in a setting in which isolation can make it more \ndifficult for both victims and law enforcement. In a small, rural State \nsuch as Vermont, our county and local law enforcement agencies rely \nheavily on cooperative, interagency efforts to combat and solve \nsignificant problems. That is why I sought to include the rural \ndomestic violence and child victimization enforcement grant program as \npart of the original VAWA. This program helps make services available \nto rural victims and children by encouraging community involvement in \ndeveloping a coordinated response to combat domestic violence, dating \nviolence and child abuse. Adequate resources combined with sustained \ncommitment will bring about significant improvements in rural areas to \nthe lives of those victimized by domestic and sexual violence.\n  The rural grants program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and \nexpands the existing education, training and services grant programs \nthat address violence against women in rural areas. This provision \nrenews the rural VAWA program, extends direct grants to State and local \ngovernments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include \ncommunity collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or \nexpansion of additional victim services. This provision includes new \nlanguage that expands the program coverage to sexual assault, child \nsexual assault and stalking. It also expands eligibility from rural \nStates to rural communities, increasing access to rural sections of \notherwise highly populated States. This section authorizes $55,000,000 \nannually for 2006 through 2010, which is an increase of $15 million per \nyear.\n  The second grant program initiative on which I have focused is the \ntransitional housing assistance grants for victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. This program, \nwhich became law as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003, authorizes grants \nfor transitional housing and related services for people fleeing \ndomestic violence, sexual assault or stalkers. At a time when the \navailability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows, \ntransitional housing for victims is especially needed. Today more than \n50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing \ndomestic violence. We have a clear problem that is in dire need of a \nsolution. This program is part of the solution.\n  Transitional housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving \nviolence in their homes and becoming self-sufficient. Our bill, VAWA \n2005, amends the existing transitional housing program by expanding the \ncurrent direct-assistance grants to include funds for operational, \ncapital and renovation costs. Other changes include providing services \nto victims of dating violence, sexual assault and stalking; extending \nthe length of time for receipt of benefits to match that used by \nHousing and Urban Development transitional housing programs; and \nupdating the existing program to reflect the concerns of the service \nprovision community. The provision would increase the authorized \nfunding for the grant from $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.\n\n  Regrettably, this important bill was saddled in committee with an \nextraneous and ill-considered amendment, offered by Senator Kyl, \nrelating to the national DNA database. Current law permits States to \ncollect DNA samples from arrested individuals and to include arrestee \ninformation in State DNA databases. In addition, States may use \narrestee information to search the national DNA database for a possible \n``hit.'' The only thing that States may not do is upload arrestee \ninformation into the national database before a person has been \nformally charged with a crime.\n  Under the Kyl amendment, arrestee information can go into the \nnational database immediately upon arrest, before formal charges are \nfiled, and even if no charges are ever brought. This adds little or no \nvalue for law enforcement, while intruding on the privacy rights of \npeople who are, in our system, presumed innocent. It could also provide \nan incentive for pretextual and race-based stops and arrests for the \npurpose of DNA sampling. Congress rejected this very proposal less than \na year ago, after extended negotiations and consultation with the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The Kyl amendment would also make it harder for innocent people to \nhave their DNA expunged from a state database. Under current law, if a \nState chooses to enter a person's DNA profile into its database before \nthe person is convicted of a crime, then the State must automatically \nexpunge that information in the event that no conviction is obtained. \nUnder the new language, even a person who is arrested in error and \nreleased without charge would need to obtain a court order before his \nDNA information could be removed from the database.\n  Databases are important tools to solving crime, but there are limits \nto what should be included in databases. The Kyl amendment raises \nserious privacy concerns that cannot be justified by any legitimate law \nenforcement need. I opposed it in committee, I continue to oppose it in \nits current form, and I will press for its exclusion in conference.\n  VAWA 2005 is an important part of our efforts to increase awareness \nof the problem of violence, to save the lives of battered women, rape \nvictims, and children who grow up with violence and to continue \nprogress against the devastating tragedy of domestic violence. I look \nforward to working with Senators Specter and Biden, Congressmen \nSensenbrenner and Conyers and other members of the upcoming conference \nto reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and thus strengthen the \nprevention of violence against women and children and its devastating \ncosts and consequences.\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent the Biden-Hatch--Specter Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. \n1197. It is a testament to the underlying goals of this legislation \nthat this legislation was unanimously passed and garnered 57 cosponsors \nfrom both sides of the aisle. I would like to thank Chairman Specter \nfor his unyielding efforts to get this bill passed, and I would like to \nthank Senator Hatch for his longstanding support for this effort. The \nact expired on September 30. The House has passed its legislation, so \nit is imperative that we get the Violence Against Women Act of 2005 to \nconference and to the President's desk immediately.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 makes many critical \nimprovements to the original act that we passed over 10 years ago. Many \nin this Chamber are well aware that I consider the Violence. Against \nWomen Act the single most significant legislation that I have crafted \nduring my 32-year tenure in the Senate. Indeed, the enactment of the \nViolence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic \ncommitment to women and children victimized by domestic violence and \nsexual assault. Our Nation has been rewarded for this commitment. Since \nthe act's passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50 \npercent, incidents of rape are down by 60 percent, and the number of \nwowen killed by an abusive husband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent. \nToday, more than half of all rape victims are stepping forward to \nreport the crime. And since we passed the act in 1994 over a million \nwomen have found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic \nviolence protective orders.\n  ``This is a dramatic change from 10 years ago. Back then, violence in \nthe household was treated as a ``family matter'' rather than a criminal \njustice issue. Because we took action, the criminal justice system is \nmuch better equipped to handle domestic violence, and it is treated for \nwhat it is, criminal. The goal of the legislation passed is to usher \nthe Violence Against Women Act into the 21st century. With this \nlegislation we attempt to look beyond the immediate crisis and takes \nsteps to not only punish offenders, but to also do more to help victims \nget their lives back on track, and prevent domestic violence and sexual \nassault from occurring in the first place.\n  This bill is truly a cooperative effort. As Senator Hatch, Senator \nSpecter and I drafted this bill, we listened closely to suggestions \nfrom both sides of the aisle, and we listened carefully to the input \nfrom those with wide ranging opinions on how to combat this problem. In \nparticular, we listened to those who are on the front lines fighting to \nend violence, such as police officers, emergency room nurses, victim \nadvocates, shelter directors, and prosecutors. Based upon these \ndiscussions, we made targeted improvements to existing grant programs \nand we tightened up the criminal laws.\n  The groups that assisted with drafting this bill included the \nNational Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Network to \nEnd Domestic Violence, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, Legal \nMomentum, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National \nCenter for Victims for Crime, the American Bar Association, the \nNational District Attorneys Association, the National Council on Family \nand Juvenile Court Judges, the National Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs' Association and many others. I would \npersonally like to thank them for the work that they do each and every \nday to make our Nation a better, safer place for its citizens.\n  No doubt, the bill that we have passed today is ambitious. We have \nmade tremendous strides in treating domestic violence and sexual \nassaults as public crimes over the past 10 years. We have helped ensure \nthat offenders were held accountable, and we created coordinated \ncommunity responses to help victims. The Violence Against Women Act of \n2005 will help us look beyond the immediate crisis and provide long-\nterm solutions for victims, and we will redouble our prevention \nefforts. This is why we included important efforts to ease the housing \ncrisis for victims fleeing their homes, included efforts to engage boys \nand men to prevent domestic violence from occurring in the first place, \nenlisted the healthcare community in identifying and treating victims, \nand to help stop the cycle of abuse suffered by immigrant women and \nprovided tough new regulations for international marriage brokers to \nensure that they provide foreign brides with information related to the \nbackground of their potential husband and their rights if they are \nabused.\n  Despite all of the strong points of this legislation, it could be \nmade better. In particular, I had hoped that provisions from Senator \nMurray's Security and Financial Empowerment Act, SAFE, would have \nremained in the bill. This amendment would provide some fundamental \neconomic protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual \nassault. Just as the Family Medical Leave Act protects individuals \ncaring for a sick loved one, the SAFE Act would allow domestic violence \nvictims to take time off from work to appear in court cases and other \njudicial proceedings without jeopardizing their employment at a time \nthey need it the most. The SAFE Act is important legislation, and I \nbelieve that there is bi-partisan support for it. Unfortunately, we \nwere not able to reach a consensus on this amendment and, as a result, \nit is not part of this final bill. It is my hope that the Senate will \nrevisit this issue soon, and I look forward to working with Senator \nMurray in this effort.\n  One of the primary concerns expressed about the bill is that it \nsimply costs too much. This is certainly understandable given our \nNation's financial situation right now, but I have always said that the \nsafety of the American people is the single most important \nresponsibility for Federal, State, and local governments. And, while \nmoney doesn't solve every problem, there are very few, if any, efforts \nrelated to preventing violence and fighting crime that can be solved \nwithout money. As such, it is simply a fact that this effort will \ncontinue to cost money. I would argue that the results over the past 10 \nyears show that this has been money well spent, and I hope that the \nCongress will continue to fund these efforts. In fact, there is \nevidence that we have received a net return on this investment. A 2002 \nuniversity study found that money spent to reduce domestic violence \nsaved nearly ten times the potential costs through the years of 1995 \nand 2000. During that time, the Federal Government spent $1.6 billion \nfor the act's programs and, as a result, we avoided spending an \nestimated $14.8 billion on medical, legal and other victimization costs \nthat arise from domestic violence. On an individual level, the bill \ncosts roughly $15.50 per woman in the United States and saves an \nestimated $159 per woman. This evidence suggests that our success in \nending family violence cannot be signal to reduce funding, rather, it \nis a call to continue to do more. We simply can't afford to lose the \ngains that we have made. We have found a winning combination, and we \nneed to stick with it.\n  The Senate's action today demonstrates that eradicating violence \nagainst women is truly a shared goals, one that is held by Democrats \nand Republicans, one that is upheld by men and women, and one that is \ndesired by both Government and by the private sector. I would like to \nthank my colleagues of the Senate for their support of this important \nlegislation. In particular, I want to thank Senator Hatch, a long-\nstanding champion on this issue. Since 1990, Senator Hatch and I have \nworked together to end family violence in this country, so it is no \ngreat surprise that once again he worked side-by-side with us to craft \ntoday's bill. I am also deeply indebted to Senator Kennedy for his \nunwavering commitment to battered immigrant women and his work on the \nbill's immigration provisions. I also thank Senator Leahy who has long-\nsupported the Violence Against Women Act and, in particular, has worked \non the rural programs and transitional housing provisions. Finally, I \nwant to thank my very good friend from Pennsylvania for his commitment \nand leadership on this bill. It is a pleasure to work with Senator \nSpecter, and I want to thank him for expeditiously moving this \nlegislation through the Judiciary Committee and through today's action \nby the Senate. I look forward to working in the future with all of my \ncolleagues to ensure that we continue to strive to the important goals \nof the Violence\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\nAgainst Women Act of 2005. This effort will require a bi-partisan \ncommitment.\n  Again, I am thankful to Senators Reid and Frist for their work on \nseeing that bill is passed and to all of my colleagues who unanimously \nsupported the Violence Against Women Act of 2005.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last evening, S. 1197, ;the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, was passed out of the Senate. I commend the \nJudiciary Committee for including Title 9, Safety for Indian Women, in \nits bill to reauthorize the act. Title 9 focuses on the needs of Indian \ntribes to enable them to reduce and treat incidents of domestic \nviolence in Indian country. Among other things, it would authorize the \ncreation of tribal criminal history databases to document domestic \nviolence convictions and protection orders and it creates a new Federal \ncriminal offense authorizing Federal prosecutors to charge repeat \ndomestic violence offenders before they seriously injure or kill \nsomeone. S. 1197 also would authorize the Bureau of Indian Affairs \npolice and certain tribal officers to make arrests for domestic \nviolence assaults committed outside of their presence.\n  Since 1999, the Department of Justice has issued various studies \nshowing that Indian women experience the highest rates of domestic \nviolence compared to all other groups in the United States. These \nreports state that one out of every three Indian women are victims of \nsexual assault; that from 1979 to 1992, homicide was the third leading \ncause of death of Indian females between the ages of 15 to 34; and that \n75 percent of those deaths were committed by a family member or \nacquaintance. What we don't know, however, is the impact of these \nviolent acts on law enforcement, judicial, mental or medical services \nin Indian country. I am, therefore, pleased to see that this bill would \nauthorize a comprehensive study of domestic violence in Indian Country \nto gauge the impact of these acts to Indian tribes and their resources. \nThe findings of such a study will help the Congress and the \nadministration to better focus resources to areas with the greatest \nneed.\n  Earlier this Congress, Senator Dorgan and I introduced the Restoring \nSafety to Indian Women Act. We worked closely with the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to ensure that the provisions of this bill, some of which I \nmention here, were given due consideration. Throughout the more \ncomprehensive S. 1197, Indian tribes would be eligible for various \ngrants to enhance their victim services, judicial function, and law \nenforcement service capacity to the same extent as State and local \ngovernments are eligible.\n  Domestic violence is a national problem and not one that is unique to \nIndian country. Yet, due to the unique status of Indian tribes, there \nare obstacles faced by Indian tribal police, Federal investigators, \ntribal and Federal prosecutors and courts that impede their ability to \nrespond to domestic violence in Indian country. Title 9 of this bill \ngoes a long way toward removing these obstacles at all levels and to \nenhance the ability of each agency to respond to acts of domestic \nviolence when they occur. These critical changes to the current law \nwill greatly curb violence against Indian women, and perhaps even save \nlives.\n  Again, I thank the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for \ntheir thoughtful consideration in drafting a bill that includes an \noften forgotten segment of our population, the Nation's Indian tribes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11124-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CONGRATULATING ASHLEY JEFFERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nAshley Jeffers of Alvaton, KY. Ashley was recently awarded a $15,000 \ncollege scholarship as part of the Girls Incorporated National Scholars \nProgram.\n  Ashley experience at Girls Inc. of Bowling Green, KY is a testament \nto her impressive work ethic, initiative, and leadership skills. She \njoined Girls Inc. at the age of 14, and was hired shortly after to help \nteach classes. Eager to expand the center, Ashley learned about other \nGirls Inc. national programs and incorporated new classes into the \nexisting program at Bowling Green. Inspired by her experience working \nwith other young women at Girls Inc., Ashley has decided to pursue a \ncareer in social work following her studies at Western Kentucky \nUniversity.\n  The Girls Inc. National Scholars Program was created in 1992 by a \n$6.1 million gift from Lucille Miller Wright, a volunteer pilot during \nWorld War II, who wanted to help young women overcome financial \nbarriers to attending college. Since 1992, the National Scholars \nProgram has awarded over $1.8 million to 304 girls.\n  By inspiring other young women to become strong, smart, and bold, \nAshley Jeffers does justice to the legacy of Lucille Miller Wright. She \nis an example of how young Americans can have a positive influence on \ntheir communities by participating in mentorship activities such as \nGirls Inc.\n  I congratulate Ashley on this achievement. She is an inspiration to \nthe citizens of Kentucky. I look forward to seeing all that she will \naccomplish in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11124-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AUGUST WILSON\n\n   Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to pause in the Senate's \nbusiness today to recognize the passing of a great American who we in \nMinnesota are proud to call our own: Pulitzer Prize winning poet and \nplaywright August Wilson. He died yesterday at the age of 60.\n  August Wilson spent a good part of his adult life in Saint Paul, MN, \nwhich is my home. He worked for a time at the Science Museum of \nMinnesota, writing educational scripts. As his work became recognized \nand his fame spread, he continued to be seen around Saint Paul, working \nin coffee shops and other such places, sketching out ideas on the backs \nof napkins.\n  In his many plays, Mr. Wilson brought his audiences back time and \nagain to the neighborhood where he grew up, in the Hill District of \nPittsburgh, PA. Through a series of 10 plays, he traced the African-\nAmerican experience through the ten decades of the 20th century. The \nfirst, ``Jitney,'' about a city taxi station, was written in Saint \nPaul.\n  Decades ago, the poet T.S. Elliot wrote that, ``Poetry is not an \nassertion of the truth, but making that truth more fully real to us.'' \nAmerica struggles with deep divisions on matters of race. The tragic \nevents in the gulf coast have brought that home to us. How desperately \nwe need the kind of expression of the truth that August Wilson brought \nto a large audience.\n  Facts are important, but we have all experienced the frustration of \nnot seeing our set of facts ``carry the day.'' Psychologists have even \ndetermined that we use one part of our brain to process the ideas of \npolitical candidates we support and a different part of our brain when \nwe are listening to the views of one we don't. Jerry Garcia of the \nGrateful Dead wrote a line I like: ``People ain't gonna learn what they \ndon't wanna know.''\n  But we hold out the hope the art can find a way through our defenses \nand make truth fully real to us. When Abraham Lincoln met Harriet \nBeecher Stowe, author of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' legend has it that he \nsaid, ``So this is the little woman who started this big war.''\n  It is a special honor that August Wilson will have a theater on New \nYork's Broadway named in his honor. The Minnesota connection in that is \nthe theater has previously born the name of Virginia Binger, the late \nwife of Jim Binger, one of Minnesota's great citizens. The eight Wilson \nplays that made it to Broadway were nominated for more than 50 Tony \nawards.\n  Talking about the blues in a way that could just as well have been \napplied to his own writing, he said: ``You don't sing to feel better. \nYou sing `cause that's a way of understanding life.''\n  We recognize the history and forces which shaped the life of August \nWilson and we honor his life long effort to make the truth \nreal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11124-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11124-S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A FRIEND TO IDAHO ARTS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an \nIdahoan, who through his lifelong love and support of the arts, has \ngained national recognition. Dan Harpole, executive director\n\n[[Page S11125]]\n\nof the Idaho Commission on the Arts, ICA, since 2002, has recently been \nnamed board director of the National Assembly of States Arts Agencies, \nNASAA.\n  Dan's years of energetic and committed arts leadership in Idaho and \nthe Northwest made his appointment to this position very fitting. He \nunderstands the intrinsic and overt value to society of a thriving arts \ncommunity at all levels. In the course of Dan's leadership of the Idaho \nCommission on the Arts, the ICA has developed a new strategic plan for \nits mission and vision in Idaho. By reaching out to all parts of the \ncommunity, including nonprofits, cultural organizations, schools, art \nprofessionals, and State and local government officials, the ICA under \nDan's direction has created a plan that aims to successfully integrate \nart into communities across Idaho for the greater benefit of all. Dan's \nseminal vision was demonstrated to his colleagues in other States when \nIdaho hosted the NASAA National Convention this year.\n  I want to publicly recognize Dan for his continued efforts and \naccomplishments as well as the commissioners and staff for their \nsupport. His children, Hunter and Fiona, are his inspiration and joy \nand we are pleased that they chose to make Idaho their home. What Idaho \nhas gained by Dan's expertise and enthusiasm will now be shared \nthroughout other States as he takes the helm of NASAA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11125-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING SOUTH DAKOTA'S BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to publicly honor and congratulate O'Gorman High School of \nSioux Falls, Alcester-Hudson Elementary, and Corsica Elementary on \nachieving blue ribbon status under the Federal No Child Left Behind \nAct. All three schools earned the prestigious blue ribbon designation \nbased on strong test scores and a myriad of other successes.\n  These three schools are among only 295 recognized nationwide this \nyear, and O'Gorman is 1 of only 40 high schools to receive this \ndistinction. In fact, O'Gorman is the only high school in the entire \nDenver region, which includes South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, \nMontana, Colorado, and Utah, to earn this honor.\n  For public schools such as Alcester-Hudson Elementary and Corsica \nElementary to qualify for blue ribbon status, they must meet State \ntesting levels or have a student body comprised of a high percentage of \neconomically disadvantaged students, yet demonstrate improvement. \nAchieving this goal is a wonderful accomplishment and Alcester-Hudson \nand Corsica elementary schools ought to be commended.\n  Although all South Dakota public schools are required to take part in \nDakota STEP, the State's test for tracking progress under the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, private schools, on the other hand, are under no such \nobligation. Nonetheless, O'Gorman administers the Dakota STEP exam to \nprovide parents and supporters a comparison between O'Gorman students \nand those of other schools. Unlike the criteria used to rate public \nschools, the standards private schools are required to meet in order to \nachieve blue ribbon status are more rigorous, as students must place in \nthe top 10 percent on both the State test and on the national level for \nreading and math. As noted by Kyle Groos, principal of O'Gorman High \nSchool, the junior class scored in the top 10 percent of schools on the \nState test, with more than 90 percent of students considered proficient \nor advanced in reading and math.\n  While test scores play a significant role in determining whether a \nschool fits the blue ribbon standard, O'Gorman also submitted in its \napplication a 24-page report detailing the school's various attributes. \nThe statement highlighted students' high participation in the \nperforming arts, the school's many sports championships, the 13,000 \nhours students devoted to volunteering and community service last year, \nas well as O'Gorman's emphasis on foreign language, math and theology \nstudies.\n  Earning this distinction under No Child Left Behind is certainly an \nachievement for all these outstanding schools; however, O'Gorman was \nalso a blue ribbon school under the Federal Government's former \nrecognition program that began in 1982. Like the previous Blue Ribbon \nSchools Program, this distinction is one that never expires unless the \nprogram is replaced.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor these three exceptional \nschools. It is a privilege for me to share with my colleagues the \nexemplary leadership and tireless commitment to education O'Gorman High \nSchool, Alcester-Hudson Elementary, and Corsica Elementary provide to \ntheir students. I strongly commend the hard work and dedication all the \nfaculty, administrators, and staff devote to these three institutions, \nand I am very pleased that their dedication and the students' \nsubstantial efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated. On \nbehalf of all South Dakotans, I would like to congratulate these three \nextraordinary schools and wish them all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11125-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING FATHER BRIAN SHANLEY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, on July 1, 2005, we welcomed home a \nson of Providence College to assume the presidency of that great \ninstitution. Father Brian Shanley is a man of great intellect, great \nenthusiasm, and a man of deep and abiding faith.\n  He is superbly prepared to continue the extraordinary progress of \nProvidence College as a distinguished community of scholars serving to \neducate the talented young men and women who proudly claim PC as their \nown.\n  Generations of students and graduates of Providence College have \nenriched our Nation and our State not only with their knowledge but \njust as importantly with their character.\n  Father Shanley understands this great legacy of Providence College \nand, through his effort and his energy, he will sustain and enhance \nthis extraordinary place.\n  St. Thomas Aquinas, a theologian who Father Shanley is acquainted \nwith, wrote ``If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his \nship, he would keep it in port forever.''\n  Under Father Shanley, I do not think Providence College will get many \n``port calls.'' He will sail forward with determination, faith, and \ngood humor to inspire faculty and students to think seriously, to face \nthe challenges of our times, and to live a life of character and \nconcern that has always been the hallmark of Providence College.\n  I wish him good luck and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11125-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11125-S11126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HILLS POW-WOW\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to take \nthis opportunity to inform my colleagues in the U.S. Senate about a \nspecial event taking place in the beautiful Black Hills of South \nDakota. In Rapid City, on October 7 through October 9, the 19th Annual \nHe Sapa Wacipi and Fine Art Show, otherwise known as the Black Hills \nPow-Wow, will be held. Hundreds of dancers from throughout the Northern \nPlains and Canada will celebrate, compete, and engage in fellowship.\n  It is also a time of coming together and enjoying the fine art and \nauthentic handmade crafts of many gifted artisans. There will also be \ncontemporary indigenous music and handgame tournaments, which have \nbecome quite popular with the Native youth in our State. This year, for \nthe first time, educators and officials with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration, NASA, will be in attendance with exhibits and \npresentations that will help foster the possibilities of careers in \nspace and technology for South Dakota youth.\n  The Tribes of the Great Sioux Nation are a uniquely family-oriented \nculture that has always placed great emphasis and importance on \nrelationships with family and friends. Worthy of note, is the Indian \nway of life that means when you walk into their home, you never leave \nhungry. Their hospitality is legendary. They are kind and generous and \nwill give from the bottom of their hearts. They embrace their \nspirituality as a part of who they are and they respect and honor their \nCreator.\n  Their desire to continue their language and traditions is very dear \nto their hearts. For many years, the language of the Lakota, Dakota and \nNakota was in danger of being lost. But in the last 30 to 40 years, it \nhas begun to flourish and is being restored,\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n\nthanks to those educators, elders and all who recognize its beauty and \nsignificance in our time. The coming generations will be a testimony of \nthe importance of this legacy.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to give special recognition to \nthe He Sapa Wacipi Pow-Wow Association and all the volunteers who \nselflessly give of their time and effort to bring this event together \nevery year. It is a lot of work, but the end result is a spectacle of \nbeauty and pageantry every year. They can be very proud of all their \nefforts and I officially acknowledge and honor them for their \ndedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11126-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11126-S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4107.

Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of \nthe United States Postal Service located at 6110 East 51st Place in \nTulsa, OK as the ``Dewey F. Bartlett Post Office''.\n  Dewey Follett Bartlett, former Governor and distinguished alumnus of \nthis Senate body, emulated the Oklahoma spirit of innovative \nleadership, hard work, and public service. In his honor, I proudly seek \nto name a post office in his hometown of Tulsa, OK. We commemorate an \noutstanding public servant so that posterity will be challenged by his \nexample, just as we have been.\n  Although he was not actually born in Oklahoma, Dewey Bartlett \nnaturalized as fast as he could. While studying at Princeton \nUniversity, he came home during summers to work in Oklahoma oil fields \njust as I did. He moved to my hometown, Tulsa, in 1945 to assume a \nmanaging role in his family's business after his military service \nduring World War II.\n  Dewey Bartlett shared my dedication to a strong national defense. As \na member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a pilot myself, I \nappreciate Mr. Bartlett for his military service to our country. He was \nawarded the Air Medal for his distinguished efforts in the Pacific \nTheater during World War II. Not only did he serve in the U.S. Marine \nCorps as a combat dive-bomber pilot, he championed the military during \nhis service in the Senate.\n  During his tenure in the Senate, Bartlett was more than once deemed \nthe most conservative member of the Senate. It is an Oklahoma \ndistinction that I have sought to uphold. Last year, the American \nConservative Union ranked me as the most conservative member of the \nSenate. I share his vision of advocating common sense Oklahoma values \nincluding less government bureaucracy, less regulation, lower taxes and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Dewey Bartlett's political philosophy was consistent with the \nConstitutional intention to not encumber Americans with layers of \nbureaucracy, but to promote individual liberty, freedom and justice. I \nam pleased that we can honor albeit in a small way, his service to our \ncountry by naming a post office in Tulsa, OK after him.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nas we commemorate an outstanding citizen so that future generations \nwill be challenged by his example.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1821. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto preparation for an influenza pandemic, including an avian influenza \npandemic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, four years after 9/11, the government was \nsupposed to be prepared for a crisis like Hurricane Katrina. Yet as we \nall saw, the government was not. We owe it to the American people to do \nbetter in the future.\n  Once again, the experts are warning us. This time, it's not about \nlevees or terrorists. It's about another pandemic flu.\n  According to the experts, another pandemic flu is not a matter of if \nbut a question of when. As Dr. Julie Gerberding of the Centers for \nDisease Control put it: ``. . . many influenza experts, including those \nat CDC, consider the threat of a serious influenza pandemic to the \nUnited States to be high. Although the timing and impact of an \ninfluenza pandemic is unpredictable, the occurrence is inevitable and \npotentially devastating.''\n  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina would pale in comparison \nto the potential consequences of a global pandemic. A respected U.S. \nhealth expert has concluded that 1.7 million Americans would die in the \nfirst year alone of an outbreak. A pandemic flu outbreak in the Untied \nStates today could cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars due \nto death, lost productivity and disruptions to commerce and society.\n  Perhaps the only thing more troubling than contemplating the possible \nconsequences of an avian flu pandemic is recognizing that neither this \nNation nor the world are prepared to deal with it.\n  Our National Pandemic Plan is still in draft stages. We lack the \ncapacity to rapidly manufacture vaccines in mass\n\n[[Page S11133]]\n\nquantities. We barely have enough antiviral medication for 2 percent of \nour population. Our health care infrastructure is not prepared to \nhandle a pandemic. And the medical community, businesses, and general \npublic need to be better prepared.\n  These are just a few ways we are not as prepared as we should be.\n  America can do better. An avian flu pandemic may be inevitable, but \nthe devastating consequences are not. We need to heed the warnings and \ntake action immediately.\n  Last week, the Senate unanimously approved an amendment offered by \nSenators Harkin, Obama, Kennedy, Durbin and me that will begin to \nprovide the resources necessary to protect Americans against this \nlooming threat.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce, along with Senators Obama, Bayh, \nKennedy, Harkin and Durbin, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act \nof 2005. This legislation builds on our commitment to protecting \nAmericans by preparing for the possibility of a pandemic.\n  Specifically, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will ensure \nthat we have a national plan to address a flu pandemic. Under our bill, \na new Director of Pandemic Preparedness and Response within the \nExecutive Office of the President will be responsible for finalizing \nand carrying out the National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan. \nThere should be no question about who is in charge of preparing our \nnation for this looming threat. This new position will also ensure \nthat, in the event of a pandemic, we will have a single senior official \nwhose primary responsibility is to coordinate the federal government's \nresponse and ensure coordination between local governments and the \nprivate sector. This is serious responsibility, and our bill will \nensure that the new Director is held accountable for preparing and \nprotecting Americans against the threat of a pandemic.\n  Our bill will improve surveillance and international partnerships so \nwe may detect the emergence of a flu strain with pandemic potential \nimmediately. Specifically, our bill establishes and implements a \ncomprehensive diplomatic strategy targeted at nations most at risk for \nan epidemic of avian influenza. It also provides assistance for \ninternational surveillance and medical care, and creates an \nInternational Fund to support pre-pandemic influenza control and relief \nactivities in countries affected by avian influenza.\n  Domestic surveillance efforts will also be bolstered by our \nlegislation. Our bill improves state surveillance capacity, and expands \nefforts by the Department of Agriculture to prevent pandemic avian \ninfluenza.\n  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will improve our capacity \nto develop, produce and distribute a vaccine that will be effective \nagainst a pandemic flu. It will expand research at the National \nInstitutes of Health so we may develop more efficient methods of \nproducing vaccines. Our bill would enhance our vaccine production \ncapacity by creating a guaranteed market for seasonal flu vaccine \nthrough a federal buyback program for a portion of unsold doses. And \namong other provisions, our bill will improve access to vaccinations \nduring a pandemic by enhancing annual flu vaccination coverage for \nuninsured and underinsured adults and children.\n  Our legislation will ensure that we have enough antivirals, vaccines \nand other essential medications and supplies in the Strategic National \nStockpile. Specifically, our bill requires that we procure enough \nantiviral medication to cover a minimum of 50 percent of the population \nfor the Strategic National Stockpile. This legislation will protect \nAmericans from the price-gouging of medications during a pandemic, and \nestablishes a mass tracking and distribution system for vaccines and \nantiviral medications so we can direct medications and vaccines to \nwhere they are needed the most.\n  The Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will also improve our \nsurge capacity so that the American people can be assured there will be \nan adequate supply of health care providers and institutions to care \nfor them in the event of a pandemic. Our bill will also ensure that \npublic education and awareness campaigns targeted to businesses, health \ncare providers and the American public related to pandemic preparedness \nare conducted.\n  And finally, the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act will ensure \nthat adequate resources are available to address this looming threat.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nso we may ensure that we do everything possible to prepare and protect \nAmericans from the threat of a global flu pandemic.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pandemic Preparedness and \n     Response Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Health and Human Services reports \n     that an influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause \n     rapid increases in death and illness than virtually any other \n     natural health threat.\n       (2) Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century: the \n     Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, the Asian flu pandemic in 1957, \n     and the Hong Kong flu pandemic in 1968. The Spanish flu \n     pandemic was the most severe, causing over 500,000 deaths in \n     the United States and more than 20,000,000 deaths worldwide.\n       (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     estimated conservatively that up to 207,000 Americans would \n     die, and up to 734,000 would be hospitalized, during the next \n     pandemic. The costs of the pandemic, including the total \n     direct costs associated with medical care and indirect costs \n     of lost productivity and death, are estimated at between \n     $71,000,000,000 and $166,500,000,000. These costs do not \n     include the economic effects of pandemic on commerce and \n     society.\n       (4) Recent studies suggest that avian influenza strains, \n     which are endemic in wild birds and poultry populations in \n     some countries, are becoming increasingly capable of causing \n     severe disease in humans and are likely to cause the next \n     pandemic flu.\n       (5) In 2004, 8 nations--Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, \n     Japan, Laos, China, Cambodia, and the Republic of Korea--\n     experienced outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) among poultry \n     flocks. Cases of human infections were confirmed in Thailand, \n     Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam (including a possible human-\n     to-human infection in Thailand).\n       (6) As of September 29, 2005, 116 confirmed human cases of \n     avian influenza (H5N1) have been reported, 60 of which \n     resulted in death. Of these cases, 91 were in Vietnam, 17 in \n     Thailand, 4 in Cambodia, and 4 in Indonesia.\n       (7) On February 21, 2005, Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that \n     ``this is a very ominous situation for the globe . . . the \n     most important threat we are facing right now.''.\n       (8) On February 23, 2005, Dr. Shigeru Omi, Asia regional \n     director of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated with \n     respect to the avian flu, ``We at WHO believe that the world \n     is now in the gravest possible danger of a pandemic.''.\n       (9) The best defense against influenza pandemics is a \n     heightened global surveillance system. In many of the nations \n     where avian flu (H5N1) has become endemic the early detection \n     capabilities are severely lacking, as is the transparency in \n     the health systems.\n       (10) In addition to surveillance, pandemic preparedness \n     requires domestic and international coordination and \n     cooperation to ensure an adequate medical response, including \n     communication and information networks, public health \n     measures to prevent spread, use of vaccination and \n     antivirals, provision of health outpatient and inpatient \n     services, and maintenance of core public functions.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300aa-1 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n             ``Subtitle 3--Pandemic Influenza Preparedness\n\n     ``SEC. 2141.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a critical \nissue--the possibility of an avian influenza pandemic.\n  When I started talking about this 7 months ago, not too many folks \npaid attention. Perhaps because the shorthand for this looming crisis \nis the ``bird flu,'' people assume it is just going to get birds and \nanimals sick.\n  In reality, however, what is at stake here is the potential of a \npandemic that we have not seen in the United States since 1918. As has \nalready been stated, our top scientists and medical personnel, \nincluding the heads of the NIH, CDC, and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, all agree that it is almost inevitable that an avian \nflu pandemic will strike.\n  The key question is the extent of the damage, especially in terms of \nlives lost. The answer to this question will, in large measure, depend \non our level of preparedness and the amount of resources we are willing \nto immediately commit to deal with this looming crisis.\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\n  After Katrina, I hope we all learned a lesson about the critical \nvalue of preparedness.\n  I rise today to introduce, along with Senators Reid, Bayh, and \nKennedy, S. 1821, legislation that dramatically enhances the ability of \nthe United States and international community to prevent and respond to \nan avian flu pandemic.\n  The bill we are introducing today--the Pandemic Preparedness and \nResponse Act or PPRA--incorporates much of my AVIAN Act, and has a \nnumber of new and important provisions, that will protect Americans \nfrom pandemic flu.\n  The PPRA establishes leadership at the very top level by requiring \nthe President to name a national director for Pandemic Preparedness and \nResponse, who will sit in the executive office. This director will be \nin charge of all preparedness and response activities at the national \nlevel, including coordinating the activities and programs of each \nFederal agency.\n  It is not enough for the Department of Health and Human Services and \nDepartment of Homeland Security to be ready; we must have a commerce \nplan, a transportation plan, a diplomatic plan aimed at our foreign \npartners, and a plan for our military personnel and veterans.\n  We have asked this director to procure enough antivirals to cover 50 \npercent of the populations, and sufficient vaccines and other supplies \nwe need for the Strategic National Stockpile. The director will also \ncreate a national tracking and distribution system to ensure the fair \nand equitable allocation of drugs and vaccines when the pandemic \nstrikes.\n  On the State level, we have asked the Director of the CDC and HRSA to \nwork with States and give them the help they need to make sure they are \nready to respond as well. Our success at preventing or containing an \noutbreak of avian flu will depend on the preparedness of our State and \nlocal partners.\n  Understanding that international collaboration and cooperation is key \nto surveillance and quick response, we have created an international \npandemic fund, and requested the Secretary of State develop and \nimplement a diplomatic policy aimed at the Southeast and East Asian \ncountries. Senator Lugar and I have been hard at work on this last \npoint for months.\n  Finally, we recognize that this Nation will never have enough \nvaccines, or the ability to produce sufficient vaccines, if we don't \ncreate the incentives for more drug manufacturers to get into the \nvaccine business. We just have three domestic flu vaccine \nmanufacturers, and that is unacceptable. This bill authorizes the \nSecretary to enhance vaccine production capacity by creating a \nguaranteed market for seasonal flu vaccine through a Federal buyback \nprogram for unsold doses of seasonal flu vaccine. It also increases \npublic education and outreach activities for Americans, to stimulate \ndemand for the seasonal flu vaccine.\n  An outbreak of the avian flu could occur in a year, 5 years, 10 \nyears, or if we were incredibly lucky not happen at all. But the one \ngood thing about investing in measures to deal with this looming crisis \nis--and I will end on this point--if we spend the money now, it will \npay dividends, even if this particular strain of the avian flu outbreak \ndoes not occur.\n  Why is this the case?\n  This is not--no pun intended--a case of Chicken Little.\n  The risk of some sort of pandemic, and the mutations of flus for \nwhich we have no immunity, is almost inevitable. The H5N1 strain may \nnot be the strain that leads to a full blown pandemic. But, another \nstrain could easily come along and cause serious damage in the future.\n  My point is this: undertaking these measures is going to be a wise \ninvestment that will help protect the lives of millions of people here \nin the United States and across the globe. This legislation gets at the \nheart of this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1822. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Security Act to \nmake improvements to the implementation of the medicare prescription \ndrug benefit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprotect low-income Medicare beneficiaries from being penalized under \nthe new Medicare Modernization Act. My legislation also gives all \nseniors and the disabled more time to make the right choice in \nselecting a drug plan.\n  My bill is called the Medicare HEALS Act, which stands for Help for \nEvery beneficiary and Low Income Seniors. I am pleased to be joined \ntoday by Senator Cantwell in introducing this new bill.\n  My goal is to protect very low-income seniors who today are covered \nby both Medicare and Medicaid. The new drug law will impose new co-\npayments and premiums on these vulnerable patients, while--at the same \ntime--covering fewer prescription drugs.\n  Worst of all, the law prohibits States from providing additional \ncoverage, known as wrap-around coverage, to seniors, the disabled and \nlow-income beneficiaries. I believe seniors deserve better. I believe \nlow income working families deserve better, and that's why I've written \nthis bill.\n  The new drug law will force painful changes on low income patients, \nand my bill will help protect our most vulnerable from the negative \nimpacts of the drug law.\n  Let's start by looking at how low-income beneficiaries are covered \ntoday versus how they will be covered under the new law. Today, very \nlow income seniors are eligible for coverage under both state Medicaid \nprograms and the Federal Medicare program, so they are often referred \nto as ``dual eligibles.''\n  Today, their prescription drugs are covered by State Medicaid \nprograms, and they are a good deal. For many seniors and the disabled, \nState Medicaid drug coverage involves limited co-payments, no premiums, \nand coverage for a broad range of medically-necessary drugs.\n  Once the new Medicare drug program is implemented, these vulnerable \npatients will lose their State Medicaid coverage. They will be shifted \ninto the Federal Medicare program, which will impose higher co-\npayments, new premiums and fewer covered drugs. It's a bad deal for \nlow-income seniors and to make matters worse, it's incredibly \ncomplicated to figure out which private drug plan meets their needs.\n  1 am concerned that these individuals will be unable to afford co-\npayments or tiered co-payments that will be part of many MMA plans.\n  I am concerned that these individuals will also be denied the most \nmedically-appropriate treatments due to restrictions imposed by the \nplans or additional financial burdens that plans will use to drive down \ndrug utilization costs.\n  In addition, I am not convinced that we have done enough to fully \neducate and prepare beneficiaries to the choices and implications of \nthese choices that they face today.\n  Another problem with the Medicare drug law is that it will penalize \nanyone on Medicare who needs extra time to make a decision about which \nplan to choose or whether or not to join the program. For a new system \nthat is as complex as this new drug law, it's unfair to force people to \nmake a decision quickly and to penalize those who need extra time to \nmake the right choice.\n  To solve these problems and to protect our most vulnerable, my \nlegislation would repeal the prohibition included in MMA on the use of \nMedicaid funds to provide wrap around coverage for dually eligible.\n  While I still believe that additional delay is warranted in switching \nthis population to private plans under Medicare, I do believe we need \nto ensure that States facing a huge backlash from this population can \nrespond accordingly.\n  I have joined in support of legislation aimed at providing a 6-month \ntransition period for dual eligibles to give these patients time to \nphase into these new plans, but I also think we must ensure that States \nhave the ability to respond to lapses in coverage or financial barriers \nthat will deny access to necessary and life saving drugs.\n  States would have the option of providing wrap-around coverage using \nboth Federal and State Medicaid funds, as they do today.\n  My legislation would also deduct any State funds used to provide \nwrap-around coverage from the so-called clawback amount. As we know, \nthe MMA legislation takes back much of the savings States will see by \ntransferring these patients to Medicare. I do\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\nnot think it is fair to penalize States for trying to do the right \nthing.\n  Finally, my legislation would delay the late penalty enrollment from \nMay 15, 2006 until January 1, 2008, for all beneficiaries. This will \ngive all Medicare beneficiaries the time to fully evaluate the plans. \nThe extension will provide beneficiaries with one full benefit year and \nthe open enrollment period to determine if these plans offer them a \ngood value or provide the kind of security we all expect from Medicare.\n  This extension is of particular importance to those seniors who may \nbe eligible for assistance but have not yet applied. We know that full \ndual eligibles will be automatically enrolled in a plan if they fail to \nselect one. However, those with incomes from 135 percent to 150 percent \nof the Federal poverty level could also qualify for assistance but will \nnot be automatically enrolled.\n  Early estimates from the Social Security Administration and the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) indicate that a number \nof seniors have failed to even apply for eligibility determination. I \nhave been told from CMS that 18 to 19 million beneficiaries were mailed \ninformation and an application this summer to begin the eligibility \ndetermination. So far, only 3 million have even applied.\n  A recent USA Today/Gallup Poll shows that only 37 percent of \nbeneficiaries understand the program somewhat, but 61 percent do not. \nFifty-four percent of beneficiaries do not even plan on joining the \nprogram. Many seniors have simply chosen not to even try and navigate \nthe process. For some, there are more than 20 different plans with \npremiums nationwide, ranging from $1.87 to $100 and deductibles from $0 \nto $250. This does not even get into restricted formularies or other \nrestrictions that may be imposed.\n  It is clear that all beneficiaries need more time. Extending the late \npenalty enrollment deadline of May 15, 2006 is the simplest step we can \ntake to give seniors time to evaluate these plans and this new benefit. \nThe late enrollment penalty of 1 percent each month is a huge financial \nhit that punishes those who may need the help the most.\n  In Washington State, we could see thousands of frail, vulnerable \nbeneficiaries paying significantly more for life saving drugs or simply \ngoing without. There are an estimated 86,167 full dual eligibles and an \nadditional 22,869 who receive some assistance from Medicaid. The intent \nof MMA and this new benefit was to expand access to affordable drug \ncoverage; however, the unintended consequence could be the disruption \nof care for millions of low income beneficiaries nationwide.\n\n  It is my understanding that dual eligibles in Washington State will \nbe automatically enrolled into 1 of 12 plans. There are 31 plans \nparticipating as Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). \nWithin these plans, there are often several different benefit packages. \nPremiums range from $0 to $120; deductibles can range from $0 to $2500; \nand many will have tiered co-payment structures. None of these plans \nwill cover all top 100 drugs used by seniors. Some plans provide only \n77 of the top 100 drugs.\n  While these plans may offer far better benefits than many receive \ntoday, it will be difficult to make this determination. The range of \nchoices; the restrictions; the variations in out-of-pocket and the \nbelief by many that this is not a good benefit overall, will lead many \nseniors to simply walk away.\n  But, even if seniors decide to sit down and do the calculation and \nevaluate each plan or option, they face challenges in the reliability \nof the information.\n  CMS has partnered with a number of outstanding groups in Washington \nState who are working hard to get information and help to seniors so \nthey can make informed choices. But the task is made much more \ndifficult when CMS announces that materials already mailed to \nbeneficiaries are incorrect.\n  My office received notice this week from CMS that the area specific \n2006 version of the ``Medicare and You Handbook'' already mailed to \nbeneficiaries contains a rather large error. The error occurs in the \ncomparison charts listing the Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). \nIn the last column of the comparison table, entitled ``If I qualify for \nExtra Help, will my full premium be covered?''\n  For each plan listed, the column should say yes if the plan's premium \nis at or below the regional benchmark, and a beneficiary who qualifies \nfor the low income subsidy would pay no premium for this plan.\n  The column should show no if the plan's premium is above the regional \nbenchmark and a beneficiary who qualifies for the low income subsidy \nwould pay the difference between the regional benchmark and the plan's \npremium.\n  Due to an error, this column lists yes for every plan. Even if one \ncould figure out what the regional benchmark is and the difference in \nthe premium, they are still getting bad information.\n  How can anyone determine the value of a plan or benefit when the \ninitial information is wrong?\n  There are other examples of information being provided by CMS that is \nincorrect or inconsistent. I think this has happened in part because \nthis administration is in a race against time to enroll, enroll, \nenroll. This kind of pressure will only lead to more and more confusion \nand distrust.\n  As we saw with the temporary discount drug card, seniors simply \nrefused to participate. Even those who would have qualified for $600 \ndid not bother to enroll. The largest enrollment was done by States and \nprivate plans for those who qualified for the subsidy, but far more \nsimply did not bother. The choices were too complex, there were too \nmany rules or restrictions, and there was no way for beneficiaries to \nmeasure the value of these cards.\n  My legislation does not address every problem and every coverage gap, \nbut it is a small step to protect the most vulnerable. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in making these small but necessary corrections \ntoday before beneficiaries lose their coverage and lose access to \naffordable life saving drugs.\n  I know that this administration has resisted any efforts at fixing \nthis program and has said the President would veto any legislation that \ndelays implementation or changes the structure of the benefit. But, I \nam convinced we will be back making changes to this program over the \nnext 2 years because seniors will demand action.\n  Maybe before all confidence in this program is gone and seniors are \ncalling for repeal, the administration would look at small, humane \nfixes today, and that is the Medicare HEALS Act offers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 1823. A bill to empower States and local governments to prosecute \nillegal aliens and to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nestablish a pilot Volunteer Border Marshal Program; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious \nthreat facing our Nation--illegal immigration. Despite successful \nefforts by me and other Members to increase border patrol forces, add \nnew detention facilities, and improve border monitoring, the problem of \nindividuals entering our country illegally continues to impact \ncommunities across the country. Just last year, the number of \nimmigrants entering our country illegally outnumbered those entering \nthrough legal means. While legal immigration contributes to the \ndiversity and uniqueness of our society, illegal immigration undermines \nthe system and weakens the legitimate process by which people can enter \nour country. With the Census Bureau estimating that 10 to 11 million \npeople reside in our country illegally, clearly our strategy in \nconfronting this issue must change.\n  Immigration and naturalization are constitutionally defined powers \ngranted to the Federal Government. As such, many view the issue of \nimmigration as strictly a Federal burden, to be addressed by Federal \nlegislation, policies, and payment. While immigration policy is \ncertainly initiated at the Federal level, one cannot ignore the \ninherent truth that the impact of illegal immigration is predominantly \nmanifested in our State and local communities, often in the form of \noverwhelmed emergency rooms, overburdened school systems, and \novercrowded prisons. Our local communities often find themselves with \nlittle recourse or ability to address the pervasive and crippling \neffects of a broken immigration system. These effects, of course, are \nnot confined to our southern border regions,\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\nbut rather they reverberate across the country.\n  The country's immigration system is long overdue for a comprehensive \noverhaul, and I commend the efforts being made by a number of my \ncolleagues to generate attention to the need for comprehensive \nimmigration reform. Ideas are being proposed to improve avenues for \nlegal immigration, enhance enforcement capabilities, and address the \ngrowing presence of illegal immigrants with nationalities other than \nMexican. While I applaud these proposals and eagerly await our \nopportunity to discuss them, I believe it is essential that we \nrecognize the role our State and local communities can have in \naddressing illegal immigration, particularly when it comes to the area \nof enforcement. As such, I am introducing legislation today to solidify \nthe right and opportunity of our State and local governments to enforce \nthe law--immigration law.\n  Historically, the authority for State and local law enforcement \nofficials to enforce immigration law has been limited to the criminal \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act; these include acts \nsuch as physically crossing the border illegally. By contrast, the \nenforcement of the act's civil provisions, which include apprehension \nand removal of deportable aliens already in the country, has been \nstrictly a Federal responsibility, with States playing an incidental \nsupporting role. This view was recently reinforced when a community in \nNew Hampshire attempted to prosecute illegal immigrants for criminal \ntrespass but was thwarted when a judge ruled it was constitutionally \nimpermissible, stating that Congress has exclusive jurisdiction on \ncivil immigration issues.\n\n  Enforcing the laws of our country should not be confined to Federal \nauthorities when the illegal behavior specifically impacts the State \nand local communities. Just as State and local officials can arrest, \ndetain, and prosecute for illicit drug violations, so they should be \nable to for illegal immigration violations. The legislation I propose \ntoday would enable State and local officials to arrest, detain, and \nprosecute illegal immigrants for all Federal immigration violations, \nboth civil and criminal, and would authorize States to create \nimmigration enforcement provisions in accordance with Federal \nimmigration law. My proposal preserves the Federal Government's \nconstitutionally delegated authority to determine immigration status, a \ndetermination to which the States would defer. Allowing communities to \ntake enforcement actions based on their own needs, while working within \nlimits set under Federal law, is sound, appropriate policy.\n  Further, in order to strengthen border security and reduce the strain \non local and Federal border officials, my bill allows the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to create a Volunteer Border Marshal Program The \nprogram will assist the Department in securing our borders by using \ntrained, State-licensed peace officers in a volunteer capacity. These \nvolunteers would be assigned to the Border Patrol on temporary missions \nto identify and control illegal immigration, as well as human and drug \ntrafficking.\n  In order to properly tackle the problem of illegal immigration, \nFederal, State, and local authorities must work as partners. Our \ncommunities must have the tools necessary to fight it effectively. My \nlegislation will empower States and communities with a new weapon to \ncombat illegal immigration and thereby reinforce our legal \nnaturalization process. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nsensible approach to addressing this serious problem. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Illegal Immigration \n     Enforcement and Empowerment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE ENFORCEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State or unit of local government may \n     investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain, prosecute, \n     and impose criminal or civil penalties upon any individual \n     who violates--\n       (1) a Federal immigration law; or\n       (2) a State law that is based, in part, upon the violation \n     of Federal immigration law.\n       (b) Limitation.--Criminal penalties imposed under \n     subsection (a) may not exceed the penalties authorized under \n     section 275(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1325(a)).\n       (c) Federal Determination of Immigration Status.--No \n     penalty may be imposed upon an individual under this section \n     unless the individual has been identified by the Federal \n     Government as having violated a Federal immigration law.\n\n     SEC. 3. VOLUNTEER BORDER MARSHAL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     may establish a pilot Volunteer Border Marshal Program \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Program'').\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Program is to assist the \n     Department of Homeland Security in securing the borders of \n     the United States in a safe and orderly manner by using \n     volunteer, State-licensed peace officers who are already well \n     trained.\n       (c) Assignments.--Upon deployment, the volunteer peace \n     officers shall be sworn in as Special United States Border \n     Marshals and shall be assigned to the Office of Border \n     Patrol, which shall be act as the lead agency of the Program.\n       (d) Rotations.--The volunteer peace officers shall rotate \n     on temporary missions along the international borders of the \n     United States to assist the Office of Border Patrol in \n     identifying and controlling illegal immigration and human and \n     drug trafficking.\n       (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``peace \n     officer'' means any law enforcement agent, whether currently \n     employed or retired, who is licensed by a State authority to \n     enforce State or local penal offenses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1824. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstrengthen the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Strengthen the \nEarned Income Tax Credit Act of 2005. Since 1975, the EITC has been an \ninnovative tax credit which helps low-income working families. \nPresident Reagan referred to the EITC as ``the best antipoverty, the \nbest pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of \nCongress.'' According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nthe EITC lifts more children out of poverty than any other government \nprogram.\n  It is time for us to reexamine the EITC and determine where we can \nstrengthen it. Census data released in August and the events of \nHurricane Katrina reiterated the fact that there is a group of \nAmericans that are not benefiting from the economic recovery. The \nCensus data shows the number of people who work, but live in poverty \nincreased by 563,000. Four million more people were poor in 2004 than \nin 2001, when the economy hit bottom. The poverty rate in 2004 remains \nhigher than the rate in 2001, the year of the recession.\n  Hurricane Katrina affected many individuals who were already faced \nwith difficult economic situations. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama \nare the first, second, and eighth poorest States in the Nation. The \nincome of the typical household in these three States is well below the \nnational average. In the hardest hit counties, 18.6 percent of the \npopulation is poor and the national average is 12.4 percent.\n  Time after time, the Republican controlled Congress has passed tax \ncuts which are skewed towards those with the most. The Urban Institute-\nBrookings Institution Tax Policy Center reports that households with \nincomes of more than $1 million a year--the richest two-tenths of the \npopulation--receive tax cuts of an average of $103,000 a year. These \nindividuals do not have to worry about how they will have to pay for a \nroof over their heads or enough gas to fill the tank. We should not be \nfocused on tax cuts which help those who do not have to worry about \nliving pay check to pay check.\n  We need to help the low-income workers who struggle day after day \ntrying to make ends meet. They have been left behind in the economic \npolicies of the last 4 years. We need to begin a discussion on how to \nhelp those that have been left behind. The Earned Income Tax Credit is \nthe perfect place to start.\n  The Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2005 strengthens \nthe EITC by making the following four changes: Reduce marriage penalty; \nincrease the credit for families with\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\nthree or more children; slow down the phase-out for individuals with no \nchildren; and permanently extend the provision which allows members of \nthe armed forces to include combat pay as income for EITC computations. \nBy making these changes, more individuals and families would benefit \nfrom the EITC.\n  First, the legislation increases marriage penalty relief and makes it \npermanent. In the way that the EITC is currently structured, many \nsingle individuals that marry find themselves faced with a reduction in \ntheir EITC once they are married. The tax code should not penalize \nindividuals who marry.\n  Second, the legislation increases the credit for families with three \nor more children. This proposal would make the credit more generous for \nfamilies with 3 or more children. Increasing the credit rate results in \nan increase in the phase-out range. More families would be able to \nbenefit from the EITC. The poverty level for an adult living with three \nchildren is $19,233. Under current law, an adult living with three \nchildren and eligible for the maximum EITC with income equivalent to \nthe phase-out income level would still have income below the poverty \nlevel. This provision would lift this family above the poverty level. \nSome 36 percent of all children live in families with at least three \nchildren and more than half of poor children live in such families.\n  Third, the legislation would slow down the phase-out rate for \nindividuals without children. It would result in more individuals \nwithout children eligible for the credit. For 2005, an individual with \nearnings above $11,750 would not be eligible for the EITC. Under the \nproposal, an individual with earnings above $16,950 would not be \neligible for the EITC. The EITC for individuals with no children only \noffsets a portion of federal taxes. Giving more individuals the EITC \nwould help provide an incentive to work.\n  Fourth, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 included a \nprovision which would treat combat pay as earned income for purposes of \ncomputing the child credit. This provision expires at the end of the \nyear. This legislation makes this provision permanent. There is no \nreason why a member of the armed services should lose their EITC when \nthey are mobilized and serving their country.\n  This legislation will help those who most need our help. It will put \nmore money in their pay check. We need to invest in our families and \nhelp individuals who want to make a living by working. We are all aware \nof our fiscal situation and we should legislate in a responsible \nmanner. It is a time for shared sacrifice. We do not need to extend tax \ncuts or allow tax cuts to go forward that only benefit those earning \nover $200,000. We cannot keep adding to the deficit\n  Thank you for your consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11142-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 265--RECOGNIZING 2005 AS THE YEAR OF THE 50TH \n           ANNIVERSARY OF THE CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I understand we are now in morning \nbusiness. I ask unanimous consent that immediately upon the disposition \nof the Defense appropriations bill, on which we just voted cloture, \nthat immediately following the vote on that bill that the Senate return \nto consideration of S. 1716, which is a bill by Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus to provide emergency health care relief to the many \nvictims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita throughout the gulf coast and \nthe needs of States throughout the Nation. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be brought up for consideration right after the final vote on \nthe Defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will object shortly. As the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana knows, the issue we are talking about is one \nthat is very close to me, one on which she and I have had many \nconversations because it goes right to the heart of health care for \nhundreds of thousands of people. It is an issue we have to address. I \npersonally have spent about an hour and a half today on this issue with \nthe chairman and many others. We are not there yet. I pledge to keep \nworking on this issue. I understand the time urgency of it.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Louisiana knows, there are several \nobjections on our side, and on behalf of those colleagues, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, may I ask the majority leader a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Through the Chair, first of all, I appreciate the work \nthat he has been doing behind the scenes with the leadership in the \nSenate to press forward on this very important issue. But I would like \nto ask him what he thinks about the possibility of us going home on \nbreak for over a week before something can be determined definitively \nas to whether people who are without a home, without a job, without a \nchurch, without a neighborhood, without their family--does the Senator \nthink we should possibly make some decisions at least about their \nemergency health care needs before we leave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the issue of health care and health care \ndelivery among peoples who have lost their homes, who have lost \nshelters, security, family members, is something we need to address \nquickly, expeditiously, and we are going to continue to work on it.\n  At the same time, I wish to say to the American people who are \nlistening to me--and the Senator from Louisiana and I have had the \nopportunity to travel together over the region she is about to discuss, \nand I observed firsthand. Those people now are getting health care, and \nhealth care is not being denied anybody. It cannot be denied, and it \nwill not be denied. The real issue is to make sure that compensation \nfor that health care does flow and does flow in a timely fashion to \nwhere the patient is displaced or to the State of Louisiana or it might \nbe Alabama or Mississippi. How that is done most appropriately and \nfairly where the funds can follow the individual and follow the \npatient, the family, is what is being addressed.\n  The issue is not as to whether or not health care is being provided. \nHealth care is being provided. It is available to those people who need \nit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to proceed with a couple of items of \nbusiness, and then I know that the Senator from Louisiana has the floor \nand has a number of very important things to address.\n  I should also say that Senator Landrieu and I have been in discussion \nover the course of today on a number of issues that she provided in a \nletter to me which addresses health care issues, small business issues, \neducation issues, and community disaster loans. I continue to \naggressively address all four of those issues with my colleagues as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11165-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The Chair, on behalf of the President pro tempore, pursuant to Public \nLaw 106-398, as amended by Public Law 108-7, in accordance with the \nqualifications specified under section 1238(b)(3)(E) of Public Law 106-\n398, and upon the recommendation of the Democratic leader, in \nconsultation with the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices and the Senate Committee on Finance, reappoints the following \nindividuals to the United States-China Economic Security and Review \nCommission: C.

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the issue \nthat the Senator from Louisiana is going to talk about, but I do not \nwant to take any of her time away from her. I know it is late in the \nevening but if I could, I will say a few words before leaving the \nfloor. I hope that my Senate colleagues who are following this debate \nand conversation, as well as those who are viewing these proceedings, \nunderstand what my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu, and \nher colleague, Senator Vitter have been through.\n  They have faced a disaster virtually unprecedented in modern American \nhistory. Having been through a few minor disasters and floods in my \narea, I cannot imagine the stress that they have been under to serve \nthe public, which is their responsibility in the Senate. Though I do \nnot know Senator Vitter as well, nor have I known him as long, I can \ncertainly attest to his concern for the people of Louisiana. I can \nspeak personally about the concern of Senator Landrieu.\n  From the moment I got her on the telephone--and it was not an easy \ntask--while she was still fighting flood waters in her hometown of New \nOrleans, until this moment today, she has been consumed with one \nfocused objective, what she can do to spare the suffering of the people \nshe represents and to rebuild and recover from this terrible disaster.\n  I visited New Orleans a few weeks ago with a bipartisan delegation, \nmet with her as well as Commander Allen, who is heading up the FEMA \neffort now, as well as Governor Blanco and Mayor Nagin, many of them \nlocal officials. It is clear now that they have faced challenges that \nmost public servants do not dream of. The reason we are here tonight is \nbecause she is reaching the end of her patience. I have talked to her \nduring the course of this day, and I know what is boiling up inside of \nher.\n  The thought that we would leave Washington, the capital of our \nNation, for a week or 10 days and be back in our home States is a real \nconcern to her because she knows while we are gone, people in Louisiana \nwill continue to suffer because of our inaction and our unwillingness \nto respond to the basics. Look at what has happened so far. The \nadministration announces initially no-bid contracts to some of the most \nrecognizable big hitters in Washington, corporations that always seem \nto win when others are facing misfortune.\n\n  The administration says it is going to cut the wages for construction \nworkers who are going back to work to rebuild in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, exactly the opposite of what these families \nneed to get back on their feet.\n  The administration has refused to come forward with the emergency \nhousing that is needed for so many of these people who are literally at \ntheir wits' end, trying to keep their families together, living in the \nmost extreme circumstances.\n  This Senator from Louisiana has been on the floor repeatedly, \nappealing to both sides of the aisle, but particularly to the majority, \nfor help with health care for the people who have been displaced. \nSomeone lucky enough to have health insurance when Hurricane Katrina \nhit may have lost not only their home but also their job and their \nhealth insurance, and now they are adrift. Senator Landrieu has been \nworking with Senator Grassley, a Republican, and Senator Baucus, a \nDemocrat, to make certain they have health care coverage. It is not \nenough to say if they show up in an emergency room, somebody will \nprobably take care of them. Is that what you would like your medical \nfuture to be for you and your family? That is not what Senator Landrieu \nwants and that is what she is fighting to change.\n  We have also seen the suggestion we cut back on cash payments to \npeople who have no job, may not even have access to the unemployment \nchecks or whatever they are entitled to at this moment.\n  I think one of the worst and crowning blows is this notion that \nsomehow every penny we put into rebuilding America, rebuilding the Gulf \nCoast States--New Orleans, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--has to \nbe paid for by cutting other programs that may help poor people. Today \nthe Agriculture Committee is considering cuts in food stamps, $500 \nmillion or $600 million in cuts in food stamps so we can provide help \nto Hurricane Katrina victims. So we will literally take food from the \nmouths of babies and mothers and families across America to give them \nto the babies and mothers and families of Hurricane Katrina? Is that \nwhat it has come to in America?\n  The suggestion we would cut Medicaid, the health insurance for the \npoor and elderly and disabled in America, so we can provide that same \nMedicaid, that same health insurance for the poor and elderly and \ndisabled and dislocated in Hurricane Katrina, is that what it has come \nto in America?\n  I think what troubles me the most is the situation here where there \nis an insistence by some of my colleagues that every penny we spend \ninvesting in rebuilding the Gulf Coast States has to be met by a cut in \nspending for the most vulnerable people in America. None of these \npeople who are insisting on this match of cut for spending said that \nwhen we were talking about rebuilding Iraq--$18 billion, without a \nsingle dollar of it set off against any cut in spending. Not one of \nthem brought up this idea of cutting spending to give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in America. But when it comes to the most vulnerable, \nthose helpless victims of this hurricane in those States, they are \ndemanding this setoff that, frankly, will make life more painful and \ndifficult for vulnerable people all across America.\n  This is a real test of who we are and what we stand for. If we are \ntruly in this together, if we are going to be unified as a nation and \nreact as a community and as a family, we can do better. America can do \nbetter. I salute the Senator from Louisiana. I will turn the floor over \nto her, thank her for her leadership, and say this Senator and many \nothers will fight with you to the bitter end to make sure the people \nyou represent understand that they do not stand alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois, who \nhas been such a champion for people in need, for people who need their \nGovernment to step up and to be with them in times of difficulty. That \nis what governments are all about.\n  We appreciate the self-sufficiency of people. We appreciate the value \nof upward mobility. We appreciate the values of family that Illinois \nand Louisiana treasure, about moving forward. But we also understand \nwhen life throws you a curve ball, when you are hit by a monster storm, \nwhen the home you have worked for all your life and might in fact have \nbeen paid for is literally washed away before your eyes; when the \nbusiness that your father or your mother handed down to you and you \nbuilt up to be something to be proud of, to turn over to your children, \nis gone in the flickering of an eye; when your child is in an accident \nand it was unexpected and the health insurance doesn't pay for it and \nyou have a child now who is in great need--you would think we would \nhave a government that would not question whether we should be there to \nhelp.\n  We would say: Of course. This is America. This is what we do. We help \neach other through difficult times. That is the way the country used to \nbe. That is the country I grew up in. But I am standing here now on the \nfloor at a quarter to 11 on Wednesday night. We are getting ready to \npass a very important bill. We, the other Senator from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter, and I, have been patient--persistent but patient over \nthe 31 days since this first hurricane hit Louisiana and devastated our \nlargest city and rocked the whole southern part of our State back on \nits heels. We have been to countless meetings, countless conferences, \ncountless telephone conversations, countless visits back to our State \nand region, visiting from shelters to briefing rooms. We have outlined \nwhat we need. I have to stand here now at a quarter to 11 on\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\na Wednesday night with the idea that Congress is basically prepared to \ngo home and do nothing other than what we have done, which is give $62 \nbillion to an agency that does not work.\n  That is where we are. Thirty-one days after the worst natural \ndisaster in the history of the country, the subsequent breaking of a \nlevee system that is primarily the fault of the Federal Government--not \nonly but primarily the fault of the Federal Government from decades of \nneglect and disinvestment, disengagement, and disinterest--and I have \nto go tell my constituents that people in Congress needed a break and \nwe had to go home, and the only thing we could do is give $62 billion \nto the agency about which the only thing we all seem to agree, \nRepublican and Democrat, House and Senate, is that it doesn't work.\n  I sent a letter--I have sent many, but this is another letter--to the \nleadership, to say:\n\n       Although a month has passed since Hurricane Katrina \n     destroyed the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands \n     of Americans, survivors of this disaster and Hurricane Rita \n     [throughout Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama] still \n     await direct federal assistance.\n\n  They are not getting much direct Federal assistance because the \nassistance has gone to FEMA. FEMA is not resourced, organized or \nprepared to handle it, so people are not getting the money.\n  So, instead of doing something before we leave to actually get the \nmoney to people it could help, we may do nothing.\n  In order to provide immediate relief to millions of Americans, I am \nsuggesting that part of the FEMA money be reallocated. There is $43 \nbillion tonight--we checked today--of the $61 billion or so we have \nappropriated. There is about $43 billion sitting there, $43 billion the \ntaxpayers have already appropriated, we have already voted for, sitting \nthere.\n  Some of us are suggesting that we take a few billion of that $43 \nbillion that is sitting there doing nothing and do something important \nwith it, such as send signals to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama \nthat they could be reimbursed for their hospital and health care \nexpenses for the 2 million people who have been displaced from their \nhomes, from their neighborhoods, from their church communities, so \nthere would be no question that they could get that reimbursement and \nStates could begin planning how to provide critical health needs.\n  The Senator from Tennessee said that everyone will be getting health \nbenefits. If you are a middle-income family and had private health \ninsurance with your employer, and your employer went out of business, \nyou don't continue with that health care unless we pass all or part of \nthe Baucus-Grassley bill that provides a way for that health care to be \ncontinued.\n  The Senator says you can get health care. Yes, you could go stand in \nline in an emergency room and wait for a day, 2 or 3 days. The lines \nwere long before Katrina, and after Katrina and Rita, I had a mother \ntell me she waited 2 days with her child with cerebral palsy in her \narms--for 2 days trying to get health care.\n  Unfortunately, many people go to the emergency room to get health \ncare. But in this case, we have many people who don't usually get their \nhealth care from emergency rooms that need the Grassley-Baucus bill to \nbe able to extend their private coverage at a reasonable and affordable \nrate until we can figure out a better way to keep them with health \ninsurance, get them back in their jobs, get them back into homes, and \ndecide how to do that.\n  That is why I sent a letter today saying I think we should act on the \nEmergency Health Care Relief Act--not 2 weeks from now, not a month \nfrom now, but right now. Take a few billion dollars and instead of \nletting it sit there doing nothing under the FEMA headline, take this \nmoney and use it for health care.\n  In addition, we have had 71,000 small businesses at a minimum--it \ncould be more--71,000 small businesses, from restaurants to small \nmanufacturing shops to high-tech businesses to agricultural-related \nbusinesses to art stores. I could go on and on and on. These are people \nwho worked their whole lives to create a business for themselves and \ntheir children. They may employ three or four people. But it was a \nsuccessful business. They were proud of their business. The business is \ngone.\n  Instead of Congress acting to help small business through the Small \nBusiness Administration, we have decided we want to give all the money \nto FEMA. If FEMA gives it to small businesses, fine; if they do not, OK \nwith us. We are going home for 2 weeks.\n  So I sent the letter saying, Could we take some of that FEMA money--\nthey have $43 billion--just $720 million of the FEMA money and give it \nto the Small Business Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act, \nsponsored not by Democrats but by the Republicans, by the chairman of \nthe committee, the very able Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, who 2 \nweeks ago moved a bill out of her committee at the request of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and because of the need of small businesses in \nthe gulf coast, moved a tight, comprehensive, direct package. But, no, \nwe can't do that. We have to go home without helping our small \nbusinesses.\n  When I was on the committee the Small Business Administration \ntestified. This was a week ago. They said 25,000 businesses had put in \napplications for aid and they had approved seven. That was last week.\n  I think that we should do anything we can do to give some money to \nthe Small Business Administration, through already approved law--\nnothing new on the books--that they asked for, that the Republican \nchairman of the Senate committee said absolutely this is what we should \ndo, with the ranking member, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, agreeing. It passed unanimously out of our committee. We have \nvery liberal members of our committee, and very conservative members of \nour committee who passed this unanimously, but for some reason we can't \ndo this before we leave because the House leadership and the \nadministration don't think that this help for small business is an \nemergency.\n  I might want them to call some of the 71,000 small businesses that \ndon't have their business any longer and ask them if they could wait \nanother few weeks for no reason, just because we can't manage to get a \nbill that passed unanimously over here, for the White House or someone \nin the administration to say, you know, that would be a good idea. FEMA \nis not working so well. While we try to work on getting FEMA to work \nbetter, it would make sense to us to take $720 million of the $43 \nbillion that FEMA has and get it to the small businesses to help.\n  Another part of this letter is $3.3 billion for immediate funding for \nelementary, secondary, and postsecondary relief for children. We go to \nschool early in the South. Up here around Washington people do not go \nto school until after September. But down South, we all go back to \nschool around the middle of August. In Louisiana and Mississippi and \nAlabama, kids that just finished with their new backpacks, got in their \nlittle uniforms, parents are excited, kids are excited, they had just \nstarted school the week before the hurricane.\n  Then, on August 29th, Katrina, a category 4 or 5 hurricane, with 165-\nmile-an-hour winds, slammed into the gulf coast and destroyed hundreds \nof schools--public, private, parochial.\n  The superintendents, in their self-reliant way, started making phone \ncalls and saying 250,000 children need to go to school. So they start \nmaking all kinds of arrangements, principals and teachers, mothers and \nfathers without much money, having lost their home and in some cases \ntheir business, scrambling to find schools to put their kids in. Why? \nBecause a smart, good educator from Louisiana, the superintendent, who \nis universally admired in our State, said to people 12 days after the \nstorm, You might have lost everything, but if you still have your \nchildren, do me a favor. Get them in school because it will bring \nnormalcy to them. It will calm them from this tragedy, and it will \nprovide some order for your family.\n  Wealthy people had many options. Middle-income people had fewer \noptions, but they kind of made it work. The poor have struggled with \nthis issue.\n  Our States have said it has been a month. We know there are 250,000 \nchildren, just elementary and school-age kids, that are enrolled in \nother schools,\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\nstrange schools. Children have been doing beautifully though, showing \nup to a brand new school, sometimes without any of their friends with \nthem.\n  I have been through the shelters. I have seen the children leave, I \nhave seen them come back. They are doing a great job.\n  The only people not doing very well are the Members of Congress on \nthe House side and the administration that can't seem to find $3 \nbillion to let the States know that those children's tuition will be \npaid for. Maybe public schools can survive this. Maybe public schools \njust know: I am a public school and I know I am going to get our money. \nBut what about the parochial schools?\n  Let me also remind you that these schools are employers. They employ \nteachers and support staff. Maybe they can wait until January, but \nsince the administration has said we want to give help--$4,000 a child \nor up to $7,500 per child to make sure the States of Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Texas are whole--we should allow the schools \nthat have taken in these children to be compensated at some great \nexpense to the schools that were already full.\n\n  Let's take the State of Arkansas. They took 75,000 people; maybe they \nhave 25,000 children or maybe only 20,000 children. Those children have \ngone to schools in Arkansas. They have taken them in. Those schools \nhave not received one penny for those children and are not quite sure \nif they will. They have taken them in anyway, though. The parents do \nnot know if their children are going to be paid for or if they will \nhave to pick up a second tuition. Some of them have already paid \ntuition for the school they were in before the hurricane hit.\n  I am wondering, why is this complicated? The administration has said \nthey are for it. Lamar Alexander, Senator Kennedy, two Republicans, and \na Democrat have pretty much agreed on how to do this. It only costs $3 \nbillion. Again, we would just as soon take it from FEMA since they are \nnot doing very well with the money we have given them. It wouldn't cost \nus anything and we would get that done for our States, something \npositive and concrete. But, no, we have to go home.\n  The fourth thing in the letter we sent today was to see if we could \nget some direct funding, $1.5 billion we say here, for just 3 months, \nit would just cover about 3 months of basic payroll for sheriff \ndepartments, for police, for fire fighters in the cities and counties \nand parishes that were the hardest hit.\n  Today, in the city of New Orleans--and this is a picture of one \nneighborhood--the headline in our hometown newspaper is that the city \nis to lay off 3,000 city employees. When a city has been destroyed, as \nthis picture indicates, and people in your city look like this picture, \nwhich can be seen all over south Louisiana--this is what most homes in \nthe southern part of Mississippi and throughout south Louisiana look \nlike. Whatever town, county, or city she lives in, you can obviously \ntell she will not be paying any sales tax. If you could see a broader \npicture, there are no stores standing where, if she could get up and \nwalk, she could buy something and pay sales tax. Obviously, she will \nnot be paying any ad valorem tax on this house.\n  Counties and parishes all over south Louisiana made their payrolls in \nAugust. They made their first payroll in September. They made their \nsecond payroll the end of September. They have no revenues coming in. \nThey come here and ask for $1.5 billion and are told: Why don't you go \nback and tighten your numbers a little bit. Why don't you go back and \njust see if there is any way this lady could pay a little tax. I have \nnever seen or heard anything like this in my life.\n  FEMA has $43 billion unallocated. Throughout the entire region, they \nhave no sales tax to operate, no property tax to operate, and are \ngetting ready to declare bankruptcy. And Congress says, they have to \ntighten their numbers. If we give them the money in New Orleans, if we \ngive the money to them under current law, we have to pay it back.\n  How is New Orleans or Waveland or anyplace that looks like this, how \nare they going to pay any money back? If we do not get this law changed \nbefore we leave, the only money New Orleans could get under the current \nlaw, which is why we keep saying FEMA is not working--under the current \nlaw a city or county can get a maximum of $5 million by loan, which \nthey have to pay back.\n  Do you know how much the annual operating monthly payroll is for the \ncity of New Orleans? It is $40 million. How would the $5 million help \nthe city of New Orleans to stay in business when in 1 month they spend \n$40 million just on operating expenses for the city that looks like \nthis? I come and ask for $40 million for 1 month and get told it is too \nmuch to ask for? Don't ask for too much, Senator.\n  OK, well, we will ask for just 3 months of operating expenses for \nsome of these communities. I suggest if you are giving tax credits to \nget people to come back, you might need a city they can come back to, \nor a county they can come back to that is actually operating. I don't \nknow too many businesses that want to operate in a place with no police \nprotection, no fire protection, no sewer, no water, and limited utility \nmaintenance for electricity because the city is shut down. Maybe there \nis a community like that somewhere in the world or in America, but I \ndon't know of one. Even people who live in rural areas--and I have been \nout to Montana, Idaho, and beautiful places in the West where you never \nsee anyone--have a beautiful ranch in the middle of nowhere, and there \nis a fire department that would come if their ranch caught on fire.\n  We have cities and communities on the gulf coast that are letting \ntheir police and their firemen go, and we are sitting around passing \ntax credits.\n  I am sure this woman could use some of the tax credits we have \npassed. I have not figured out exactly which one, but I will work on \nthat tomorrow, something she might particularly benefit from.\n  I have sheriff's departments, cities, counties, and parishes that do \nnot know how they will make payroll. FEMA has $43 billion, and I cannot \nget $1.5 billion to help them stay in business. Anything we might do in \nDecember could actually work.\n  I don't know how to express any more the tragedy and the magnitude of \nthis disaster. I hope perhaps some people listening would pick up the \nspecial edition of National Geographic, ``Why It Became a Man-made \nDisaster, Where It Could Happen Next.'' The pictures are hard to look \nat. The text is even more difficult to read--not because the words are \nlarge but because it makes you so sick when you read it because it was \navoidable.\n  This was all avoidable, but there were many failures along the way at \nthe national level, at the State level, at the local level. I hope we \ncan learn from what we did so people do not think: Well, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana is just talking about the people from Louisiana.\n  Let me read you the last page, which is why I am spending time on the \nfloor, why I am going to stay on this floor, why I am going to push \nthis issue, so we get something for the people of Louisiana and the \ngulf coast before we leave, something for their health care or \nsomething for their education or something for their small business or \nsomething for their police and fire departments, something for their \noperating budgets, so we can have something to work with when we get \nback.\n  But the reason I am also pressing it is because I know, as sure as I \nam standing here, there is going to be another disaster. If we do not \nfix FEMA, if we do not fix some of these systems and set a precedent--\nnot a precedent because it is already in the law; but actually act on \nwhat the law already says, which is all we are asking, not anything \nnew; but we are setting a precedent by acting on what the Federal \nGovernment already has--it is going to happen to someone else. And I am \nlikely to tell you now who that someone else is going to be.\n  The next Katrina? According to NOAA--which is the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration--meteorologist Joe Golden, the five \nplaces in the United States at greatest risk for a calamitous hurricane \nare Tampa Bay, FL--heads up, Senators from Florida--Mobile, AL--heads \nup, delegation from Alabama--Houston, TX--heads up to the Texas \ndelegation--New York City and Long Island, NY, and Miami, FL.\n  This is a picture of the likely areas of threat in the dark color on \nthis map in\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\nthe National Geographic article. So not only do we have to get this \nright for the gulf coast, which has been hit hard and knocked down--but \nnot knocked out--we have to fix this so it does not happen again, and \nif it does, the people of Florida do not have to suffer the way the \npeople of Louisiana and Mississippi have had to suffer; so the people \nof New York would not have to go through what we went through.\n  But I do not know if I have hope about that because also in National \nGeographic they remind us of something that I knew of as a kid. \nEverybody in Louisiana knows about it. It was Hurricane Betsy--the \nlargest natural disaster in the history of the country. There is a \nhurricane that all the old-timers know about that hit in 1965, \nHurricane Betsy. It flooded a great area of the metropolitan area, \nPlaquemines Parish, Saint Bernard Parish, and the Lower Nine, which was \nalso terribly affected by Katrina.\n  As a result of Betsy, the Federal Government did the same thing. \nPresident Lyndon Johnson came down at the request actually of Senator \nRussell Long from Louisiana who said: Please come, see what has \nhappened, and help us.\n  President Johnson, I am proud to say, came down and seemed to do more \nthan we are doing now. I have a memo I am going to submit for the \nRecord that he himself wrote--that I got from the Lyndon Baines Johnson \nLibrary today--upon his return, as he indicated to Congress what needed \nto be done. Maybe this would inspire us to do more.\n  Anyway, that hurricane occurred. We set out to build a levee system, \na bold, aggressive plan for a levee system. But somewhere along the way \nthat plan fell by the wayside. Congress got distracted. Other \npriorities came up. Even though our delegation, decade after decade, \nRepublican and Democrat, pleaded, begged, and used our own political \nchits to add money to the executive budget every year for levees and \nflood protection and important dredging projects, it was never a \npromise that was fulfilled.\n  So we find ourselves, 40 years after Betsy, having basically a \ncollapse of a levee system. I would like to be optimistic, but I am not \nsure I can be, because in 1927 the great flood before Betsy did the \nsame thing. The picture I have in the Chamber is eerily the same, \nexcept there is no overpass. This first picture was taken in 1927. This \nother one was taken in 2005. You would think that a sophisticated \ncountry such as ours--sophisticated governments such as ours--would \nunderstand that every now and then you have to make smart investments \nand smart decisions about levee protection and about growth.\n  So I am hoping, since we had this once in 1927, we flooded again in \nthe 1960s, and now in 2005, we could learn some lessons about how to \nprevent this because it is preventable. We are not the only people in \nthe world who live below sea level. There are examples all over the \nEarth of people who have to live close to the water for trade and \ncommerce purposes who have managed to discipline themselves, restrain \nthemselves, wisely spend their money, and invest it in the protections \nthat their homeowners and their businesses and their people need to \nhave a long and prosperous and safe existence.\n  But we did not learn it in 1927 sufficiently. We did not learn it in \n1965. And I am hoping today we can learn it in 2005.\n  Before we build the levee system, though, we have to face the \nimmediate issues, which is why we sent this letter to the leadership, \nwhy I have said: Let's not go home until we take some money from FEMA, \nwhich has $43 billion and is not spending it very well. And everyone \nagrees with that. There is not a person in Congress now who is \ndefending the way FEMA is distributing this money. It is not because \nthey do not have some good people at FEMA. I have met many of them. \nThey are caring and compassionate individuals.\n  But FEMA is not organized to manage this crisis, and they are the \nagency that should be coordinating it. They are not resourced. They are \nnot staffed. They are not organized because they were put in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, stripped of much of their \nindependence. Their budget was slashed. Most of the people who knew how \nto run disasters either left or were asked to leave. So they have a \ngroup of people who are not as experienced, not as well organized, and \nnot prepared.\n  As a result, our people in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are \nsuffering. So instead of complaining more about it, which we have done \nad nauseam almost for 31 days, we said: OK, let's move on here. Let's \ntake some of the money that is not being used and direct it immediately \nto things that would really make a difference in people's lives and, \nmost importantly, would send a positive signal that help is on the way.\n  So I do not know why we are not able to do this, which is why I have \ncalled up this bill, the Grassley-Baucus bill, why I am going to push \nand insist and use all the power I have as a Senator from this State of \nLouisiana, with anyone else, Republican or Democrat, who will help to \ntry to get this message to the White House, to the House leadership: \nPlease do not abandon the people of Louisiana again, and the people of \nMississippi again, and the people of Alabama again by leaving before we \ndo something to help them in a direct and concrete manner.\n  Now, there have been a lot of press releases issued. I will submit \nthose for the Record. There are lots of messages that people give out, \nthat people are asked to say--things like: The President has called on \nall Americans to help those in need; the President has asked for this; \nSo and so has asked for this; please tell people they are not alone.\n  We have programs such as the opportunity zones, urban homesteading. I \nthink there is some merit in some of this that has been proposed. I am \nnot opposed to exploring options for anything to encourage home \nownership. But right now our State, the city of New Orleans, cannot \nkeep people on the payroll. If we do not do something immediately to \ngive money to our local governments, to sheriffs, to first responders, \nfor firefighters, I do not know how anything else we do is going to \nmatter because there will not be a city to do it in, or there will not \nbe a county that is functioning when the schools manage to get rebuilt, \nwhen any businesses decide to take advantage of the tax credits we have \ngiven them to open, there will not be a city to move into.\n  We are trying to get some of our neighborhoods back in New Orleans, \nand the mayor and Federal officials and the Governor and the council \nhave been working through a complicated plan that is not universally \nsupported. But I can understand why we have to go neighborhood by \nneighborhood, because some neighborhoods are totally uninhabitable. You \nwant to bring some life to the city, but what is the use of moving \npeople back into Algiers, which is where we want to move them on the \nwest bank, or back into the CBD, if the mayor has to let 3,000 people \noff this week and 3,000 people off next week? Who would the people in \nthe central business district call when they need a permit?\n  I don't think this is too complicated. It is time for us to act. We \nhave passed some tax credits in a bipartisan fashion, $6 billion in tax \ncredits to help people with casualty loss, to let people take some \nmoney out of their IRA tax free, to tell the IRS, don't collect any \ntaxes for people. If anybody owes you money or if people are late or \ndon't expect any quarterly reports, that has all been helpful. We have \ngiven a $2,400 credit to employers. One thing we can do in this \nCongress is pass tax cuts. We have become very good at passing tax \ncuts. We are appreciative of these tax cuts, $6 billion. But I can tell \nyou that our State needs $9 billion. Maybe we could live with $6 \nbillion if we eliminate some things that we need. Perhaps we could wait \nfor a couple of months to get this emergency health care relief act.\n  We need the $720 million for small business relief already passed in \na bipartisan way. We need money for our elementary and secondary \nschools. And most importantly, we need money for our community disaster \nloans and for several hospitals in the region. When the whole community \nwas collapsing, when certain hospitals had to evacuate, these three \nhospitals in the metropolitan area--West Jefferson, East Jefferson, and \nOschner, two public hospitals and one private hospital--stayed open the \nwhole time, never closed their doors, even with water rising and \nwindows out and all sorts of disaster and\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\ndifficulty. Because of their sheer determination to do so, they stayed \nopen. As a result, Oschner can't qualify for insurance because they \nnever closed their doors. But if we don't give them some immediate \nhelp, this well-respected institution may not be able to keep their \ndoors open. They are one of the largest employers, most respected \ninstitutions. What are we going to do, say, sorry, come back in a \nmonth? They may not be here in a month.\n  We don't even have on this list our universities. The University of \nNew Orleans, Southern University, Dillard University, Xavier \nUniversity, Tulane University, Loyola University, and our largest \ncommunity college, Delgado, which had five feet of water around it. \nThese are not only the brainpower that is going to help us rebuild a \ncity greater and better, higher and stronger and smarter, these are \nemployers who employ thousands of the professionals who make up the \nheart of our region. We don't even have them on the list. They were on \nthe front page of the New York Times, on CNN last night, saying: Does \nanybody know we are out here? We are not able to make payroll.\n  Why wouldn't they be able to make payroll? They have no students in \ntheir university. So what does the president of the university tell his \nfaculty: Go to Atlanta and come back in 2 years? And if Xavier is not \nfunctioning, and Dillard is not functioning, and the University of New \nOrleans is not up and operating, and Tulane can't get completely back \nup, and Loyola, who do the small businesses we are trying to give tax \ncredits to, who do they sell their products to if there are no large \nbusinesses that have survived?\n  Let me talk about one other employer, the Catholic Church. There are \npeople in this Congress who have this idea that in a storm such as this \nor in a hurricane or disaster, let's have faith-based initiatives. \nChurches do beautiful work. The synagogues do beautiful work. People of \nfaith have done so many things that I want to say thank you to everyone \nwho has helped in every way. But in my city, as a Catholic city \npredominantly, the Catholic Church not only runs schools and senior \ncenters and feeding centers and homeless shelters, they don't think of \nthemselves as a business. They think of themselves as a ministry. They, \nin fact, are one of the largest employers in our region and have been \nsince before the Government actually existed in the way we know it \ntoday. In other words, the Ursuline nuns, the nuns of the Holy Sisters, \nthe Sisters of the Poor, the Jesuits came to the city before we even \nhad an American Government and helped to stand the city up. That is how \nlong they have been there. They have helped decade after decade, \nthrough the Revolutionary War, the Battle of New Orleans, the Civil \nWar, through every tragedy, the nuns, the priests, the teachers have \nbeen there.\n  Now their schools are ruined. Their hospitals are ruined. They come \nto ask the Government for some help. We act like, go ask a faith-based \ninstitution. They are a faith-based institution. Whom should they go \nask? They have to let off maybe 1,500 people. Why would we want our \nlargest employer to let go people so these people who are trained in \nthe ministry, who deliver services, who are the social workers of the \ncity, the psychologists of the city, the counsellors of the city, the \nteachers of the city could go to Atlanta or Houston or Michigan or \nDallas and come back in a couple years? We need them to stay there and \nhelp us build the city and community.\n\n  I am sure that is true in Waveland. I am sure it is true in Pass \nChristian. I am sure it is true throughout the gulf coast of \nMississippi. Instead we get: Go ask a faith-based institution for help. \nGo ask a church. They are the church. They can't even save their own \nemployees so how are they going to help everyone else? I don't know \nwhat has happened to us as a country. It makes me frightened to think \nabout how far we have come as a nation that we don't understand the \nrole of the Federal Government at a time such as this, that we are so \nfocused on tax cuts, on other priorities, that when hard-working \nAmericans, hard-working American citizens, who have done nothing but \nwork hard all their lives to build some equity, to get to a place not \nof luxury but of peace and comfort, lose everything in the blink of an \neye, we have to come up here to the Federal Government and beg on their \nbehalf, instead of the Federal Government saying: This is why we are \nhere. That is what being part of a nation is all about. If one State is \nhurting, the other 49 can lift them up. Or if two States are hurting, \nthe other 48 can lift them up.\n\n  Instead, we have to listen to editorial after editorial saying: Why \ncan't Louisiana be more self-reliant? The State needs to demonstrate \nself-reliance.\n  The Budget Director of Louisiana reported to our legislature that \ntheir revenues will be short $1 billion out of a budget of \napproximately $14 billion. But the State needs to be self-reliant; the \npeople in Louisiana are not self-reliant.\n  I want to show a picture of a woman who I think is self-reliant. She \nis not on a wagon train out West, but this is what I think about self-\nreliance. She has her baby in her arms. She is doing the best she can \nin a very tough situation. I want to show some other pictures of self-\nreliance.\n  This is a woman for whom no one came. She probably has no car, but \nshe has the two babies that she can carry, and I am sure if she had a \nthird, she would have managed to put a third one in her arms and wade \nthrough 5 feet of water to try to get these children to safety. This is \nwhat Senator Landrieu thinks is being self-reliant.\n  There is another picture in this magazine of some people in a boat. \nThere is a picture in this magazine of about 10 people in a boat. The \nboat does not have the Coast Guard emblem--and let me thank the Coast \nGuard. They saved 32,000 people in the course of 3 and 4 days; 32,000 \nthe Coast Guard alone saved out of houses, off porches, off roofs. That \nis not counting the thousands of people who were saved by Wildlife and \nFisheries.\n  But there is a picture in this magazine of a boat that looks like it \nis sort of a blown-up boat with about 12 people in it. There are no \npaddles. So the people in the boat found some wood floating in the \nwater and picked up the wood and started paddling.\n  This is the picture. I hope the cameras can see it. They are going to \nhave to really blow it up, but here it is. It is not very large. But \nthis is what the Senator from Louisiana thinks is being self-reliant. \nPeople found something that floated, put themselves and their children \nin it, found some old wood, and started paddling to safety. And I have \nto listen to news people saying that our people are not self-reliant?\n  I will not apologize for asking for help on behalf of the 4.5 million \npeople who live in my State--Black and White, Hispanic and Asian--who \nhave been devastated by this storm, 2 million of whom have lost their \nhomes and their neighborhoods. Most of them have never asked the \nGovernment for one thing, have never been on one program, and they come \nhere to ask for a little bit of help and they are told: You need to be \nmore self-reliant. How much more self-reliant can people be other than \nto raise their children, send them to school, balance their budget, pay \nfor their house, pay their bills on time, and serve in the military? \nHow much more self-reliant can they be?\n  I thought and I think they thought they lived in a nation that when \nsomething such as this happened that was unexpected and not their \nfault, somebody would be there to help them. All we have is photo ops, \nmessage boards, and press releases. But when it comes down to actually \npassing some legislation with some money attached to it that could \nactually help someone, we cannot seem to find the will to do it, \ndespite the fact that what we are asking for we can take from the FEMA \nmoney and not add anything. Republicans and Democrats have come \ntogether almost unanimously in support of these, but yet we are going \nto go home without doing anything.\n  Mr. President, I hope I have made my point. I will be back in the \nmorning to talk about some other aspects of this recovery. Again, to be \nperfectly clear, FEMA has been given $51 billion. There is $43 billion, \nas of yesterday, that is unallocated. Everyone agrees that FEMA is not \nwhat it used to be, that it is not working very well. For whatever \nreason and for whose ever fault that might be, we cannot fix that \novernight. So I am asking to take a few billion of that money that is \njust sitting there and allocate it to programs already established, \nthat are already working, that are desperately needed, that have\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\nbeen agreed to by Republicans and Democrats alike before we leave so we \ncan give hope to people.\n  I am going to stand here on this floor all day tomorrow and use every \npressure point I can to see that some agreement can be reached to do \nsomething before we leave and when we come back, to agree to up-or-down \nvotes on some critical bills on which we need action now. We don't get \naction on them, anything we do in January or February or March or \nApril, in large measure, will be for nought because the counties, \ncities, parishes, police departments, and fire departments that we are \ntrying to help may not make it that long. Without them, it is very \nhard, if not impossible, to build our communities and build our cities.\n  In conclusion, people want to come home. Some people may not be able \nto. But as a Senator from Louisiana, I want people to know from our \nState that everyone is welcome home. All people are welcome, and we \nwant everyone back. We are doing the very best we can to try to provide \nand prioritize what we need to do first, second, and third in order to \nget people back and get our communities started again.\n  Not only is New Orleans a great city, but the region is pretty \nspectacular and special. The whole gulf coast is a place that when you \ngrow up in New Orleans, you know about Waveland, Pass Christian, places \nthat are very special to people along that gulf coast. Generation after \ngeneration of families have vacationed together and lived together and \nworshipped together and gone to school together, and it is gone.\n  We would like the help of this Nation to build it back higher, \nstronger, and better. We don't want to waste a penny, but we need this \nhelp now.\n  Let us act when we come back early in the morning to get some of this \ndone and to work with our colleagues to see that we can get help to the \npeople who are desperately in need of help.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/05/senate-section/article/S11172-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
