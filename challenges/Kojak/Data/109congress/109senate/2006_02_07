Mr. President, a week ago we all listened as the \nPresident laid out his priorities in the State of the Union.\n  At the time, I noted that what he says in his speech is a lot less \nimportant than what he does in his budget.\n  Yesterday, he sent us his budget, and I am deeply concerned about \nwhat it means for our country, our people and our future.\n  Later today, I will raise some of my concerns directly with the \nbudget director, and I will come back here to the floor time and again \nto talk about what we should be doing.\n  But this morning, I want to step back and take a broad look at the \nsignificance of the budget and the choices before us.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that what we do now will affect us, \nand the American people, months from now.\n  The budget decisions we make now will either empower us, or tie our \nhands, when we turn to write the appropriations bills.\n  I am speaking on the floor today to warn my colleagues that you \ncannot vote for an unrealistic budget in the spring and then act \nsurprised in the summer and fall when painful cuts are required.\n  At the end of every year, Congress crams several important pieces of \nlegislation through in a rush to head home for the holidays. This past \nyear was no different. In a matter of days, we finished appropriations \nbills, authorization bills, and even spending cuts.\n  Unfortunately, the logjam we experienced at the end of last year was \nnot a surprise to many of us who work closely on the budget process.\n  Starting in March, many of us began raising concerns that we were \nheaded in the wrong direction. We knew that there was no way we could \nhonor our commitment to America's working families, enact huge cuts in \nentitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, enact another round of \ntax cuts, and continue to cut our Nation's deficit.\n  When you add in the growing cost of war and Hurricane Katrina, the \nlegislative train wreck was entirely predictable.\n  But no matter what the hurry, make no mistake these bills have \nserious consequences, and their impact will be felt for years to come.\n  They set funding levels, cut and grow programs, and set important \npolicy for agencies and programs touching nearly every American.\n  But it is more than that. Collectively, they represent our priorities \nand reflect our values.\n  They provide the direction we intend to lead the country. And what \ntoo few Americans know--and too few Senators seem to remember--is that \none single document serves as the blueprint for these additions, \nsubtractions and everything in between each year.\n  I'm speaking, of course, about the Federal budget resolution.\n  Every year, with much fanfare and even more detail, the \nadministration sends Congress a spending and revenue plan for the next \n5 years. Congress is required to draft a similar spending and revenue \nplan.\n  Our work begins on the day we receive the President's budget and is \nsupposed to be completed by April 15. From early February, until April \nwe debate, mark up, and offer a multitude of amendments.\n  Most of the time, we complete this process and move to the next phase \nof the budget process on May 1. The congressional budget resolution \nsets the tone for the entire budget process, including appropriations.\n  I have served on the Budget Committee for my entire Senate career. \nIt's a very important committee, one that I take great pride in working \non. But its work is not often considered newsworthy or particularly \ninterested for the press and public.\n  While this process may not always draw front-page coverage, its \nimportance could not be greater.\n  This one document is more than numbers and charts. From health care \nto energy, security to the economy, this one document is the vehicle \nthat allows us to act on each and every priority the Government will \nhave for an entire year.\n  The Federal budget is the statement of our priorities as a people. It \nshould be a moral, thoughtful document.\n  It should carefully consider its impact on the Nation's best-off and \nworst-off.\n  Too often, I fear, this impact is overlooked in all the details and \nprocess. Its impact is lost in the time from the budget's passage to \nthe enactment of the final appropriations bills.\n  That is why this year, with the benefit of our action at the end of \n2005, with upcoming votes on left-over items from last year, and with \nthe President's new budget, I wanted to come here to the floor to \nensure that we all know the stakes of this great debate.\n  And I intend to be back, saying much the same, I fear, in the weeks \nand months ahead.\n  This year's budget, and the priorities it enacts, will not be lost to \ntime, if I have anything to say about it. It is simply too important to \nforget.\n  As I listened to the President's State of the Union, I felt a real \ndisconnect between his priorities and the challenges facing working \nfamilies in Washington State, Americans across our country, and those \nfighting for our freedom abroad.\n  We all want America to be strong again and that means we must invest \nin our people and in our infrastructure. What the President said last \nweek matters much less than what he does in his budget.\n  That budget is a document of values, and it will tell us if he is \nreally intent on creating a brighter future for America or just giving \nus more of the same.\n  It is time to put the needs of America's working families first. We \nneed a government that reflects our values and provides real economic \nincentives to encourage job creation.\n  We can do that by investing in our infrastructure, providing \naffordable, accessible healthcare, supporting energy independence, \nproviding education for all of our children, and protecting our ports \nand borders.\n  These are the priorities that will make our Union and our families \nstrong. We also have a moral obligation to ensure that our troops who \nserve and protect all of us have the resources they need on the \nbattlefield and when they return home.\n  Unfortunately, if last year's budget and this year's speech are any \nindication, the President's priorities are simply not in line with \nthose of the American public.\n  Almost exactly 1 year ago, the President previewed his FY 2006 budget \nin the State of the Union Address. He said:\n\n       My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 \n     Government programs that are not getting results, or \n     duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential \n     priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars \n     must be spent wisely, or not at all.\n\n  A week later, we received a budget from President Bush that slashed \nhealth care programs, punished veterans, cut education aid, and \nincreased the long-term financial obligation we'll leave to the next \ngeneration. His ``non-essential priorities'' were made quite clear.\n  In choosing to vote against that budget, I said:\n\n       Families in Washington State and across the country are \n     concerned about the security of their jobs, their \n     communities, access to affordable health care and a quality \n     education. Unfortunately, rather than inspiring confidence, \n     the budget we are voting on tonight leaves too many Americans \n     questioning the future.\n       On issue after issue, this budget falls short of what our \n     communities and our country need to move forward.\n       I know what responsible budgets look like because I've \n     worked with chairmen of both parties to create them.\n       Unfortunately, this Republican budget fails to create jobs, \n     improve security and meet our country's needs.\n\n  Mr. President, last year's budget proposal was a disaster. It cut \nMedicaid--the health care for our most vulnerable. It cut education. It \ncut veterans funding. And incredibly, once again, it increased the \ndeficit.\n  The President has rightly been focused on our Nation's security, but \nhis budget didn't reflect the type of priorities that keep Americans \nsafe. Speeches are one thing, but they ring hollow\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nif not matched with a real commitment of funding.\n  In fact, in his budget proposal last year, the President tried to cut \nfirefighter grants, funding for U.S. search and rescue, and the port \nsecurity grants that help keep cities such as Seattle and Tacoma safe. \nIf we are serious about our security, then each of these should be \npriority for this President.\n  And after that budget passed--by the slimmest of margins, I might \nadd--we felt the pain it inflicted. In appropriations debate after \nappropriations debate Democrats, and in some cases even some \nRepublicans, fought to provide the basic funding for services that make \na difference in every American's life--the most important programs \nneeded.\n  Several times Republicans invoked the budget, saying we couldn't \nprovide the necessary dollars because of its constraints.\n  The budget and the Bush priorities were taking their toll.\n  As if these painful cuts weren't enough, the Bush team actually used \nthe budget to ensure more hardship for the least among us, while \nhanding out more perks to the best-off.\n  Through reconciliation, Republicans ``saved'' billions of dollars on \nthe backs of the poor. Again, by the slimmest of margins in each \nChamber, they cut Medicaid, Agriculture, and retirement security \nprograms.\n  Reconciliation is intended as a tool for reducing the deficit. \nUnfortunately, the Republican leadership has pushed reconciliation \nbills that actually make the deficit worse and pass the burden of tax \ncuts for the wealthy and the cost of the war on the backs of poor \nchildren, the disabled, and our Nation's seniors.\n  I will say again what I said when they brought this immoral bill to \nour committee: At a time when communities along our gulf coast are \nhurting, when we are facing the implementation of a confusing new \nprescription drug law, when our roads and bridges and railways are \naging, when millions of Americans are concerned about how they are \ngoing to pay for heat in their homes this winter, and when the men and \nwomen who have sacrificed to serve us overseas cannot find health care \nor jobs when they return home, we should be focused on protecting our \nmost vulnerable, not handing them further burdens.\n  There is one particular area that warrants mentioning because we have \nheard a lot about it in recent days, and that is health care. We heard \nthe President talk about his health care priorities in his State of the \nUnion Address last week. But every American knows that actions speak \nlouder than words.\n  One of the most serious challenges facing all working families today \nis the escalating cost of health care. Instead of addressing the \nincreasing cost of health care and its impact on the uninsured, last \nyear's failed budget strategy only made this situation worse.\n  In the reconciliation package the House approved, half of the cuts \ncome from Medicare and Medicaid. We know from a recent CBO report that \nan estimated 65,000 enrollees in Medicaid will lose coverage under the \nRepublican budget reconciliation bill.\n  The reconciliation bill shifts greater costs to working families and \ncould reduce Washington State's share of Medicaid funding by $185 \nmillion. The package requires higher copayments and premiums for low-\nincome children. It eliminates the focus on prevention benefits and \nearly screening for children.\n  Medicaid is an essential safety net program for seniors, for the \ndisabled, and for our children. Without Medicaid, there are very few \noptions available for receiving care. Nationwide, in fact, 40 percent \nof all births are paid for by Medicaid. Where will these people go for \ncare? Who is going to pay? The reconciliation bill cuts $35 billion \nfrom services that make America stronger and make our communities more \nsecure, all while burdening our children with massive debt.\n  Rather than being good stewards of taxpayers' dollars and helping our \nNation become stronger and more secure, and rather than paying down the \ndebt, Republicans are back to the same game: They want to keep \nshoveling money right back out the door in the form of billions of \ndollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to point out that \nthey cut spending by $40 billion, but they did so by cutting student \naid, cutting health care for the poor, and cutting other programs that \nare critical to working families, and they did it all while increasing \nthe deficit.\n  As our outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said:\n\n       If you are going to lower taxes, you should not be \n     borrowing essentially the tax cut. That over the long run is \n     not a stable fiscal situation.\n\n  I agree. Imposing painful cuts on hard-working families to pay for \nmore tax cuts and then passing the cost on to our children is clearly \nwrong. We can and we must do better. And let's not forget higher \ndeficits also mean a larger debt. It is no surprise that we soon will \nbe asked to raise the borrowing authority yet again for the Federal \nGovernment to over $8 trillion. That is going to mean less capital for \nsmall businesses to expand and it means higher interest rates for every \nworking family.\n  Once again the budget and Bush priorities will take their toll.\n  As I look at the challenges facing our country and as I listen to the \npeople in my home State of Washington, it is pretty clear that the top \npriority now must be making America strong again. And to do that, we \nneed to invest here at home. That means taking care of education, \nhealth care, infrastructure, housing, safety, and security, and on each \nof these fronts, the Bush priorities have been time and again \nmisguided, adrift, and downright painful for millions of Americans.\n  I believe that in order to make America strong, we need to make \ninvestments here at home in our people, in our infrastructure, and in \nour communities. Everywhere I travel in Washington State, I hear from \nfamilies who are struggling to find a safe and affordable place to \nlive. Whether it is a young couple looking for their first home or a \nfamily searching for rental housing close to their job or a senior \ncitizen who wants to find better access to social services, it is \nharder than ever in this country to find affordable housing.\n\n  Across the country, public housing agencies and nonprofit \norganizations are working to help families find a place they can call \nhome. At the same time, they are contributing to community \nrevitalization efforts that will bring new jobs and opportunities. But \na lack of funding threatens those achievements that have been made and \nthe work that is yet to be done.\n  It is also critical that we continue to invest in our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Recent cuts in transportation spending threaten to \nweaken airline safety, impose new transportation costs on American \nbusinesses, and cost tens of thousands of construction jobs. Investing \nin our Nation's transportation infrastructure will help reduce \ncongestion, improve safety, and support continued economic growth. I \nurge this President to support these critical investments and put \naction behind his good rhetoric.\n  When I am home in my State of Washington and here in DC, I hear a lot \nof concern from the business community, from local governments, and \nfamilies over the United States losing its global competitiveness. In \nfact, we heard a lot from President Bush the other night on this very \nsubject. But last year's budget set us on a path that weakened \neducation programs at all levels, and the new budget that was sent to \nus yesterday does the very same thing.\n  Last year's budget so constrained our education programs that the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill failed once in the House and almost did \nnot pass at all. In the end, programs faced one last hit again, a 1-\npercent-across-the-board cut that further hindered education at every \nlevel.\n  In a time when our schools are facing increasing requirements under \nthe No Child Left Behind Act and families are facing rising college \ntuition costs, this is no time to be shortchanging education.\n  Last year's budget resulted in funding levels that represented the \nsmallest increase in education in a decade, and this year the President \nis proposing the largest cut to education in 26 years.\n  This year, $12.7 billion is proposed to be cut from student loans \nthat help low-income and middle-income families pay for college. \nSeventy percent of\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\nthose cuts will be paid for by students and their families. Those cuts \nwill not go for balancing the budget either; they are going to go for \ntax cuts for those who need them the least.\n  Tuition and fees increased this year by 7.1 percent for 4-year public \nuniversities and 5.9 percent for private universities. Not only is \ncutting student aid the wrong priority for our country today, but it \nwill cost our Nation dearly in the long term.\n  Today only one-third of the U.S. workforce has a postsecondary \neducation, and it is estimated that 60 percent of the new jobs in the \n21st century will require college education. Workers who have attended \ncollege have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment than those \nwho do not. And those with a college education are more likely to have \njobs with benefits, such as health care and retirement and pension \nplans.\n  We should be helping to break down the barriers to a college \neducation, not building them up with this budget plan.\n  I want to talk about veterans funding because with so many of our \nbrave men and women fighting for us overseas, I believe our most \nfundamental priority has to be to take care of those who sacrificed so \nmuch for all of us.\n  I have said time and again that actions speak louder than words, but \nit was, nevertheless, very troubling to me when President Bush failed \nto even mention our veterans in the State of the Union Address. I hope \nhe will not forget them in the budget process.\n  I am concerned that the President's fiscal year 2007 budget that was \njust sent to us is not based on real numbers and does not reflect the \nreal demand for VA services. I am convinced that without real budgets \nbased on real numbers, the VA is going to face a shortfall again this \nyear and more veterans are going to be denied the care they have \nearned.\n  The rising utilization rates, increasing costs of medical care, and \nthe influx of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq are going to require \nmore VA funding.\n  In addition, the new Medicare prescription drug program has added \nmore demands on the VA. Many seniors who are veterans are now being \ntold they should go to the VA for their prescription drugs. Surely, \nthis influx of new VA patients will have a major impact on the VA \nsystem and will inevitably delay access for veterans.\n  Finally, much of the increased demand on the VA system is due to the \nnationwide health care crisis. As veterans lose their health care \ncoverage from their own employers, they are coming by the thousands to \nthe VA to get care for the first time. The longer the health care \ncrisis continues to grow, the more the demands will be on the VA to \ntake care of the veterans population.\n  As my colleagues will remember, last year I was told the VA didn't \nneed any more funding. The administration told me everything was fine \nand that they could handle the demands brought about by the Iraq war. I \ntried time and again to increase funding for the VA to maintain \nveterans' access to the health care they were told they would get, and \nI was fought at every level. Then finally in June, Secretary Nicholson \nannounced the VA was, indeed, facing a $1 billion shortfall in fiscal \nyear 2005 and that the VA miscalculated demands in the VA by over $3 \nbillion between fiscal year 2005 and 2006.\n  In June, when I asked whether the administration had adequately \nplanned for the impact of the war, I was told the VA underestimated the \nnumber of Iraq war veterans by over 300 percent.\n  I finally was able to work with my colleagues to attach $1.5 billion \nin emergency funding for the VA on the fiscal year 2006 Interior \nappropriations bill and another $1.2 billion in the fiscal year 2006 \nmilitary construction bill to finally cover this shortfall.\n  Since the war in Iraq began, there have been 2,245 casualties and \n16,548 wounded soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Our men and \nwomen in uniform--past, present, and future--will time and again answer \nthe call to duty, and at the very least they deserve a budget that \nfulfills our commitment to them and to their families.\n  I look forward to debating the President's budget this week. I truly \nbelieve it is one of the most important actions that we take every year \nbecause it sets the tone for everything else we do.\n  Tuesday night last week the President told Congress and all Americans \nthat:\n\n       In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that \n     determine both the future and the character of our country.\n\n  I couldn't agree with him more. Our future and our character are at \nstake. A budget reflects our priorities and our values. Let's make sure \nour budget for the coming year reflects the best of both, and let's \nremember that the decisions we make now will tie our hands months from \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S736-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S736-S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROGRESS OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a little time today \ntalking about the economy. When I was mayor of St. Paul, people would \nsay: Mayor, what are you doing for kids? My response would be: The best \nthing I can do for kids is make sure mom and dad have a job. The best \nwelfare program is a job. The best housing program is a job. Access to \nhealth care most often comes through a job. So that was always my \ngoal--jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  I want to talk about the economy, but I want to touch briefly on the \nbudget. The President submitted his budget. There will be a lot of \ndebate. It is the beginning of a conversation. The President submits a \nbudget and then we take a look at that budget and we weigh a number of \noptions and ultimately it concludes. It is the beginning of a \nconversation.\n  One of the things I find somewhat frustrating is that my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle talk about the deficit. We are all \nconcerned about the deficit. We do not want to pass on debt to our \nkids. We don't want to put obligations on them from what we do today. \nWe need to be more responsible. So we hear concern about the deficit, \nabout which we are all concerned. Then anytime the President says we \nhave to keep a lid on spending, our friends on the other side of the \naisle complain that we are cutting too much. You cannot be so \npassionate about the deficit if you are not willing to do something \nabout it. It is not enough to complain. It is not enough just to be \nagainst.\n  What the President has done is say: OK, we are going to cut the \ndeficit in half by 2009. We are going to have to make some tough \nchoices. We will have to make some very tough choices. But the answer \nis not simply raising taxes. The answer is not more spending. We are \ngoing to have to do the hard act of governing. It is not enough just to \ncomplain. It is not enough to say what you are against. What is your \nalternative? What are you for?\n  The President has laid on the table a budget with the hope of \ncontinuing progrowth policies, restraining spending, cutting the \ndeficit and, perhaps most importantly, dealing with the long-term \ndanger, the challenges we face with close to 70 percent of our budget \ngoing to things that are mandated. So we have to look at Social \nSecurity and Medicaid, and we have to do the right thing--do the right \nthing for our seniors, do the right thing for those in need. We have to \nhave the courage to look at those things and act. You can't just \ncomplain. You can't keep complaining about the deficit and every time \nthere is an opportunity to put a lid on spending you are against that. \nIt doesn't make sense. It doesn't add up.\n  I wish to talk a little about where we are today and what has \nhappened with what we have done in the past. We passed some tax relief. \nMr. President, you and I together had the opportunity to be here during \nconsideration of a number of proposals which have actually cut taxes. \nWhat has been the result? Let us look a little bit at the numbers.\n  The President's tax relief has produced more than 4.7 million new \njobs since November 2003 when he signed the legislation accelerating \nbroad-based income tax reductions and provided capital gains and income \ntax relief. Today the unemployment rate is\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\n4.7 percent, lower than the average of the last three decades, and the \nlowest in 4 years.\n  Home ownership has reached an all-time high. This economic growth \nwould not be possible without the President's tax relief. Recall when \nwe had the tech bubble burst during the last administration--a bubble \nthat should never have been allowed to inflate so high. We had \ncorporate scandals that were nonpartisan but certainly were encouraged \nby the get-rich-quick ethic of the 1990s. We had the attack of \nSeptember 11, and now we have the daily war on terror. The President's \ntax relief, which was fully implemented in 2003, has been critical in \nhelping the economy recover from the recession and the terrorist \nattacks of 2001. Things such as small business expensing, capital gains \ntax relief, bonus depreciation--all helped to get this economy back on \nits feet and helped the economy continue expanding, despite the \nhurricanes and high prices of 2005.\n  So on September 11, 2001, we faced a recession. We faced the end of \nthe tech bubble. We faced hurricanes and high energy prices. With the \ntax relief provisions fully implemented in 2003, tax receipts also \nresponded accordingly. In fact, receipts jumped by a remarkable $274 \nbillion or 14.5 percent, the largest increase in the last 24 years.\n  These recent gains in receipts confirm that a strong economy is the \nmost important factor in reducing the deficit. You want to reduce the \ndeficit? Grow the economy. Keep a lid on spending and grow the economy \nbut don't advocate more spending and higher taxes. That is not a way in \nwhich you grow an economy. If you compare the economy with the same \npoint in previous business cycles, in many respects the current \nexpansion is even stronger than the growth of the early and mid-1990s. \nWe look back to the mid-1990s, the Clinton years, as the halcyon days \nof the economy. Boy, things were great 10 years ago. Let me run some \ncomparisons.\n\n  For example, in April 1995 the unemployment rate was 5.8 percent. \nToday it is 4.7 percent. The African-American unemployment rate was \n10.7 percent. Today it is 8.9 percent. This is a key figure: \nProductivity growth in 2005, the key to raising our standard of living, \nis at 3.1 percent compared to 0.3 percent in 1995--10 times today the \nproductivity increase than it was in the halcyon days, the glory days \nof the nineties. Economic growth averaged 3.5 percent in 2005, while in \n1995 it was 2.5 percent. If that picture had been drawn for us 5 years \nago, how many would have predicted the economy would be in as good \nshape as it is today?\n  The reason is sound monetary policy and tax relief that were well \ntimed and sized to stimulate the economy when it needed it the most. \nUnfortunately, in a scene reminiscent of the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' \nmany on the other side are arguing that we should let this tax relief \nexpire. In other words, we should raise taxes. If you let tax relief \nexpire, you are saying we should raise taxes. This is the wrong \nprescription for the American people and for the fiscal purse. We are \nnot an undertaxed society. By rejecting tax increases on family and \nsmall businesses, we will help keep the economy on a continuing course \nof job creation and strengthen the foundation for long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  For example, a closer look shows that the capital gains and dividends \ntax relief packages actually paid for themselves. The latest statistics \non capital gains tax collections were recently released by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and receipts are not way down \nbut receipts are way up--by 45 percent, by the way, to be exact. \nRecall, one of the things Congress did was to reduce the tax on capital \ngains from 20 percent to 15 percent. Opponents predicted, as ever, that \nthis would reduce revenue. In other words, since we have lowered the \npercentage of taxes we are getting on capital gains from 20 to 15 \npercent, the opponents say you will not bring in as much money; you \nlower the tax we are taking.\n  It is not even close. The 25-percent reduction actually triggered a \ndoubling of capital gains revenues to over a half billion dollars in \n2005 to $269 billion in 2002. In addition, a new report from the \nAmerican Shareholders Association finds that actual capital gains \nrevenues were $62 billion higher than what was predicted over the 3-\nyear period--$62 billion higher. While this may seem counterintuitive \nto some, it makes perfect sense to me and confirms that capital gains \ntax relief increased economic activity, leading to more revenue for the \nTreasury.\n  When I was mayor of St. Paul I didn't raise taxes in 8 years, and we \ngrew the economy and grew jobs because it was a better place to do \nbusiness and more moms and dads were working and putting money in their \npockets and food on the table and taking care of their families.\n  What we have here is Punxsutawney Phil coming again. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle again argue that only the rich benefit from \nthis relief. This ignores the fact that capital gains and dividend \nrelief has played an essential role in creating over 4 million new jobs \nover the past couple of years, in 32 straight months of positive \neconomic growth. Taxes on dividends and capital gains are impediments \nto capital formation. If you tax too much, you impede capital \nformation. You have less money going into the economy to grow jobs. \nThey impede entrepreneurial activity, the wellspring of economic growth \nand wealth creation. Americans across all levels of household income \nhave benefited from these lower rates.\n  Nearly 60 percent of those paying capital gains earn less than \n$50,000 a year, and 85 percent of all capital gains taxpayers earn less \nthan $100,000 a year, according to the Joint Economic Committee.\n  I know many express concerns regarding the budget deficit. There is \nno doubt that Congress needs to do all it can to responsibly control \nthe rate at which we spend on mandatory programs--on which we spend on \nprograms. But some advocate that raising taxes is the key to opening \nthe door to fiscal discipline. I am afraid instead of opening the door \nto prosperity, higher taxes will shut the door on innovation, \nentrepreneurship, and greater economic growth.\n  I recognize the uneasiness and uncertainty in America today regarding \nour economic future. But if one looks at the data, it is clear that the \neconomy remains solid. Productivity is strong, employment growth \nremains robust. Both retail sales and the housing market remain on a \npath of remarkable growth. The American economy is highly flexible, and \nthanks to that we have been able to absorb natural disasters and high \nenergy costs that would have easily thrown the economies of other \nnations into economic recession.\n  To ensure the economy's continued momentum, we must make the \nPresident's tax relief permanent or else small businesses, teachers, \ncollege students, and hard-working moms and dads will see their taxes \ngo up.\n  Yet tax policy is not the only key to economic growth. As I said \nbefore, we face challenges. I know my neighbors and folks in my \ncommunity in Minnesota are worried about what is happening in India and \nChina. They are worried about the prospect of losing their jobs. \nCertainly, Mr. President, you are very sensitive to what is happening \nto the global economy and the impact it has on the good people of South \nCarolina.\n  We have to understand that we are not going to win the low-wage jobs.\n  There is a recent study by the National Science Foundation entitled \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' The President did not mention it \ndirectly in his State of the Union, but he is recognizing that we \nproduced 70,000 engineers last year. China produced 600,000; India \nproduced 350,000.\n  For the cost of one engineer or one chemist in the United States, a \ncompany can hire five chemists in China or 11 engineers in India.\n  Of 120 chemical plants being built around the world with price tags \nof $1 billion or more, one is in the United States and 50 are in China.\n  I could go on and on and on. We face some challenges out there.\n  We rank 17th in the proportion of college-age kids earning science \nand engineering degrees, down from third place a couple of decades ago.\n  We are making progress. The President is setting the pace. We have \nbipartisan legislation that follows up on that.\n  There are a number of things we need to do. In addition to that, we \nneed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We need to reform our \nlegal system, including completing our work on the asbestos bill that \nis before the Senate.\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nWe need to continue to work toward opening foreign markets to American \ngoods and services. What we do not need to do is to apply the brakes on \nthe economy by raising taxes on hard-working moms and dads, small \nbusinesses, college students, and teachers across the country. That is \nnot the prescription for continued economic growth. I have said this \nmany times, but the fact is by cutting taxes you grow jobs. We have \nbeen through a recession, national emergency, corporate scandals, and a \nwar. Yet because the President has stepped forward with an economic \nplan based on the commonsense belief that we should put money back into \nthe pockets of ordinary Americans, the economy is going strong. By \nproviding businesses with incentives such as bonus depreciation and \nexpensing, they will be able to reinvest in their operation, purchase \nmore goods, and hire more employees. That translates into jobs, \neconomic growth, and opportunity for all Americans.\n  Given the good news on the economy, even the most persistent critic \nmust concede that the President's economic program boosted the \neconomy's performance and played a crucial role in helping the economy \nto rebound from the recession that began during the final months of the \nClinton Presidency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when the Judiciary committee reported an \nasbestos-trust fund bill in 2003, I proposed three criteria for \nevaluating such a bill: the trust fund must be fair to people with \nasbestos injuries; its cost must be reasonable; and it must provide a \npermanent solution to the asbestos-litigation crisis. Last year, I \nvoted to report this bill out of committee because I believe that the \nbill does meet or has the potential to meet each of these criteria. I \nalso voted for the bill in no small part out of appreciation for the \nchairman's extensive efforts to address my concerns about the bill. I \nparticularly appreciate his assistance in adding to the bill a \ngatekeeper mechanism for certifying exigent claims seeking an early \nsettlement. Any startup provision that threatens to prematurely return \nthe trust fund to court is bad for victims, bad for participant \nbusinesses, and bad for the U.S. Government. Once this fund is started, \nit need to work--we cannot shift victims back and forth between the \ntort system and the fund, especially those victims with malignant \nconditions, who likely do not have long to live.\n  The need for this bill is obvious. Current asbestos litigation \npractices have been accurately described by Professor Lester Brickman \nas a ``massively fraudulent enterprise fit to take its place among the \npantheon of American scandals.'' Typically, trial lawyers consolidate \nthousands of claims and file them against a series of defendants. These \nclaims are generated by mass-screening recruitment companies that \nignore all scientific standards for identifying asbestos disease and \nemploy corrupt physicians who will say that anyone has asbestosis if \nthe fee is right.\n  In the perverse rules, plaintiffs' lawyers have a de facto veto over \nconfirming the bankruptcy trust and can thus dictate its terms.\n  The results are predictable: even for asbestos bankruptcy trusts \namounting to billions of dollars, the plaintiffs' lawyers take 40 \npercent off the top. These recoveries inevitably compensate lawyers in \nan amount several orders of magnitude greater than anything resembling \na reasonable hourly rate. And all for bringing claims that no honest \ndoctor would ever describe as legitimate cases of asbestos injury. It \nis easy to see where a well-crafted trust fund could improve on this \nsystem--how it could cut our the trial lawyer middle man and preserve \nrecoveries for actual victims of asbestos disease.\n  Nevertheless, when I voted for this bill in the committee, I \nexpressed reservations about the final product. One concern about this \nbill looms above all others, and it directly threatens all three of the \nabove-stated criteria for evaluating the bill: solvency. I remain \ndeeply concerned that this fund will run out of money and prove unable \nto pay all qualifying claimants. Allow me to explain why I am concerned \nabout the fund's finances.\n  Here are a couple of reasons why. First, look to the bankruptcy trust \nfunds previously existing and that have existed in the past. What has \nour experience been? Not very good.\n  In written questions to Dr. Francine Rabinovitz, who has been \nretained by trust fund bankers to estimate future claims under the \nfund, I asked her about the experience under the asbestos bankruptcy \nfunds. Those funds are about the closest analog to what we are doing \nhere--no-fault funds that compensate all claimants who meet particular \nexposure and medical criteria. Indeed, the criteria for this fund \nexplicitly are borrowed from the latest version of the Johns Manville \nbankruptcy fund, which is part of her study. I appreciate her candor. \nHere is what she had to say:\n\n       To my knowledge, none of the bankruptcy trusts created \n     prior to 2002 have been able to pay over the life anywhere \n     close to 50 percent of the liquidated value of qualifying \n     claims. Of the current generation of bankruptcy trusts, the \n     expected payout of those trusts, to my knowledge, ranges from \n     a low of 5 percent (Manville) to a high of 31.7 percent \n     (Western McArthur). The only current operating Trust to pay \n     100 percent of its scheduled values in the Mid-Valley Trust. \n     These percentages are sensitive, of course, to the \n     eligibility criteria the trusts apply. Under its original \n     eligibility criteria, Manville was forced to drop its initial \n     100 percent payout first to 10 percent and then 5 percent of \n     liquidated value. There will be a reevaluation of Manville's \n     ability to pay a higher percentage in the near future by \n     virtue of the impact of its recently imposed more stringent \n     eligibility criteria.\n\n  These figures should disturb us all.\n  We are legislating a $140 billion trust--one that must work, because \nthe costs of failure would be catastrophic. And yet the model for this \nfund is one that has failed every time that it has been tried. The \nmiserable performance of the bankruptcy trusts should, at the very \nleast, make us very cautious in proceeding down the same no-fault \ntrust-fund path. While I recognize that this Fund is not exactly like \nthe bankruptcy trusts--that it is designed better in some ways--in \nother ways the compensation criteria employed by this Fund are a change \nfor the worse.\n  Another example that ought to give us some pause is the black lung \nfund, which is designed to compensate miners with CWP, a coal-mining-\ninduced lung disease. That fund is now $8.7 billion in debt. It is now \nfinally bringing in enough revenue to pay current claimants, but it is \nunable to service its debt. Each year's interest is simply added to the \ntotal debt. This is no way to run a trust fund.\n  It is telling to read the story of the black lung fund and hear why \nit has become so overburdened. The narrative should sound familiar to \nanyone who has closely followed the committee proceedings for the \nasbestos fund. There is a June 12, 2002 report from the Congressional \nResearch Service. I wanted to quote from part of it, but the bottom \nline is that the crafters of the black lung fund ignored medical \nscience when they set up the fund's compensation criteria. As is \npredictable for Congress, criteria were developed in the spirit of \npolitical compromise rather than under the guidance of hard science. \nThe results have been very unfavorable.\n  The report basically said:\n\n       Virtually all of the expectations for the Black Lung \n     Benefits Act when it was enacted in 1969, e.g., the numbers \n     of claims submitted or approved, were contradicted by \n     subsequent experience. Corrective legislation was adopted in \n     1972, 1977, and 1981, including the establishment of trust \n     fund financing in 1977, but results have continued to be at \n     variance with expectations. As a consequence, the trust fund \n     has perennially been in a position of growing deficit.\n\n  In other words, even at a time when the black lung fund's liberal \ncompensation criteria were generating a surplus of claims, political \npressures nevertheless pushed Congress to further liberalize those \ncriteria and further bankrupt the fund.\n  In the asbestos arena, I fear that we already have repeated the first \npart of the black lung fund story. Our concern is that as we continue \ndown this path, we risk repeating the rest of the story as well.\n  But this fund is different from black lung in one key respect: it is \nmuch, much more expensive. This fund has the potential to burn through \nscores of billions of dollars, rack up $30 billion in\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\ndebt, and throw us back into the tort system--all within one decade. \nSuch a result truly would make the black lung fiasco seem \ninsignificant. It would be an utter disaster. We cannot let it happen.\n  I wish that the Judiciary Committee had learned more from the black \nlung experience--that we could at least recognize that a no-fault trust \nfund must be run as a tight ship, with rigorous compensation criteria \nand no leakage of claims. Unfortunately, that does not describe the \nbill that has been produced by the Judiciary Committee.\n  In his recent testimony before this committee, Dr. James Crapo \ndescribed how we are repeating the same mistake made in the black lung \nfund: we are compensating diseases that are not caused by occupational \nexposure to asbestos. Dr. Crapo criticized the fund's compensation of \npersons with pleural reactions, which are not regarded as a disease and \nare not even a predictor of future disease. He also criticized the \nfund's claim level for persons with colorectal, stomach, and other \ncancers, noting that it would ``result in large compensation to large \nnumbers of individuals who develop a cancer for which there is no \nestablished causal relationship to asbestos exposure.''\n  And just as was the case with black lung, despite the asbestos fund's \nuse of criteria that are far more liberal than what can be justified by \nmedical science, we already are hearing arguments that the fund should \ngo further, that its compensation criteria should be even more liberal. \nFor example, the medical literature strongly demonstrates that the only \nmarker for asbestos-related lung cancer is clinically significant \nasbestosis. The cohort studies overwhelmingly show that unless a person \nhas at least some asbestosis, asbestos exposure played no role in his \nlung cancer. But in this bill, we go further than compensating lung \ncancer in the presence of asbestosis. We also compensate lung cancer \nwith pleural plaques. Pleural plaques are evidence of asbestos exposure \nbut are not a valid marker for asbestos-related lung cancer.\n  And yet, even this has not satisfied some fund critics. This \ncommittee was even forced to vote several times on an amendment that \nwould have obligated the fund to pay compensation for lung cancer when \nthe claimant did not even have pleural plaques. The committee did \ndefeat that amendment by a vote of more than 2 to 1, showing some \nrespect for medical science. Nevertheless, the amendment is a harbinger \nof the political pressures that this Fund ultimately will face over its \nlife.\n  Several other aspects of this bill also cause me concern. Let me \nsummarize some of those.\n  For example, the sunset: The bill still contains a provision that \nwould prematurely terminate the fund and return all claims to State and \nFederal court, with no mechanism for fixing problems even if the reason \nthat the fund is running out of money is because it is paying non-\nmeritorious claims. Once the fund is started, it must work. Going back \nto court is not a realistic option. As the bill now stands, the fund \nwould borrow $30 billion prior to any sunset. Once companies are back \nin court defending against asbestos claims, they would also be paying \ndown this debt. This would require full trust fund assessments for at \nleast a decade. These payments, combined with renewed litigation and \nno, or heavily eroded, insurance policies, would be unaffordable for \nmany companies. The effects of such a sunset likely would be so \ndevastating that companies would demand that the Federal Government \nbegin directly subsidizing the fund. This is a prospect that we should \ndo all that we can to avoid. The fund should have a self-correction \nmechanism that makes sure that a sunset will never happen.\n  Another problem is allocation. This is an emerging problem, the scope \nof which we are only gradually becoming aware of, and, frankly, one to \nwhich I will devote my primary attention. The bill requires companies \nto pay into the fund based on their past asbestos expenditures, \njudgments, settlements, and litigation costs, even if those payments in \nthe past were all absorbed by insurance. Companies' insurance will not \ncover their trust fund payments; insurers pay into the fund separately. \nThe fact that the bill effectively invalidates the company's insurance \ncontracts creates colorable takings claims against the fund. It also \ncreates some serious inequities. Companies that found their asbestos \nliabilities to be manageable will find themselves facing unaffordable \nfund assessments. I am going to insist we have language in this bill \nthat will address these inequities.\n  Another problem is startup. Much progress was made during the last \ndays of markup toward fixing the so-called startup provisions. \nNevertheless, the fund still ultimately allows claims to return to \ncourt if there are delays in startup, with no limits on award and no \noffsets in future fund payments for participants. Other, much simpler \ntrust funds, such as those for radiation workers, have taken 18 months \nto start functioning. We cannot dismiss the possibility that this fund \nwill require more than 2 years to begin paying all claims. Without an \noffset in limits, such a startup reversion would be disastrous for many \ncompanies.\n  Another issue relates to pending claims. The fund allows claims that \nalready have advanced to trial to remain in the tort system with no \noffsets and no limits on damages. Already, some trial lawyers have \nbegun seeking acceleration of their trial dates in order to take \nadvantage of this provision. For the same reasons as applied to the \nstartup provisions, such continued litigation could be very damaging.\n  A final problem is the problem of medical criteria which I alluded to \nearlier. Although improved over the 2003 committee bill, especially \nwith regard to removal of level VII smokers, the fund still pays people \nwith very common diseases that were not caused by exposure to asbestos. \nCredible medical experts had expressed the view to the committee that \nthese problems will bankrupt the fund. These flaws in the bill would be \nless severe if the fund contains some self-correction mechanism that \nallowed tightening the million-dollar criteria in the event of \ninsolvency caused by nonmeritorious claims, but it currently contains \nno such mechanism.\n  In summary, the bottom line is this is a bill which remains very much \na work in progress. I am committed to addressing its problems as the \nbill advances through the Congress. I want to see it advance through \nthe Congress. The bill is so important to so many people: the asbestos \nvictims seeking compensation--at least it might help take care of their \nfamilies, the businesses with only marginal connections to asbestos \nthat nevertheless face bankruptcy through litigation, and workers and \npensioners who see their jobs and retirement accounts destroyed by the \nlitigation juggernaut. This bill is important. I look forward to \nworking on the legislation with the chairman of the committee, the \nranking member, and others who are supporting it. I will support the \ncloture motion and motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helped awaken the \nNation to a dream of an America where each person, to use Dr. King's \nbeautifully profound formulation, is judged by the content of his \ncharacter, not the color of his skin. Ms. King continued to sustain the \ndream after her husband's death. We can take comfort in the hope that, \n38 years after his tragic death, this couple has been reunited at last.\n  Because of Coretta Scott King, Dr. King's legacy is still alive. Her \ntireless efforts led to the establishment of Martin Luther King Day on \nthe third Monday of January every year beginning in 1986 to mark Dr. \nKing birthday.\n  Because of Ms. King, Americans everywhere can explore Dr. King life \nand vision through the King Center in Atlanta. Established in 1968, the \nKing Center attracts over 650,000 visitors annually.\n  Born in poverty in Heiberger, AL, in 1927, Coretta Scott grew up in \nthe midst of segregation, walking to a one-room schoolhouse every day \nas a school bus full of white children passed her by. But these harsh \nsurroundings did not extinguish her spirit.\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n  As a girl, she enjoyed singing and had the talent to attend Boston's \nNew England Conservatory of Music to train as a classical singer. She \nwould later lend her gift to the civil rights cause, singing at over 30 \nFreedom Concerts to raise money for the movement.\n  It was while in Boston, in February, 1952, that Coretta first met a \n23-year-old Martin Luther King, who was pursuing his doctorate in \ntheology at Boston University. As a lonely southerner in a northern \ntown, he asked a mutual friend if she knew any nice young ladies he \ncould meet. She mentioned the name Coretta Scott, and described her as \n``pretty and intelligent.''\n  The young King persuaded the friend to give him Ms. Scott's number \nand asked if she'd put in a good word for him. Soon, he called for a \ndate. Displaying a bit of verbal flair, he said, ``You know, every \nNapoleon has his Waterloo. I'm like Napoleon at Waterloo before your \ncharms.''\n  ``Why, that's absurd. You haven't seen me yet,'' Coretta replied.\n  Undeterred, he finally convinced her to let me take her out for lunch \nbetween classes. ``I have a green Chevy that usually takes 10 minutes \nto make the trip from Boston University,'' he told her. ``But tomorrow, \nI'll do it in 7.''\n  That was 1952. They were married in 1953.\n  Ms. King once said, ``I was married to the man whom I loved, but I \nwas also married to the movement.'' Her entire life was intertwined \nwith the fight to stamp out the injustices of racism and inequality.\n  After her husband's life was tragically cut short, Ms. King \npersevered, raising four young children on her own. It must have been a \nlonely struggle . . . but her dignity and grace inspired a nation.\n  A few days ago, Ms. King became the first African-American to lie in \nhonor in the Georgia State Capitol rotunda. Today she will be laid to \nrest alongside her husband, at the King Center in Atlanta, and for all \ntime they will be reunited.\n  Martin Luther King once said of his wife, ``I think on many points, \nshe educated me.'' Now, at the end of her celebrated life, many of us \nfeel the same way. Dr. and Mrs. King helped educate America by forcing \nit to look itself in the mirror, face up to its failings, and recommit \nitself to its founding ideals.\n  So today, Coretta Scott King will be laid to rest in her beloved \nGeorgia, next to the husband she lost 38 years ago. As the whole Nation \nreflects today on her incalculable contributions to human progress, I \nam reminded of Dr. King's own simple wish:\n\n       I don't know how long I'll live, and I'm not concerned \n     about that--but I hope I can live so well that the preacher \n     can get up and say, ``He was faithful.'' That's all, that's \n     enough. That's the sermon I'd like to hear: ``Well done my \n     good and faithful servant.''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to salute the life and legacy of \nCoretta Scott King. She earned a place not just in our history but in \nour hearts. She was a true trailblazer for women, for the African-\nAmerican community. She was an inspiration for all Americans. I feel \nprivileged to have known Mrs. King throughout much of my political \ncareer. Her family is in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Mrs. King's courage and faith were remarkable. She insisted that she \nhad her own voice in the civil rights movement at a time when women \nwere often not recognized for their own talents and merit. Not only was \nshe resolute, but she was feisty--someone after my own heart.\n  Mrs. King's life story was remarkable--even before she met Dr. King. \nShe was born into rural poverty in Alabama and grew up in a two-room \nhouse that her father built. She came from a hard-working family. Her \nfather hauled timber, owned a country store, and worked as a barber. \nHer mother drove a schoolbus. Growing up in the segregated South, \nCoretta Scott King saw the injustices of racial discrimination. Yet she \nsaw the value in working hard and fighting for her dreams. She attended \ncollege and the New England Conservatory, where she trained as a \nclassical musician.\n  It was while studying music in Boston that she met Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. From the beginning of their marriage, Coretta Scott King \nmaintained her own identity and voice. She was Dr. King's true partner \nmarching by his side and speaking out on her own. At the same time, she \nwas a mother, raising four children. The entire family lived with \nthreats and intimidation.\n  We all remember those tragic days after the assassination of Martin \nLuther King. She comforted a nation that was torn apart. She is the \nreason we have a national holiday that honors Dr. King.\n  She fought for equality before the law, for economic justice, and for \nlifting people out of poverty. Her vision was put to action when she \nfounded the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change and saw to it that \nthe center became deeply involved with the issues that she believed \nbreed violence--hunger, unemployment, voting right, and racism.\n  Coretta Scott King took her message of nonviolence to every corner of \nthis country and to almost every corner of the world. She led missions \nto Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. She was the first woman to \ngive a class-day address at Harvard and the first woman to preach at \nthe statutory service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, England.\n  Coretta Scott King will be remembered throughout American history for \nher grace, strength, and belief that all people should be treated with \ndignity and equality. We must honor her legacy not just with words but \nwith actions. We must recommit ourselves to the principles she stood \nfor--opportunity, equality, and empowerment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the life \nand contributions of an American civil rights icon, Mrs. Coretta Scott \nKing.\n  Many people know Mrs. King as the wife of one of America's greatest \ncitizens, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King's enduring legacy of \nnonviolence and his quest for racial equality permanently altered the \nsocial fabric of America. Mrs. King will always be remembered as a part \nof Dr. King's life and legacy that are rightfully celebrated across our \ngreat land and throughout the world. However, Dr. King's towering \naccomplishments should not obscure the fact that Mrs. King held her own \nhistoric place in our Nation's struggle for equal opportunity.\n  I am reminded of the time some 20 years ago when Mrs. King came to \nsee me when I was Governor of Tennessee. We were working to establish a \nholiday in honor of her late husband. It was harder work than it should \nhave been, and I am reminded of how far we have come even since that \ntime.\n  Mrs. King was the founding president of the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nCenter for Nonviolent Social Change which continued to promote the \nnoble philosophies of Dr. King. In addition to promoting the memory of \nher husband and his great work, Mrs. King created her own legacy as she \ntraveled throughout America and across the globe to champion racial \nequality, women's rights, religious freedom, health care, and \neducation.\n  We all know that Mrs. King was born in a time when America was very \ndifferent than it is today. Little Black boys and girls could not go to \nschool with little White boys and girls. Plessy v. Ferguson had not yet \nbeen overruled, so ``separate but equal'' was the law of the land. \nLynchings were common and in many places the Ku Klux Klan terrorized \nBlack communities, often operating with near impunity. As we look back \non the amazing progress we have made since then, we remember those who \nwere responsible for helping America turn away from the sins of \ninjustice and inequality.\n  As a wife, a mother, and a leader of the civil rights movement, Mrs. \nKing showed strength and dignity. With quiet determination, she \npreserved her husband's legacy and created her own place in the history \nof our Nation's struggle for equal opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S740-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 852, which the \nclerk will report.\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 852, a bill to create a fair and \n     efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in addressing the motion to proceed where \nwe are scheduled to have a vote at 6 o'clock this evening, the question \nis whether the problem of asbestos, causing thousands of people to have \ndeadly diseases and forcing many companies into bankruptcy and \nresulting in a situation where people with the deadly diseases have no \none to claim against, the issue is whether we have a problem which is \nworthy of the attention of the Senate. That is an easy question to \nanswer; it is yes. That has been authenticated by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States on several occasions where the Court has said the \nmatter should be addressed by the Congress. That came up in a context \nwhere there were class action suits attempting to find the modality for \ndealing with the issue, and the Federal courts--ultimately, the Supreme \nCourt--said class actions were not appropriate and it was a matter for \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  This problem has been intractable. It has been studied. There have \nbeen proposals for more than three decades. I first saw this issue soon \nafter I came to the Senate after the 1980 election when Senator Gary \nHart came to see me as a junior member of the Judiciary Committee on \nbehalf of his constituent, Johns Manville. We have wrestled with this \nproblem for decades.\n  Finally, on an idea conceived by Senator Hatch to have a trust fund, \nthe bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in July of 2003. \nBut the bill had many problems. I then solicited the assistance of \nFederal Judge Edward Becker, a senior judge who had been the Chief \nJudge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and in August of \n2003, Judge Becker convened a meeting in his chambers in Philadelphia \nattended by stakeholders. That is the name we gave to the various \ngroups which had key interests in the asbestos bill. One stakeholder \nwas the AFL-CIO, representing labor; another stakeholder was the \nmanufacturers; another, the insurers; another, the trial lawyers. Even \nthough the trial lawyers have been opposed to the bill because it has a \nmajor impact on their financial status--and I understand that--we \nincluded the trial lawyers in every step of the proceeding, trying to \naccommodate as many interests as we could. Even though someone was \ngoing to be opposed to the bill, we wanted to consider what they had to \nsay. We wanted to produce a bill which was as good as we could possibly \nproduce.\n  Following those initial meetings in August of 2003 in Judge Becker's \nchambers, there have been meetings in my conference room--totaling 36--\nattended by varying groups, from 20 to as many as 60, pouring out into \nthe boundaries of the office from the conference room. What we have \ndone has been to seek to accommodate every issue which has come up. We \nare still talking to Senators and still talking to companies and \ninterested parties to find answers to their problems.\n  One of the major issues has been the impact on small companies. That \nhas been addressed by a number of Senators. Senator Kyl has taken the \nlead, and a proposal has been worked out to cap the contribution by \nsmaller companies which have gross revenues below a certain figure. In \naddition, there is a fund of some $300 million annually for the \nadministrator to take care of hardship cases so that no one, for \nexample, should be driven into bankruptcy by what they have to pay. We \nhave taken that into account.\n  The figure of $140 billion was worked out by Senator Frist and \nSenator Daschle about a year and a half ago. It is a figure that grows \nfrom that originally put into the trust fund to that figure where CBO \nhas given us the assurance that the range of cost will be somewhere \nbetween $120 billion and $135 billion. Under one contingency, it could \ngo to $150 billion, but that is unlikely.\n  We have within the structure of the bill a provision that the \nadministrator can make a reevaluation, going through certain \npreconditions, so that if it looks as if we are going to exceed $140 \nbillion, we can make modifications in the medical standards and \ncriteria to stay within the $140 billion.\n  One factor is emphatically plain, and that is that there is no \nobligation by the Federal Government to spend a dime. There were three \namendments directed during the committee process to make sure of that.\n  There are possible technical points of order which may be raised, and \nwe are in the process of trying to restructure the bill to eliminate \nthem. At this point, I am not sure whether we can, but we are trying to \ndo that, and we may be successful.\n  But if a point of order is raised on the merits, it ought to be \nexamined by Senators because there is no impact on the Federal budget. \nTechnically, the expenditures are made by the Federal Government \nbecause the funds go through the Department of Labor, but they are only \na conduit. There is no Federal money. So if you want to use 60 votes to \ndefeat the bill, the point of order may be available, as I say, or may \nnot be. But substantively there is nothing to the point of order \nbecause this bill does not have any impact on the Federal budget \nbecause there is no Federal money. The Department of Labor is just, \nplain and simple, a conduit.\n  Similarly, if you want to defeat the bill on an obstructionist \ntactic, which is what is being undertaken now on a filibuster on the \nmotion to proceed, the 60 votes can be used. Senator Reid was on the \nfloor yesterday, and we had a disagreement. You might call it a \ndisagreement. But the one thing that he did talk about involved the \nproblems of people suffering from mesothelioma and other asbestos \nproblems. So there is no doubt that the leader of the opposition, \nobstructionist No. 1, the Senator from Nevada, concedes the problem, \nconcedes that we have a major problem. Now, that ought to be sufficient \nto proceed to see if we can solve the problem. Occasionally around here \nwe ought to deal with a pending matter, whether it is a point of order \nor a motion to proceed, on the merits. What is involved in a motion to \nproceed is a decision by the Senate that we ought to consider \nlegislation on this issue. If somebody has amendments, we are open. We \nhave accepted more than 70 amendments in the committee. If somebody has \na problem with constituents, I invite them to come to see me, my staff, \nor Senator Leahy.\n  We have bipartisan support for this bill. Senator Leahy, Senator \nKohl, and Senator Feinstein voted the bill out of committee. We have \nother support among Democrats. And I am talking to Senators on an \nindividual basis and have visited with many of them in their offices \nand am available to do more.\n  But the issue on a motion to proceed is whether you have problem, \nwhich we certainly do, and whether legislation ought to be considered. \nAnd if somebody has amendments, if somebody has a constituent who \nthinks the constituent company is being asked to pay more than a fair \nshare which is jeopardizing the company, come to us. We have been \nconsidering individual cases, and we have been solving them in many \ninstances. We are open for business.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana is going to address a problem \nin Libby, MT, where they have had environmental problems. Asbestos was \nused in a reckless, disgraceful, criminal manner by W.R. Grace & \nCompany, and we are working to accommodate Libby, MT. There may be more \nthat we can do for that issue. There are other so-called hot spots \naround the country, and we are taking them up.\n  There have been issues raised about our medical criteria. We have \nstudies by the Institute of Medicine. If you have a problem, we want to \nsolve it. We want this bill to go forward.\n  But on the narrow issue we are voting on at 6 o'clock this evening, \nany Senator who votes not to proceed is saying to his constituents, is \nsaying to people suffering from mesothelioma, people suffering from \nasbestos exposure--anybody who votes no on the motion to proceed is \nsaying there is no problem. Well, I think that is a pretty tough vote \nto explain, a pretty tough vote to explain that there is no problem, \nand it ought not to be considered by the Senate.\n  Yesterday, in the discussions--you might call them that--with Senator \nReid, I said this was certainly the most complex bill I have seen in \nthe time I\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nhave been in the Senate. And I think it is fair and accurate to say it \nis the most complex piece of legislation ever considered by a \nlegislative body. I know that is a pretty grandiose statement, and I do \nnot know all the legislation considered by legislative bodies, but I \nthink it is accurate.\n  I challenge anybody to bring to my attention, to the attention of the \nSenate, any legislative proposal which has ever been undertaken and \nanalyzed that is more complicated than this one, that has received more \nattention than we had in 36 meetings in my conference room, in dozens--\ndozens--literally hundreds of meetings involving Judge Becker and \nmyself and Senators.\n  Enormous work has been done by Senator Leahy. I owe him a debt of \ngratitude for his cooperation and his leadership. Senator Feinstein has \nhad innovative proposals on startup. As I say, Senator Leahy, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Kohl are cosponsors.\n  So if anybody has an issue, I invite them to come forward. But I \nthink it is an unconscionable vote to vote no on the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise on this subject and first of \nall I want to congratulate--maybe that is not the word--the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for tackling this important problem. I can't \nthink of a time or a piece of legislation that has been so complicated \nand so important to my State of Montana. So I want to tell the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee that the statement he made is right on \ntarget. Some of us that have been impacted by asbestos and asbestos-\nrelated diseases take this very seriously. We need to vote to proceed.\n  I want to tell you why I am involved in this and there are a couple \nof other issues that are also burning in our office right now that need \nmy personal attention. When you go to Libby, MT, it is a little town in \nnorthwest Montana on the Kootenai River, and the W.R. Grace Company had \na mine up there. And if you are not torn on this issue, both sides of \nit, the statement of Eva Thomson from up there I will just read her \nstatement. That is why I am giving my statement with regard to Libby, \nbecause it is an isolated case.\n  Eva Thomson said:\n\n       I have two sons, both them and I have asbestos-related \n     disease. But they are not eligible by the standards in the \n     existing bill as it is today. If the bill cannot be done \n     right to protect us victims, please don't pass it at all. We \n     place 225 crosses in the cemetery this Memorial Day in \n     remembrance of asbestos victims. There are more than 20 new \n     crosses this year. We need help, real help, and she thanks \n     me.\n\n  Yet I have another one from Charlotte Wade, who says:\n\n       Please don't forget us. I watched my Dad Jack die in 2002 \n     and my mother Margaret die and suffocate from asbestos in \n     2004. I'm next. I've been on oxygen since the year 2000. My \n     three grown children, no doubt, will follow.\n\n  Jim Davidson, long time resident of Libby, MT. He has been diagnosed \nwith mesothelioma:\n\n       Because of the short time I have left, I'm vitally \n     interested in seeing that a compromise is reached to allow \n     passage of some type of relief to me and all others affected \n     by asbestos and worse. As you know, there's no other avenue \n     left to those of us in Libby, Montana, because of the \n     bankruptcy of W.R. Grace. So I urge to you work for some type \n     of help for us.\n\n  Those are just three of hundreds in Libby, MT, that makes it a \nspecial place and harbors a special place in this piece of legislation. \nSo I rise today to ask the Members of the Senate to remember the plight \nof the residents of this small town as this debate over the asbestos \nbill continues. I know a lot of folks have taken issue with the \nassertion that the Libby residents deserve special consideration. Well, \nI am here today to reiterate why this consideration is needed.\n  The asbestos contamination in Libby is as widespread as any area in \nthe country. Though a sparsely populated town, the residents of that \ncity have been profoundly affected by this spread of asbestos-related \ndiseases. The asbestos exposure in Libby is unlike any other place in \nthe United States. While I know my colleagues lament that they have \nsimilar situations in their own States, I ask them to simply listen.\n  The scope of asbestos exposure in Libby, MT, may never be known, but \nlet me assure, you, Mr. President, that it is significant.\n  When Governor Martz of Montana executed the so-called silver bullet \nunder CERCLA, she triggered a fast track listing of Libby on the \nNational Priorities List. There has only been one other time when the \nsilver bullet has been triggered due to asbestos. But that case in \nArizona was limited to 17 square acres, not the contamination of an \nentire town. And unlike the case in Globe, AZ, the asbestos in Libby, \nMT, can't simply be covered in a filter fabric and soil and rock, \nfenced to keep everyone out. Unfortunately we can't control the \nexposure in that way. And the people in Montana--in Libby--don't want \nthat.\n  So I challenge anyone--anyone--from any State to identify a town \nanywhere else in the country that has these kind of situations. I just \nwant to show you right behind me is the vermiculite mine that was \nopened in 1924. By the 1950, cases of previously diagnosed as \ntuberculosis were instead cases of asbestos exposure. The town of Libby \nis located in a valley where the W.R. Grace processed ore from the \ncontaminated mine, more than a half million pounds of asbestos a day \nwas processed.\n  The Libby case is not an isolated case to the exposure within the \nconfines of a factory. Instead, asbestos was everywhere. Community \nexposure was rampant. Contaminated properties including everything from \nthe Libby community boat dock to the high school--the high school \ntrack. I want to put up this next picture. This is important. This is \nmore than just a family hugging a mine worker after coming home and \ncomplaining of exposure. This is about asbestos exposure so significant \nthat asbestos fibers fell like snow from the sky.\n  This is not very far from the mine. It is not very far from their \nloading and processing areas. This is the baseball field in Libby, MT. \nChildren played on piles of vermiculite and all around town finding \nhumor in taking a match to a fiber which would ignite.\n  Houses all over town were insulated with asbestos-contaminated in \ninsulation. So my point is this morning, I invite anybody to visit this \nsmall town in northwest Montana, though I doubt my colleagues will take \nme up on the offer. In the summer, maybe when fishing is pretty good I \ncould probably lure some of you out there but this is extremely \nimportant that other Senators understand the vast difference between \nthis town of Montana and various processing plants that were located \naround the country. They were in isolated and enclosed areas.\n  This was free to the wind, to the winds of the vermiculite and one \ncannot just sit here and try to draw a mental picture of the impact \nthat it had.\n  It is extremely important that Senators during this debate understand \nthis is a special place, a special circumstance, and special people who \nstill live there. I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Specter has done marvelous work on this. And to \ntackle this issue, as big as it is, and though we may have some \ndisagreements on the size of the trust fund, who pays into the trust \nfund, how much they pay, the formulas, all of this, but I am sort of on \nthe other side of this. Mine is the protection of people who have \nseriously been impacted by this thing we call asbestos since 1924.\n  Walk through the cemeteries and see those families, and to have \npeople come to your town hall meeting short of breath, being suffocated \nby this disease, or any disease related to asbestos.\n  I only hope we can continue to work together not only to safeguard \nthese Libby provisions, but to improve them as well.\n  And again I want to thank the chairman. He is a man of great bravery \nto take this issue on. And it is troubling. It is complex. But I will \ntell you, it is important.\n  And I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana for those important comments. I commend him for his diligence \nin looking after his constituents with special reference to what has \ngone on in Libby, MT. He has outlined the problem, walking through the \ncemeteries, seeing the people who have been smitten since the 1920s. He \nunderscores and\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\nemphasizes, in graphic and forceful terms, the problem. I hear him when \nhe talks about Libby, MT. We have been addressing it with a special \nprovision. We will do more if we possibly can. I have talked to Senator \nBurns off the floor on many occasions and heard the serious problems \nthe people of Montana face in Libby. And I have heard the problem that \nthese hotspots create around the country. We will do everything we can. \nI compliment the Senator from Montana for his thoughtful statement and \nthank him for his support on the motion to proceed.\n  Again, anybody who has listened to Senator Burns, who doesn't think \nwe ought to proceed and take up this problem, simply has his or her \nhead in the sand. It would be unconscionable to vote against the motion \nto proceed.\n  Senator Santorum was in the Chamber a few moments ago. He proposes to \nspeak on the Steelers' great victory. I am due at the swearing in of \nthe Ambassador to Finland so I will have to leave the floor in a few \nmoments.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter and Mr. Santorum are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber, let \nme say I again invite any Senator or any constituent who has a problem \nwith this bill to come see me. I know Senator Leahy feels the same way. \nWith all the outstanding work he has done, and our staffs, we want to \ndo what we can to answer all of the problems. As we get ready for the \nvote on the motion to proceed this afternoon, we have certainly \noutlined the seriousness of the issue.\n  Since I spoke earlier, I have been reviewing the testimony or the \nargument yesterday of Senator Durbin who spoke about the problem. No \ndoubt there is a problem that has to be addressed. That is the issue on \nthe motion to proceed. Senator Durbin made a comment that he didn't \nknow how the $140 billion was arrived at. It was arrived at by his \nleader, then-Senator Daschle, in collaboration with Senator Frist. He \nsaid he hadn't been able to find out where the money is coming from. He \ncould if he would make an inquiry. We had to subpoena the records, but \nthere is transparency. We know where the money is coming from. I \nhaven't had a chance to read his statement in full, but I will no doubt \nhave more to say about it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the U.S. Senate gets started for the \nsecond legislative session of the 109th Congress, I would like to take \nthis opportunity and concentrate our attention on the milestones \nachieved in the global war on terror and take a look at the road ahead.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, we and many others in the \ninternational community have been united in our effort to defeat \nterrorism wherever it has taken hold in the world. September 11 proved \nwithout a doubt that a network of extremists preaching hate and \noppression were determined to cause our Nation great harm. It is clear \nthese extremists were and continue to be committed to nothing less than \nthe total destruction of our Nation and our way of life. This network \nof terrorism is embedded in many countries. It has penetrated hard \nworking communities, valued institutions of education, and sacred \nplaces of worship.\n  As in any previous world conflicts, the global war on terror cannot \nbe successfully prosecuted without extensive cooperation of the members \nof the international community. Given the potential catastrophic \nconsequences of terrorist attacks, President Bush worked with our \ninternational partners and allies to identify terrorist networks, \nreduce their ability to communicate and coordinate their plans, and \ndisrupt attacks before they occur.\n  With America in the lead, a full scale international campaign began \nin 2001. A total of 136 countries, including members of the European \nUnion, Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Australia, countries of Asia and \nAfrica provided and, in many instances, still continue to provide a \nrange of intelligence and/or military assistance. As a result of this \nunprecedented multilateral cooperation, we have been able to kill or \ncapture more than one half of the known al Qaida leaders and prevent \npossible terrorist attacks both in the U.S. and abroad.\n  Despite the many difficulties in this war, our Nation has not \nretreated nor walked away in the face of adversity. We sought out \nterrorists, cut off their funding, and disrupted their plans. Under the \nsteadfast leadership of President Bush our country has taken the battle \nto the enemy and achieved significant successes.\n  In October 2001, the coalition forces launched a military campaign \nagainst the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The regime was successfully \nremoved from power and all known al Qaida training camps were \ndestroyed.\n  With the help from the international community, the people of \nAfghanistan, many for the first time in the history of their nation, \ntasted the initial seeds of freedom. Let me pause here for a second. \nFor the first time in history millions of people in Afghanistan are now \nable to express their opinions without a fear of retribution or \npunishment.\n  After several national elections, the people of Afghanistan adopted a \nnew constitution, elected a president and held successful parliamentary \nelections. Efforts to revitalize Afghanistan's economy and education \nsystem have already produced significant results. Agricultural \nproduction, which is a way of life for 70 percent of Afghanistan's \npeople, has nearly doubled. New roads are being built. Teachers are \nbeing trained and an increasing number of people, including women, have \naccess to education.\n  Afghanistan was devastated by decades of war and neglect and is now \nbeing turned into a young democracy that will be an example to others \nin the troubled region.\n  A year after September 11, the President challenged the United \nNations to confront another protector of terror: Saddam Hussein. Saddam \nHussein failed to comply with more than a dozen of United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions and he gave every appearance of continuing \nto hide large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Based on Saddam's reported weapons of mass destruction and support \nfor terrorism, Iraq represented a dangerous nexus that the \ninternational community could no longer ignore. President Bush bravely \nmade the decision to liberate Iraq from the most brutal regime in the \ncountry's history and plant the seeds of freedom in the land that had \nonly known decades of tyranny and oppression.\n\n  It is clear today that the terrorists view Iraq as the major \nbattleground against the coalition forces, against the rule of law, and \nagainst peace and prosperity. During the last 2 years they have tried \nto derail the democratic process and threatened to kill those \nparticipating in it. Undeterred, the majority of the Iraqi people have \nbravely ignored this threat and joined the emerging Iraqi political \nprocess.\n  By the millions, Iraqis lined up to choose a transitional government \nthat\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\ndrafted the most democratic constitution in the Arab world. By the \nmillions, Iraqis approved that constitution in a national referendum. \nAnd by the millions, Iraqis elected a new Iraqi government under the \nIraqi-written constitution for the Iraqi people. Let there be no doubt \nabout it: the establishment of a meaningful political process and \nlasting democratic institutions will decide Iraq's future.\n  We can be proud of the fact that each national vote in Iraq has \nexperienced less violence and produced bigger and broader voter \nturnout. President Bush put it best when he stated:\n\n       In all three aspects of our strategy--democracy, security \n     and reconstruction--we are learning from our experiences, and \n     we are fixing what hasn't worked. . . . we have witnessed a \n     transformation in Iraq that is virtually without precedent.\n\n  Iraqi security forces continue to show improvements in defending \ntheir fellow countrymen. In October of last year, Iraqi police and army \npersonnel secured polling sites around the country, quickly suppressing \nany incidents of violence.\n  Growing in size and strength, Iraqi military units have become more \ncapable and able to defend their country's emerging democracy. Today, \nIraqi security battalions have assumed control over entire sectors of \nIraq. These accomplishments demonstrate the willingness of Iraqis to \nstand up to insurgents and protect their fellow countrymen. Iraqis are \ngradually taking over the frontline in defense of their communities.\n  With each Iraqi soldier trained and equipped to carry out the \nmission, Iraq draws closer to being able to stand on its own and \nprotect its own freedom.\n  A free society cannot exist without an independent and impartial \njudicial system. With slow but steady progress on all fronts, the Iraqi \npeople are carefully building one of the country's most important \ninstitutions: its judiciary. With the help from the international \ncommunity, the Iraqi people have begun the trial of one of the most \nbrutal dictators in history, Saddam Hussein. Although none of Hussein's \nvictims had a luxury of due process, the new Iraqi government decided \nto adhere to the highest standard of the rule of law and allowed its \nformer dictator to stand trial by his peers.\n  None of these successes would have been possible if not for the \nsacrifice of America's finest men and women in uniform. Their pride, \npatriotism and perseverance have been the deciding factor on the \nbattlefields far away from home. They have answered the call of duty in \na noble but difficult task. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice. \nTheir families will always be in our thoughts and prayers. We should \nhonor their lives by defeating the terrorists.\n  The successful strategy for prosecuting the global war on terror set \nforth by President Bush is steadily moving forward. The road ahead will \nrequire additional sacrifice from America's leaders, members of the \nmilitary and the American people. We must continue to unite behind our \nCommander-In-Chief, make the necessary adjustments, and move forward on \nthe path of complete victory. The Global War on Terror demands nothing \nless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, later this afternoon, in fact about 3\\1/2\\ \nhours, we will gather in the Senate to vote on a motion to proceed to \ntake up and begin debate on legislation that is designed--imperfect \nlegislation but well intended--to ensure that people who have been \nexposed to asbestos who become sick, whose breathing is impaired from \nthat sickness, will have an opportunity to be compensated for their \nimpairment. As their impairment worsens, if it does, they would be in a \nposition to be compensated further. The legislation also is intended to \ntry to ensure that more money that is paid--if you go by defendants and \ninsurance companies--ends up in the pockets of those victims and of \ntheir families.\n  The question is, Why are we taking this up now? One of the reasons we \nare taking this up now is because the Supreme Court has been saying, at \nleast since 1997, with Justices including, I believe, Justice Ginsburg \nand maybe more recently Justice Souter, that the issue of asbestos \nlitigation is one that needs to be resolved by Congress, not by the \nCourt. It is appropriate that finally we are taking this on.\n  My own experience and involvement with asbestos litigation reform \ngoes back to 2001, when I was called upon by an old friend who had \nended up becoming a CEO of a company I had never heard of called \nFederal-Mogul. Federal-Mogul is a company headquartered in Michigan \nthat manufactures, among other things, Champion spark plugs and a lot \nof other products. He had become CEO in 2001 and was in Washington and \ntold me about it. I congratulated him and said good luck, and said if I \ncan be of service, let me know. He called me back in about 6 months. He \nsaid: Remember, you said if I could ever be of assistance to let you \nknow. We have a problem at Federal-Mogul. And he came back to explain \nwhat it was all about.\n  Apparently, Federal-Mogul acquired a number of years before, long \nbefore my friend became CEO, a British company that had an exposure to \nasbestos, and because of that exposure, Federal-Mogul was drawn into \nasbestos litigation lawsuits by folks whose health had been damaged, I \nbelieve, by the British subsidiary that I think was owned and sold by \nFederal-Mogul in a relatively short period of time.\n  At the time, I took my friend around to meet with the two Senators \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow. They were good \nenough to meet with him. I also took him over to meet with the then-\nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, \nand asked Chairman Leahy to meet with the CEO from Federal-Mogul. He \ndid. The long and short of it is Federal-Mogul went into bankruptcy. \nThey have come out of bankruptcy, but a lot of the shareholders who \nowned stock in the company lost a good deal. Folks who had been \nemployees, pensioners who had their money in 401(k) plans, lost a fair \namount of their money if it was invested in company stock. The company \nended up with fewer employees than it had in the first place.\n  Along about the same time I had another visit, this from a trial \nlawyer who represented, and I presume still represents, people who have \nbeen exposed to asbestos in their work and have developed a fatal \ndisease called mesothelioma. This attorney came to say that the system, \nas it existed in either 2001 or 2002, was not working, and the folks he \nrepresented who were sick and dying, many who die within a year or so, \nwere not receiving the help they and their families needed--at least \nnot promptly. And a good deal of the moneys paid by defendants ended up \nin the pockets of people such as him, the attorney.\n  He said people who are sick and dying ought to get the money they \nneed, generously; they should get it now. The folks who have been \nexposed to asbestos but who are not sick and do not have an impairment \nshould not get anything now and folks such as I,\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nmaybe, should get a little bit less in terms of the moneys paid by \ndefendants to victims.\n  That was how I was introduced to this issue. I did not come to the \nSenate to be involved in civil justice reform or particularly asbestos \nlitigation reform, but I did come with a number of core values. I think \nwe all did. Among the core values I brought was to try to figure out \nwhat is the right thing to do: Try to treat other people the way I want \nto be treated, try to use a little bit of common sense.\n  We have been joined in the Senate by Senator Hatch, who preceded and \nlater succeeded Senator Leahy as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \nHe has worked, as has Senator Leahy, and as has the current chairman, \nSenator Specter of the Judiciary Committee, to try to improve the \nlegislation that was introduced years ago, maybe even before I came \nhere in 2001, initially.\n  What was originally introduced was not a static use of legislation. \nIt was not the Ten Commandments. It was not carved into stone. It was a \nlegislative proposal. Over time, it has been changed and has been \nimproved and, frankly, I believe it can be improved further. I will \ntalk a little bit about some of the improvements that have been made \nover time to the earlier legislation and some further changes I would \nlike to see made and would expect to support those changes.\n  Before I do that, let me back up for a moment and say some Members \nworked on class action reform legislation which was enacted and signed \nby the President early last year. Again, Senator Hatch was a leader in \nthat effort. I was involved, to some extent, along with some of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Kohl, among others on \nour side, working with our colleagues on the Republican side.\n  The history of class action reform goes back to the 1990s. The idea \nbehind class action reform legislation was to try to come up with a \nlegislative approach to make sure, when little people are harmed by big \ncompanies or by small companies--harmed not that they lose their arm, \nleg or eyesight but harmed in a material way--that those little people \nhave the opportunity to be made whole but, at the same time, to make \nsure, when the class action lawsuit is filed by a group of people that \nare drawn into a plaintiff class, the defendants have the opportunity \nto be defended or have their case heard in a courtroom or before a \njudge so the defendant, as well as the plaintiff, can be given a fair \nshake.\n  That legislation was introduced in the 1990s, reintroduced in \nsubsequent Congresses, debated in committee, voted on in committee, and \nreported out of committee. Class action literally came to the floor, I \nthink, on at least two occasions where we were unable to get the votes \nfor cloture to end debate and to go on to final debate and passage with \nan up-or-down vote on the bill.\n  That process, though, where legislation is introduced, maybe over \nseveral Congresses, is debated within the appropriate committees, voted \non in those committees, amended in those committees, reported out to \nthe Senate, and debated here, amended here, I call that regular order. \nThat is what we call regular order.\n  When the final compromise was agreed to on class action, including \nthe bipartisan group I alluded to a few minutes ago, we struck an \nagreement amongst ourselves, an agreement with the House of \nRepresentatives that if we would not amend or change that compromise \nthat we struck on class action, the House would accept our proposal, \nthe House would not change one word. As a result, we, the drafters, if \nyou will, of the final compromise on class action reform opposed, for \nthe most part, all amendments. I think I supported one offered by \nSenator Feingold. But no amendments were approved. No amendments were \nattached to the bill. The bill passed with a bipartisan majority and \nwas sent to the House of Representatives. They adopted it lock, stock, \nand barrel.\n  What I want to see happen on asbestos litigation legislation is that \nwe proceed with regular order. In fact, we have been proceeding with \nregular order. But there is a difference between asbestos litigation on \nthe floor and class action on this Senate floor a year or so ago. Here \nis the difference: There is no agreement amongst the bipartisan group \nthat I talked about earlier to pass an unamended bill. As I said a few \nmoments ago, this is not a perfect bill, it is an imperfect bill, but \nit is a whole lot better than it was when it started out. In my view, \nit can be made better still.\n  I would like to see us soon--we vote today at 6 o'clock on the motion \nto proceed to the bill. My hope is Democrats and Republicans, a \nmajority of us, 60 or more, will vote to proceed to the bill, to debate \nthe bill, offer amendments, debate those amendments, vote on those \namendments, and then to see how the bill takes shape during the course \nof the debate in the week or so ahead.\n  Let me mention, briefly, some of the improvements that have been made \nin the bill over what was introduced maybe back in the late 1990s or \nthe earlier part of this decade.\n  First of all, serious questions were raised, and are still raised, \nabout the size of the trust fund that will be created. Moneys paid into \nit by defendant companies, roughly $90 billion; by insurers, about $46 \nbillion; by trust funds and others, $4 billion--adding up to, roughly, \nabout $140 billion. That is almost 50 percent more in the trust fund \nthan I think was originally anticipated just a few years ago. So I \nwould suggest one of the improvements that has been made in this bill \nis just the adequacy of the trust fund.\n  There is a second thing that I would suggest has been an improvement \nmade in this bill over maybe an earlier version. Now, $140 billion is a \nlot of money, but there is a history of the trust funds set up to help \nasbestos victims, there is a history of them, in some cases, running \nout of money. So what happens if we have a trust fund that is set up \nwhere everybody who, in the future, wants to file a claim has to go to \nthe trust fund for an administrative solution and the fund runs out of \nmoney? What do we do then?\n  What we do then is really take the path suggested by Senator Dianne \nFeinstein of California. In anticipation of just that kind of problem \ndown the road, she offered language, which was adopted and made part of \nthis bill, which says if the trust fund runs out of money at some point \ndown the line and it does not look as if we are going to have enough \nmoney in the trust fund any time soon to pay victims' claims, then \nthose victims can return to the tort system. They can go back into \ncourt in the State in which they live. They can go back into court in \nthe State where they were injured. Or they can go back into the tort \nsystem in Federal courts.\n  Another area where I think improvement has been made deals with folks \nwho have been injured, where they have been receiving workers' \ncompensation, and now they will, in the coming months or years--if we \nestablish this fund--have the opportunity to file a claim with the \nasbestos trust fund. The question was: Well, can a person receive money \nout of the trust fund and also have received previously workers' comp \nor currently receive workers' compensation funds? Or do they have to \npay that back somehow out of the money they receive from the trust \nfund?\n  I think the authors of the bill, wisely, and the committee, wisely, \nsaid no. If the person is receiving workers' comp from a separate \nsource of funds, they can keep that. It does not have to be reclaimed \nor repaid. And the claimant, the victim, can then also receive the \nmoneys from the trust fund that we would set up, establish under this \nlegislation.\n\n  If you look at the legislation, a fourth improvement deals with \nsomething called medical monitoring. But if you look at the \nlegislation, there are a number of levels of impairment, starting with \nlevel I, and I think going up to level IX. And there may be some \nvarious gradations within each of those levels.\n  Level I is something called medical monitoring. It has been a matter \nof some contention. Some of the companies, some of the defendants, some \nof the insurance companies were very skittish and reluctant, \nunderstandably so, given the history of some of the ways people were \nrecruited to file some, not all but some, asbestos claims in the past. \nThey were concerned the medical monitoring might be an effort to \nrecruit all kinds of people to file claims on the trust fund.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\n  But medical monitoring is included as level I for impairment. And \nlevel I means a person has been exposed to asbestos--maybe in their \nwork or another part of their environment--but they do not have an \nimpairment, there is no discernible impairment that we can attribute to \nasbestos. But by establishing medical monitoring, what we say to those \nwho have been exposed, who do not have an impairment, at least we \nacknowledge you could have a problem down the road, and we are going to \nprovide, every year or two, for the opportunity for someone--a health \nprofessional who really does know their business--to examine that \nvictim and see whether any impairment has developed. If so, they can go \nthrough other levels and become eligible for sums of money, from \nseveral tens of thousands of dollars to over $1 million in the worst \ncases.\n  A fifth improvement I think has been made deals with what are called \nexigent claims. Those are claims filed traditionally by people who have \nmesothelioma, the disease I talked about earlier, caused by asbestos, \nsolely by asbestos exposure. We know mesothelioma victims, folks, are \ngoing to die, unfortunately, and not a pleasant death, and die fairly \nsoon, generally within less than a year.\n  For exigent claims like that, or other people who are believed by \ndoctors to be in a terminal situation where their lifespan is less than \na year, those claims, under this improved version of the bill, will be \ntreated on an expedited basis. I believe that is an improvement.\n  There are other improvements. I mention one: silica claims. There are \nmixed death claims that are not just asbestos. They might be silica. A \ngood thing that happened last year during the course of the committee's \nhearings is they brought in medical experts and actually talked to them \nand listened to the medical experts talk about: What do the x rays look \nlike for people who have been exposed to asbestos as opposed to those \nwho have been exposed to silica?\n  We know people can die from both, do die from both. But as it turns \nout, if we establish an asbestos trust fund, and someone has been \nexposed maybe to asbestos but does not have the markings from asbestos, \nand someone has been exposed to silica, and they have the impairment \nthat relates to silica, can they come to the trust fund and be made \nwhole out of the asbestos trust fund? The answer is no. The silica \nvictims are welcome to go back into the tort system, to stay in the \ntort system. Again, there is apparently a real difference in the \nappearance of the x rays of the lungs of people who have been exposed \nto asbestos who have asbestosis and those who have lung disease that \nhas been caused by silica.\n  Those are some of the improvements that have been made to the bill. I \nwant to mention maybe one or two others that I think ought to be made \nand have been drawn to my attention, and I suspect to most of our \ncolleagues' attention as well.\n  One deals with the startup provisions and the steps we need to take \nto help ensure the trust fund is set up and running quickly and \nefficiently. We are on a tight time period, a tight timeframe. There is \na whole lot of work that is going to be done that we have not done, at \nleast not with asbestos. It is going to be a real challenge to the \nDepartment of Labor getting the right people to run this operation and \nassembling the money quickly and putting in place a system that is user \nfriendly and will actually provide relief to a lot of victims.\n  I believe there are some further steps we will debate on the floor \nand, hopefully, be able to adopt.\n  Some folks from the insurance industry have shared with me, and I am \nsure shared with others, the concern they have about potential leakage \nissues, as people file claims in the tort system for alleging \nimpairment of breathing from exposure to asbestos. And the question is, \nAt what point do we say to the victim, to the plaintiff, you have to go \ninto the trust fund or you may continue through the tort system? There \nare concerns raised by the insurance industry that we, frankly, have \nnot done the kind of job that needs to be done with respect to what \nthey call leakage in the system. That is one we want to revisit and \nconsider.\n  I am not an attorney. We all know people who are. I have a concern, \nand I know it is a concern shared by others, that if we cap it at 5 \npercent, the amount of money that can go to an attorney, in some cases \nthat is adequate. This is a system that is not designed to, frankly, \nneed a whole lot of assistance. And, hopefully, some people will be \nable to go through this system and apply for money from the trust fund \nand receive their claim, their payment without the assistance of an \nattorney or anybody else.\n  But in some cases you are going to have an attorney who has worked \nfor not just months but maybe a couple of years to help prepare a case \nto be heard in a court, only to find that before they could actually \nbring the case to a judge and jury and have a verdict, they are cut off \nbecause of the establishment of this trust fund. In that case, where \nyou may have had attorneys work for months or a couple years, to say \nthat person can only receive a 5-percent payment out of the payment \nfrom the fund, I think, is just unfair.\n  Again, it goes back to one of my core values I talked about earlier: \ntreat other people the way we want to be treated. If I were the \nattorney and I had actually done work for a couple of years, I would \nwant to be paid more than 5 percent of, say, a million dollars for the \nwork I had done. Attorneys today, not uncommonly, get 25, 30, 35, 40 \npercent in attorney's fees for the work they do in conjunction with \nthese victims. I am not suggesting we have those kinds of payments to \nattorneys, but I would suggest maybe the better part of valor is to say \nthat the attorneys could receive 5 percent, and in cases where they \nhave done work give the administrator of the fund the discretion to \nprovide something in addition, something on top of, above the 5-percent \ncap--at the discretion of the administrator. And maybe we want to cap \nit at 20 percent or something like that. But I would suggest that is a \nfair thing to do and a just thing to do, particularly where an attorney \nhas done a great deal of work.\n  Let me close by saying this. I came here, like I think all my \ncolleagues, because I wanted to get things done. I want to right wrongs \nand try to help people as best we can. Sometimes it is best for people \nwho are hurt to take those grievances to the courts, and to address, \nthrough the judicial system, the wrongs they believe they have \nincurred. The highest Court in our land, the Supreme Court, has said on \nseveral occasions in the last decade, we have a problem with asbestos \nlitigation that needs the attention of the Congress and the President \nand we should try to improve on a situation that is flawed.\n  I am an old Navy guy and spent a number of years of my life as a \nnaval officer, and not as much time on ships. I spent a little time on \nships. I know a lot of folks served in the military--and a lot of them \nwere in the Navy who served on ships--who were exposed to asbestos, had \ntheir breathing impaired, and, in a number of cases, died.\n  They are not in a position to go into court and sue the Federal \nGovernment to be made whole. They can get some help through the VA \nsystem, and they have, but they are not in a position to receive the \nkind of payments and recovery of damages that others have been able to \nin the courts because private sector employers have been sued as \ndefendants by victims, and those victims cannot sue the Federal \nGovernment. Under this legislation, a veteran from any part of the \narmed services who is precluded from receiving much in the way of \ndamages will now have the opportunity to go into the same trust fund \nand apply for the same dollar payments that any other person who has \nbeen injured could apply for. As a veteran, that is especially \nnoteworthy. It goes a long way to explaining why so many veterans \ngroups strongly support this legislation.\n  Again, what is our goal? Our goal is to try to make sure that when \npeople have been exposed to asbestos for an extended period of time, \nwhen their health has been damaged, that they have an opportunity to \nreceive some compensation for that harm, to try to do so in a way that \nis prompt and where the amounts of money they can receive actually vary \nfrom fairly modest, when the impairment is slight, to rather \nsubstantial when the impairment is substantial or maybe life \nthreatening. We want to do this in a way where we put more money in the \npockets of victims and their families\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\nand in a way that acknowledges the work that is done by attorneys when \nthey have done a considerable amount of work in preparing for a case \nthat then ends up in the trust fund.\n  Is this bill perfect as it comes to us today? We have been joined on \nthe floor by the chairman of the committee. I thank him and those with \nwhom he serves, certainly Senator Leahy. I also want to say a word \nabout Judge Becker, former chief judge of the Third Circuit, who has \nworked very hard as a mediator to try to help us get to a better place \nwith this legislation. I have met a lot of people in my life, but here \nis a man who suffers from very serious health problems himself. He has \nnon-Hodgkins lymphoma and is in his early seventies. He travels from \nPhiladelphia on the train, pays for his own way. When he spends a night \nhere, he stays in a hotel and pays his own way. He pays for his own \nmeals. He does all this work because he believes it is the right thing \ndo to--and it is.\n  For all who have been working on this for a lot longer than I have to \nget us to this point in time, we need to vote at 6 o'clock to proceed \nto the bill, debate it, change the parts we think need to be changed, \nand go forth from there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his remarks on this bill, for his \ncomments on Senators Specter and Leahy, and for his willingness to \ninvoke cloture this afternoon. We need to proceed to this bill and \ndebate it in on the Senate floor. It is that important.\n  Before proceeding with my remarks, I would like to reserve 15 minutes \nfor my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of S. 862, the \nbipartisan Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act. More \nspecifically, I rise in favor of debating S. 852. It is a bill worth \nour time.\n  The crisis of asbestos exposure impacts not only the lives of sick \nand dying workers and retirees, but also the lives of workers in every \ncorner of the American economy. The litigation that these workplace \ninjuries spawned now threatens to deprive the workers who need \ncompensation for their injuries of their due rewards, while crushing \nbusinesses large and small in every State.\n  I find it surprising that there are those in those body who do not \nwish to address our Nation's asbestos crisis. They do not even want to \nhave this debate. So they are filibustering even a motion to proceed to \nthe bill. It is funny how things change. This summer, when some of the \nMembers of this body were filibustering judicial nominations, we were \ntold that the filibuster was a privilege central to the Senate's \ndeliberative character. The right to speak and debate had to be \npreserved. But through this filibuster, they do not seek to promote \ndebate. They are seeking to prevent it. For the life of me, I do not \nfully understand this type of reasoning.\n  The public health calamity caused by occupational exposure to \nasbestos is something that we should be debating. It is precisely the \ntype of situation that cries out for comprehensive bipartisan \nlegislation. For what it is worth, it is precisely the type of well-\ndocumented crisis that I would expect my colleagues to want to talk \nabout. Instead this filibuster shows that they would rather close their \neyes to this crisis.\n  The consequences of asbestos exposure are tragic and well-documented. \nIt has devastated the families of hard-working American men and women. \nAnd it is not an equal opportunity hazard. It frequently targets \nveterans. It targets those who took their lunch to work, who gave a \nfull day's work for a full day's pay, and who came home with dirt under \ntheir fingernails.\n  Each and every year 10,000 individuals will die from mesothelioma, a \ncancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. Ten thousand moms and dads \nand grandparents. Think about it. And because of the asbestos fibers \nthey would bring home from work, sometimes even the spouses and \nchildren of these workers become sick. Thousands and thousands more \nwill be afflicted with debilitating lung conditions that make it hard \nto breathe, sapping the joy from what should be a person's golden \nyears.\n  This is a public health crisis of the highest magnitude. And this \npublic health crisis is made more pressing by a related litigation \ncrisis. Nobody in this body believes, especially those of us who \nsupport this bill, that individuals who become sick as a result of \nasbestos exposure should be denied compensation. Let me be clear about \nthis. They are owed compensation. Here is the problem: Who is supposed \nto pay? Most of the companies that originally produced this stuff have \nlong since gone out of business or have been put out of business. They \nnow exist in bankruptcy merely to pay out claims to the extent that \nthey can, which amounts to a very small number of pennies on a dollar.\n  What are the victims actually getting from their settlement? Pennies \non the dollar. The actual damage done by exposure to these fibers might \nbe worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but most people will never \nsee that money, money that could go to pay medical bills or take care \nof loved ones, because the companies do not have the money to pay the \nnumber of claims.\n  Of course, this has not proven to be an obstacle to the innovative \ntrial bar. These attorneys are going after corporations, not \nsurprisingly ones with very deep pockets that have inherited their \nasbestos liabilities by acquiring companies that once produced or used \nasbestos. I remember one company in particular that acquired another \ncompany for $10 million. They have paid well over $100 million out in \nasbestos-related claims because of that acquisition.\n  So not content with a public health crisis, a group of committed \nattorneys have set out to bankrupt some of our Nation's greatest \ncompanies, creating an economic crisis as well. And many of them have \nonly had some collateral relationship with asbestos.\n  Playing fast and loose with the actual exposure of their clients, \nthere has been an explosion of litigation in recent years. As a result, \nat least 73 companies have had to declare bankruptcy due to their \nasbestos-related liabilities.\n  Do those who have actually been harmed by asbestos benefit by this \nlitigation? No. They wind up in years of litigation only to find that \nthey get a mere 42 cents out of every dollar. By the time the attorneys \ntake their fees and add on transaction costs, the poor person who has \nbeen injured gets only 42 cents out of every dollar recovered.\n  The status quo does not do justice to those injured by asbestos \nexposure. I am a conservative. I do not believe the Federal Government \nshould attempt to fix every social or economic problem faced by the \ncountry. However, there are certain crises, because of their size, \nbecause of the number of persons impacted, and because of their \ndetrimental impact on the American economy, that call out for national \nlegislation. This is just such a bill.\n\n  Asbestos exposure has cause a far-reaching public health disaster of \nthe highest order, one that is now compounded by an unprecedented \nlitigation crisis. I am hardly alone in thinking this. The Supreme \nCourt of the United States has called on Congress on three separate \noccasions to address this particular problem. In 1999, the Justices \ntold the Nation that ``the elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . \ndefies customary judicial adminstration and calls for national \nlegislation.'' So we answered the call.\n  We are hardly springing this bill on the Senate. We have been \ndebating a solution to the asbestos crisis since the 107th Congress. \nThis is the 109th Congress. When I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, we held hearing after hearing. We had weeks of markups. We \ndid our best to achieve some sort of compromise. Yet when it came time \nto debate this bill on the floor, it was filibustered. The Senate was \nprevented from giving its final up-or-down vote. That was April of \n2004.\n  Then we heard the bill was not ready for prime time. We were rushing \nthe issue, jamming the opposition. We have not considered the issues \ncarefully enough, they said. If only we had more time.\n  Not it is almost 2 years later. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, has again \nheld hearing after hearing. Again, we have had week after week of \nmarkups. He and his staff\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nhave been tireless and fair in their negotiations. Judge Becker, a \nfederal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, has worked to \ncraft a solution.\n  Over the last 3 years, there have been 36 meetings hosted by the \nchairman where any group, including labor unions, trial lawyers, and \nany other interested parties, was welcome. And those efforts have borne \nfruit. Most notably my colleague from Vermont, ranking member of the \ncommittee, came to support this bill. We work a good deal on \nintellectual property issues together, but this bill is a different \nanimal. This is a bill that impacts the rights of workers and the \nrights of the sick. On those types of issues, there is, unfortunately, \nnot enough bipartisanship around here.\n  The fact that the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, is a \ncosponsor of this bill is very important. It is a testament to both the \nscope of the problem it addresses and the depth of good faith \ncompromises that have been made along the way.\n  There are many criticisms made about this bill. Some have suggested \nthat even debating it demonstrates the triumph of corruption. I wonder \nwhat their colleagues from Vermont, California, and Montana think about \nthat? All this time they thought they were working to make this a \nbetter bill. As it turns out, they were just tools of the special \ninterests. Give me a break.\n  I will tell you who the special interests are in this debate. They \nare the law firms that specialize in much of the bogus asbestos \nlitigation that is driving this crisis. They are the lawyers who file \nsuits for people who are not sick, just hoping that some company will \ndecide to settle rather than go to court. They are the lawyers who \npromise the truly sick a jackpot but give them instead years of \nlitigation and then take for themselves fully 60 percent of any \nsettlement. I would call it ``jackpot justice.'' But for the workers \nimpacted by asbestos exposure, there is no jackpot, and this sure is \nnot justice.\n  These lawyers have gotten rich litigating these cases.\n  They do not like the prospect for reform. Why not? Because it is \ngoing to turn off the golden spigot. It will create an easy, no-fault, \nand quick administrative process that will enable those made sick by \nasbestos to obtain compensation without the middle man.\n  In other words, if this bill becomes law, these lawyers are going to \nhave to find some other industry to bilk. The other side of this debate \nshould take a good, long look in the mirror before going down the road \nof accusing the bill's supporters of promoting special interest \nlegislation.\n  In addition, it is beyond ridiculous to suggest, as we heard \nyesterday from opponents, that this bill is being rushed. That is \nabsolutely ridiculous. How is it that a bill that was debated on the \nfloor nearly 2 years ago, reported favorably out of the Judiciary \nCommittee twice--on a bipartisan basis this time--and was subject to \ncountless amendments is somehow not even ready for debate today?\n  We have been at this for years. This bill addresses a recognized \npublic health tragedy. Yet it is not even worthy of debate on the \nSenate floor?\n  For those not steeped in Senate procedure, it is worth noting what is \nbeing suggested by this objection to the motion to proceed.\n  When a bill is filibustered after hours and even days of debate in \norder to prevent a vote on final passage, the message sent is that \nthere has not been enough debate. The issues are so difficult and \ncomplex that more debate is required before this body could responsibly \nmove to final passage.\n  Filibusters are not always justified, but they are sometimes \nunderstandable. When you filibuster a motion to proceed, you are saying \nthis bill is not even worthy of a debate on the floor. This is an \ninsult. I know this is not a perfect bill. Few bills are. The FAIR Act, \nhowever, is most certainly a bill worthy of debate.\n  We have a limited number of days in any given year to do the people's \nbusiness. We only take up bills on the floor when there is a pressing \npublic need. And in the opinion of not only the majority leader but the \nRepublican caucus and even some Democrats, this is a bill worthy of our \nattention and time. Frankly, it is ludicrous to suggest otherwise.\n  Nineteen members of the Senate have cosponsored this legislation. It \nis supported by the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. It has bipartisan support. I do not think there is a person \nin this body who doubts the severity of the problems it is designed to \naddress. So something must be done. This bill is a sound and reasonable \nattempt to do something to help these sick workers get the compensation \nthey deserve.\n  The asbestos trust fund created through this legislation deserves a \ndebate. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to \nproceed and to give this bill the attention it is owed.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill. I pay tribute to Senators \nSpecter and Leahy for the work they have done in committee and in \nbringing this bill to the floor. They deserve accolades from everybody \nin this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber this afternoon to \nsupport the asbestos reform bill, S. 852. This bill is simply about \nhelping victims. It is about doing the right thing for extremely sick \nindividuals. It is about doing the right thing for very sick people by \ncompensating them quickly and fairly.\n  As we know, this bill addresses the asbestos litigation crisis by \nremoving most cases from the court system and paying claims from a \nnational trust fund, using money contributed by company defendants and \ninsurance companies.\n  Let me say up front that removing cases from our court system is not \nsomething we should ever do lightly. Our civil justice system usually \nworks well. Our State and Federal courts are a vital part of our system \nof government. That is where cases should normally be. Our court \nsystem, as a rule, ensures a level of fairness and justice for our \ncitizens that is second to none, and I don't like removing cases from \nthat system.\n  But our justice system is not perfect. Unfortunately, we all know \nthat our justice system, in this case, has failed to deal with the \nasbestos crisis. The system is not adequately protecting the rights of \nvictims, nor is it adequately protecting the rights of defendants. In \nfact, the system has been overwhelmed by asbestos litigation.\n  The numbers tell the story. The sheer volume of claims is staggering. \nMore than 750,000 individuals have made claims for asbestos exposure, \nand approximately 300,000 of those claims are still pending. The most \nrecent Rand study estimates that anywhere between 2.5 million and 3.3 \nmillion individuals could make claims in the future.\n  Part of the problem is the unusual nature of the illnesses caused by \nexposure to asbestos. Specifically, there is a long latency period \nbetween exposure to asbestos and the actual illness or impairment. In \nother words, people can be exposed to asbestos for long periods of time \nbut usually don't show symptoms of illness for 25 or 30 years. Not \neverybody exposed to asbestos gets sick, but our tort system requires a \npotential victim to file a claim for injury within a year or two of \ndiscovering the potential harm. So a vast majority of people who are \nfiling claims are not actually sick at that time, and many may not ever \nget sick, but to protect their legal rights, they file suit.\n  This enormous volume of lawsuits--again, many from people who are not \nill at that time--crowds court dockets, slows the decisionmaking on \nclaims from those who are sick, and imposes huge costs on defendants. \nAs more and more defendants are pushed toward bankruptcy, actual \npayments to victims are diminished.\n  Perversely, the process creates a greater incentive to sue \nimmediately because someone who has been exposed to asbestos--even if \nhe or she has no symptoms--may decide to sue now or take the risk that \nnobody will be left to pay a claim down the road. This increases the \nproblem, and the cycle of excessive litigation and decreasing payments \nto victims continues.\n  As a result, justice is not being served. Many victims wind up with \nno one to sue and receive pennies on the dollar for their claims from \nasbestos bankruptcy trusts. That is not right. That is not just. That \nis not fair to\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\nthese victims. We have to do something about that. On the other \nextreme, a few victims receive huge awards or settlements that are, \nfrankly, sometimes out of proportion to their injuries.\n  The bottom line is that very few people are compensated fairly, and \nmore and more victims face a risk of never being compensated at all for \nasbestos-related illnesses. It is our responsibility in the Senate to \ndeal with this crisis. We simply must not wait any longer to act. We \nmust take steps to help the victims of asbestos exposure, and the bill \nwe have in front of us today does just that.\n  There is another critical problem we have to address with regard to \nasbestos, and that is the issue of jobs. Not only is the current mass \nof litigation hurting victims, but it is also causing tremendous \nproblems for the business community and, subsequently, of course, for \nthe creation and retention of jobs, which hurts workers. As more and \nmore businesses are drawn into this endless cycle of litigation, more \nand more money is being spent on legal fees. These costs, and the \nuncertainty that engulfs these businesses, make it harder to invest in \nimproving their companies and creating new jobs. In fact, asbestos \nliability is actually bankrupting many potential defendants. It has \ngotten to the point where claims are now being brought against \nbusinesses that have a very remote connection with the manufacture of \nasbestos. So the impact of asbestos claims today is simply \noverwhelming--not just to some of our Nation's largest companies but to \nour small businesses as well.\n  This is not just some abstract or academic problem. When businesses \nare harmed, workers are harmed, too. Tens of thousands of workers--real \npeople employed by these businesses--are today being affected. Many \nemployees and their families--people who never had any exposure to \nasbestos at all--are feeling the effects in lost wages, lost jobs, and \ndiminished pensions.\n  The impact in my home State of Ohio is particularly severe. Ohio is \none of the top States in which asbestos litigants choose to file their \nsuits. In fact, literally thousands of companies have been named as \ndefendants in Ohio courts. Out of the more than 8,000 firms that have \nbeen named as defendants nationwide, over 7,000 of these businesses \nhave been named in cases filed in Ohio. Of the almost 80 companies that \nhave filed bankruptcy because of asbestos-related liability, more than \n20 of those companies are headquartered or have significant facilities \nin the State of Ohio.\n  Let me be clear: I believe companies should be held accountable for \ntheir conduct. That is a basic principle of American jurisprudence. But \nmost of the companies that manufacture asbestos are today now bankrupt. \nThe legal system already has decided their liability, and they are \npaying their liability through asbestos trusts.\n  I am concerned, however, about the many companies that now find \nthemselves held responsible for the actions of other companies. These \ncompanies have little to do with asbestos production or use, but they \nemploy thousands of people who contribute to our economy and to our tax \nbase. No one, including the victims of asbestos, is helped when these \ncompanies are punished.\n  I believe it is clear, bluntly, that we have a legal disaster--yes, a \ndisaster--on our hands. The court system is clogged with claims by \npeople who are not ill and may never get ill, and victims who are ill \nmust wait a long time for sometimes very little compensation. Employers \nare at risk even when they have had little to do with asbestos, and \ntheir current employees and retired workers as well are paying the \nprice.\n  Anyone who looks at this honestly has to conclude that the current \nsystem does not work for anyone involved. In fact, the Supreme Court on \nthree separate occasions has called for a national solution, has called \non Congress to take a look at this issue.\n  We have to do something about this crisis. We need to protect the \nrights of victims, and we need to provide business--the group of \nbusinesses which will provide compensation to those victims--with some \nway to predict how much this crisis will cost so they can plan for it \nand figure out a way to stay in business while they pay for it. The \nFAIR Act--this bill--provides that needed protection to victims and \nprovides that needed predictability to businesses so they can continue \nto provide for their employees and retirees.\n  We know, of course, that no bill is perfect. This bill is not \nperfect. Many people believe it must be amended. As a matter of fact, I \nhave heard from a number of Ohio companies that they are not happy \nabout some of the provisions in this bill. Not surprisingly, some think \nthe bill goes too far and some think it doesn't go far enough. We have \nspent a great deal of time discussing and modifying this bill over the \nyears. I believe it has improved the process. During this whole \nprocess, I think we have simply improved it as a result of the work \nthat has been conducted in the Judiciary Committee.\n  As we debate this bill in the Senate, I plan to work with Chairman \nSpecter and many others to make some additional refinements to the \nbill. It truly is a work in progress. But the bottom line is that we \nmust move forward and we must move forward now. The status quo is \nsimply not acceptable. It is not fair to the victims, and it is not \nfair to the companies.\n  We all know this bill is not perfect and, in fact, this issue is so \ncomplicated that no bill could ever be perfect. But the bill we have \nbefore us is far better than the current situation. We must move \nforward.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with a story that illustrates why \nwe need to vote for this legislation. A fellow Ohioan came to my office \nrecently and explained that he is very ill from asbestos exposure. He \nhas retained a lawyer and has a trial date scheduled. He was worried \nthat this bill would remove his ability to sue without giving him \nenough compensation to take care of his family and provide for their \nfuture and not give him the compensation he deserves.\n  After discussing the details of his case and explaining how the FAIR \nAct would apply to him, it was clear that the bill, if enacted, would \nlikely provide him with more money much more quickly than he likely \nwill get if he pursues his claim in court, although, of course, \nlitigation is notoriously difficult to predict. Even though this Ohioan \nstill has a difficult road to walk in dealing with his illness, he is \nnow reassured that this bill, if it becomes law, will provide his \nfamily with hope for the future and provide him with some just \ncompensation.\n  Nothing can ever be fair. Nothing can ever provide a victim with what \nwould be considered just, but I think he was assured and felt better \nafter my staff was able to discuss this bill with him, and the details \nof it.\n  As I have said, this bill is not perfect, but it will help the \nvictims of this asbestos crisis. It will help the real people most at \nrisk, and it will help save countless jobs. That is why I am supporting \nit. It simply is the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the asbestos bill \nand to indicate my support for the cloture motion which will be voted \non at 6 o'clock this afternoon.\n  For over 15 years now, believe it or not, the U.S. Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly urged Congress to create a solution to this asbestos crisis. \nIn 1997, in a case called Amchen Products v. Windsor, Justice Ginsburg \nwrote this:\n\n       The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.\n\n  This is exactly what we are trying to do in this effort. It is true \nit is not easy to do. It is true it has taken many years of hearings in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and it is true efforts to draft this \nlegislation have been ongoing for many years, but I would like to take \nthis opportunity to commend the chairman and ranking member of our \ncommittee, Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, for their tireless \nefforts to develop a true bipartisan compromise, and I know it hasn't \nbeen easy.\n  Before discussing the specifics of this legislation, I think it is \nimportant to remember what has brought us here and why so many of us \nhave spent hundreds of hours working through the complex issues in \ntrying to develop a\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\nno-fault administrative solution. As has been stated, the pivotal \nquestion before this body is, Will a victim be better off in a trust \nfund, or will they be better off in the tort system? I believe that \noverall a victim will be better off in this trust fund.\n  Up to this point, more than 70 American companies have filed for \nbankruptcy caused by asbestos liability. This has cost the American \neconomy up to 60,000 jobs. Each displaced worker from a bankrupt \ncompany will lose on average an estimated $25,000 to $50,000 in wages \nover his or her career because of periods of unemployment and the \nlikelihood of having to take a new job paying a lower salary.\n  This impact is not limited to workers who lose their jobs. For the \nworkers who are able to keep their jobs at these companies, they can \nexpect an average 25-percent reduction in the value of their pensions. \nAnd for every 10 jobs lost to an asbestos bankruptcy, a community will \nlose 8 additional jobs.\n  At least four companies headquartered in my home State of California \nhave been bankrupted from asbestos lawsuits. Additionally, 41 companies \nwith current or former operations in California have been sued or are \ncurrently facing lawsuits. They include: Allwood Door Company; Ashland; \nAtlas Corporation; Bechtel; Bethlehem Steel; California Portland Cement \nCompany; Celotex; Dow Chemical; Exxon Mobil; Federal Mogul; Flintkote; \nGencorp; Georgia Pacific; Goodrich Aerospace; Hill Brothers Chemical \nCompany; Honeywell; Jacuzzi Brands; JM A/C Pipe Corporation; Kaiser \nCement; Kelly Moore Paint; Metalclad Insulation; National Gypsum; \nNational Steel and Shipbuilding Company; Norton and Sons of California; \nOccidental Petroleum; Owens-Illinois California Container; Owens \nCorning Fiberglas; Pacific Gas and Electric; Pittsburgh Corning; Plant \nInsulation Company; Polyone; Raymark Industries; Reinhold Industries; \nRPM; The Scotts Company; Southern California Edison Company; Todd \nShipyards; Tyler Pipe Industries; Walter Industries; Unocal; U.S. \nGypsum; and Viacom.\n  One of those companies, Celotex, had three plants and two regional \nsales offices in California. In 1987, Celotex employed 325 people \nthere, with a payroll of $7 million. They were forced into bankruptcy \nand today they operate in the United Kingdom. This is one impact of \nwhat has been happening.\n  According to a study done by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, in \n1980, 300 companies were being sued for asbestos claims. This grew so \nmuch that by 2002, 8,400 companies had been named as defendants.\n  RAND also concluded that litigation has spread beyond the asbestos \nand building products industries to the point that companies now being \nsued cover 75 out of 83 different types of industries in the United \nStates. And, just through 2002, $70 billion had been paid out to \n730,000 personal injury claims.\n  So again, the question is whether a victim is better off in a no-\nfault trust where they automatically recover if they meet the criteria \nor in the tort system with high transaction costs that often eat up 50 \nto 60 percent of a judgment.\n  It is true that bankruptcies have tragic consequences, not just for \nthe businesses, but also for their employees who lose their jobs, lose \ntheir savings, and for the victims whose settlements are frequently \nreduced even more by bankruptcy trusts until they are receiving pennies \non the dollar.\n  I think the most startling and most egregious example of the asbestos \ntragedy is what occurred in Libby, MT. Candidly, this is what put it on \nmy radar screen big time. This small community has been devastated \nbecause of the callous and potentially criminal actions of one company, \nW.R. Grace.\n  The asbestos found in Libby, MT, tremolite asbestos, has demonstrated \nan unusually high level of toxicity, as compared with chrysotile \nasbestos. Diseases contracted from tremolite asbestos are unique and \nthey are highly progressive, which means they move quickly. So far 192 \nresidents from this small community have died and 1,400 are suffering \nfrom asbestos-related diseases.\n  In addition, W.R. Grace not only sent its workers into the earth to \nmine asbestos without proper protection, it also pumped asbestos out of \nits factory and into the community of Libby. W.R. Grace provided \nasbestos materials to high schools and parks. It even put out piles for \nchildren to play in. For decades, there was an unprecedented 24-hour-\nper-day contamination of this community.\n  Based on this and other actions, a Federal grand jury in February of \nlast year indicted W.R. Grace on multiple criminal counts. The \nindictment charges that W.R. Grace was aware of several studies that \ndemonstrated the dangers of asbestos exposure and concealed this \ninformation from the people of Libby and from the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The prosecutor is quoted in the press as saying W.R. \nGrace's treatment of workers and residents is ``a human and \nenvironmental tragedy.''\n  Sadly, while the situation in Libby is extraordinarily unique and our \nlegislation recognizes this, the harm caused by asbestos is far \nreaching.\n  In California, we have had shipments of asbestos from Libby in 35 \nlocations. Our shipyards became hotspots for asbestos-related diseases \nbecause the shipping industry used asbestos to insulate boilers, steam \npipes, hot water pipes, and incinerators. In fact, according to the \ndata compiled from the National Center for Health Statistics, between \n1979 and 2002, 4,618 Californians died because of asbestos-related \ndiseases.\n\n  Statistics do not adequately tell the full story of this tragedy. The \nday after Father's Day in 2003, Alan Reinstein of Redondo Beach, CA, \nfirst learned about the devastating effect asbestos can have. After \nmonths of ineffective and inaccurate testing to diagnose his health \nproblems that Mr. Reinstein was experiencing in his lungs, doctors \nfinally determined that he was suffering from mesothelioma. \nMesothelioma is a debilitating and aggressive form of cancer that has \nbeen directly linked to asbestos exposure.\n  After learning the correct diagnosis, Mr. Reinstein had to have major \nsurgery to remove his left lung, his diaphragm, and the lining around \nhis heart. The surgery to save his life was so extensive it nearly \nkilled him. He and his wife Linda today face his continued health \nproblems from mesothelioma. As a matter of fact, he is a very rare case \nand the only person I know of who has survived for more than 1 year \nwith mesothelioma.\n  Billy Speicher from Ontario, CA, spoke of his experience with \nmesothelioma before the Judiciary Committee around this time last year. \nHe discussed how he was exposed to asbestos while serving as an \naircraft mechanic for the Marine Corps in the late 1950s and again as a \npipefitter from 1965 to 1999. He stated that in his jobs:\n\n       Asbestos was everywhere. It was all over me and all over \n     everyone who worked near me . . . At first the doctors I was \n     seeing for two years kept telling me I had asthma--even \n     though I had CAT scans that showed my lungs were scarred. But \n     finally the fluid built up so much in my lungs they realized \n     I had mesothelioma.\n       Now I'm living with a lot of pain--and I can barely get my \n     breath. [I] can't hardly sleep at night either. You know that \n     mesothelioma is a death sentence.\n\n  These stories illustrate the personal tragedies asbestos has caused. \nUnfortunately, these two men are not alone. So the question is what to \ndo, and many people think: Just leave it up to the tort system. I \nlooked at that. But then you also hear cases of people who receive \npennies on their judgment, and the question arises, Is it not possible \nto protect victims and not bankrupt companies and have a no-fault \nsystem whereby medical people can make the judgments and people can be \npaid a fair sum? That is what this legislation is all about.\n  Compromises have been made. What I have tried to do, on the Judiciary \nCommittee, is ensure that there are strong provisions in place to \nprotect individuals who were struck with terminal asbestos-related \ndiseases.\n  There are some important provisions that I would like to highlight. \nThe bill we are now considering contains higher awards values for \nvictims than the version that was before the Senate in the 108th \nCongress. A broader definition of asbestos has been included to address \nthe potential threat of naturally occurring asbestos that has been \ndiscovered in California and other parts of the country.\n  During the startup period, the bill incorporates a process so \nmesothelioma victims and other terminally ill victims will have their \nclaims resolved\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nand paid within 9 months or else they will be allowed to take their \ncase to court. So either they get prompt payment or they can go to \ncourt. I have insisted on that. Thanks to Senator Specter and Senator \nLeahy, that is in the bill.\n  The committee also adopted an amendment that provides accelerated \npayments for terminally ill victims so they can get their awards \nquickly, once the fund becomes operational. The bill protects cases \nthat have a verdict, final judgment, or final order issued by a trial \ncourt and cases in trial or those that have an enforceable settlement \nso that victims who have had their claims resolved are not suddenly \nuprooted.\n  And this legislation prevents subrogation of awards, ensuring that \nvictims' awards cannot be reduced.\n  As everybody has said, this bill is not perfect. However, given the \ncurrent state, I think it is an important solution to help provide \nrelief to both victims and businesses. My understanding is that the \nchairman will have a managers' package that will further clarify and \nmake improvements to the bill as well. I urge my colleagues to look \ncarefully at that managers' package because many improvements have in \nfact been made.\n  During this huge undertaking, there have been many concerns raised \nand criticisms levied against the bill. At every step, Senators Specter \nand Leahy have attempted to address any flaws or ambiguities. This has \nnot been a ``take it or leave it'' piece of legislation. I know of no \nchairman or ranking member who have been more receptive to looking at \nchanges and evaluating them.\n  Several concerns have been expressed regarding how quickly money will \ncome into the fund and whether the trust fund will be able to process \nthe immediate flood of claims that are currently pending in court. The \nso-called upfront funding has been increased throughout the process, so \nnow the fund will have $42 billion in the first 5 years to pay claims. \nIn addition, the committee adopted an amendment to speed up the initial \ncontributions by insurers, defendant companies, and bankruptcy trusts \nso that the administrator can pay claims quickly.\n  The bill also provides the administrator of the trust fund with \nborrowing authority, so if the upfront funding of $42 billion proves to \nbe inadequate, he or she may borrow funds to cover any shortfall.\n  Next, the bill includes a streamlined process to settle claims of \nterminally ill individuals immediately upon enactment of the \nlegislation. This provision ensures that terminally ill \nindividuals will have their claims processed quickly, and it should \nresolve some of the most pressing claims before the trust is up and \nrunning so there would not be an overwhelming flood of claims filed \nwith the trust on day one.\n\n  Finally, Senator Specter included language in the statute of \nlimitations to give individuals sufficient time to file their claims--5 \nyears--so there will not be a need to rush to the fund for fear of \nbeing cut off.\n  Another concern that has been expressed, and I want to address it, is \nthat the legislation will harm small businesses by requiring payments \nto the fund that are well beyond the means of these small businesses. \nUnder this bill, small businesses, as defined under section 3 of the \nSmall Business Act, are explicitly exempt from having to contribute to \nthe fund.\n  Let me repeat that. Under this bill, small businesses, as defined \nunder section 3 of the Small Business Act, are explicitly exempt from \nhaving to contribute to the fund. At the same time, these companies \nwill receive the protections provided under the legislation. They don't \nhave to contribute, and they will receive the protections provided \nunder the legislation--meaning they cannot be sued.\n  For example, manufacturing companies that have fewer than 500 \nemployees will qualify as a small business. Some categories of \nmanufacturing, including chemical manufacturing, will qualify if they \nhave fewer than 750 employees.\n  It is also important to remember that companies are only required to \npay if they have already expended money on asbestos claims. They only \npay if they have already expended money on asbestos claims. Smaller \ncompanies that had not incurred asbestos liability-related costs of $1 \nmillion or more before December 31, 2002, are exempt from having to \ncontribute to the fund.\n  In addition, for those companies which are not exempt from having to \ncontribute to the fund, the bill tiers companies by size and amount of \nliability. The current tort system provides no protections for small \nbusinesses and allows any company of any size, no matter how small, to \nbe sued into bankruptcy.\n  Another argument made against the bill is that there is inadequate \nfunding to cover all future asbestos claims. Trying to project how many \nindividuals will make claims is clearly an inexact science--if you can \neach call it a ``science.'' Even the Manville Trust, an almost 20-year-\nold trust that was created after the bankruptcy filing of the Johns-\nManville Corporation, has had to alter its projections time and time \nagain. Since we do not know how many people have been exposed to \nasbestos and, of those, who will develop a disease, we must rely on \nprotections based on sound calculations and real-world experiences of \nother trust funds. The size of the fund is based on the strongest \nstatistical data and economic models available. A leading actuary with \nTillinghast-Towers Perrin testified before the committee on June 4, \n2003, that ``$108 billion appears to be more than adequate,'' while \nRAND Corporation estimates the remaining future cost of asbestos-\nrelated loss and expense at $130 billion.\n  By using a no-fault administrative system, the fund will \nsignificantly reduce the substantial transaction costs of the current \ntort system, costs that most experts agree consume more than half of \nthe total amount being expended. Of the $130 billion of future \nasbestos-related costs, it is estimated--and listen to this carefully--\nit is estimated that approximately $28 billion, or 21.5 percent, is \nattributable to defendant costs and approximately $41 billion, or 40 \npercent, will go to plaintiffs' attorneys. So there you have 61.5 \npercent going to lawyers.\n  I understand how lawyers feel, but 61.5 percent of the total amount \ngoing to lawyers means that amount of money is not going to victims. \nBecause of these transaction costs, if we continue in the current \nsystem, less than 40 percent of the $130 billion estimate of future \nasbestos-related loss and expense--less than 40 percent will be paid to \nasbestos victims.\n  This legislation provides for $140 billion to come into the fund over \n30 years without the transaction costs of the legal system, allowing \nfor more money to go to victims. The bill, as amended, obligates \ndefendant and insurer participants to contribute $136 billion to the \nfund, and at least $4 billion more would be contributed from confirmed \nbankruptcy and other asbestos compensation trust funds.\n  As an added protection against the risk of insufficient funding, the \nlegislation gives the administrator of the fund the authority to borrow \nfrom commercial and government lending institutions.\n  Finally, if the projections are wrong and the amount of money \navailable proves to be insufficient in the long run, victims will be \nallowed to return to the courts.\n  With this safety net, carefully thought out and eagerly debated, this \nlegislation ensures that no one is left without an avenue for recourse.\n  Another argument opponents of the bill make is that victims will be \nforced to wait years before they receive compensation.\n  While California has a system to provide expedited trials when a \nvictim is terminally ill, victims in most States across the country are \nforced to wait years before they can have their cases brought before a \njudge or a jury. And often, even after the case is heard and decided, \nor a settlement is reached, payments can still be stretched out for \nseveral months or even years.\n  Due to the long delays in other States, I have fought throughout this \nprocess to ensure that the fund follows California's example and \nresolves claims of terminal individuals as quickly as possible.\n  An amendment was adopted in committee that ensures once the trust \nfund becomes operational, individuals who have mesothelioma are paid in \none lump sum within 30 days after their claims are approved, or within \n6 months after their claims are filed, whichever is shorter.\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\n  Let me repeat that because that is important.\n  Mesothelioma victims are paid in one lump sum within 30 days after \ntheir claims are approved, or within 6 months after their claims are \nfiled, whichever is shorter. What we are trying to do is prevent the \ndelay in payment to someone who is terminally ill.\n  Other terminally ill claimants, individuals who have been diagnosed \nwith less than a year to live, must be paid within 6 months after their \nclaims are approved, or 1 year after their claims are filed, whichever \nis shorter.\n  During the committee consideration of the bill, we also adopted an \namendment to speed up payments to terminally ill individuals while the \nadministrator is attempting to get the fund up and running. This \namendment provides for a process whereby terminally ill victims can \nreceive a settlement directly from the administrator or claims facility \neven before the fund is operational. So the first people to be served \nbefore the fund is operational are terminally ill victims.\n  If, for whatever reason, the administrator or claims facility is \nunable to process or pay these claims during the startup period, the \ncompanies or the insurers will be required to make a settlement offer \ndirectly to the individual.\n  We cover that possibility as well.\n  If the offer is rejected because it is less than the individual would \nhave received under the fund--in other words, the company makes an \noffer but it is a low offer--the companies have 20 days to make a new \noffer or else they are penalized.\n  Under these settlement agreements, claims are to be paid to \nmesothelioma victims, with 50 percent of the claim to be paid within 30 \ndays after the settlement is accepted, and the other 50 percent within \n6 months after the settlement is accepted.\n  Other terminal victims are to be paid 50 percent of the claim to be \npaid within 6 months after settlement is accepted, and 50 percent \nwithin 1 year after settlement is accepted.\n  If after 9 months, as I said, the terminally ill individual has still \nnot had their claim processed or fully paid, then they may return to \nthe court.\n  This has been hard fought for, and this is the fail-safe in this \nlegislation. I think it is fair to say that the companies would like to \navoid this. I don't know if Senator Specter would agree with that, but \nI found that to be true. And, therefore, this ability to go back into \ncourt if you are terminally ill and you are not paid right away is an \nadded protection that you will get paid.\n  Finally, I want to address the argument that this bill creates a new \nentitlement program and will cost the people millions of dollars. This \nis simply untrue.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, entitlement programs \nare a form of mandatory spending, which ``require the payment of \nbenefits to persons . . . if specific criteria established in the \nauthorizing law are met,'' and they are not subject to discretionary \nappropriations from Congress. Entitlement payments are legal \nobligations of the Federal Government, and beneficiaries can sue to \ncompel full payment.\n  That is not the case here. The fund created by this legislation will \nbe privately funded. The money collected for the fund comes from \nbusinesses and insurance companies--not from the U.S. Treasury.\n  Although the program will be housed in the Department of Labor, the \nbill ensures that all expenses, including administrative expenses, are \npaid by the moneys collected from businesses and insurers.\n  In addition, as an extra protection, it is expressly stated several \ntimes throughout the bill that nothing in the act shall be construed to \ncreate any obligation of funding from the United States or to require \nthe United States to satisfy any claims if the amounts in the fund are \ninadequate. If anyone doubts that, they can look up section 406(b) of \nthe bill.\n  Some have argued that the Government's liability is derived from the \nprovision that allows borrowing from the Federal financing bank.\n  In response to an inquiry from former Senator Don Nickles on a \nprevious version of this bill, the GAO stated that ``[t]o ensure that \nthe government incurs no liability for repayment of borrowing under the \nact, Congress may wish to explicitly state that repayment of borrowing \nis limited solely to amounts available in the fund.''\n\n  That is what Senator Specter did.\n  The bill expressly provides that ``[r]epayment of moneys borrowed by \nthe administrator . . . is limited solely to amounts available in the \n[Fund].''\n  It also states that ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \ncreate any obligation of funding from the United States Government, \nincluding any borrowing authorized . . . ''\n  With these explicit statements throughout the bill, it is abundantly \nclear that this legislation would not be a burden on the U.S. Treasury.\n  In conclusion, from the beginning it has been clear that creating a \nnational asbestos trust fund is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. \nThis has been a compromise effort and there are numerous issues where \ncompeting interest groups have come together, such as the creation of a \nno-fault administrative system, the equitable allocation of \ncontributions, the establishment of reasonable medical standards, the \nresolution of pending claims and settlements, fair compensation values, \nand transparency of the system to both victim and corporate \nstakeholders alike. That is very important.\n  However, I must say it often seemed that with every solution and \ncompromise, more concerns and problems would arise. In the end, there \nare some provisions I think all sides would like to change, but \ncompared to the shortfalls in the current system, this is a strong \nsolution and a good compromise.\n  I hope Members will vote to close off debate and that we will be able \nto pass this important piece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for the comments which she has made. They are thoughtful, \nthey are profound, they go to the heart of the question, and they \nillustrate the need for legislation. I thank her even more for the \ngreat contribution she has made to the bill as it has moved through the \ncommittee process. She has devised some of the key sections of the \nbill, starting with the handling of exigent claims to see to it that \npeople with mesothelioma and other deadly diseases are handled at a \nvery early stage in the proceeding.\n  We have worked together countless hours in her office, in my office, \nwith many other Senators in the committee process, and she has done a \ngreat job in committee generally on many items, including the one \nidentifying victims whose identities are stolen, legislation we are \ntrying to bring to the floor now. But I think the speech she just made \nwas a fine hour, perhaps her finest hour, in identifying their very \nserious problems.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the crux of what Senator Feinstein has \nhad to say is proof positive that we ought to proceed. There is no \ndoubting the problem. The only issue is whether we ought to take up the \nbill and work on it. Anybody who votes against taking up this bill will \nbe casting, in my opinion--it is a tough word, a tough term--an \nunconscionable vote, considering how many thousands of people have \nsuffered from deadly diseases and how many companies have gone \nbankrupt--at least to proceed to take it up. I haven't seen any Senator \nwho has addressed the issue on the floor who hasn't at least faced up \nto the fact that we have a problem that ought to be addressed. \nOccasionally, we do consider the merits of a pending motion. The merit \nof a motion to proceed is whether there is a problem which ought to be \ntaken up. If somebody has a better bill, let them come to it.\n  I am going to speak very briefly because our distinguished colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, is on the floor. He, too, has been a \nmajor contributor.\n  First, I wish to thank Senator Carper for his speech in support of \nthe motion to proceed earlier. I think there is Democratic support. \nSenator Leahy, of course, is a cosponsor, Senator Kohl is a cosponsor, \nSenator Feinstein has spoken, Senator Carper has spoken, and others \nhave stated their intention to move to take up and consider the\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nbill. Senator Hatch's comments were very important. He is the author of \nthe trust fund concept, and chaired the Judiciary Committee before term \nlimits called for a shift in chairmanship. He did a great job. Senator \nDeWine has spoken in a very important way.\n  I want to put into the Record a couple of newspaper articles which I \nthink are very germane.\n  Senator Reid and I had a conversation about the bill yesterday, with \nSenator Reid making the accusation that lobbyists paved the way for \nthis bill to come to the floor. On the floor, in his presence, I \nchallenged him as violating rule XIX which bars a Senator from making \nderogatory comments about another Senator.\n  This morning, in the Hill publication there was the disclosure of a \nfascinating document which the Hill obtained from a coalition opposing \nthe bill. This document, which is published at some length in the Hill, \npoints out that nearly 20 corporations paid a total of about $3 million \nto defeat the asbestos legislation.\n  The document obtained says this bill's ``defeat could bring an end to \nthe trust fund as a viable political option for addressing the asbestos \nlitigation crisis. Therefore, coalition activities leading up to that \nvote should be commensurate with the opportunity presented to us to \ndefeat the trust fund once and for all.''\n  This coalition document then specifies how they are laying out $2.78 \nmillion for defeating the bill, allocating $1.34 million for coalition \noperations and $1.44 million for advertising.\n  Then there is a specification as to the companies that are trying to \ndefeat the bill, such as American International Group, Allstate, \nAmerican Re, a reinsurance provider, the Chubb Corporation, Hartford \nInsurance, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide Insurance, and Zurich Financial. \nEach has received bills, according to this document, for $134,250. \nExxonMobil paid $73,000 to the coalition.\n  I shall not read any further, but I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I also think it is relevant to note an \neditorial in the New York Times today which is solidly in support of \nthis bill. The Times editorial refers to the efforts of Senator Leahy, \nthe distinguished ranking member and principal cosponsor with me, and \nsays:\n\n       That makes it a 21st century rarity; a thoughtful, \n     bipartisan compromise on a vexing national problem. It would \n     create a trust fund to pay awards to those who are already \n     sick, using detailed medical criteria to determine \n     eligibility and awards. Under this no-fault system, akin to \n     workers' compensation, those exposed to asbestos at work but \n     not ill would be entitled to free medical screening every \n     three years.\n\n  And the Times editorial goes on to point out:\n\n       Lobbyists for the trial lawyers, at various companies, \n     insurers and union interests that feel aggrieved by some \n     aspect of the complex package are trying to round up \n     lawmakers to block the bill. A key test is to come today, \n     when the majority leader, Bill Frist, has scheduled a vote to \n     allow the Senate to begin formal consideration of the bill. \n     Mr. Reid is trying to derail the measure even before the \n     debate begins in earnest, and Democrats who want to see \n     asbestos victims treated fairly should not support him.\n       There are other dangers ahead, including the possibility of \n     a ``poison pill'' amendment that would expand to other \n     communities a special provision that would make residents of \n     Libby, Mont., a town uniquely affected by asbestos \n     contamination, eligible for a guaranteed level of \n     compensation without a need to show occupational exposure. \n     Another worry is that some Republicans will try to amend \n     provisions or medical criteria in ways that would be unfair \n     to victims.\n\n  The New York Times editorial concludes, saying:\n\n       No one can be sure that $140 billion will cover all current \n     and future claims. But the bill would give victims the option \n     of going to court should the trust fund run out. It would be \n     a vast improvement over the present method of dealing with \n     the claims of asbestos victims, which is to clog the courts \n     and bankrupt companies while depriving many victims a measure \n     of justice.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this editorial be \nprinted at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in order to make other documents \navailable, I ask unanimous consent that a series of letters be printed \nin the Record. I think it important that these be available in the \nRecord for Senators and their staffs and for the public to see the kind \nof support this bill has.\n  Yesterday, Senator Reid and I had a few words about a number of \ngroups who are for the bill and who are against the bill. This letter \nis from many veterans groups urging Senator Reid not to filibuster the \nbill. They say:\n\n       We urge you not to stand in the way of full Senate \n     consideration of this vital legislation.\n\n  And the number of veterans groups is enormously impressive, including \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, The \nRetired Enlisted Association, the Blinded American Veterans Foundation, \nthe Jewish War Veterans of the USA, and quite a number of veterans \norganizations which will appear in the Record.\n  I also have printed letters of support from the NFIB and a letter \nsigned by manufacturers, labor groups, small business, and 25 \nadditional veterans groups.\n  I ask that these documents be printed in the Record so colleagues can \nsee the kind of support this bill has. By doing this, they get into the \nCongressional Record, and the people note the support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. My distinguished colleague from Alabama has been \nwaiting. In advance, I thank Senator Sessions for his outstanding work \non this committee generally but especially on this bill.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                     [From the Hill, Feb. 7, 2006]\n\n                        Aiming at Asbestos Bill\n\n                         (By Alexander Bolton)\n\n       Nearly 20 corporations have paid a total of about $3 \n     million to defeat the asbestos trust-fund bill, which Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has designated his first \n     priority in 2006, according to a coalition planning document \n     obtained by The Hill.\n       The Senate will consider the bill, which establishes a $140 \n     billion trust fund to compensate the victims of asbestos \n     exposure, over the next two weeks, leading up to the \n     Presidents Day recess. Strategists leading the opposition \n     view the debate as an opportunity to defeat the creation of \n     such a trust fund permanently.\n       ``Majority Leader Frist's agreement with Chairman [Arlen] \n     Specter [R-Pa.] to put S. 852 on the Senate floor for a vote, \n     in the face of opposition from the Judiciary Committee \n     conservatives and Budget Committee leadership, has increased \n     the stakes of that vote beyond its important role in the \n     legislative process,'' Kieran Mahoney, a strategist with \n     Mercury Public Affairs, wrote in a private memo to the \n     Coalition for Asbestos Reform. The firm Fleishman-Hillard is \n     also coordinating the lobbying effort.\n       ``This has become a do-or-die opposition for the advocates \n     of the Trust Fund, and its defeat could bring an end to the \n     Trust Fund as a viable political option for addressing the \n     asbestos litigation crisis,'' Mahoney wrote. ``Therefore \n     coalition activities leading up to that vote should be \n     commensurate with the opportunity presented to us--to defeat \n     the Trust Fund once and for all.''\n       The memo was contained in a 22-page internal planning \n     document detailing the Coalition for Asbestos Reform's \n     strategy. The bill is sponsored by Specter and cosponsored by \n     Sen. Pat Leahy (Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee. The document, crafted at the end of last year, is \n     available on The Hill's website, http://img.thehill.com/img/\nnews/020706/asbestos.pdf \n       It lays out a $2.78 million budget for defeating the bill, \n     allocating $1.34 million for coalition operations and $1.44 \n     million for advertising.\n       Fleishman-Hillard and Mercury Public Affairs are charging \n     $510,000 in fees and $80,000 in expenses for their work over \n     the first four months of the year, according to the document.\n       In his memo, Mahoney writes that the advertising campaign \n     will be built around \"creating political will inside three \n     audiences--moderate/conservative Democrat Senators who are \n     deemed persuadable, conservative Democrat Senators who are \n     deemed persuadable, conservative Republican senators whose \n     current opposition needs to be turned into a ``no'' vote, and \n     DC opinion leaders who collectively make up \n     conventional wisdom.\n       Opinion leaders are being targeted by advertising through \n     national cable networks, D.C. broadcast stations and Capitol \n     Hill print outlets.\n       Senators are being targeted through TV and print ads in \n     select markets in key states.\n       The business groups are leaving the persuasion of liberal-\n     leaning senators to trial lawyers and unions.\n       ``Separately, the Coalition needs to ensure that the trial \n     bar and related advocacy\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\n     groups are preparing a similar strategy that targets liberal \n     Democratic Senators,'' the Mercury Public Affairs memorandum \n     stated.\n       The campaign appears to have gained traction, as Senate \n     Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) has vowed to filibuster it \n     and conservative Republicans on the Judiciary Committee such \n     as Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) have \n     voiced concerns over the bill.\n       It passed out of the Judiciary Committee with the support \n     of all Republican members and Sens. Leahy, Dianne Feinstein \n     (D-Calif.) and Herb Kohl (D-Wis.).\n       Manufacturing and insurance companies have long sought a \n     trust fund to pay asbestos-related medical claims and to \n     avoid costly lawsuits. Partisan wrangling over the best way \n     to pay asbestos-related claims and to settle a blizzard of \n     ongoing and potential lawsuits that has dragged on for years.\n       The bipartisan proposal has garnered opposition from groups \n     of labor unions, trial attorneys, midsize manufacturing \n     companies and insurance companies. Unions have pushed for \n     more money in the trust fund and trial attorneys oppose the \n     concept because it curbs litigation. Midsize companies have \n     balked at how much they must pay into the fund, and insurance \n     companies are worried about their liability if it runs out of \n     money.\n       But a significant portion of the business community \n     supports Specter and Leahy's efforts.\n       ``There are numerous supporters of the trust fund,'' said \n     Matt Webb, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's \n     Institute for Legal Reform, which has not taken a position on \n     the bill.\n       ``It's impossible to say how many are in each camp, it \n     depends on each individual company's financial situation and \n     legal situation.''\n       The coalition's document includes a list of member \n     companies and how much they've been asked to contribute to \n     the opposition effort.\n       Donors such as American International Group; Allstate; \n     American Re, a reinsurance provider; Chubb Corp.; Hartford \n     Insurance; Liberty Mutual; Nationwide Insurance; and Zurich \n     Financial have each received bills for $134,250 to pay for \n     operating and advertising costs, according to the document.\n       Oglebay Norton, an industrial-minerals company, and Okonite \n     Co., an electrical-wire manufacturer, have received bills for \n     $55,000. Bills for varying amounts have been sent to other \n     member companies.\n       Exxon Mobil paid $73,000 to the coalition but is not a \n     member, said Thomas O'Brien, chairman of the coalition, who \n     will receive $100,000 for his work over January, February, \n     March and April, according to the document\n       O'Brien declined in a phone interview to discuss what other \n     companies have joined the coalition or if the billing records \n     accurately represent the contributions of coalition members \n     to date.\n       ``Things change every day,'' he said during the interview \n     in which Bill Fay of Fleishman-Hillard also participated. \n     ``That was a planning document. As Bill said, that document \n     was not for public dissemination, I wouldn't comment on it.''\n       O'Brien and Fay said that the time for Congress to act was \n     several years ago but that states such as Texas have now \n     taken steps to deal with the slew of medical claims. They \n     said that the Senate bill would wreck those efforts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2006]\n\n                      Justice for Asbestos Victims\n\n       Just last week, the Democrats' Senate leader, Harry Reid of \n     Nevada, failed to muster the gumption to try to stop the \n     nomination of a right-wing ideologue to a lifetime seat on \n     the Supreme Court. So it's shocking to hear Mr. Reid \n     threatening now to block a bipartisan bill that would finally \n     bring justice and compensation to victims of asbestos-related \n     diseases. We can't imagine what Mr. Reid is trying to \n     achieve, other than showing fealty to the trial lawyers who \n     have been so generous to his party.\n       The Senate should approve the bill, which would replace the \n     current morass of asbestos litigation with a $140 billion \n     fund to pay the claims of victims of asbestos exposure. The \n     fund would be financed by makers of asbestos, a carcinogenic \n     material, and manufacturers that used it, and their insurers.\n       It is the product of an assiduous effort by Senator Arlen \n     Specter, the Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, and Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee's senior \n     Democrat. That makes it a 21st-century rarity: a thoughtful \n     bipartisan compromise on a vexing national problem. It would \n     create a fund to pay awards to those who are already sick, \n     using detailed medical criteria to determine eligibility and \n     the awards. Under this no-fault system, akin to workers' \n     compensation, those exposed to asbestos at work but not ill \n     would be entitled to free medical screening every three \n     years.\n       Lobbyists for trial lawyers, and various companies, \n     insurers and union interests that feel aggrieved by some \n     aspect of the complex package, are trying to round up \n     lawmakers to block the bill. A key test is to come today, \n     when the majority leader, Bill Frist, has scheduled a vote to \n     allow the Senate to begin formal consideration of the bill. \n     Mr. Reid is trying to derail the measure even before the \n     debate begins in earnest, and Democrats who want to see \n     asbestos victims treated fairly should not support him.\n       There are other dangers ahead, including the possibility of \n     a ``poison pill'' amendment that would expand to other \n     communities a special provision that would make residents of \n     Libby, Mont., a town uniquely affected by asbestos \n     contamination, eligible for a guaranteed level of \n     compensation without a need to show occupational exposure. \n     Another worry is that some Republicans will try to amend the \n     payment provisions or medical criteria in ways that would be \n     unfair to victims.\n       No one can be sure that $140 billion would cover all \n     current and future claims. But the bill would give victims \n     the option of going to court should the trust fund run out. \n     It would be a vast improvement over the present method of \n     dealing with the claims of asbestos victims, which is to clog \n     the courts and bankrupt companies while still depriving many \n     victims a measure of justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                                 January 31, 2006.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Veterans across the country who are \n     afflicted with asbestos-related diseases would at last get \n     compensation and relief under the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution (FAIR) Act. But according to a number recent media \n     reports, you have labeled the FAIR Act as a bill that caters \n     to special interests and have informed Majority Leader Frist \n     in writing that you will oppose this critical legislation. In \n     all frankness, your words and actions are extremely \n     disappointing to veterans across this nation--surely you do \n     not consider sick veterans to be a ``special interest''?\n       The FAIR Act will provide proper compensation to sick men \n     and women who volunteered to fight for our country--\n     compensation they simply can't get under the current system. \n     The military used asbestos throughout its facilities, bases, \n     and ships during and after World War II, and countless \n     veterans were exposed to this deadly material. But because \n     the U.S. government has asserted sovereign immunity, these \n     sick veterans are unable to seek compensation from the \n     government through the courts.\n       The FAIR Act's victims' trust fund would open a door for \n     veterans that has been closed for years.\n       We are disappointed that you are trying to keep that door \n     closed and stop veterans from receiving the compensation they \n     deserve. Sick veterans--and indeed, all victims--deserve \n     better than political gamesmanship on this critical issue. We \n     urge you not to stand in the way of full Senate consideration \n     of this vital legislation.\n       The FAIR Act is more than overdue. The Senate has been \n     debating these reforms for years. Sick victims, including \n     sick veterans, shouldn't be forced to wait for help any \n     longer.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Force Sergeant Association.\n       American Ex-Prisoners of War.\n       Blinded American Veterans Foundation.\n       Blinded Veterans Association.\n       Fleet Reserve Association.\n       Jewish War Veterans of the USA.\n       Marine Corps League.\n       Military Officers Association of America.\n       Military Order of the Purple Heart.\n       National Association of Black Veterans.\n       Non Commissioned Officers Association.\n       National Association of Uniformed Services.\n       National Association of State Directors of Veterans \n     Affairs.\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n       Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n       The Retired Enlisted Association.\n       Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc.\n       Veterans of Foreign Wars of the US.\n       Women in Military Service for America.\n       Memorial Foundation, Inc.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans, Inc.\n       U.S. Submarine Veteran, Inc., Lockwood Internet Base.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans of World War II.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans Base Rhode Island.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Thames River Chapter.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Central Connecticut \n     Chapter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business, I am writing \n     to express our support for S. 852, ``The Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005.'' The FAIR Act will \n     help protect innocent small business owners from the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that now threatens their business.\n       Asbestos lawsuits against small businesses are on the rise. \n     After years of suing large corporations for multi-million \n     dollar damage awards, ``traditional'' asbestos manufacturers \n     and defendants are mostly bankrupt. As a result, asbestos \n     litigation now targets companies far removed from any \n     potential wrongdoing, including small businesses. This \n     relatively untapped pool of defendants is an attractive \n     target for trial lawyers since small-business owners and \n     their insurers can be forced to pay millions of dollars in \n     damages. Horrifying for a small-business owner is the \n     prospect that they can be hauled into\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n     court without having any relationship to asbestos or the \n     plaintiff. Many small businesses are forced to settle because \n     they don't have the money or time to be away from their \n     businesses. Not only do they face the stigma of having to \n     settle, and the loss of time and money, but they will likely \n     also experience higher insurance rates.\n       By creating an alternative compensation system to resolve \n     asbestos claims, S. 852 will fix a badly broken system that \n     is not working and, in the process, compensate victims \n     faster. In addition to lawsuit relief, the legislation \n     relieves small businesses with either low or no asbestos \n     liability from having to pay into the compensation fund. No \n     business that meets the Small Business Administration \n     description of a small business can be required to pay a \n     penny into the fund. Nor will any small business that has \n     carried less than $1 million in asbestos expenditures before \n     December 31, 2002 have to pay into the fund.\n       This legislation will help prevent small businesses from \n     having to spend the time and money to defend themselves in \n     asbestos lawsuits. It takes a significant step towards fixing \n     part of our litigation crisis that hurts business, big and \n     small, and ultimately keeps the victim from receiving \n     compensation.\n       Thank you for your support of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Public Policy and Political.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 26, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid: We, \n     the undersigned, urge you to bring the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005 (the FAIR Act--S. 852) to the \n     floor of the United States Senate for debate and \n     consideration. Although we all come from a variety of \n     perspectives, we agree it is time for Congress to enact \n     meaningful asbestos reform through establishment of a well-\n     constructed federal trust fund.\n       Our country faces an asbestos litigation crisis with claims \n     rising exponentially and the backlog of cases ever \n     increasing. To date, 74 companies have gone bankrupt due to \n     asbestos litigation with 60,000 jobs lost and the cost to the \n     U.S. economy estimated at $343 billion. The continuing costs \n     and uncertainties of the current situation are harmful not \n     only to the asbestos victims with legitimate claims, but also \n     to employees, retirees, shareholders, customers of defendant \n     companies and insurers and to U.S. consumers.\n       The FAIR Act will go a long way toward solving many of the \n     injustices of the current system. First, and most \n     importantly, a well-constructed trust fund will provide sick \n     victims of asbestos exposure with the fast, certain, and fair \n     compensation they deserve. Such a trust fund will provide \n     compensation to many sick veterans who are barred from \n     seeking compensation through the courts. Additionally, the \n     legislation includes significant protections for small \n     businesses.\n       Indeed, our nation's governors working through the National \n     Governors Association called for federal legislative action \n     on the asbestos crisis in a resolution adopted at their \n     annual meeting in July, 2005. S. 852 is a bipartisan \n     compromise approved overwhelmingly by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee by a 13 to 5 vote. We believe that the time is now \n     for the Senate's consideration of this important legislation \n     that will lead to the meaningful reform our country needs and \n     deserves.\n       Please move forward on S. 852. It is a solution to the \n     asbestos litigation crisis that will ensure fair and timely \n     compensation for victims and certainty and finality for \n     businesses, workers, and the US. economy. All Americans stand \n     to benefit from the resolution of the asbestos crisis.\n           Sincerely,\n       A Parts Center.\n       Air Force Sergeant Association.\n       Alabama Voters Against Lawsuit Abuse.\n       Albina Fuel.\n       Alma Chamber, NE.\n       American Architectural Manufacturers Association.\n       American Boiler Manufacturers Association.\n       American Ex-Prisoners of War.\n       American Small Business Association.\n       AMVETS, Albuquerque, NM, Post 7.\n       AMVETS, Post 15, Los Ojos, NM.\n       The Asbestos Alliance.\n       Asbestos Study Group.\n       AMT--The Association for Manufacturing Technology.\n       Arizona Association of Industries.\n       Associated Industries of Florida.\n       Associated Industries of Kentucky.\n       Associated Industries of Massachusetts.\n       Associated Industries of Missouri.\n       Associated Oregon Industries.\n       Association of Builders and Contractors, NM Chapter.\n       Association of Builders and Contractors, LA.\n       Association of Washington Business.\n       Austin Gene Rater.\n       Automotive Parts and Service Association, TX.\n       Banner Healthcare.\n       Beatrice Chamber.\n       Blinded American Veterans Foundation.\n       Blinded Veterans Association.\n       Brave Services.\n       W.T.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the leadership of \nthe chairman. We have been working on this idea for quite a few years. \nI believe more strongly than ever that it is time to fix this broken \nsystem. I will talk about that more.\n  If the chairman does not mind, our colleague, Senator Ben Nelson from \nNebraska, wanted 2 minutes.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent I be recognized after \nSenator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the asbestos litigation in America today \nis out of control. We have been working on fixing it for years. In a \nprevious life, I represented two plaintiffs, people who were injured \nfrom asbestos, seriously injured, and adversely affected in their \nhealth. I was embarrassed by how long it took, and by how many fees and \ncosts came out of those cases. I have been embarrassed over the years \nto see this spasm in our legal system continue daily, not dispensing \njustice in a fair and legitimate way.\n  We know from a Rand study and from our own experience that 58 percent \nof the money paid out by these defendants does not go to the people who \nare sick; it goes to lawyers. Somebody made an interesting point--I \nbelieve it was Senator Durbin--that actually a slightly higher \npercentage of money goes to defense lawyers than to the plaintiffs' \nlawyers. Regardless which side receives the money, over half of it is \ngoing to lawyers.\n  If you are sued for $50 million and your corporation hires the best \nlegal team possible and spends all this money, and there are court \ncosts and depositions and fees for experts, it eats you up. When the \njudgments come out, often after years of work, very little money goes \nto the victim. It is not right. It is the worst performance by the \nlegal system, in my view--other than discrimination based on race in \nour past--since the founding of the Republic. This cannot be justified, \nalthough it is happening this very day in courts all over America.\n  Over 700,000 individuals have filed asbestos claims, and as many as \n300,000 of those claims are pending today. The number of asbestos \ndefendants started out at 300. These defendants were the people who \nmade the asbestos, who shipped it out, who at some point became aware \nthat asbestos was damaging to their health--they put no warnings on \nit--and just sent it out. Those people were the original asbestos \ndefendants. The original plaintiffs were directly harmed by their \nactions. For example, my client was in a submarine, sawing asbestos \nwith an electric saw in that confined space, breathing untold amounts \nof asbestos. By his early fifties, he was on oxygen. That is reality. \nThat happened.\n  Today, we have people who worked in a repair shop who claim somehow \nthe brakes had asbestos in them and are now responsible for a disease \nthey may have. And it may not be true. The damage is much less in many \nof these instances than it was for my client and others like him. Yet \nunder the current system, these shaky claims get compensated. We need \nto sift through this mess and create a system that will work.\n  Mr. President, $70 billion has been spent today to resolve asbestos-\nrelated claims. Of course, less than half of that $70 billion got to \nthe victims. Companies are settling claims filed by people who are not \nsick because they cannot afford to litigate. It is just that simple. \nPeople who are not sick now are getting money as almost a nuisance or \nextortion payment because the lawyers are filing so many of these \ncases. It has been driving companies into bankruptcy at an alarming \nrate.\n  There were 19 asbestos bankruptcies filed in the 1980s. Seventeen \nwere filed in the 1990s. Between 2000 and mid-2004, there were an \nastonishing 36 asbestos-related bankruptcy filings, amounting to more \nfilings in the first half of this decade than in the prior two decades \ncombined.\n  We hear a lot of people saying: I would rather sue and go through the \ncourt system than have this national fund. But there may not be a \ndefendant to sue at this rate because 77 companies have gone bankrupt. \nWith those bankruptcies, American workers have lost 60,000 jobs, \ncosting up to $200 million in lost wages.\n  The money, as I indicated, is not getting to the victims. Some \nbeneficiaries of the Manville asbestos trust fund received as little as \n5 cents on the dollar for their claims. If there is a $1 million \nverdict and you get 5 cents on the dollar, how fair is that?\n  In my hometown of Mobile, AL, the Mobile Register, which has done a \nconsiderable, superb investigative effort into some of the abuses in \nthis system which are prominent along the gulf coast because we have a \nlot of asbestos exposure in the shipyard industry, said:\n\n       The biggest beneficiaries of the asbestos-related lawsuits \n     tend not to be people with health problems, but the lawyers \n     and the for-profit lung testing companies they hire.\n\n  There has been a tremendous scandal over that. One courageous Federal \njudge has blown the whistle on it and perhaps broken that system up. \nBut it is just one more example of the many abuses in the current \nsystem.\n  Now, the U.S. Supreme Court has seen this matter from the perspective \nof the legal system. They are looking down at the 300,000 claims that \nare pending all over America. They are seeing that things are not going \nas they should. So in 1991, the Judicial Conference Committee--this is \nthe judges' committee that represents all the Federal judges in \nAmerica, appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States--said the \nasbestos situation had ``reached critical dimensions.'' Then they went \non to say that the courts were ``ill-equipped'' to address these mass \nclaims in any effective manner. This statement was significant because \nthe Judicial Conference Committee does not write us very often about \nthings like this.\n  In AmChem Products v. Windsor, in 1997, Justice Ginsburg, writing for \nthe Supreme Court--I will note parenthetically that Justice Ginsburg, \nwho was an ACLU lawyer, one of the more activist members of the Court, \nand certainly not a shill for the business industry--said this:\n\n       The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure. Congress, however, has not \n     adopted such a solution.\n\n  The Supreme Court has in essence issued what is a challenge, a plea \nto us, really.\n  In Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., Justice Souter, on the Supreme Court, \nsaid this:\n\n       The elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies \n     customary judicial administration and calls for national \n     legislation. . . .\n\n  S. 852 is a response to the Supreme Court's concerns. The bill \nestablishes a $140 billion trust fund, privately funded, for the \npurpose of directing compensation to the individuals suffering \nidentifiable injuries as they result from asbestos exposure. Instead of \nwaiting years for their claims to go through the tort system, the trust \nfund will allow legitimate asbestos victims to be compensated faster \nand on a no-fault basis, meaning that the claimants no longer have to \ngo into court and have a trial to prove that their injuries are the \nresult of negligence or fault on another party; they just make a claim \nand get paid based on the severity of injury. They do not have to prove \ncausation or negligence.\n  For asbestos victims who are the most ill, like those with \nmesothelioma, the bill provides for an expedited\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nclaims process and payment system. It is really expedited. Fifty \npercent of the $1.1 million a person with meso will be entitled to \nreceive will be paid within 30 days, and the rest in 6 months.\n  Now, we have seen in the paper, we have heard here on the floor, and \nwe have heard from people who have come to the Hill, like widows of \npersons who have died from mesothelioma, just how long it takes to get \ncompensation under the tort system. Meso is a deadly disease that is, \nindeed, connected to asbestos. Of that I think there is little dispute. \nThat is why this legislation says that if you have mesothelioma and you \nhave been exposed to asbestos, you walk in with a doctor and they will \npay you $1.1 million, and you do not even need a lawyer. You get all of \nyour compensation, and you do not have 60 percent of the money taken \nout for fees and costs, and the money will be paid promptly. Isn't that \nthe way the system should work?\n  But we have had these widows and other victims coming here, telling \nus how long it takes to get their money. I began to think about it a \nlittle bit--I know Senator Specter has had the opportunity to deal with \nthis issue, too--and how sad it is to see people who have been widowed \nas a result of asbestos. Let me say this. Widows are coming here asking \nfor payment as the result of the death of a loved one because they have \nnot yet gotten their money. Why haven't they been paid? Because it \ntakes years in the current system to bring the case to judgment, and \nthen there is only partial judgment. Some defendants settle, some do \nnot settle, and the cases go on. And the people with fatal diseases \nsuch as mesothelioma die before the case is ever concluded. I am \ntelling you that is the way it works in the real world. That will end \nwith this process.\n  We have the ability to create in this Senate a legal scheme for \nhandling these cases that will end a system where the real victims get \npennies on the dollar and individuals with no real injuries clog up the \nsystem or get windfalls. It will end a system where lawyers are the big \nwinners, often walking away with more than half the proceeds.\n  The FAIR Act will provide greater certainty to victims, defendant \ncompanies, and insurers. Under the fund, victims will be paid on a set \nschedule, according to their proven illness. Defendant companies and \ninsurers will contribute a set amount of money to the fund on a \npredetermined timetable, allowing them to move forward and plan for \ntheir financial future. The money will go to victims, not to overhead \nand attorneys.\n  The Democratic leader has said this is some sort of corrupt process, \nand those who want to fix this system are somehow coming here with less \nthan clean hands, that their judgment is clouded by K Street or money. \nI would ask the Democratic leader to defend this system, if you will. \nCome here and justify what is going on in the courts of America.\n  Dickey Scruggs, who lives not too far from my hometown of Mobile, AL, \nwas the architect of the asbestos litigation. He started the cases, and \nhe established the legal principles that led to all of these suits \naround the country. He came with Senator Specter the other day and said \nit is time to bring it to an end, that this is not a legitimate legal \nprocess anymore. It is not working effectively. It is an embarrassment \nto us all.\n  It is an embarrassment to me that Congress cannot fix a system where \nbillions of dollars are being paid out, billions of dollars--$70 \nbillion already, and 60 percent of it does not go to the victims. What \nkind of legal system is that?\n  Now, we have a lot of businesses that are opposing the legislation. I \nwould suspect their views are that they have gotten a calculator out \nand they have had their accountants and lawyers get together, and they \nhave calculated that they may not pay as much under the current system \nas under this bill, so they do not want the bill to pass.\n\n  We have plaintiffs' lawyers who are out there making millions of \ndollars every day on this system. And there are defense lawyers also \nmaking millions of dollars on this system. They object to the \nlegislation because they have a special interest in it.\n  But we are Senators. We represent the public interest. We have a duty \nand an obligation to defend this American legal system, and to make \nsure the legal system has integrity. We are entitled and have a \nresponsibility to superintend it. When we see things in the system that \nare plainly wrong, it is our responsibility to fix them. That is what \nwe are setting about to do with this bill. It is not easy. I do not \ndeny that.\n  We will continue to listen to the legitimate complaints of those who \nfeel somehow this system will not be fair to them, and continue to make \nadjustments.\n  Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, and others have--we have all promised \nto do that, to try to, in good faith, work in that way. But, again, our \nresponsibility is not to plaintiffs' lawyers, who poured millions of \ndollars in campaign contributions to one side or another in these \nraces, or businesses that pour out large contributions. What is that? \nOur responsibility is to integrity and to propriety and to justice. \nJustice is not being done in these cases. Dickey Scruggs himself says \nit should end. He supports this legislation. Does anybody say he does \nnot care about victims? He has represented thousands of them, tens of \nthousands of them.\n  I am glad to work with Chairman Specter and the others in support of \nthis bill. I believe his work on it comes from the highest motives, the \npurest motives. We can disagree on the tactics, but it is offensive to \nme that we have Senators on this floor suggesting that an effort to end \nthis abusive and unjust system is somehow, in itself, a corrupt act. \nThat is not true.\n  Senator Specter and Judge Becker of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, a senior judge and capable person, have had meetings all over \nthis country, listening to everybody who has an interest in this \nmatter. Senator Specter has spent hours in these meetings--days, weeks, \nmonths, even. Senator Hatch, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nbefore Senator Specter, has also worked tirelessly to accommodate \nconcerns.\n  For years we have been working on this legislation. It is an open \nprocess. The bill is out there. If it needs to be improved, I support \nthat and will listen to that effort. But I do not think we need to drop \nthe ball now. We are moving forward toward the goal line. We have an \nopportunity to provide relief to victims in a way that cannot help but \nbe helpful to them, but they may not know that.\n  I am getting calls from victims, and they are saying things with \nwritten messages their trial lawyers have given them to say. It breaks \nmy heart. To think, I used to be representing victims, so I know a \nlittle bit about this matter. I am sympathetic to them. They do not \nknow. They have no idea this system is going to provide more money for \nvictims, quicker and faster, with less cost than the current system. \nThey are hearing it only from one side--their lawyer's.\n  So it is up to us to do the right thing and not play politics, not \nlose our nerve at this point in history.\n  I am glad to see Senator Specter here. If he would allow me, I wish \nto take a couple minutes at this point to say a few words on the \npassing of Coretta Scott King.\n  I say to Chairman Specter, if you wish to comment, I did want to have \na few minutes to express my thoughts on the funeral today of Coretta \nScott King.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alabama will yield to \nme for a very brief comment about his presentation before moving on, I \nwish to thank him for those comments. I think he has accurately \ndescribed the serious problem caused by asbestos in this country in \nterms of injuring workers, injuring people who are exposed to asbestos \nwho are not workers but from materials carried home, the tremendous \nimpact on the economy, the bankruptcies.\n  He has addressed in a very forceful way the spurious, unmeritorious \nallegation about lobbyists having bought their way on to the floor with \nthis bill. I appreciated all of his speech, but I especially \nappreciated the passion there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the printed Record reflect the passion. \nThe printer is going to have to figure out some way to reflect the \npassion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is that unanimous consent request granted, Mr. \nPresident?\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I took it as such, and I granted it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Good. But it was a terrific speech, I say to Senator \nSessions, and I thank you for it and thank you for your leadership on \nthis bill generally and for your strenuous, hard work and leadership on \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, I say to Senator Specter. You put your heart \nand soul into this effort. Nobody should think the effort you have gone \nforward with, and that Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and Judge Becker \nand others have gone forward with, is for any other purpose than trying \nto make this system better. We absolutely can improve the system. It is \nwithin our grasp to do so. If we cannot pass legislation that takes the \n58 percent of compensation that is currently not getting to the victims \nand allow those victims to have larger amounts of money, it is our \nfault. We are pretty incompetent.\n\n\n                           Coretta Scott King\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to express some \nthoughts about the death of Coretta Scott King. She grew up in Perry \nCounty, AL. Her father ran a country store as did mine.\n  Mrs. King, in so many ways, epitomized the good background that she \nhad and where she was raised. She carried those values forward \nthroughout her life. She graduated from Lincoln High School in Marion, \nAL. It was an all-Black high school that educated the offspring of \nformer slaves from 1867 and 1970. The late Jean Childs Young, wife of \nformer Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, was another distinguished Lincoln \ngraduate.\n  After high school, where she was valedictorian of the Class of 1945, \nMrs. King accepted a scholarship to Antioch College in Ohio, where she \nstudied the violin, singing, and piano. After graduating from Antioch, \nshe accepted a scholarship to attend the New England Conservatory of \nMusic in Boston, where she met her future husband Martin, who was also \na student in Boston.\n  They got married in 1953 and the very next year, they were at Dexter \nAvenue Baptist Church, within sight of the State Capitol of the State \nof Alabama. It was at this time that she and Dr. King came to know Rosa \nParks, whose refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus led to the \ncivil rights movement. Rosa Parks was arrested and the Montgomery bus \nboycott ensued, sparking a movement to ensure that all citizens were \ntreated equally under the law.\n  Dr. and Mrs. King and Rosa Parks truly changed a system that could \nnot be defended. It was a system that treated people, because of the \ncolor of their skin, as second-class citizens and not equal. It was not \na defensible system morally or legally.\n  Judge Frank Johnson got the bus boycott case, and he ruled that the \nequal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution said people should be \ntreated equally. Requiring someone to go to the back of the bus, \ndespite a State statute to the contrary, did not represent equality. It \nwas unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed, and that gave a real \nboost to the civil rights movement.\n  During her 78 years, Mrs. King represented the kind of character and \nintegrity and commitment to right living that should inspire us all. \nAnd she has given her best full measure. She has seen the toils and \nsnares of life. She moved through them through her full and complete \ntime on this Earth. She has run the race and is fully entitled to the \nrewards of that successful race.\n  It is my honor and privilege to express, on behalf of the people of \nAlabama, my sympathy to the King family, to wish them well and to say \nto them how our State, our Nation, and, indeed, the world is better off \nfor the courage they displayed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I associate myself with the eloquent \nremarks of the Senator from Alabama with respect to Coretta Scott King. \nI appreciate the opportunity to listen.\n\n\n                          Warrantless Wiretaps\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Last week the President of the United States gave his \nState of the Union Address, where he spoke of America's leadership in \nthe world and called on all of us to ``lead this world toward \nfreedom.'' Again and again, he invoked the principle of freedom and how \nit can transform nations and empower people around the world.\n  Almost in the same breath, the President openly acknowledged that he \nhas ordered the Government to spy on Americans on American soil without \nthe warrants required by law. The President issued a call to spread \nfreedom throughout the world, and then he admitted he has deprived \nAmericans of one of their most basic freedoms under the fourth \namendment--to be free from unjustified Government intrusion.\n  The President was blunt. He said he had authorized the NSA's domestic \nspying program, and he made a number of misleading arguments to defend \nhimself. His words got rousing applause from Republicans and I think \neven from some Democrats.\n  The President was blunt so I will be blunt. This program is breaking \nthe law, and this President is breaking the law. Not only that, he is \nmisleading the American people in his efforts to justify this program.\n  How is that worthy of applause? Since when do we celebrate our \nCommander in Chief violating our most basic freedoms and misleading the \nAmerican people in the process? When did we start to stand up and cheer \nfor breaking the law? In that moment at the State of the Union, I felt \nashamed.\n  Congress has lost its way if we don't hold this President accountable \nfor his actions. The President, of course, suggested that anyone who \ncriticizes his illegal wiretapping program doesn't understand the \nthreat we face. But we do. Every single one of us is committed to \nstopping the terrorists who threaten us and threaten our families. \nDefeating the terrorists is our top national priority. And we all agree \nthat we need to wiretap them to do it. We all agree on that. In fact, \nit would be irresponsible not to wiretap terrorists. But we have yet to \nsee any reason at all why we have to trample the laws of the United \nStates to do it.\n\n  The President's decision that he can break the law says far more \nabout his attitude toward the rule of law than it does about the laws \nthemselves. This goes way beyond party and way beyond politics. What \nthe President has done is to break faith with the American people.\n  In the State of the Union, he also said that we must always be clear \nin our principles ``to get support from our friends and allies that we \nneed to fight terrorism.''\n  So let's be clear about a basic American principle: When someone \nbreaks the law, when someone misleads the public in an attempt to \njustify their actions, they need to be held accountable. The President \nof the United States has broken the law. The President of the United \nStates is trying to mislead the American people, and he needs to be \nheld accountable.\n  Unfortunately, the President refuses to provide any real details \nabout this domestic spying program. Not even the full Intelligence \nCommittees know the details, and they were specifically set up to \nreview classified information and oversee the intelligence activities \nof our Government. Instead, the President says, basically: Trust me.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have heard this. In the \nlead up to the Iraq war, the administration went on the offensive to \nget the American public, the Congress, and the international community \nto believe its theory that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of \nmass destruction and even that he had close ties to al-Qaida and was \nsomehow involved in 9/11. The President painted a dire and inaccurate \npicture of Saddam Hussein's capability and intent, and we invaded Iraq \non that basis. To make matters worse, the administration misled the \ncountry about what it would take to stabilize and reconstruct Iraq \nafter the conflict. We were led to believe that this was going to be a \nshort endeavor and that our troops would be home soon.\n  We all recall the President's ``mission accomplished'' banner on the \naircraft carrier on May 1, 2003. In fact, the mission was not even \nclose to being complete. More than 2,100 total deaths have occurred \nafter the President declared an end to major combat operations in May \nof 2003, and over 16,600 American troops have been wounded in Iraq. The \nPresident misled the American people and grossly miscalculated the true \nchallenge of stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq.\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\n  In December, we found out that the President has authorized wiretaps \nof Americans without court orders required by law. He says he is only \nwiretapping people with links to terrorists. But how do we know? How do \nwe know? We don't. The President is unwilling to let a neutral judge \nmake sure that that is the case. He will not submit this program to an \nindependent branch of Government to make sure he is not violating the \nrights of law-abiding Americans.\n  I don't want to hear again that this administration has somehow shown \nthat it can be trusted. It hasn't. That is exactly why the law requires \na judge to review these wiretaps. It is up to the Congress to hold the \nPresident to account. We held a hearing on the domestic spying program \nin the Judiciary Committee yesterday, where Attorney General Gonzalez \nwas a witness. We expect there will be other hearings. That is a start. \nBut it will take more than hearings to get the job done. We know that, \nin part, because the President's Attorney General has already shown a \nwillingness to mislead Congress.\n  At the hearing yesterday, I reminded the Attorney General about his \ntestimony during his confirmation hearings in January 2005, when I \nasked him whether the President had the power to authorize warrantless \nwiretaps in violation of criminal law. We didn't know it then, but the \nPresident had authorized the NSA program 3 years before, when the \nAttorney General was the White House counsel. At his confirmation \nhearing, the Attorney General first tried to dismiss my question as \n``hypothetical.'' He then testified that ``it is not the policy or the \nagenda of the President to authorize actions that would be in \ncontravention of our criminal statutes.''\n  Wiretapping American citizens on American soil without the required \nwarrant is in direct contravention of our criminal statutes. The \nAttorney General knew that, and he knew about the NSA program when he \nsought the Senate's approval for his nomination to be Attorney General. \nHe wanted the Senate and the American people to think that the \nPresident had not acted on the extreme legal theory that the President \nhas the power, as Commander in Chief, to disobey the criminal laws of \nthis country. But he had.\n  The Attorney General had some explaining to do, and he didn't do it \nyesterday. Instead, he parsed words, argued that what he said was \ntruthful because he didn't believe that the President's actions \nviolated the law.\n  The Attorney General knew what I was asking. He knew he was \nmisleading the committee in his response. If he had been \nstraightforward, he would have told the committee that in his opinion, \nthe President has the authority to authorize warrantless wiretaps. My \nquestion wasn't about whether such illegal wiretapping was going on. \nSimilar to almost everybody else in Congress, I didn't know about the \nprogram then. It was a question about how the nominee to be the \nAttorney General of the United States viewed the law. This nominee \nwanted to be confirmed. So he let a misleading statement about one of \nthe central issues of his confirmation, his view of Executive power, \nstay on the record until the New York Times revealed the program.\n  The rest of the Attorney General's performance at yesterday's hearing \ncertainly did not give me any comfort either. He continued to push the \nadministration's weak legal arguments, continued to insinuate that \nanyone who questions this program doesn't want to fight terrorism, and \nhe refused to answer basic questions about what powers this \nadministration is claiming.\n  We still need a lot of answers from this administration. Let's put \naside the Attorney General for now. The burden is not just on him to \ncome clean. The President himself has some explaining to do. The \nPresident's defense of his actions is deeply cynical, deeply \nmisleading, and deeply troubling. To find out that the President of the \nUnited States has violated the basic rights of the American people is \nchilling. And then to see him publicly embrace his actions and to see \nso many Members of Congress cheer him on is appalling.\n  The President has broken the law. He has made it clear that he will \ncontinue to do so. But the President is not a king, and the Congress is \nnot a king's court. Our job is not to stand up and cheer when the \nPresident breaks the law. Our job is to stand up and demand \naccountability, stand up and check the power of an out-of-control \nexecutive branch.\n  That is one of the reasons the Framers put us here--to ensure balance \nbetween the branches of Government, not to act as a professional \ncheering section. We need answers, because no one--not the President, \nnot the Attorney General, and not any of their defenders in this body \nhave been able to explain why it is necessary to break the law to \ndefend against terrorism. I think that is because they cannot explain \nit.\n  Instead, this administration reacts to anybody who questions this \nillegal program by saying that those of us who demand the truth and \nstand up for our rights and freedoms have a pre-9/11 view of the world. \nIn fact, the President has a pre-1776 view of the world. That is the \nproblem. Our Founders lived in dangerous times, and they risked \neverything for freedom. Patrick Henry said, ``Give me liberty or give \nme death.'' The President's pre-1776 mentality is hurting America. It \nis fracturing the foundation on which our country has stood for 230 \nyears.\n  The President cannot just bypass two branches of Government and obey \nonly those laws he wants to obey, deciding unilaterally which freedoms \nstill apply in the war against terrorism. That is unacceptable and \nneeds to be stopped immediately.\n  Let's examine some of the President's attempts to defend his actions. \nHis arguments have changed over time because none of them hold up even \nunder casual scrutiny. So he cannot rely on one single explanation. As \neach argument crumbles beneath him, he moves on to a new one, until \nthat is, too, debunked, and on and on he goes.\n  In the State of the Union, the President referred to Presidents in \nAmerican history who cited executive authority to order warrantless \nsurveillance. But of course those past Presidents, as Wilson and \nRoosevelt, were acting before the Supreme Court decided in 1967 that \nour communications are protected by the fourth amendment, and before \nCongress decided in 1978 that the executive branch can no longer \nunilaterally decide which Americans to wiretap. The Attorney General \nyesterday was unable to give me one example of a President who, since \n1978 when FISA was passed, has authorized warrantless wiretaps outside \nof FISA.\n  So that argument is baseless, and it's deeply troubling that the \nPresident of the United States would so obviously mislead the Congress \nand American public. That hardly honors the Founders' idea that the \nPresident should address the Congress on the state of our union.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978 to \ncreate a secret court, made up of judges who develop national security \nexpertise, to issue warrants for surveillance of terrorists and spies. \nThese are the judges from whom the Bush administration has obtained \nthousands of warrants since 9/11. The administration has almost never \nhad a warrant request rejected by those judges. They have used the FISA \nCourt thousands of times, but at the same time they assert that FISA is \nan ``old law'' or ``out of date'' and they can't comply with it. \nClearly, they can and do comply with it except when they don't. Then \nthey just arbitrarily decide to go around these judges, around the law.\n  The administration has said that it ignored FISA because it takes too \nlong to get a warrant under that law. But we know that in an emergency, \nwhere the Attorney General believes that surveillance must begin before \na court order can be obtained, FISA permits the wiretap to be executed \nimmediately as long as the Government goes to the court within 72 \nhours. The Attorney General has complained that the emergency provision \ndoes not give him enough flexibility, he has complained that getting a \nFISA application together or getting the necessary approvals takes too \nlong. But the problems he has cited are bureaucratic barriers that the \nexecutive branch put in place and could easily remove if it wanted.\n  FISA also permits the Attorney General to authorize unlimited \nwarrantless electronic surveillance in the United States during the 15 \ndays following a declaration of war, to allow time to consider any \namendments to FISA required by a wartime emergency. That\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\nis the time period that Congress specified. Yet the President thinks \nthat he can do this indefinitely.\n  In the state of the union, the President also argued that Federal \ncourts had approved the use of Presidential authority that he was \ninvoking. But that turned out to be misleading as well. When I asked \nthe Attorney General about this, he could point me to no court--not the \nSupreme Court or any other court--that has considered whether, after \nFISA was enacted, the President nonetheless had the authority to bypass \nit and authorize warrantless wiretaps. Not one court. The \nadministration's effort to find support for what it has done in \nsnippets of other court decisions would be laughable if this issue were \nnot so serious.\n  The President knows that FISA makes it a crime to wiretap Americans \nin the United States without a warrant or a court order. Why else would \nhe have assured the public, over and over again, that he was getting \nwarrants before engaging in domestic surveillance?\n  Here's what the President said on April 20, 2004:\n\n       Now, by the way, any time you hear the United States \n     Government talking about wiretap, it requires--a wiretap \n     requires a court order. Nothing has changed, by the way. When \n     we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking \n     about getting a court order before we do so.\n\n  And again, on July 14, 2004: ``The Government can't move on wiretaps \nor roving wiretaps without getting a court order.''\n  The President was understandably eager in these speeches to make it \nclear that under his administration, law enforcement was using the FISA \nCourt to obtain warrants before wiretapping. That is understandable, \nsince wiretapping Americans on American soil without a warrant is \nagainst the law.\n  And listen to what the President said on June 9, 2005:\n\n       Law enforcement officers need a Federal judge's permission \n     to wiretap a foreign terrorist's phone, a Federal judge's \n     permission to track his calls, or a Federal judge's \n     permission to search his property. Officers must meet strict \n     standards to use any of these tools. And these standards are \n     fully consistent with the Constitution of the U.S.\n\n  Now that the public knows about the domestic spying program, he has \nhad to change course. He has looked around for arguments to cloak his \nactions. And all of them are completely threadbare.\n  The President has argued that Congress gave him authority to wiretap \nAmericans on U.S. soil without a warrant when it passed the \nauthorization for use of military force after September 11, 2001. Mr. \nPresident, that is ridiculous. Members of Congress did not think this \nresolution gave the President blanket authority to order these \nwarrantless wiretaps. We all know that. Anyone in this body who would \ntell you otherwise either wasn't here at the time or isn't telling the \ntruth. We authorized the President to use military force in \nAfghanistan, a necessary and justified response to September 11. We did \nnot authorize him to wiretap American citizens on American soil without \ngoing through the process that was set up nearly three decades ago \nprecisely to facilitate the domestic surveillance of terrorists--with \nthe approval of a judge. That is why both Republicans and Democrats \nhave questioned this theory that somehow the Afghanistan resolution \npermitted this sort of thing.\n\n  This particular claim is further undermined by congressional approval \nof the PATRIOT Act just a few weeks after we passed the authorization \nfor the use of military force. The PATRIOT Act made it easier for law \nenforcement to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists and spies, \nwhile maintaining FISA's baseline requirement of judicial approval for \nwiretaps of Americans in the U.S. It is ridiculous to think that \nCongress would have negotiated and enacted all the changes to FISA in \nthe PATRIOT Act if it thought it had just authorized the President to \nignore FISA in the AUMF.\n  In addition, in the intelligence authorization bill passed in \nDecember 2001, we extended the emergency authority in FISA, at the \nadministration's request, from 24 to 72 hours. Why do that if the \nPresident has the power to ignore FISA? That makes no sense at all.\n  The President has also said that his inherent executive power gives \nhim the power to approve this program. But here the President is acting \nin direct violation of a criminal statute. That means his power is, as \nJustice Jackson said in the steel seizure cases half a century ago, \n``at its lowest ebb.'' A recent letter from a group of law professors \nand former executive branch officials points out that ``every time the \nSupreme Court has confronted a statute limiting the Commander-in-\nChief's authority, it has upheld the statute.'' The Senate reports \nissued when FISA was enacted confirm the understanding that FISA \noverrode any pre-existing inherent authority of the President. As the \n1978 Senate Judiciary Committee report stated, FISA ``recognizes no \ninherent power of the president in this area.'' And ``Congress has \ndeclared that this statute, not any claimed presidential power, \ncontrols.'' Contrary to what the President told the country in the \nState of the Union, no court has ever approved warrantless surveillance \nin violation of FISA.\n  The President's claims of inherent executive authority, and his \nassertions that the courts have approved this type of activity, are \nbaseless.\n  The President has argued that periodic internal executive branch \nreview provides an adequate check on the program. He has even \ncharacterized this periodic review as a safeguard for civil liberties. \nBut we don't know what this check involves. And we do know that \nCongress explicitly rejected this idea of unilateral executive \ndecisionmaking in this area when it passed FISA.\n  Finally, the President has tried to claim that informing a handful of \ncongressional leaders, the so-called Gang of Eight, somehow excuses \nbreaking the law. Of course, several of these Members said they weren't \ngiven the full story. And all of them were prohibited from discussing \nwhat they were told. So the fact that they were informed under these \nextraordinary circumstances does not constitute congressional \noversight, and it most certainly does not constitute congressional \napproval of the program. Indeed, it doesn't even comply with the \nNational Security Act, which requires the entire memberships of the \nHouse and Senate Intelligence Committee to be ``fully and currently \ninformed of the intelligence activities of the United States.''\n  In addition, we now know that some of these Members expressed concern \nabout the program. The administration ignored their protests. Just last \nweek, one of the eight Members of Congress who has been briefed about \nthe program, Congresswoman Jane Harman, ranking member of the House \nIntelligence Committee, said she sees no reason why the administration \ncannot accomplish its goals within the law as currently written.\n  None of the President's arguments explains or excuses his conduct or \nthe NSA's domestic spying program. Not one. It is hard to believe that \nthe President has the audacity to claim that they do. It is a strategy \nthat really hinges on the credibility of the office of the Presidency \nitself. If you just insist that you didn't break the law, you haven't \nbroken the law. It reminds me of what Richard Nixon said after he had \nleft office: ``Well, when the President does it that means that it is \nnot illegal.'' But that is not how our constitutional democracy works. \nMaking those kinds of arguments is damaging the credibility of the \nPresidency.\n  And what's particularly disturbing is how many Members of Congress \nhave responded. They stood up and cheered. They stood up and cheered.\n  Justice Louis Brandeis once wrote:\n\n       Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to \n     protect liberty when the Government's purposes are \n     beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel \n     invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest \n     dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of \n     zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\n\n  The President's actions are indefensible. Freedom is an enduring \nprinciple. It is not something to celebrate in one breath, and ignore \nthe next. Freedom is at the heart of who we are as a Nation, and as a \npeople. We cannot be a beacon of freedom for the world unless we \nprotect our own freedoms here at home.\n  The President was right about one thing. In his address, he said ``We \nlove our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.''\n  Yes, Mr. President. We do love our freedom, and we will fight to keep \nit.\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\nWe will fight to defeat the terrorists who threaten the safety and \nsecurity of our families and loved ones. And we will fight to protect \nthe rights of law-abiding Americans against intrusive Government power.\n  As the President said, we must always be clear in our principles. So \nlet us be clear. We cherish the great and noble principle of freedom. \nWe will fight to keep it, and we will hold this President and anyone \nwho violates those freedoms accountable for their actions.\n  In a nation built on freedom, the President is not a king, and no one \nis above the law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a compelling need to reform the \ncurrent asbestos litigation process. This process is not fair to \nworkers, including many who have become ill through exposure to \nasbestos. There are people who are not impaired who have received \ncompensation, and there are many claimants that have been injured by \nasbestos exposure who have not received compensation. It is not fair to \nbusinesses for a host of reasons. The status quo is not acceptable.\n  I do have several substantive issues with S. 852, The FAIR Act. I \nhave spent a great deal of time over the past few months working with \nthe sponsors of S. 852, including Senators Specter and Leahy, seeking \nto make changes that would improve the bill from my perspective.\n  For instance, I wanted to see more money go to mesothelioma victims \nwho have dependents and to ensure that in a budget neutral manner, the \nmoney didn't come from other terminally ill victims. The sponsors of \nthe bill have agreed to support the following language to address my \nconcerns:\n\n       The Administrator may increase awards for Level IX \n     claimants who have dependent children so long as this \n     provision is cost neutral. Such increased awards shall be \n     paid for by decreasing awards for claimants other than Level \n     IX, so long as no award levels are decreased more than 10 \n     percent.\n\n  Another issue for me was to protect companies that might be required \nto contribute to an asbestos trust fund, and have their insurers \ncontribute, but that have no assurance that the company's own claims \nwill be satisfied. The sponsors have agreed to an added criteria which \nwould allow a company to apply for a decreased payment for their annual \nassessment into the trust to protect again that outcome. That criteria \nwould be:\n\n       When measured against the likely cost of past and potential \n     future claims in the absence of the Act.\n\n  A third problem I wanted to see addressed related to companies that \nshould not be required to participate in the asbestos trust fund \nbecause they have disposed of all of their known previous claims. The \nsponsors of the bill have agreed to support the following language to \naddress my concern:\n\n       . . . subject to the discretion of the Administrator, [a \n     company may] be exempt from any payment obligation if such \n     defendant participant establishes with the Administrator that \n     it has satisfied all past claims and that there is no \n     reasonable likelihood in the absence of the Act of any future \n     claims for whose costs the defendant participant might be \n     responsible. . . .\n\n  A fourth issue that concerns me is in the area of attorney's fees in \nboth (a) past cases that are moved into the trust fund from the tort \nsystem and (b) new administrative claims in the asbestos trust fund. \nThe former situation could be highly unfair and even confiscatory while \nin the case of the latter the fee is so low as to constitute as a \ndeterrent to both filing future claims and appeals. The sponsors of the \nbill have agreed to language relative to (b) that reads in part that \nattorneys will be able to ``obtain a reasonable attorney's fee, which \nshall be calculated by multiplying a reasonable hourly rate by the \nnumber of hours reasonably expended on the individual's claim.'' My \nconcern relative to (a) remains unaddressed.\n  I have additional concerns about S. 852. I am concerned about the \ncurrent severability provision in the bill. There are many contentious \nissues in S. 852 that many observers expect will be litigated including \nthe constitutionality of incorporating existing asbestos trust funds \ninto this one. There are also restrictions on tort cases in this bill, \nwhich if triggered by the fund's nonviability will limit the possible \nvenues for filing future asbestos claims. The availability of such \nrestrictions may lead companies to resist payments to the fund, thereby \ncontributing to its nonviability because they obtain restrictions on \ntort claims in that event. That is not a wise incentive. Therefore, I \nsupport a nonseverability clause for certain sections of the bill and \nthe sponsors have indicated a willingness to consider it.\n  There are other issues that have been raised by a number of \ncolleagues with this bill. Some of those issues include the \nconstitutional issues involved in the of ``taking'' the existing \nasbestos trust funds; the lack of a contribution structure for the $46 \nbillion of insurance industry contributions; the special consideration \ngiven in this bill to the residents of one community; the lack of an \nadequate startup provision which would trigger a return to the tort \nsystem if the trust fund never gets going and the lack of an \nappropriate sunset trigger which would also provide for the fund to \ndissolve if claims go unpaid and allow people to go back to court.\n  Based on my discussions with the managers, I will support the motion \nto proceed to S. 852. My future position on the legislation will depend \non the content of the bill after it is amended.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this evening, Senators will finally have \nthe opportunity to vote to consider legislation which has been publicly \ndebated and considered for several years. It is a bipartisan bill that \nis the product of lengthy and conscientious negotiation. We have held \ndozens of public hearings and committee markups. It has been an \nexemplary process.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania in the Chamber. He \nhas arranged--I have lost count of the number of meetings where people \nfrom across the spectrum, political and otherwise, have had a chance to \nbe heard--businesses, victims, labor, industry, everybody. It has been \na great process. But with every day we delay consideration of this \nbill, victims are dying and more companies are going bankrupt. Both are \ntragedies for the families and victims, as well as for the workers and \nretirees and for the families who built these companies.\n  The time has now come to pass this legislation. Victims have been \nwaiting long enough for a comprehensive national solution. I hope all \nSenators will support the motion to proceed to this legislation. It has \nearned the support of many organizations that represent the victims of \nserious asbestos exposures.\n  Asbestos disease has tragically weighed heavily on one group in \nparticular--our Nation's war veterans. These brave veterans are unable \nto receive compensation under our current system, and they have asked \nMembers of Congress--both parties--over and over again for help. The \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart noted in its last letter of support \nthat ``the FAIR Act is the only viable solution for sick veterans.''\n  We all speak of our support of veterans, as we should; all Americans \nshould. That should not be partisan. But here is one way to help a \nclass of veterans who are not going to get any help otherwise.\n  More than 30 organizations representing veterans, as I noted on the \nfloor yesterday, have supported this piece of legislation. But we have \nalso received renewed letters of support from the International \nAssociation of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Union, \nthe International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace and \nAgricultural Implement Workers, otherwise known as the UAW, and the \nInternational Union of Painters and Allied Trades. They represent \nliterally hundreds of thousands of families who have suffered. They \nsupport this because, as they say, they are ``firmly convinced it would \nbe far superior to the current tort system in compensating the victims \nof asbestos-related diseases.''\n  It has not been easy getting to this point. It has taken years and \nyears of\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\nwork. It is not line for line the bill I would have written; it is not \nline for line the bill the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter, would have written. Both of us went in with the idea that we \nwould find a bill that would get the broadest support possible but also \na bill that would help as many victims as possible. I believe this does \nit.\n  Think of what is going to happen if you are going to have thousands \nof people who never get help and dozens more companies go bankrupt on \ntop of the 70 that have already gone bankrupt.\n  Supreme Court Justices as diverse in philosophy as the late Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have pled, \npublicly pled with the Congress to come up with legislation to solve \nthis problem. Right now, litigation--many times--helps only those \nlitigators, both defense and plaintiff, and very little help to the \ncompanies or the victims.\n  The problems we are addressing are complex. This bill necessarily \nreflects these complexities. Drafting was not easy. The compromises we \nhad to make were difficult but necessary to ensure that we created a \ntrust fund that would provide adequate compensation to the thousands of \nworkers who have suffered and continue to suffer the devastating health \neffects of asbestos.\n  The tragic history of asbestos use in our country has to come to an \nend. We Senators first and the other body next have the chance to bring \nthis to an end. The President has said he would sign such legislation \nif we can pass it. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue; this \nis an issue for all Americans.\n  I join with the President, I join with my Republican colleagues, and \nI join with my Democratic colleagues who have supported this. In fact, \nunder a provision authored by Senator Murray of Washington State which \nwe have included, which was accepted during the last Congress by the \nJudiciary Committee, this bill will ban the maintenance and \ndistribution of asbestos. This whole thing can come to an end so \nvictims can get help.\n  We have to halt the harm asbestos creates, and we have to ameliorate \nthe harm it has already caused. The industrial and insurer participants \nin the trust fund will gain the benefits of financial certainty and \nrelief from the stresses of litigation in the tort system, and victims \nwill have a quicker and more efficient path to recovery.\n  Chairman Specter, Senator Feinstein, Senator Baucus, and my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle on the Judiciary Committee are \nworking hard with me on this bipartisan legislation. Let this go \nforward today. Let us bring this to a halt. Help us bring surety.\n  I urge Senators to let us move toward solving this problem by \nconsidering our bipartisan bill to at long last help solve the asbestos \nproblem by providing fair compensation to victims of asbestos exposure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, for his \ncomments. I compliment him on his comments and on his work on the \nasbestos bill--on his entire career in the U.S. Senate, 31 years, but \nespecially in the past year and 1 month, 13 months, where he and I have \nbeen ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the \ncooperation which we have had. We have had some disagreements, but very \nfew, and when there have been disagreements, they have been on matters \nof policy as opposed to anything to undercut the collegiality of the \nwork of the Judiciary Committee. I can think of some votes--there are \nbound to be differences on votes--but I think we have carried the \ncommittee a long way with class action, bankruptcy, and moving through \nthe disagreements and filibuster versus the nuclear option on the \ncircuit judges and Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito not all \nagreements but in large measure--and then coming to the asbestos bill, \nwhich has been as tough as any legislation I have ever seen.\n  I made a statement yesterday which may have been a little excessively \nsweeping, but the asbestos bill is a complicated bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nbetween 5:40 and 5:50 is reserved for the Democratic leader, and 5:50 \nuntil 6:00 is reserved for the majority.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have the \nlast 10 minutes as the surrogate of the majority leader. I will yield \nand conclude my comments when my time comes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the distinguished Democratic leader \nallow me 20 seconds to refer to what the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania just said?\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is my \nfriend--a friend from the days when we were prosecutors together. I am \nvery touched by what he said. The Judiciary Committee handles some of \nthe most difficult issues there are. I enjoy working with him because \nof his own ability and because of that friendship.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my 10 minutes start running from this \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a crisis facing the American people, \na crisis which causes the death of 10,000 people each year. In addition \nto the 10,000 deaths each year, hundreds of thousands of people are \nsuffering from lung conditions that are most debilitating.\n  The crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis; \nit is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. We are told by experts that \nthe problem will get worse, not better. It will peak about 10 years \nfrom now. Litigation has not caused the deaths, the pain, the \nsuffering, the lost wages, the medical bills; asbestos has caused the \ndeaths and the suffering.\n  I have said on a number of occasions--I say it today--that of course \nI would support a fair and equitable piece of legislation, legislation \nwhich would favor the victims, not a few very large corporations.\n  Senators Leahy and Specter have worked very hard on this legislation \nand on things they do on the Judiciary Committee. I understand that. \nBut hard work doesn't always lead to good legislation.\n  I have served in Congress 24 years. There may be an occasion when \nSenator Leahy and I have voted opposite one another; I just do not \nremember when that was. We virtually agree on everything we do. So I am \nsorry that on this piece of legislation we must disagree.\n  Powerful corporate interests have fought throughout this process to \nescape responsibility--a paradigm shift from what they should pay to \nwhat they are willing to pay. This is not the American way. The bill \nbefore us is based on faulty and questionable guesses, not estimates. \nTo make it even worse, little relevant information has been made \npublic.\n  The legislation before the Senate is unfair to the victims, to the \nveterans--they would be much better off without this legislation--to \nthe insurance industry, most businesses, the American taxpayer, and, of \ncourse, our judicial system. I rise again to express my strong \nopposition to the asbestos bill before the Senate. As I have just said, \nit is unfair to victims, veterans, the insurance industry, most \nbusinesses, and, of course, the American taxpayers.\n  I oppose this legislation because it will not buy justice regarding \nasbestos exposure. It deprives victims of their legal rights and gives \nthem a trust fund that will not work and will not provide adequate \ncompensation. One would have to search long and hard to find a bill, in \nmy opinion, as bad as this.\n\n  Asbestos disease kills thousands of Americans every year--10,000 to \nbe exact. The cases of disease and death caused by asbestos exposure \nare not abstractions. I have received countless letters from victims of \nasbestos-related diseases and their families. Each shares another story \nof loss and pain.\n  All the leading organizations representing asbestos victims oppose \nthis bill--the Committee to Protect Mesothelioma Victims, asbestos \ndisease\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nawareness organizations, the Asbestos Victims Organization. The White \nLung Association wrote a letter February 1 to me and to Senator Frist. \nIt said:\n\n       We do not want this proposed government policy forced upon \n     us. We believe the program will fail to treat victims fairly \n     while benefitting the very companies that cause the problem.\n\n  It was for the sake of these victims that today I introduced a Senate \nresolution designating April 1 of this year as National Asbestos \nAwareness Day. Introducing this resolution was one small step in an \neffort to raise awareness of this dangerous substance and the painful \neffects that exposure to asbestos has caused throughout the country.\n  It is my hope that designating another National Asbestos Awareness \nDay will serve as a reminder that exposure to asbestos remains a very \nbad problem in this country. Asbestos-induced illnesses continue to \nkill or disable Americans at alarming rates. Our resolve to adequately \nprotect the rights of these victims must not falter.\n  One thing we should do for asbestos victims is to defeat the flawed \nlegislation now before the Senate. Approximately 150,000 individual \nvictims of asbestos exposure and their families have petitioned the \nSenate to communicate their opposition to this legislation. I have a \nfew of the 150,000 names. We have boxes and boxes of these petitions. \nThese petitions say:\n\n       We, the undersigned, hereby petition the United States \n     Senate on behalf of the victims of asbestos poisoning.\n       We are the victims of asbestos poisoning and families and \n     friends of the victims who are opposed to Senate bill 852, \n     the ``FAIR ACT.''\n       Although the Bill's Senate sponsors intend to help victims, \n     this bill only helps a few large companies at the expense of \n     the victims of asbestos poisoning and most businesses.\n       In addition to our opposition, we observe that the bill is \n     also opposed by most insurance companies, numerous \n     businesses, and most labor unions.\n       The reasons we oppose S. 852 are as follows:\n       (1) The bill does not provide a reliable mechanism for \n     providing compensation quickly to the victims of asbestos \n     poisoning. If anything, the Bill backtracks on protections \n     already promised by the Senate in an earlier version which \n     passed in the Judiciary Committee with substantial bipartisan \n     support.\n       (2) If the Trust Fund runs out of money, as predicted by \n     some experts, the Bill does not contain reliable sunset \n     provisions. Victims will be left in limbo.\n       (3) In many instances, the compensation for victims is far \n     less than victims' actual damages and far less than we \n     currently receive in the judicial system.\n       (4) The Bill allows companies to renege on settlement \n     commitments and settlement trust amounts already promised and \n     set aside for victims and their families.\n       (5) The Bill does not have reliable, transparent funding \n     mechanisms. Instead, it sets up a complex system of \n     administrative challenges and court challenges that will \n     allow companies to contest their funding obligations.\n       (6) Contrary to prior Senate commitments contained in \n     earlier versions of the Bill, this Bill will stop the current \n     system of compensation before an up and running reliable \n     system is established to take its place.\n       (7) This Bill was written to benefit a group of companies \n     who have spent a fortune lobbying for its passage to the \n     detriment of other companies and insurers who have promised \n     to fight the Bill in the courts. This will result in further \n     delays all to the further detriment of all victims of \n     asbestos poisoning.\n\n  Mr. President, there are 150,000 signatures with their names and \naddresses. I will not ask it be made part of the record, of course.\n  I will use leader time now. I mentioned yesterday on the Senate floor \nthat there were some businesses that were not being treated fairly. I \nmentioned them by name, and I will run over a couple of them again: \nFoster Wheeler Company, an international engineering and construction \ncompany with 4,000 U.S. employees, has stated in recent SEC filings the \ncompany does not expect to fund any asbestos-related costs from the \ncompany's cash flow. Yet as a Tier II defendant participant would be \nrequired to pay at least $19.5 million per annum into the trust fund. \nThis requirement, along with the separation of the company from its \ninsurance assets, jeopardizes its long-term financial viability.\n  The A.W. Chesterton Company, founded in 1884, would also file \nbankruptcy. They have 2,000 employees.\n  Hopeman Brothers, in Waynesboro, VA, is still privately owned by the \nHopeman family. It has finished the interiors and outfitted ships since \nit first worked in Sun Shipyard in Chester, PA, in 1916. Hopeman bought \nsignificant liability insurance, much of which remains unused today. \nStripping Hopeman of its insurance coverage and then imposing a cash-\npay obligation will drive the company into bankruptcy.\n  Okonite Company, founded in 1876, is the only company in America that \nmakes wire. They will be forced to file bankruptcy if this bill passes.\n  These are only four of hundreds and hundreds of companies that will \nbe forced into bankruptcy.\n  Each one of the 150,000 signatories on these petitions are a real \nconcern. Each one of the 10,000 Americans who will die from asbestos \nexposure this year have tragic stories. Each will leave behind a family \nwhich will never be whole again. Each one is counting on us in the \nSenate to preserve their right to obtain compensation for the harm \ncaused to them and their families by asbestos exposure, just as these \ncompanies want fairness.\n  Opposition to the FAIR Act is not limited to individual victims. Many \nworkers have been exposed to asbestos, as I outlined yesterday, and \ntheir unions have been fighting to ensure fair treatment for them. \nVirtually every major union has concluded that this bill does not meet \nthe needs of their workers: The AFL-CIO, the Change to Win Federation, \nSteelworkers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Laborers \nInternational, and on and on.\n  Beyond unions, most small- and medium-sized businesses oppose this \nbill, as do the vast majority of insurance companies. They know it will \nnot work.\n  This bill deprives victims of their legal rights and replaces the \ntort system with a trust fund that is doomed to failure. Experts who \nhave reviewed the bill conclude that the trust fund will be underfunded \nand will quickly become insolvent.\n  This morning, the Bates White Research Firm, a prominent, eminent \nconsulting firm offering services to Fortune 500 companies and \ngovernment agencies--Dr. Bates developed a computer model of the \nincidence of asbestos-related diseases. Without going into their \nresume, I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Bates White\n\n       Bates White, LLC (Bates White) is a national consulting \n     firm offering services in economics, finance, and business \n     analytics to leading law firms, FORTUNE 500 companies, and \n     government agencies.\n       Their Environmental & Product Liability (EPL) practice \n     offers economic consulting, litigation support, class \n     certification, and liability estimation services. The \n     business is based on the use of analytical tools to help \n     clients understand and quantify potential liabilities. They \n     have extensive experience in asbestos and provide expert \n     testimony in both bankruptcy and coverage litigation, as well \n     as expert opinions with regard to insurance valuation, due \n     diligence evaluations, and financial reporting services. \n     Through the course of this work, Bates White has seen claims \n     data from numerous defendants and insurance companies. The \n     knowledge gained across all of those matters has been \n     invaluable in assessing the financial viability of S. 852.\n       As part of our work in asbestos-related matters, Bates \n     White has led the development of several highly \n     sophisticated, customized analytical tools that estimate \n     clients' future asbestos liability from personal injury and \n     property damage lawsuits. In the early 1990s, Dr. Charles \n     Bates developed a computer model of the incidence of \n     asbestos-related malignant diseases. Over the years, Bates \n     White has performed ongoing research to improve this model. \n     This state-of-the-art model became the industry standard. \n     More recently, Bates White has pioneered research on the \n     recruitment of non-malignant claimants, and challenged \n     epidemiological-based forecasts of future non-malignant \n     claims.\n       In addition to research on asbestos matters, Bates White \n     has analyzed the historical U.S. usage of tobacco from 1920 \n     through 2002. This research provides us the smoking history \n     of potential lung cancer patients who could qualify under S. \n     852.\n\n  Mr. REID. They found that the CBO underestimated the number of cancer \nvictims who will likely file claims with the fund. Based on this and \nother factors, Bates White concluded that the real cost estimate for \nthe trust fund should be double what it now is.\n  During floor debate this morning, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, explained \nwhat will\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nhappen if the trust fund runs out of money. He said:\n\n       We have within the structure of the bill a vision that the \n     administrator can make a reevaluation going through certain \n     preconditions so if it looks like we will exceed the $140 \n     billion we can make modifications in medical standards and \n     criteria and stay within the $140 billion.\n\n  In other words, if the fund runs short, fewer victims are eligible or \nthose who are eligible will get less money. So there are real \nconsequences to this underfunded trust fund. It will hurt victims. The \nonly alternative is that taxpayers will be left to fund the shortfall.\n  Even if the trust fund was adequately funded, the claim system \nestablished by the FAIR Act is fraught with defects that would prevent \nmany victims from recovering what they deserve.\n  First, startup provisions are unfair. As soon as the bill is enacted, \nthe ability of asbestos victims to claim compensation in the court \nsystem is cut off. There is no better example of this than what happens \nto veterans. Also, the bankruptcy court trust funds that are now \ncompensating victims will be shut down, depriving victims of needed \ncompensation.\n  Second, the bill is unfair to victims with pending or settled court \ncases. Rather than permit asbestos claims to continue in court while \nthe fund is being established, the bill imposes an immediate 2-year \nstay of nearly all asbestos cases. The bill's language is so broad that \na trial about to begin would be stopped and an appellate ruling about \nto be handed down would be barred.\n  Third, the sunset process under the legislation leaves too much \nuncertainty. If the fund fails to operate as promised, instead of \nallowing victims to return to court, this legislation allows the \nadministrator of the fund to allow or recommend any number of measures \nhe feels important to salvage the program. As Senator Specter said this \nmorning, this means that fewer victims may recover.\n  Fourth, the bill requires some victims to prove that asbestos was a \n``substantial contributing factor'' to their disease, a higher burden \nthan victims must meet in court, where it is sufficient to show that \nasbestos exposure was a contributing factor, no matter how substantial \na factor.\n  I want to make sure Senator Specter has time to complete his \nstatement, so I ask the time for the vote, which is now set for 6 \no'clock, not begin at that time so Senator Specter is allowed time to \nfinish his statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the result of the Senator \nusing his leader time.\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure the Senator from Pennsylvania \nunderstood that.\n  The whole concept of no-fault trust fund is that it is \nnonadversarial, but the higher burden of proof creates the very likely \npotential for endless litigation and a high number of rejected cases.\n  These are a few of the problems that make the FAIR Act--and again, as \nI said yesterday, the FAIR Act? We should be used to these Orwellian \nterms after naming legislation ``Leave No Child Behind,'' ``The Clear \nSkies Initiative,'' ``Healthy Forests,'' ``Budget Deficit Reduction \nAct,'' all of which do the opposite of what they say. It is my opinion, \nto which I am entitled, that the FAIR Act is part of that, again.\n  I have always favored improvements in the way asbestos victims were \ncompensated. This bill does not accomplish that goal.\n  We have heard a lost talk about the managers' amendment to this bill. \nApparently, the sponsors are telling Senators that we will take care of \nyour concerns in the managers' amendment. The problem with this \napproach is that no one except the sponsors can know how the pieces of \nthe managers' amendment will fit together. Since the sponsors are \ntrying to satisfy Senators with conflicting concerns, there is every \nreason to believe that different elements of the managers' amendment \nwill move in different directions.\n  For example, one Senator may want to expand eligibility under the \ntrust fund for compensating asbestos victims. A different Senator may \nwant to limit the amount of money paid into the trust fund. The first \npart of the managers' amendment may expand the number of victims, but \nthe second part may limit the amount of money available to all victims. \nBoth Senators may have their language included, but the final result \nmay be completely unworkable and unsatisfactory.\n  This is not the right way to legislate. These amendments should be \noffered individually so that all Senators can evaluate them on their \nindividual merits, and after all the amendments are offered and voted \non, Members can evaluate the total product when they vote on final \npassage. Certainly, Members should not commit their support to the \nfinal bill until they see how the conflicting pieces to the managers' \namendment fit together.\n  I believe it has been good for the Senate to spend time debating the \nmotion to proceed. We focused attention on what some believe are flaws \nin the process leading to the Senate consideration of the bill and the \nflaws of the bill itself. Now we are ready to debate the bill on its \nmerits. I welcome that debate.\n  I offered to vitiate this vote and begin consideration of amendments \nto the bill on Thursday. This was rejected. I will now support cloture \nand encourage Senators to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Nevada has spoken \nfor 18 minutes, taking some leader time, and the 10 minutes allocated \nunder the unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent Senator McConnell \nand I may be accorded the same amount of time.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. That is together, not individually--not 36 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mr. REID. No problem.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I yielded the floor as 5:40 arrived, \nI was in the middle of commenting about the work which the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, and I had done on this \nbill and the spirit of collegiality and the spirit of bipartisanship \nwhich has characterized the work of the Judiciary Committee the past 13 \nmonths.\n  Senator Leahy and I have worked together as ranking member and as \nchairman. This bill represents very substantial work and analysis as to \nhow we have gotten there.\n\n  When the Senator from Nevada talks about the debate being useful up \nto the present time, I tabulate three Senators who spoke in opposition \nto the bill. And a good bit of what they have had to say is in error \nfactually on the merits.\n  This bill has been subjected to more analysis, more discussions--I \nwas saying before I yielded the floor when time had arrived for the \nminority leader--than any bill in the history of legislation. I \nacknowledge that as a very grandiose statement because I do not know \nall of the legislative bills that have been considered in the history \nof the legislative process. But I make that assertion based upon what \nhas been done, which I detailed yesterday, with Judge Becker, a senior \nFederal judge, and I hosting some 36 meetings, attended by 20, 30, 40, \nsometimes as many as 60 people, and the numerous meetings which Judge \nBecker has had on a volunteer basis, and the many meetings I have had \nwith individual Senators.\n  I have talked to many Senators, several dozen Senators, perhaps a \nmajority of the Senators, on an individual basis, either visiting in \ntheir offices or on the Senate floor or in the corridors, in order to \nacquaint Senators with what is going on.\n  The assertions which have been made simply are not factual. I am \npleased to note the Senator from Nevada has stated his intention to \nvote for cloture and that we are going to be going on to debate the \nbill on the merits. Yesterday, the Senator from Nevada was more than \nfirm in his opposition to the bill. And I think it fair to say I was at \nleast equally firm in what I had to say by way of response. But there \nare the votes present without the vote of the Senator from Nevada to \ninvoke cloture and to proceed to a discussion on the merits. When we do \nproceed to a discussion on the merits, we will have a chance to answer \nin detail the misunderstandings which have been articulated in the \ndebate so far.\n  One Senator who spoke in opposition to the bill talked about secrecy, \nthat\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\nnobody knew who was going to pay the money. The language--there was a \nquote--``contained in a secret list known only to the asbestos study \ngroup. . . .'' ``None of the relevant information has ever been made \npublic.'' Well, factually that is just not correct.\n  The Judiciary Committee had to issue a subpoena, but we know who is \npaying how much money. That is a matter that can be looked at by \nSenators or by their staffs. But it has been retained on a confidential \nbasis because there could be a problem for the companies if these \nfactors were disclosed.\n  Then another comment made by one of the three Senators who spoke in \nopposition to the bill, that the ``United States Government will be \nmaking a commitment to compensate hundreds of thousands of seriously \nill asbestos victims. . . .'' Well, that is factually just not correct.\n  This bill is airtight that the Federal Government has no financial \nobligation, and that if there is an effort to impose a budget point of \norder, and it is considered on the merits, that it will not impede the \nmovement of this bill forward. The budget point of order will not be \nsustained because there is no Federal money. Technically, it goes \nthrough the Department of Labor, so it is calculated as a Federal \nexpenditure, but there is no Federal money involved.\n  The Senator from Nevada has gone through a list of objections he has, \nand as we are now moving to debate--after this evening's vote--the bill \non the merits, we will have a chance to explore those in detail.\n  When the Senator from Nevada talks about Foster Wheeler, \nillustratively, I personally have met with Foster Wheeler on a number \nof occasions, as recently as 10 days ago. And we are still seeing if we \ncan accommodate the concerns of Foster Wheeler.\n  We have gone a long way to see to it that companies will not be \nadversely affected financially, on exclusion of small business, a \nmatter detailed at some length by Senator Feinstein in her comments on \nthe floor today, and on a hardship fund of some $300 million a year, \nand by an amendment which we are in the final stages of negotiation to \nlimit the amount of money that companies with lesser gross revenues \nwill have to pay, all of which is directed----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is not in order.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not going to ask for any additional time, Mr. \nPresident, because of the interruptions and the disorder--all of which \nis directed--to finish my sentence--to the companies which sustained \nfinancial hardship.\n  I made a repeated offer, yesterday and today, in speaking about the \nbill, inviting any Senator who has a constituent who has a problem to \ncome talk to us. We will try to work to a solution of the problem. And \nyou do not have to have a Senator if you are a constituent. If anybody \nis watching these proceedings on C-SPAN2, come to my office. My staff \nand I, Senator Leahy and his staff, and the Judiciary Committee \ngenerally, will try to find an accommodation and an answer.\n  The Senator from Vermont is back on the floor. I am glad he has come \nback because I wanted to make this comment about the bipartisanship of \nthe Judiciary Committee, what we have accomplished, as a sign for what \nthis body can do.\n  It is an open secret that the rancor and the partisanship and the \nbickering is at an all-time high in the Senate--an all-time high. And \nthere is much talk about the good old days when there was comity and \nthere was collegiality in the Senate.\n  Well, Senator Leahy and I have restored that to the Judiciary \nCommittee. And we have produced this bipartisan bill on asbestos \nreform. We do not make any representation that it is a perfect bill or \nthat it is a bill which cannot be improved. We are open for business to \nimprove and change the bill.\n  But that brings me to a New York Times editorial which I think is of \nnote as to what Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter have accomplished with our \ncommittee and what this body can accomplish. This is what the New York \nTimes had to say. In a complimentary line, they refer to the assiduous \neffort that Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter made, and then say: That makes \nit a 21st-century rarity: a thoughtful bipartisan compromise on a \nvexing national problem.\n\n  I think it is a sad day for the Senate, a very sad day, when it is a \n21st century rarity that there is a thoughtful, bipartisan compromise \non a vexing national problem.\n  We have a great many vexing national problems. I believe they can be \nsolved on a bipartisan effort so it does not become a 21st century \nrarity. I am glad to see that however we have gotten there, that the \nvotes were present by mid-afternoon to shut off this filibuster and \nthat we can now go forward to debate on the merits so the American \npeople can see our analysis of the problems and our proposed solutions \nand our openness to modifications to produce the best possible bill \nbecause the system which we have at the present time is an anathema and \na travesty and unworthy of the American judicial system.\n  I thank the Chair and yield to my distinguished colleague, the \nassistant majority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are about to have the cloture vote, \nand it is going to take a minute to thank Senator Specter and Senator \nLeahy for this extraordinary compliment from the New York Times. I do \nnot think it is an experience the Senator from Kentucky has ever had.\n  This cloture vote is going to be approved. We learned about an hour \nago that the Democratic leader has decided to support the cloture vote, \nand I think that is good. We would prefer to have been on this bill \nlast Friday. Senator Specter was here and ready to work, ready to \nprocess amendments last Friday. But here we are on Tuesday night.\n  So let me say I think it is good for the Senate that this cloture is \ngoing to be invoked. We are ready to get on the bill. I heard the \nDemocratic leader offer to begin tomorrow. I think that is a good idea. \nSenator Specter will be here in the hopes that amendments will be \noffered and processed. We are prepared to deal with that tomorrow and \nthrough the days until we can reach a point of conclusion.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not know how much time I have remaining, but \nso that we may move forward and vote, I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Chair lays before the Senate the \npending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 131, S. 852: A bill to create a fair \n     and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Arlen Specter, Jeff Sessions, Pat Roberts, \n           Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, Johnny Isakson, \n           Richard M.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \nAct of 2005, shall be brought to a close?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, although I voted to proceed to \nthe bill I have strong concerns with this legislation.\n  I am concerned that this bill will take away the rights of asbestos \nvictims to have their day in court while providing no guarantees that \nthey will receive fair and prompt compensation. This bill and its \npayment structure could bankrupt small businesses, with many of them \nshouldering a larger financial burden under the bill then they \ncurrently do in the court system. Many of these small businesses are \nnot the evildoers here, but due to the payment structure of the bill, \nthey will find themselves shouldering a large portion of the liability.\n  I support the concept of a nonadversarial process to provide \ncompensation to victims but a process that is fair to all the parties \ninvolved. I believe that this bill falls short, and while I voted for \ncloture I intend to vote against final passage of this bill unless \nsignificant changes are made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S766-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FUNERAL OF CORETTA SCOTT KING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be closing down \nfor the evening. But I did want to comment very briefly upon the \nwonderful experience that I and nine other of our colleagues had over \nthe course of today as we attended the funeral of Coretta Scott King at \nthe New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, down right just outside of \nAtlanta.\n  We had a bipartisan delegation that left early this morning, joined \nby a House delegation, joined also, as most people know, by the \nPresident and the First Lady and three prior Presidents, for what was, \nindeed, a memorial service in many ways but, in truth, a great \ncelebration for a great woman. She leaves a legacy of leading with \ngrace. Few people have ever had the opportunity of knowing someone like \nthat. That was reflected in many comments over the course of the day at \nthe funeral.\n  As a wife, as a mother, as a civil rights leader, Mrs. King joins \nthis large pantheon of great Americans whose courage and whose dignity, \nwhose boldness, whose tireless pursuit of social justice transformed \nnot only a generation but the dreams and expectations of generations to \nfollow. Over the course of the statements and having the opportunity to \ncirculate among people who attended, the real global impact of this \nwoman, as I said, leading by grace, focused on freedom and opportunity \nand social justice, was so apparent.\n  Born in April of 1927 on a family farm down in Marion, AL, she grew \nup during the Depression in the segregated South and early on \nexperienced firsthand the unfairness and the racial injustice that had \ncoursed through American life.\n  As a child--and we learned through many stories over the course of \ntoday--she would walk miles every day to attend a poor, one-room \nelementary school where her neighbors, White neighbors, road the bus in \ncomfort to an all-White school that was close by. She was walking 5 \nmiles a day.\n  But as Coretta herself would say in later years, before she was a \nKing, she was a Scott, Coretta Scott King. As a Scott growing up in \nsegregated Alabama, her parents taught her strength, taught her \nboldness, sharing that wisdom with her. It was this strength translated \nthrough great dignity over the course of her life that came to define \nher and to radiate from her from the very beginning and throughout her \nlife.\n  There was much discussion and reflection on her faith, her inate \nstrength and graciousness, all of which supported her through times, as \nmany of the speakers and presenters today talked about, of \nextraordinary trials and suffering.\n  Today, while millions of people around the world watched, there were \nfour U.S. Presidents, I believe there were 13 colleagues--14 Senators, \n13 of my colleagues--dozens of Congressmen, clergy, community leaders, \nthousands of admirers, people from around the world, from South Africa, \nwho spoke today, also celebrating the life and contributions of Coretta \nScott King, the first lady of the civil rights movement and, as we \nheard from South Africa, the first international lady of the civil \nrights movement.\n  I think all of us who went, and many people who shared this service \non their televisions today, were humbled by her example. You can't help \nbut to be lifted by her spirit. Oprah Winfrey observed yesterday at the \nEbenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta--and I did have the opportunity to \nshare one Martin Luther King Day with the King family and with Coretta \nScott King; I believe it was 3 years ago, at the Ebenezer Baptist \nChurch--that the great Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., often preached \nthat Mrs. King, ``leaves us all a better America than the America of \nher childhood.''\n  She leaves behind a tremendous legacy and a great challenge to all of \nus; that is, to lead our lives--and very much the thematic today was a \nreal celebration but what are we all going to be doing tomorrow? Are \nall our thoughts going to be similar to what her thoughts were the day \nafter her husband was assassinated, that bold decision to go up to \nMemphis and to return there 3 days later to be with her people? That as \nwe look ahead, how do we translate all this so that we all look to our \nown lives to be led with courage and with grace and with the boldness \nand dignity that she has shown, and to realize the dream to which she \nand her husband devoted their lives; that one day, one day soon, in \ntheir words, ``this Nation will rise up and live out the true meaning \nof its creed''--``that all men are,'' indeed ``created equal.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S766-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S766-S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ASBESTOS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we had a very important vote today on \nasbestos, and we will be proceeding to that bill tomorrow. It is a bill \nthat I feel passionately about, a bill--as I shared with my colleagues \nwho were with me earlier today in Atlanta at the funeral--that \nreflects, to me, the very best of what this body should be reflecting; \nthat is, compassion for those victims who today are not being \ncompensated, who suffer from asbestos exposure with mesothelioma, with \nlung cancer, with asbestosis; who today are not getting taken care of. \nIn a sense, they are not getting appropriate compensation, just \ncompensation, either in terms of time in which the decisions are made \nor in the amount of resources that are to be directed to them.\n  So now is the time for us to address this important issue. It is a \njobs issue. We talk about 150,000 people who have lost their jobs. We \ntalk about the 77 companies that have gone bankrupt--not as companies \nbut as employers.\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nAnd when they go bankrupt, thousands and thousands of people lose their \npensions and the jobs are lost. Now is our opportunity.\n  Just yesterday, I know there were a lot of statements made by those \non the other side of the aisle that we should stop this bill; it is a \nbad bill; we should not be addressing it and using postponing \nprocedural moves and delay. But we just can't delay anymore.\n  I am delighted with the outcome of the vote today which shows that \nthis body is ready to take up this important issue. We will be going to \nthat issue tomorrow, and I look forward to addressing, through debate \nand amendments, an issue that will have a huge impact on people's lives \nboth right now and well into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SPC Dustin Kendall will be remembered by those who knew him \nas a charming and charismatic young man, who was beloved by his friends \nand family and had a special gift for bringing smiles to the faces of \neveryone he met.\n  Growing up with a brother and four sisters, Specialist Kendall spent \nhis childhood as many children do: playing sports, causing mischief, \nand enjoying the company of his family and friends. As the son of \nmissionaries, he spent his childhood in a variety of places and \nwherever he ended up, his outgoing and friendly nature was sure to \nfollow. These qualities allowed him to make friends quickly and adapt \nto new surroundings, and that was certainly the case when his family \nmoved to Bryant, an Arkansas town just south of Little Rock, in 2002. \nIn Bryant, Specialist Kendall worked at a local restaurant, where he \nbecame a favorite of the regular customers, while he finished his \nschooling. Later, when his parents moved to Europe to continue their \nmissionary work, he stayed in Arkansas to continue classes at the \nUniversity of Central Arkansas in nearby Conway. At UCA, he studied \nbusiness but was considering following one of his passions and pursuing \na career in golf, possibly in golf-course design.\n  As a student, Specialist Kendall joined the U.S. Army Reserve for \nprimarily financial reasons but, over time, came to enjoy his military \nlife and was ultimately considering a career in the Army. Upon signing \nup for active duty last summer, he was stationed at Fort Carson, CO, \nbefore being deployed with his unit to Iraq in November of 2005. In \nIraq, Specialist Kendall served with the 68th Armor Regiment of the 3rd \nHeavy Brigade Combat Team, where he served with distinction, most \nrecently as a bodyguard for an Army colonel. Tragically, he was killed \non January 15 in Baqouba, Iraq, when his military humvee was \naccidentally struck by an American Abrams tank. He was 21 years old.\n  A memorial service was held for Specialist Kendall on January 21, in \nSummerville, SC. Many of his friends and his family gathered to \nremember the charming young man with the infectious smile and to honor \nthe brave soldier who had given his life in the fight for freedom. \nAlthough words cannot convey the sorrow felt by his loved ones, I hope \nthey may find some solace remembering the way he lived his life and \nknowing that he touched the lives of so many others. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his parents, Brandi Lee and Penelope Jean, his \nbrother and his sisters, and to all those who knew and loved him. His \ntime with us was far too short but his spirit will live on in us \nforever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S767-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In February, 2004 in Durham, NC, Sean Ethan Owen, a 23-year-old gay \nman, was shot to death. According to police, three men wanted to steal \na car and targeted Owen on a gay chat line. They then coaxed Owen to \nmeet them for a date, then beat him, shot him, and threw him into the \nEno River.\n  Matthew Lawrence Taylor, Shelton Deangelo Epps, and Derrick Arness \nMaiden beat their victim before attempting to rob him of anything. \nAccording to pathologists, Owen probably died relatively slowly by \ndrowning in the river.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S767-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             POSTAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in a colloquy \nregarding a provision contained within the manager's amendment to S. \n662, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.\n  The manager's amendment offered by Senator Collins changes the \nlanguage of section 3622 concerning rate and service complaints that \nare brought to the Postal Regulatory Commission. I ask the Senator to \nexplain the purpose and intent of this change. I particularly want to \nbe sure that this amendment to the bill is not intended to, and does \nnot deprive the Postal Regulatory Commission of its power to consider \ncomplaints relating to rates and the provision of postal services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the gentleman from Missouri. He is correct. The \namendment I propose to section 3622 does not and is not intended to \npreclude any interested party from securing a hearing before the Postal \nRegulatory Commission if it believes that the rates being charged or \nthe manner in which services being provided to that mailer or mailer \ngroup violates the act. It is my hope that in conference that we can \nwork to assure that the Postal Regulatory Commission does not become \nembroiled in attempts to resolve disputes as to internal affairs or \npurely operational decisions of the Postal Service. This provision is \nintended to protect the rights of the mailing public against the \npotential for monopoly abuse or other unjust or unfair conduct by the \nPostal Service in terms of rates charged or the nature of service \nprovided.\n  Mr. BOND.

At the time of his death, Bill \nwas on a voluntary, temporary assignment with the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency helping with the relief efforts in the gulf coast \nregion that was devastated by hurricanes this last season.\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\n  Bill was successful in many endeavors. While in Aberdeen he \ntransitioned a small office to a large weather forecasting site \nresponsible for providing severe weather warnings to 28 counties. One \nof Bill's most notable accomplishments was founding the ``Women in \nScience'' conference. This conference introduces high-school aged girls \nto the many exciting career opportunities available in the science \nfield. Bill started this conference in 2002 with only one class held in \nAberdeen. This year the conference will be held in five different \nlocations around the State of South Dakota.\n  Bill Tallman was a retired Air Force major, having served 20 years in \nthe Air Force as a meteorologist. Bill also taught high school math \nbefore enlisting in the service. He is survived by his wife Julie; two \nchildren, Jeff and Sarah; four grandchildren; his mother, three \nbrothers, and two sisters.

A bill to eliminate the requirement that States collect \nSocial Security numbers from applicants for recreational licenses; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Sportsmen's \nPrivacy Protection Act'' to address a number or privacy concerns I have \nheard from my constituents. When I worked with my colleagues to pass \nthe 1996 welfare reform law, we made sure that we created a system to \nhold parents accountable for supporting their children. A provision \nincluded in that law obligated States to implement new requirements to \nencourage payment of child support that cross-referenced Social \nSecurity Numbers of applicants for drivers' licenses, professional \nlicenses, occupational licenses and recreational licenses. States that \nfailed to implement these requirements would have faced the loss of \nFederal welfare funding.\n  Under current state law, Pennsylvania is required to revoke or deny \nrecreational licenses, including hunting and fishing licenses of \nparents who are behind on child support payments. As a result, any \nindividual that applies or renews a driver's, occupational or \nrecreational license must include their Social Security Number on their \napplication form. And it is the application that is the problem. In \nPennsylvania and many other States, the drivers', professional and \noccupational records are automated or computerized, while the \nrecreational licenses remain in a paper book often with multiple \nentries on a page. In my view, there are significant privacy concerns \nto continuing this provision as it relates to recreational licenses \nsuch as hunting and fishing.\n  In preparing this bill we asked the Congressional Research Service, \nCRS, about the effectiveness of this provision. CRS spoke with the \nPennsylvania Child Support Program, PACSP, regarding the effectiveness \nof retracting or denying individuals hunting and fishing licensees. CRS \nindicated to my staff that there have been very few instances where \nindividuals have been denied hunting and fishing licenses for falling \nbehind in child support payments. In the overwhelming majority of the \ninstances where they have been denied, the custodial parent will tip-\noff PACSP of the non-custodial parent's interest in obtaining a hunting \nand fishing license. PACSP can then notify the PA Hunting and Gaming \nCommission to deny the non-custodial parent a license.\n  I have heard from a lot of hunters about their legitimate concerns in \ngiving their Social Security Number when applying for a hunting \nlicense. This bill will repeal the Federal mandate that requires States \nto collect Social Security Numbers for recreational licenses. The \nrequirement for drivers', professional and occupational licenses would \nremain in place. My home State colleague, Representative English, has \nintroduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation that restores the \nprivacy rights of recreational hunters and fisherman, while maintaining \nan effective system of child support enforcement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2250. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Dr. Norman E. \nBorlaug; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am calling upon Congress to honor Dr. \nNorman E. Borlaug, the man of whom it is often said ``has saved more \nlives than any other person who has ever lived,'' with the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  Dr. Borlaug is commonly known in the agricultural world and beyond as \nthe father of the Green Revolution. His accomplishments in terms of \nbringing radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity are \nwithout parallel.\n  Named by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 most influential minds of \nthe 20th Century, Norman E. Borlaug is one of the great stories of our \ntime. Norm, as he is known to all who work with him, was born in 1914 \nto Norwegian-American parents outside the town of Cresco in northeast \nIowa near the Iowa/Minnesota border. His boyhood was spent on a Norman \nRockwellesque farm and in a one-room schoolhouse. Eventually Norm found \nhis way to the University of Minnesota where he became a star in Big \nTen Wrestling and earned a Ph.D. in Plant Pathology.\n  Following World War II, he spent 20 years working in the poorest \nareas of rural Mexico. It was there that Dr. Borlaug made his \nbreakthrough achievement in developing a strand of wheat that could \nexponentially increase yields while actively resisting disease.\n  With the strong support of the governments involved, Dr. Borlaug's \nGreen Revolution uplifted hundreds of thousands of the rural poor in \nMexico and saved hundreds of millions from famine and outright \nstarvation in India and Pakistan. His approach to wheat production next \nspread throughout the Middle East and was then adapted to rice growing, \nincreasing the number of lives saved to more than one billion people.\n  In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the only \nperson working in agriculture to ever be so honored, for a lifetime of \nwork to feed a hungry world. Since then, he has received numerous \nhonors and awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, The \nNational Academy of Sciences' highest honor--the Public Service Medal, \nand the Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace.\n\n  At age 91, Dr. Borlaug continues to alleviate poverty and \nmalnutrition. He currently serves as president of Sasakawa Global 2000 \nAfrica Project, which seeks to extend the benefits of agricultural \ndevelopment to the 800 million people still mired in poverty and \nmalnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Finally, Dr. Borlaug continues as Chairman of the Council of Advisors\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\nfor the World Food Prize, an organization he created in 1986 to be the \n``Nobel Prize for Food and Agriculture''.\n  The World Food Prize presents $250,000 award each October at an \ninternational ceremony in Des Moines, IA, to the Laureate who has made \nan exceptional achievement similar to Dr. Borlaug's breakthrough forty \nyears ago. Beyond recognizing these people for their personal \naccomplishments, Borlaug saw the World Food Prize as a means of \nestablishing role models who would inspire others.\n  In the 20 years of its existence, the World Food Prize has honored \nLaureates from Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, Denmark, Sierra Leone, \nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n  While Dr. Borlaug was born in Iowa, he is truly a citizen of all of \nAmerica and, indeed, of all the world. The State of Minnesota has \nenacted a special day of recognition in his honor; He continues as a \nteacher, serving as a Distinguished Professor at Texas A University; \nand he has received honorary degrees from colleges and universities in \nvirtually every state of the union.\n  Reflecting this fact, a year ago the U.S. Senate passed a resolution \ndesignating October 16 as World Food Prize Day in America in honor of \nDr. Borlaug. Beyond that, his name is widely recognized in Mexico, \nIndia, Pakistan and the Middle East reflecting his great humanitarian \nachievements in those countries. And he continues to be honored \nthroughout South Asia and Africa, for his ongoing efforts to expand the \nbenefits of the Green Revolution to the hundreds of millions of people \nstill suffering from chronic hunger and malnutrition.\n  Dr. Borlaug's achievements are in keeping with the recent \npresentation of Congressional Gold Medals.\n  For over a half century, the scientific and humanitarian achievements \nof Dr. Norman E. Borlaug have kept starvation at bay for millions of \npeople in third world countries. Through the passage of this \nlegislation, the United States Senate can recognize the humanitarian \ncontributions Dr. Borlaug has made to the entire world. The man who has \nsaved more lives than any other person who has ever lived certainly \ndeserves the highest honor the Congress can bestow.\n  As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, I am proud and honored \nto introduce this important bill, and I call upon my colleagues to \nsupport this noble legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Tribute to Dr. \n     Norman E. Borlaug Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was born in Iowa where he grew \n     up on a family farm, and received his primary and secondary \n     education.\n       (2) Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota where \n     he received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees and was also a star \n     NCAA wrestler.\n       (3) For the past 20 years, Dr. Borlaug has lived in Texas \n     where he is a member of the faculty of Texas A University.\n       (4) Dr. Borlaug also serves as President of the Sasakawa \n     Africa Association.\n       (5) Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments in terms of bringing \n     radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity \n     are without parallel.\n       (6) In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Dr. Borlaug \n     spent 20 years working in the poorest areas of rural Mexico. \n     It was there that Dr. Borlaug made his breakthrough \n     achievement in developing a strand of wheat that could \n     exponentially increase yields while actively resisting \n     disease.\n       (7) With the active support of the governments involved, \n     Dr. Borlaug's ``green revolution'' uplifted hundreds of \n     thousands of the rural poor in Mexico and saved hundreds of \n     millions from famine and outright starvation in India and \n     Pakistan.\n       (8) Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat production next spread \n     throughout the Middle East. Soon thereafter his approach was \n     adapted to rice growing, increasing the number of lives Dr. \n     Borlaug has saved to more than a billion people.\n       (9) In 1970, Dr. Borlaug received the Nobel Prize, the only \n     person working in agriculture to ever be so honored. Since \n     then he has received numerous honors and awards including the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Public Service Medal, the \n     National Academy of Sciences' highest honor, and the Rotary \n     International Award for World Understanding and Peace.\n       (10) At age 91, Dr. Borlaug continues to work to alleviate \n     poverty and malnutrition. He currently serves as president of \n     Sasakawa Global 2000 Africa Project, which seeks to extend \n     the benefits of agricultural development to the 800,000,000 \n     people still mired in poverty and malnutrition in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n       (11) Dr. Borlaug continues to serve as Chairman of the \n     Council of Advisors of the World Food Prize, an organization \n     he created in 1986 to be the ``Nobel Prize for Food and \n     Agriculture'' and which presents a $250,000 prize each \n     October at a Ceremony in Des Moines, Iowa, to the Laureate \n     who has made an exceptional achievement similar to Dr. \n     Borlaug's breakthrough 40 years ago. In the almost 20 years \n     of its existence, the World Food Prize has honored Laureates \n     from Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, Denmark, Sierra Leone, \n     Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n       (12) Dr. Borlaug has saved more lives than any other person \n     who has ever lived, and likely has saved more lives in the \n     Islamic world than any other human being in history.\n       (13) Due to a lifetime of work that has led to the saving \n     and preservation of an untold amount of lives, Dr. Norman E. \n     Borlaug is deserving of America's highest civilian award: the \n     congressional gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President Pro Tempore of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     are authorized to make appropriate arrangements for the \n     presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of \n     appropriate design, to Dr. Norman E.

A bill to designate the National Museum of Wildlife Art, \nlocated at 2820 Rungius Road, Jackson, Wyoming, as the National Museum \nof Wildlife of the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am privileged to introduce a bill today \nthat provides a national designation to the National Museum of Wildlife \nArt in Jackson, WY. As it should, a national designation signifies \nsomething unique that belongs to all the people of our Nation. Just as \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt recognized the uniqueness of Devils Tower \nin Wyoming when he proclaimed it to be the first national monument, my \nbill recognizes the uniqueness of the National Museum of Wildlife Art \nin Jackson, WY. Wildlife museums are not unusual in the United States. \nArt museums are not unusual in the United States. This museum, however, \nsets itself apart from all the others as it focuses on wildlife art. \nThis interdisciplinary approach fosters education as the museum uses \nart to teach people about wildlife and encourages wildlife lovers to \nexplore art. The museum's educational focus is clear in their motto \n``bringing people, wildlife and fine art together.''\n  The person responsible for bringing National Museum of Wildlife Art \nto my attention is Margaret, Maggie, Webster Scarlett. Given her \ninvolvement and accomplishments in the museum world, Maggie knows a \nworthy museum when she sees it. In 2002, the Senate confirmed Maggie as \na member of the National Museum and Library Services\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nBoard. This 24-member advisory body includes 20 Presidentially \nappointed and Senate-confirmed members of the general public who have \ndemonstrated expertise in, or commitment to, library or museum \nservices. She also is currently a member and past president of the \nboard of trustees of the National Museum of Wildlife Art.\n  The National Museum of Wildlife Art was founded in 1987 with a \nprivate gift of a collection of art and is accredited with the American \nAssociation of Museums. The National Museum of Wildlife Art features a \ncollection of over 2,000 pieces of art portraying wildlife. Dating from \n2000 B.C. to the present, the collection chronicles much of the history \nof wildlife in art, focusing primarily on European and American \npainting and sculpture. The collection of American art from the 19th \nand 20th centuries is particularly strong, recording European \nexploration of the American West. Many of these works predate \nphotography, making them vital representations of the frontier era in \nthe history of the United States.\n  Using the collection as a base, the central themes to the museum's \nprogramming are connections between people, wildlife, and fine art. \nEven before this designation, people from across the United States had \ndiscovered the National Museum of Wildlife Art. Since its inception, it \nhas become an American West destination attraction with an annual \nattendance of 92,000 visitors from all over the world and an award-\nwinning Web site that receives more than 10,000 visits per week.\n  These visitors find wildlife on the walls of the museum but also \noutside of its doors. The National Museum of Wildlife Art is housed in \nan architecturally significant and award-winning 51,000 square foot \nfacility that overlooks the 28,000 acre National Elk Refuge and is \nadjacent to the Grand Teton National Park. The museum displays and \ninterprets this wildlife art in one of the few remaining areas of the \nUnited States where native wildlife roams abundantly.\n  The works in the museum are united by their subject and their \nquality. The permanent collection of the National Museum of Wildlife \nArt has grown to more than 3,000 works by important historic American \nartists including Edward Hicks, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Charles M. \nRussell, William Merritt Chase, and Alexander Calder, as well as \ncontemporary American artists Steve Kestrel, Bart Walter, Nancy Howe, \nJohn Nieto, Jamie Wyeth, and others.\n  The National Museum of Wildlife Art seeks to educate a diverse \naudience through collecting fine art focused on wildlife, presenting \nexceptional exhibitions, providing community, regional, national, and \ninternational outreach, and presenting extensive educational \nprogramming for adults and children. A national designation presents a \ngreat opportunity to use the invaluable resources of the National \nMuseum of Wildlife Art to teach the Nation's school children, through \non-site visits, traveling exhibits, classroom curriculum, on-line \ndistance learning, and other educational initiatives.\n  I look forward to officially recognizing the renown of the National \nMuseum of Wildlife Art through this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Talent, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 2253. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to offer the \n181 Area of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas leasing; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill to direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to hold a lease sale within one year in the \narea known as 181. This bill does not in any way alter the moratorium \nlaw on the OCS. The areas covered under this bill are not under \nexecutive or congressional moratorium. Furthermore, this bill protects \na 100 mile buffer from the coastline of the State of Florida and it \nprotects the prerogative of the United States armed forces to perform \nmilitary activities in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. These protections \nare explicit in the bill and can not be disputed.\n  But more than that, this bill seeks to protect the American people \nfrom the rising cost of heating their homes. Only six years ago, the \nprice of natural gas in the U.S. was $2 per million btu. In the past \nfew months, we have witnessed the price of natural gas rise above as \nmuch as $14 per million btu. This morning, amidst a winter of above-\naverage temperatures throughout much of the United States, the price of \nnatural gas was over $8 per million btu. In countries competing for our \njobs, the price of the same commodity is substantially cheaper than \nthat, in some cases one or two dollars per million btu. This increase \nin cost and volatility in the price of natural gas in the United States \nshould have the immediate attention of our Nation's policy makers.\n  The effects of the rising price of natural gas cut across every major \nsector of our Nation's economy. Natural gas is used as a major source \nfor electricity generation, home heating, cooling and cooking, and as \nan essential feedstock for the production of ammonia for use in \nfertilizer production. It is necessary to the manufacturing of fabrics, \nglass, steel, plastics and paint. In short, affordable natural gas is \nof relevance to every region and each State in this country and it is \nessential to maintaining our Nation's long-term sustained economic \ngrowth. Think of the one-two punch that will be dealt to the American \nconsumer if the U.S. housing market fails to sustain its unprecedented \ngrowth of the last few years and energy costs continue to rise. The \nFederal Reserve estimated that in 2004, the American people had \napproximately $600 billion in their pockets from refinancing and home \nequity loans. But an increasing amount of that money is going right \nback out to pay the added costs of heating those homes. Over a six year \nperiod, America's natural gas bill has risen from $50 billion to $200 \nbillion. That is $150 billion less that the American people have to \nspend, save and invest. And it serves as an additional burden on the \nbusinesses that drive this nation's economy. This burden acts as a tax \non the American people and only serves to stymie growth.\n  With this bill we seek to alleviate some of that burden. We direct \nthe Department of the Interior to lease an area that holds a potential \nof nearly 5 tcf of gas. That is enough natural gas to heat and cool \napproximately five million homes for a period of 15 years. The natural \ngas from this area will have a real, substantial effect on the market \nand thus on the American consumer. Opening up this area will send an \nimmediate signal to the natural gas market that Congress is pushing to \nquickly open up an area for production with great potential for a \nsignificant new supply of natural gas. The area is close to existing \ninfrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and is the best hope for a large \ninfusion of natural gas on the market in the near term.\n  This bill presents a choice between affordable natural gas versus \nburying our heads in the sand while American people foot the bill and \nmanufacturing jobs head overseas. There is certainly bipartisan support \nfor the idea of relieving the energy costs of the American consumer, \nand I think that opening Lease Sale 181 helps us achieve this goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING IN 181 AREA OF GULF \n                   OF MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) 181 area.--The term ``181 Area'' means the area \n     identified in map 15, page 58, of the Proposed Final Outer \n     Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 1997-2002 \n     of the Minerals Management Service.\n       (2) Military mission line.--The term ``Military Mission \n     Line'' means the north-south line at 86 41' W. longitude.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Minerals Management \n     Service.\n       (b) Lease Sale.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     section, the Secretary shall offer the 181 Area for oil and \n     gas leasing pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) as soon as practicable, but not \n     later than 1 year, after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Excluded Areas.--In carrying out subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall not offer for oil and gas leasing--\n       (1) any area east of the Military Mission Line, unless the \n     Secretary of Defense agrees in writing before the area is \n     offered for lease that the area can be developed in a manner \n     that will not interfere with military activities; or\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\n       (2) any area that is within 100 miles of the coastline of \n     the State of Florida.\n       (d) Leasing Program.--The 181 Area shall be offered for \n     lease under this section notwithstanding the omission of the \n     181 Area from any outer Continental Shelf leasing program \n     under section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1344).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the bill \noffered by the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nThis legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to offer \nfor oil and gas lease certain lands within the original Lease Sale 181 \nArea in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. The lease sale is to \nbe conducted within 1 year after the date of enactment of the \nlegislation.\n  The original Lease Sale 181 Area was proposed in 1997 by the Clinton \nadministration after negotiations with the late Governor Lawton Chiles. \nThe area to be leased under the bill includes only a portion of the \noriginal sale area, and does nothing to affect areas currently under \ncongressional moratoria or Presidential withdrawal. No part of the area \nto be leased under the bill is closer than 100 miles from the Florida \ncoastline. The so-called ``stovepipe'' portion of the original lease \nsale area is not included in the area to be leased under the bill. \nLeasing east of the Military Mission line under the bill can occur only \nwith the prior written agreement of the Secretary of Defense that such \narea can be developed in a manner that will not interfere with military \nactivities.\n  The area to be leased under the bill is estimated to contain some \n6.03Tcf of natural gas and 0.93 billion barrels of oil. In this time of \nrecord high oil and gas prices, these energy resources can make a \nsignificant contribution to our domestic energy supply. Much of the \nnecessary energy infrastructure is already in place in this region, so \nproduction can come online and be marketed in the near term.\n  The lease sale is to take place within a year after the date of \nenactment of the provision. This time frame is intended to allow full \ncompliance with all applicable environmental laws. It is our \nexpectation that expeditious, but complete, environmental compliance \nwill be undertaken by the relevant agencies.\n  I regret that large portions of this sale area were previously made \noff limits by the current administration. In 2001, Secretary Norton \nreduced the size of the area to be offered in Lease Sale 181 from 5.9 \nmillion acres to 1.5 million acres. This action took off the table over \n61 percent of the gas resources, some 7 Tcf, and 5-percent of the oil \nresources, about a billion barrels, estimated to be in the original \narea.\n  Directing the Secretary to offer for lease these additional portions \nof the Lease Sale 181 Area is one thing that the Congress can do to \naddress our energy situation in the near term. It is past time to \nproceed with leasing the area that would be made available by the bill. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2254. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out \nrestoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we get few opportunities to help usher \nin visionary projects that can potentially transform communities, both \nof man and of nature. I rise today to talk about such a project--one \nthat has been discussed before on this floor when I helped unveil a \nvision that would rehabilitate and restore New Mexico's Bosque. I \nreturn here today to implement that vision that concerns this long \nneglected treasure of the Southwest.\n  According to an old Chinese Proverb, ``if you are thinking one year \nahead, sow seed. If you are thinking ten years ahead, plant a tree. If \nyou are thinking 100 years ahead, educate the people.'' The bill I am \nintroducing today encompasses the wisdom of that proverb.\n  The Albuquerque metropolitan area is the largest concentration of \npeople in New Mexico. It is also the home to the irreplaceable riparian \nforest which runs through the heart of the city and surrounding towns \nthat is the Bosque. It is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in \nthe Southwest, and one of the last of its kind in the world.\n  Unfortunately, mismanagement, neglect, and the effects of upstream \ndevelopment have severely degraded the Bosque. The list of its woes is \nlong: it has been overrun by non-native vegetation; graffiti and trash \nmar locations along its length; the drought and build up of hazardous \nfuel have contributed to fires. As a result, public access is \nproblematical and crucial habitat for scores of species is threatened.\n  Yet the Middle Rio Grande Bosque remains one of the most biologically \ndiverse ecosystems in the Southwest. My goal is to restore the Bosque \nand create a space that is open and attractive to the public.\n  This is a grand undertaking to be sure; but I want to ensure that \nthis extraordinary corridor of the Southwestern desert is preserved for \ngenerations to come--not only for generations of humans, but for the \ndiverse plant and animal species that reside in the Bosque as well.\n  The rehabilitation of this ecosystem leads to greater protection for \nthreatened and endangered species; it means more migratory birds, \nhealthier habitat for fish, and greater numbers of towering cottonwood \ntrees. This project can increase the quality of life for a city while \nassuring the health and stability of an entire ecosystem. Where trash \nis now strewn, paths and trails will run. Where jetty jacks and \ndiscarded rubble lie, cottonwoods will grow. The dead trees and \nunderbrush that threaten devastating fire will be replaced by healthy \ngroves of trees. School children will be able to study and maybe catch \nsight of a bald eagle. The chance to help build a dynamic public space \nlike this does not come around often, and I would like to see Congress \nembrace that chance on this occasion.\n  Having grown up along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, the Bosque is \nsomething I treasure, and I lament the degradation that has occurred. \nBecause of this, I have been involved in Bosque restoration since 1991, \nand I commend the efforts of groups like the Bosque Coalition for the \nwork they have done, and will continue to do, along the river. I \npropose to build on their efforts with the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  I remain grateful to each of the parties who has been involved with \nthis idea since its inception. Each one contributes a very critical \ncomponent of the project. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District \n(the ``MRGCD\") owns the vital part of the Bosque which runs from the \nNational Hispanic Cultural Center north to the Paseo Del Norte Bridge. \nThe MRGCD has proven to be a valuable local partner that has worked \nwith all parties to provide options on how the Bosque can be preserved, \nprotected and enjoyed by everyone. Additionally, the Army Corps of \nEngineers is developing a preliminary restoration plan for the Bosque \nalong the Albuquerque corridor.\n  My bill authorizes $10 million dollars in Fiscal Year 2007 and such \nsums as are necessary for the following nine years to complete \nprojects, activities, substantial ecosystem restoration, preservation, \nprotection, and recreation facilities along the Middle Rio Grande. I \nurge my fellow members to help preserve this rare and diverse ecosystem \nand to aid the city of Albuquerque and the State of New Mexico in \nbuilding a place to treasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution to designate \nApril\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\n1, 2006, as ``National Asbestos Awareness Day.'' Submitting this \nresolution is one small step in an effort to raise awareness of this \ndangerous substance and the painful effects that exposure to asbestos \nhas caused throughout this country. Last year the Senate unanimously \npassed a similar resolution. It is my hope that designating another \nNational Asbestos Awareness Day will serve as a reminder that exposure \nto asbestos remains a significant problem in this country, asbestos-\ninduced illnesses continue to kill or disable Americans at an alarming \nclip, and our resolve to adequately protect the rights of these victims \nmust not falter.\n  There is no safe level of exposure to asbestos. Despite this fact, \nthe substance still routinely manifests itself in too many work \nenvironments. According to the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA), 1.3 million Americans still face significant \nasbestos exposure in their workplaces. Some estimate that more than \n27.5 million workers have been exposed to asbestos while on the job.\n  We know too well that the effect of exposure can be deadly. Diseases \ncaused by asbestos include cancers of the lung, digestive tract, colon, \nlarynx, esophagus, kidney and some types of lymphoma; pleural disease; \nasbesostis; and, of course, mesothelioma. For many of the more serious, \nasbestos-related diseases, there is no cure.\n  These devastating illnesses take the lives of thirty Americans each \nday and ten thousand Americans each year. Countless others were exposed \nin their neighborhoods, in school yards and at home. Hundreds of \nthousands of men and women have died or become severely ill due to \nasbestos exposure.\n  The cases of disease and death caused by asbestos exposure are not \nabstractions. Real lives are affected and destroyed by this dreadful \nsubstance. I have received countless letters from victims of asbestos-\nrelated diseases and their families. Each one shares another story of \nloss and of pain, of sickness and of tragedy.\n  Adrienne Zapponi of Wellington, NV witnessed firsthand what asbestos \ndoes to the human body. Her husband suffers from asbestos exposure. In \nher letter she wrote, ``[My husband] cannot enjoy a single day of life \nbecause he has 40% lung capacity. This means that he can't walk for any \ndistance, he can't do simple jobs around the house such as mow the \nlawn, he can't remember things such as when to take his medication, he \ncan't drive because he is drowsy and can't concentrate on the road.''\n  Margy Urnberg from Carson City, NV had a father, Ronald Johnson, who \ndied from asbestos exposure. He worked in a vermiculite mine and \nsecond-hand exposure from living in Libby, MT. Alan Reinstein, the \nCofounder and Director of Communications of the Asbestos Disease \nAwareness Organization, is suffering from acute mesothelioma. Alan is \nfighting bravely and has responded to his illness as a call to action.\n  Yesterday I mentioned our brave veterans who have been exposed to \nasbestos, and the difficulty they have encountered in seeking \ncompensation for that exposure. Steven Mitchell served ten years in the \nU.S. Navy as a boiler man. He worked in the engine and boiler rooms on \nseveral ships handling asbestos insulation on a daily basis. After \nleaving the Navy, he returned to work on his family farm raising wheat.\n  Steven was diagnosed with mesothelioma and spent his last days in a \nV.A. Nursing Home. Due to the intense pain, he was constantly \nadministered morphine. Just before he died, he no longer even \nrecognized his daughter.\n  We have seen the case of Philip Schreyer, who began helping his \ncountry with the war effort in 1942 at the Ford Motor Company's Willow \nRun B-24 bomber plant. This plant was producing a bomber an hour during \nits peak operation, and many asbestos products went into each section \nof the bombers. Later that year, Mr. Schreyer joined the Navy serving \nas a radio man aboard the USS Wyoming until 1946. The USS Wyoming shot \noff more rounds than any other ship during War World II. Every time \naround was fired dust would come down off the insulated pipes like \n``snow''. Little did Mr. Schreyer know that this dust falling on him \nwas deadly asbestos.\n  Phil survived World War II, an injury aboard a warship that ended his \nNavy career, and a hunting accident that cost him his leg. He did not \nsurvive asbestos exposure. In 2002 he learned he had mesothelioma and \nwas told by his doctors that he would not survive this disease. The \ndoctors were right. On January 20, 2005, Phil Schreyer, who had \nsurvived so much, lost his final battle with mesothelioma and died.\n  Each one of the ten thousand Americans who will die from asbestos \nexposure this year will have a similar story. Each one will leave \nbehind a family that will never be whole again. Each one is counting on \nus here in the Senate to ensure they have the means necessary to pursue \ntheir rightful claim for the damages asbestos exposure has caused them \nand their families.\n  The so-called FAIR Act will not provide these protections and that is \nwhy I oppose it. As I have explained, this legislation attempts to set \nup an alternative system for recovery that is doomed to failure and \nwill unacceptably impair the rights of victims. We in the Senate need \nto remind ourselves that our best efforts must always be directed \ntoward meeting the needs of victims, and the FAIR Act falls short.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S775-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 369--CONGRATULATING THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION \n  FOR SPONSORING THE 4TH ANNUAL ``GIVE KIDS A SMILE'' PROGRAM, WHICH \nEMPHASIZES THE NEED TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE FOR CHILDREN, AND \n THANKING DENTISTS FOR VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TO HELP PROVIDE NEEDED \n                              DENTAL CARE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \nFeingold) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 355) honoring the service of the \n     National Guard and requesting consultation by the Department \n     of Defense with Congress and the chief executive officers of \n     the States prior to offering proposals to change the National \n     Guard force structure.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \nopportunity to speak on S. Res. 355 regarding the budget for the \nNational Guard, a resolution which Senator Lindsey Graham and I have \ncosponsored.\n  Last week, a total of 75 Senators, including myself, signed a letter \nto Defense Secretary Rumsfeld opposing the plan that proposes changes \nto the standing force structure of the National Guard. This plan has \nraised serious concerns.\n  Senator Frist, the majority leader, said last week on a national \nmorning news program that he would oppose cuts to the National Guard.\n  Nebraska National Guard General Roger Lempke, president of the \nAdjunct Generals Association, has aggressively questioned the proposed \nchanges to the Guard. General Lempke and I share another concern about \nthe Guard; that is, the increasing problem it has with equipment \nshortages as a result of the war, damage, total destruction, and the \nfact that much of the equipment is most likely going to be left in \nIraq.\n  Earlier this year, General Lempke briefed me on equipment shortages \nfaced by the Nebraska National Guard. I learned firsthand that the \nGuard in Nebraska is facing shortages of $35 million in equipment, from \ntrucks to body armor, from humvees to night-vision goggles.\n  This prompted me, along with my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, to \nintroduce a resolution on the National Guard that essentially does two \nthings: First, it asks the Pentagon to fully fund the Guard to restore \nlost and destroyed equipment; second, it seeks consultation with \nCongress and the Nation's Governors on any potential force structure \nchanges. In a briefing today before the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, General Schoomaker assured members he has already begun this \nprocess of talking to the Nation's Governors and seeking more \nconsultation with affected Members of the Congress.\n  This resolution was cleared by the Committee on Armed Services and \nsent to the Senate last week. It has 54 cosponsors, including myself. \nIt is bipartisan. It is direct. I urge my colleagues and the majority \nleader to ensure that this resolution be passed today. We cannot wait \nany longer. We must assure the Department of Defense, that Congress has \nspoken, and that we will be heard on this issue.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 355) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of S. Res. 367 submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 367) congratulating the Pittsburgh \n     Steelers for their victory in Super Bowl XL.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to be here today \nto speak on behalf of a great organization and a great group of men who \naccomplished the heights of their profession. The Pittsburgh Steelers \nwere victorious in Super Bowl XL on Sunday. As I speak right now, there \nis a parade going through downtown Pittsburgh of our warriors, our \nchampions who have brought back the Super Bowl trophy, the Lombardi \ntrophy, to Pittsburgh for the fifth time, which ties a record with the \nSan Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, having won five Super \nBowls.\n  During the 1970s, we won four and got comfortable with the fact that \nPittsburgh was a city of champions, winning both football titles and \ntwo World Series titles in 1972 and 1979; and in 1979 we won both the \nSuper Bowl and the World Series. It has been a long time--26 years--\nsince we were able to get, as the saying goes in Pittsburgh, ``one for \nthe thumb.'' We didn't yet have the one for the thumb. But the time for \nthe one for the thumb has come. We have, in fact, gotten over the hump, \nand we have a lot more to look forward to, in my view, in the years to \ncome with this great squad.\n  I congratulate, obviously, the team. I also congratulate some other \nfolks who I think deserve particular recognition--and, by the way, \nSenator Specter and I have put forth a congratulatory resolution, which \nwe brought down to the floor and I am sure will be cleared and we will \nbe able to get that passed today.\n  I congratulate the Rooney family. This is a family enterprise that \nhas been, since 1933, running the Steelers. I don't know of any other \nteam in the NFL that has had the kind of stable ownership and closeness \nwith the community that the Rooney ownership has brought over the past \n73 years. They are a great Pittsburgh family. Art Rooney, who bought \nthe team back in 1933, was one of the founders of the NFL. For years \nand years and years, he was one of the great men of football but never \nwon a championship for over 40 years being in the league, and then they \nhad a great run in the 1970s.\n  After his passing, Dan, his son, took it over, and has been a \ntremendous pillar of the Pittsburgh community. This is a man who is as \nhumble as any man I have ever met. In contrast with some of the high-\nflying owners of the NFL, this is a man who still flies around in a \nlittle single-engine plane. They have a training camp well out of town, \nso instead of having to drive from his home, he takes this little plane \nand flies out to the airport near St. Vincent College. He still \nremembers his roots and does so much for the community. One of the \nthings he does most for the community is he keeps the beloved Steelers \na local community team, a team that is good to its players and good to \nthe community and puts the community first. That is one of the reasons \nthe Steelers are so beloved in Pittsburgh--because they are so much a \nfabric in the city because they participate in community organizations, \nand their players have great relationships throughout the Pittsburgh \narea and make a difference in the community. That is really what \nprofessional sports should be more about.\n  We have true role models in people like Jerome Bettis who have added \nso much to the texture of Pittsburgh. Over the years, we have had many \ngreat players in and out, and because of the leadership of the Rooney \nfamily and the stability of the coaching ranks, from Chuck Knoll to \nBill Cowher, we have seen that stability, that bond with the city that \nhas been transferred to the players. They feel that special \nrelationship and obligation to be role models in the community. \nOverwhelmingly, they have lived up to that.\n  So it is a very proud moment, not only because they won a football \ngame--in fact, they won four improbable games against worthy \nopponents--they were a team that barely made the playoffs, but they \nwent through and not only got to a championship game and won the AFC \nchampionship, they then won the Super Bowl. They are truly a remarkable \nteam, inspired by this great family, the Rooney family, and a great \ncoach, Bill Cowher, who has been, again, another important piece of the \nPittsburgh family now for better than a dozen years. He continues to \nshow that a hometown boy can come back, somebody who wasn't a star in \nthe league but a solid guy from Pittsburgh who understands the \nimportance of the Steelers to the community and lives by that ethic and \nthe code the Rooneys have established very well and makes Pittsburgh a \nbetter place as a result.\n  It is great to see Coach Cowher get a Super Bowl, it is great to see \nthe team back on top, and it is great to see Pittsburgh, a town that \nhas gone through a lot in the steel industry in the 1970s--they have \nseen pretty dark times in the 1980s in particular as a community. We \nhave been going through a renaissance in Pittsburgh in the last 10, 12 \nyears, a tremendous transformation of that city. It is nice to see that \nthe Steelers put a punctuation mark which, hopefully, draws some \nattention and makes us feel better about ourselves because not only \nhave we made the transformation, but we have a winning team and a good, \npositive attitude about how we go forward.\n  So I am proud to be a Pittsburgher, and I am proud particularly to be \na Pittsburgh Steeler fan today. I congratulate the entire organization \nand all of the people in Pittsburgh for the tremendous support you \ncontinue to give the Steelers and the great attitude you bring to our \nfair city.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the Pittsburgh \nSteelers on a phenomenal season and a great Super Bowl victory. I \nregret I could not go to Detroit to see the game. But a session had \nbeen scheduled many weeks ago to bring in Attorney General Gonzales on \nthe electronic surveillance issue at 9:30 yesterday morning. I checked \nit out, and the earliest I could have gotten back to Washington would \nhave been the middle of the night. I thought it more sensible to attend \nto those important duties for the hearing with the Attorney General and \nto watch the game on television.\n  I was very heartened to see that game, to see that 75-yard run, the \nlongest in Super Bowl history, to see that phenomenal catch, \npractically a ``hail Mary,'' on the 3-yard line, to see the young \nquarterback Ben Roethlisberger carry it over on the replay and the \ngreat dispute about whether there was a touchdown, and it was a \ntouchdown. The earlier touchdown was nullified when a Seattle receiver \nhad pushed off and been called with an infraction. And then when the \nSteelers were driving at 14 to 3 toward a putaway touchdown, the \nintercepted pass and long runback, and the Seahawks came within 14 to \n10. Then the Seahawks mounted a drive and were closing in on a \ntouchdown which would have put them ahead 17 to 14, and then came the \nSteelers' interception. So, it was phenomenal and thrilling game. To \nhave the Steelers, from a wild-card position, go on the\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nroad and beat Cincinnati and then go on the road and beat Denver and \nIndianapolis and that phenomenal tackle made by Roethlisberger, which \nmay be as important in Steelers' lore as the ``immaculate reception'' \nby Franco Harris many years ago--as you can tell, I am a diehard \nfootball fan.\n  The Steelers have brought great credit to Pennsylvania with their \nvictory, great credit to America with their sportsmanship and \naccomplishments.\n  A special tribute to the Rooney family which owns the Pittsburgh \nSteelers. I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Art Rooney, who bought the \nSteelers in about 1933 for reputedly $2,500. I have had occasion to \nwork with his son Dan Rooney, who is now the family patriarch, and his \ngrandson Art Rooney. They are a wonderful family.\n  Bill Cowher is the coach. I know him, to some extent. It is a great \ntribute.\n  I have taken these few moments to comment about the great victory and \nto offer congratulations. I am sorry that I couldn't be in Pittsburgh \ntoday to attend the parade. But we have a parade on the Senate floor \nwhich takes my attention. I don't think I will be missed in that crowd.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 367) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 367\n\n       Whereas, on Sunday, February 5, 2006, the Pittsburgh \n     Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 21-10, \n     in Detroit, Michigan;\n       Whereas that victory marks the 5th Super Bowl Championship \n     for the Steelers organization, tying Pittsburgh with the San \n     Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys for the most Super \n     Bowl wins in the history of the National Football League;\n       Whereas, after losing a game to Cincinnati on December 4, \n     and dropping their record to 7 wins and 5 losses, the \n     Steelers won 8 consecutive games, the last of which earned \n     the team an overall record of 15-5 and the right to be named \n     Super Bowl Champions;\n       Whereas the path of the Steelers to the Super Bowl included \n     road victories against the Cincinnati Bengals, the \n     Indianapolis Colts, and the Denver Broncos, making the \n     Steelers the 2nd team in NFL history to win 3 playoff games \n     on the road;\n       Whereas Bill Cowher, a Pittsburgh native and the longest \n     tenured head coach in the NFL, was a steady presence \n     throughout the season and earned his 1st Super Bowl victory \n     after 14 seasons at the helm of the Steelers team;\n       Whereas Jerome Bettis, who is affectionately known as ``The \n     Bus,'' and is the 5th leading rusher in NFL history, was the \n     emotional leader of the Steelers team and was able to return \n     to his hometown of Detroit to participate in his 1st Super \n     Bowl, after which he announced his retirement from the game \n     of football;\n       Whereas Hines Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and 1 \n     touchdown, was named Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XL, \n     joining Franco Harris, Lynn Swann, and Terry Bradshaw as the \n     only Steelers to earn that prestigious award;\n       Whereas, at the age of 23, Pittsburgh quarterback Ben \n     Roethlisberger was the youngest starting quarterback ever to \n     win a Super Bowl;\n       Whereas the defense of the Steelers, led by Pro-Bowl \n     performers Troy Polamalu, Joey Porter, and Casey Hampton, \n     held the highest scoring team in the NFL, the Seattle \n     Seahawks, to more than 18 points below their season average \n     of 28.3 points per game; and\n       Whereas the Rooney family, who have owned the Pittsburgh \n     Steelers since the founding of the team in 1933, have \n     provided the Steelers organization with a level of stability \n     and commitment to community that is unmatched in the modern \n     sports environment and have created a team that is as beloved \n     by its hometown as any in the world; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Pittsburgh \n     Steelers on their hard-fought, well-deserved victory in Super \n     Bowl XL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 369, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 369) congratulating the American \n     Dental Association for sponsoring the 4th annual ``Give Kids \n     a Smile'' program which emphasizes the need to improve access \n     to dental care for children, and thanking dentists for \n     volunteering their time to help provide needed dental care.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a resolution \nto congratulate the American Dental Association for establishing the \n``Give Kids a Smile'' Program. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Coleman, Cochran, and Feingold in recognizing this \nannual event.\n  This Friday is the fourth ``Give Kids a Smile'' day, which emphasizes \nthe need to improve dental care access for children. Tooth decay is the \nmost common chronic childhood disease and can be the cause of poor \neating and sleeping patterns, decreased attention spans at school, and \nsadly, children not being able to smile. Children who are eligible for \nMedicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program are three to \nfive times more likely than other children to have untreated tooth \ndecay.\n  I also want to thank the members of the American Dental Association \nfor participating in this program. I am especially proud of all of the \ndentists in Michigan who took the time to make the annual ``Give Kids a \nSmile'' day such a great success. Last year, more than 330 dentists in \nMichigan volunteered their valuable services for ``Give Kids a Smile'' \nevents across the State. These dentists, along with more than 1,000 \nstaff members and volunteers, provided dental treatment and oral health \ninformation to more than 17,430 needy children.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 369) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, was agreed to as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 369\n\n       Whereas access to dental care for children is a vital \n     element of overall health care and development;\n       Whereas dental caries (more commonly known as tooth decay) \n     is the most common chronic childhood disease;\n       Whereas untreated tooth decay results in thousands of \n     children experiencing poor eating and sleeping patterns, \n     suffering decreased attention spans at school, and being \n     unable to smile;\n       Whereas due to a confluence of factors, children eligible \n     for Medicaid and the State children's health insurance \n     program are 3 to 5 times more likely than other children to \n     experience and suffer from untreated tooth decay;\n       Whereas dentists provide an estimated $1,700,000,000 \n     annually in non-reimbursed dental care;\n       Whereas nearly 11,000 dentists provided approximately \n     $33,000,000 of free care to almost 500,000 children in the \n     3rd annual ``Give Kids a Smile'' program held on February 4, \n     2005;\n       Whereas the participation of dentists in the 4th annual \n     ``Give Kids a Smile'' program, established and sponsored by \n     the American Dental Association and held on February 3, 2006, \n     serves to remind people in the United States about the need \n     to end untreated childhood dental disease; and\n       Whereas the generous support of numerous corporations, such \n     as Crest Healthy Smiles, Sullivan-Schein Dental, and DEXIS \n     Digital X-ray Systems, helps make the ``Give Kids a Smile'' \n     program a success: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the American Dental Association for \n     establishing and continuing its sponsorship of the ``Give \n     Kids a Smile'' program;\n       (2) emphasizes the need to improve access to dental care \n     for children;\n       (3) thanks the thousands of dentists, dental hygienists, \n     dental assistants, and others who volunteered their time to \n     bring a smile to the faces of hundreds of thousands of \n     children on February 3, 2006;\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/07/senate-section/article/S779-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPOINTMENT TO READ WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
