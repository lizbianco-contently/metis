Mr. President, I welcome back our colleagues from the \nColumbus Day recess. As we open our session, I hope everyone--I am sure \nthey did--had a productive and rejuvenating week with their \nconstituents and their families and their friends. We have a very busy \n5-week session ahead of us. There is a lot of work to do.\n  First up is going to be spending reconciliation. This week our \ncommittees are taking up the hard work of thoughtfully considering \nspending cuts to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly in light of our \nresponsibilities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. It is not an easy \njob. It is not going to be an easy job over the next several days and \nweeks. I do want to thank our committees and their chairmen and ranking \nmembers for their determination and focus.\n  On appropriations, we have made steady progress. We have made good \nprogress in the last several weeks. I anticipate we will be able to \nfinish the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, and DC appropriations bill \nthis week, which means once we are successful with that--and we will \nbe--we will have only one bill remaining. I thank, particularly, \nChairman Thad Cochran for his tremendous leadership in this \nappropriations process.\n  The appropriations process is one of our primary responsibilities. It \nfunds the basic functions of our Government. And we are committed to \ndoing so in a way that is disciplined and is fiscally responsible.\n  This is equally true as we continue to meet the challenges of \nHurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. In the wake of these twin \ndisasters, we focused on providing the targeted relief, the immediate \nrelief, and the effective tax incentives that we know will work to help \nthe gulf coast recover and rebuild.\n  As this process moves forward, we are going to face a lot of tough \ndecisions, a lot of difficult decisions. But with each of these \ndecisions does come an opportunity, an opportunity to encourage growth, \nto lower costs, to create jobs, and to strengthen the economy as the \ngulf recovers and rebuilds stronger and, indeed, more prosperous than \never.\n  Throughout, we need to keep a sharp eye on the bottom line, and we \nneed to set clear priorities. Some have called for higher taxes to \ncover the short-term expense. I disagree. America's families are \nalready bearing the burden of higher taxes in higher gasoline prices \nand heating bills as a result of the storms. We cannot and should not \nburden the American people with even greater Government-imposed \nexpenses.\n  We need to stick to a rigorous program of fiscal discipline and \nstrong progrowth and deliver meaningful solutions that are responsible \nand effective, that we know will work.\n  Before the Columbus Day recess, I asked our committee chairmen to \nkeep working on the spending controls we agreed to earlier this year \nand to look for ways to find additional savings.\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\n  I asked our Budget Committee chairman, Judd Gregg, to put together \nfeasible and achievable savings recommendations. I also asked him to \ncoordinate his work with the House and the White House.\n  We have also endorsed the concept of creating an independent \ninspector general to make sure the Katrina and Rita disaster relief \nwill be well spent.\n\n  To further control costs, we have asked the President to send the \nCongress a rescissions package under the Budget Act. This is the only \nguaranteed way to ensure both the House and Senate jointly take a stand \non spending. This authority, last used in 1992, resulted in savings, \nthen, of nearly $8 billion.\n  We are moving forward, and I urge all of our colleagues to continue \nto work together to impose aggressive fiscal discipline to restrain \nGovernment spending.\n  In the next 5 weeks, we will also consider the President's nomination \nof Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court of the United States. I expect \nthe Senate to carry out its constitutional advice and consent \nresponsibility in an expeditious, fair, and civil manner, as we did \nwith Chief Justice John Roberts.\n  Harriet Miers is an accomplished and experienced lawyer, who is \nrespected by her peers and trusted by the President. In the weeks \nahead, we will have the opportunity to learn more about her background \nand more about her qualifications. Through courtesy calls and hearings, \nwe will have that opportunity to hear from Ms. Miers herself.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to let her be heard and to resist a rush \nto judgment. Such as with all judicial nominees, Harriet Miers deserves \na fair up-or-down vote.\n  In the meantime, we will continue to work for consent on pensions and \nDefense authorization. I urge my colleagues to work together to get \nthese critical pieces of legislation done.\n  Protecting our fellow citizens' safety and well-being is our highest \nobligation. The American people expect and deserve a Senate that is \npurpose driven and that does get results. We are called upon to govern \nwith meaningful solutions.\n  In this session, we have worked hard to address some daunting \nchallenges: defeating our terrorist enemies, tackling rising energy \ncosts, and securing our borders from illegal immigration and terrorist \nthreat. More remains to be done. We face a serious threat of avian flu, \nas well as taking a hard look at our spending priorities.\n  These are just two examples. There will be many more. But I am \nconfident that by pulling together with a sense of common purpose we \ncan secure a stronger, safer, healthier, freer, and more prosperous \nAmerica. I am confident that with determination and focus we will \ncontinue to move America forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11340-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, similar to all Senators, with rare \nexception, I spent last week's recess at home. I traveled Nevada \nmeeting with my constituents. I met with a wide range of people. I had \nmany conversations. But all the conversations came back to the same \nissues, including rising energy prices.\n  One of the last conversations I had was at my home in Searchlight, \nwhere some of our friends who live in Searchlight came to visit with \nus, Judy and Dick Hill. He works at a powerplant, the Mojave Generating \nFacility, about 35 miles from Las Vegas. She is the assistant \npostmistress of Searchlight. They have two boys. One of them is going \nto school. She is even taking some courses at a community college.\n  They spend about $500 a month on gasoline. Maybe they should get \nvehicles that do not use as much gas, and I am sure they are \nconsidering that, but it would not matter what kind of vehicle they \ndrove; they need lots of gasoline to be able to do what they have to \ndo, such as going back and forth to work, taking the boy to school.\n  People in Nevada are concerned about Iraq, as well they should be. I \ncertainly applaud the people of Iraq. A little more than half of them \nturned out to vote. That is courageous. They are proud people, and I am \nglad they have shown their strength by turning out to vote. And it \nappears the constitution is going to pass. We will know in a few days.\n  We lost five soldiers yesterday in Iraq. We are very quickly \napproaching 2,000. We have not quite arrived at that number yet, but we \nare 10 or 12 short of that number.\n  The costs are ongoing. The war seems to be intractable. Surprisingly, \nthe administration is still claiming, as Secretary Rice did over the \nweekend on a Sunday talk show, that the war is a result of 9/11. The \nAmerican people do not accept that because it is simply not true.\n  Of course, constituents were concerned about Katrina and, of course, \nwhether we are ready for another disaster such as the avian flu. I am \nsure this is not unique. I am sure other Senators had the same \nexperiences I did these past 10 days. Americans from all walks of life \nare focused on these important issues, and they are looking to us for \nhelp. As the Democratic leader, I felt comfortable assuring my \nconstituents that my Democratic colleagues are doing everything we can \nto meet these three areas about which they spoke.\n  On Iraq, we continue to press the President to answer key questions \nabout how he is going to change course and achieve military and \npolitical success and to get an accounting of how the money has been \nspent.\n  On energy, we believe we must remain committed--and we will remain \ncommitted--to energy independence by the year 2020. And we have pushed \nto help families fill their tanks and heat their homes.\n  With Katrina, we have continued to fight to make sure the needs of \ndisplaced families are placed at the top of the Senate's agenda.\n  And with the avian flu, we have taken the lead in offering solutions \nto help prepare America and Americans for the next possible disaster.\n  You see, Democrats understand these issues are the priorities of the \nAmerican people. That is why they are priorities for us.\n  Mr. President, a couple of comments regarding the statement of my \nfriend, the Republican leader. I do not know of anyone who is calling \nfor higher taxes, as he suggests. But I know there are people calling \nfor doing away with the budget resolution and reconciliation that calls \nfor $70 billion more in tax cuts--$70 billion more in tax cuts--that go \nto the elite of the country.\n  On top of that, I would suggest that we need to, in effect, get rid \nof the reconciliation.\n  The resolution that will be executed by the reconciliation process \nnow before the Congress, that was called by all leaders of Protestant \nChurches the night we voted on it immoral, is even more so now, the \nresolution before us, not counting what the House says they are going \nto do. They are going to cut more, Medicaid by $10 billion, cut \nMedicaid more, cut medical care to the poorest of the poor in America. \nThey want to increase it by another $5 or $10 billion. That is \nunconscionable.\n  My distinguished friend, the majority leader, said the high energy \ncosts are a result of the storm of Katrina. That is simply without \nfact. Prior to Katrina, oil prices were at $70 a barrel. This is a \nproblem that has been going on for a while. We Democrats are concerned \nabout the priorities of the American people. I suggest that those \nissues about which my friend spoke are not priorities, certainly not to \nthe people of Nevada. We are focused on addressing America's pressing \nneeds. Republicans are acting as though nothing is wrong, that the \nstorm caused the problems.\n  Take energy. The price of gas continues to hover around $3. I already \ntold you about Dick and Judy Hill in Searchlight. Millions of other \npeople are in the same boat as Dick and Judy. The administration's own \nEnergy Department predicts families will pay hundreds more to heat \ntheir homes this winter.\n  I met with Governor Doyle of Wisconsin today. He said in Wisconsin to \nheat your home will cost $300 a month more. Despite these facts, \nRepublicans have refused to help families at the\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\npump. They have blocked our efforts to help working families heat their \nhomes. Senate Republicans have taken a similar hands-off approach to \nIraq and Katrina. We still have done nothing to help the victims of \nKatrina. We have appropriated money. The majority leader says we should \nhave somebody to make sure the money is spent right. We have begged for \nlegislation to create a czar so this money can be spent wisely. No, no \nlegislation in that regard. They won't allow us to bring it to the \nfloor. The huddled masses we all saw on TV--I read the spokesperson for \nthis administration, Bob Novak, in the Washington Post today, the \ncolumnist. He said it looks good in Louisiana, especially New Orleans: \nWe just won't let the people come back. We will have the city about \nhalf of what it was before, and that will be great for Louisiana.\n  That is their response to this catastrophe. The people who needed the \nhelp the most have still gotten no help. And preparedness for avian \nflu, let's see what happens on that.\n  The best example, though, of the Republicans, the best example is the \nDefense authorization bill. We haven't done one. At a time of war, we \nhave not done a Defense authorization bill. In that bill we have money \nfor troops, for pay raises so that they will pay taxes, money for \nhealth care, for new equipment. Republicans refuse to bring it to the \nfloor. We even agreed to 12 amendments, 12 amendments. The average \nnumber of amendments is about 150. We agreed to 12. The only real vote \nwe have had on the Defense authorization bill was an amendment offered \nby the majority leader on Boy Scouts. Yet we don't have time for the \nDefense authorization bill. Why won't they let us go forward with the \n12 amendments? Because one of the amendments calls for an independent, \nbipartisan commission to study what went wrong with Katrina. They will \nnot let us do that. They are willing to bring down the whole Defense \nauthorization bill because they know on that vehicle we have a right to \noffer an amendment. On the things they are bringing up now, the \nappropriations bills, we can't do it procedurally in the Senate. They \ndo not want an independent, bipartisan commission to take a look at \nwhat went wrong with this administration's response to Katrina. You \nwould think the administration would want this. But, no, they are \nfighting this, just as this President fought the 9/11 Commission.\n  I would hope that we would get someone like Senator McCain, who was \nthe one who forced the issue on 9/11, to come forward. Let's have this \nas a bipartisan call for help, for review. From Defense authorization \nto Katrina relief, the Republican record is clear: Their plans for the \nfuture are bad. Instead of helping Americans, Republicans have decided \nto use the months ahead to make problems worse. For the next 5 weeks, \nRepublicans have decided we should focus on cutting health care funding \nfor the sick and elderly, cutting education for students, cutting \nhousing and food assistance, food stamps. That is part of the budget \nreconciliation. They want to cut food stamps. Republicans will be \narguing that all this is justified in the name of fiscal discipline.\n  Now we have about 20 people who are running the House. With \nCongressman DeLay's problems, the Speaker has lost control of the \nHouse. We read in papers all over America today that the House is being \nrun by 20 renegades who are telling him what to do. It appears he is \nlistening, and he is going to do what they want. What are some of the \nthings they want to do? Cut Medicaid even more, more tax cuts, forget \nabout the people in Louisiana and Mississippi. The group that now runs \nthe House of Representatives is arguing that all this is justified in \nthe name of fiscal discipline, and these are the same people who have \nbrought us the largest deficits and debt increases in this Nation's \nhistory. Remember when President Bush took office, some say there was a \nsurplus over 10 years of $7 trillion. That has all since gone. Now we \nare $7 trillion in the hole. Some turnaround. These are the same people \nwho voted for trillions in additional tax cuts and hundreds of billions \nfor Iraq without batting an eye about the fact that none of this \nspending was offset.\n  The same people would like to move forward on another round of \nexpensive tax breaks for the elite. America can do better than this. It \nis time for Congress to focus on the needs of the United States. The \nAmerican people have concerns about a number of issues, and we have an \nobligation to address them. I know the majority leader would like to \nproceed with business as usual, but that is not what the American \npeople expect or want. They aren't interested in more tax breaks for \nthe rich or perks for big oil. They want us to come together and focus \non real problems. We have 5 weeks before the next recess--that is \nThanksgiving--and a host of issues to address, including energy prices, \nKatrina, preparedness for avian flu, and other disasters.\n  It is the pledge of the Democrats that we will not allow these issues \nto be swept under the rug. Democrats will do everything in our power to \nmake sure these issues are addressed before we leave. On energy, we \nwill fight to make sure the Senate takes real steps to help millions of \nfamilies fill their tanks and heat their homes, like LIHEAP, like price \ngouging. On avian flu, we will continue to push the Senate to consider \nour comprehensive legislation so that our country has the tools and \nresources it needs to focus and confront this threat. With Katrina, we \nwill make sure hundreds of thousands of victims are helped, not \nforgotten. Displaced families may no longer be front-page news, but \nthat doesn't mean their needs are met. Thousands are still without \nhealth care and housing, and we have an obligation to help. Energy \ncosts, preparedness, Katrina relief--top priorities for the American \npeople, and Democrats will fight to make sure they are the top \npriorities for the Senate as well. America must do better than what we \nhave done.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for coming \nto the floor. We have all returned from our time back home. The \nColumbus Day recess gave us a chance to go back to our home States. I \nhave run into Senators in the hallway. Senator Cornyn said: I was \nblazing across Texas. I know Senator Reid was in Nevada. I was going \nacross the State of Illinois. It is a good time. It is a good chance to \nsee if some of the things we are talking about in Washington are really \nresonating and important to the families back home.\n  I sense, after having been around here for a while, where we spend a \nlot of time, the people back home scratch their heads and think: They \nare wasting time. It is all political talk and speeches. When are they \ngoing to talk about the things that really count?\n  I will tell you what I found really counts back home. I went to \nWheaton, IL, and visited with Joel Gomez. Joel Gomez, a year and a half \nago, was injured in Iraq as an American soldier and became a \nquadriplegic. Joel Gomez is a wonderful young man. This was the first \ntime I had met him face to face. He lights up a room with his smile, \nand he is so engaging. He is in a hospital bed and cannot move. The \npeople in the community and the veterans organizations have come \ntogether and built him a new home. They built it in 3 months. They \nbroke all construction records. It is for his mother and father and \nhimself. It cost over $700,000. They put all of that into it to make \nsure that Joel Gomez can have a good life from this point forward.\n  I talked to his mom and dad and the people who are around him. I \nsaid: How is care at the veterans hospital for Joel? They are trying \ntheir best. Sometimes his condition is so challenging, they have to go \nto other places. But\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\nthey said: Senator, he is offered 16 hours of nursing care each week. \nJoel Gomez needs 24/7. He gets 16 hours from the Veterans' \nAdministration. The rest comes from friends and family, other veterans \nand relatives who are giving money so Joel can have nursing care.\n  So when I come back here and join in the debate with Senator Patty \nMurray and other Democrats and talking about the war in Iraq, I think \nof Joel Gomez. I think of the soldier who did what we asked of him, as \nso many hundreds of thousands have. He risked his life for America, has \nsuffered a life-transforming injury, and now doesn't have the support \nof his Government that he should.\n  In terms of the priorities of America, when it comes to Iraq, I am \nglad the constitutional referendum took place, but I also think we have \nto look at the security needs of Iraq and the reality of Iraq today. \nOne hundred fifty thousand American soldiers are there today. As \nSenator Reid said, we have lost almost 2,000 of our best and bravest so \nfar with no end in sight. So when we say to the administration, we are \nholding you accountable, we want to see this move forward so American \ntroops can come home, I think that is our responsibility. We are not \nsaying cut and run, retreat. We are saying: Tell us when the Iraqi army \nhas improved to the point where it can take over for American soldiers.\n  Two weeks ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid came to Capitol Hill \ndisclosing information to congress that had been classified for months. \nThe information was this: There is only one battalion in the Iraqi army \nstanding ready to fight independently, alone, today, out of 110. Four \nmonths ago there were three. They have gone downhill because of \ndesertions, because of the infiltration of insurgents. The Iraqi army \nis not growing in strength, as we had planned it would, so we could \ncome home. So when the Democratic side of the aisle holds the White \nHouse accountable, it is so that we can start bringing these soldiers \nhome. So that Iraq can take control of its own future and security; \nand, secondly, to make sure, as well, that when we consider cuts in \nappropriations, we never cut the Veterans' Administration--never.\n  We made a solemn promise to these men and women. We said, If you will \nrisk your life for America, we will stand by you when you come home. I \nthink of Joel Gomez when I think about that.\n  Then I went up to Elgin and went to the local community center there \nand met with the United Way and a young woman named Sheila Balthazar. \nSheila Balthazar and her 2-year-old son are from New Orleans. They were \nlucky. They were traveling when Hurricane Katrina hit and they managed \nto escape and made their way, with her father, up to Illinois to a \ncommunity in Kane County. The community of Elgin embraced her--because \nthey wanted to make her feel at home--finding a home for her, finding a \njob for her, and taking care of her son.\n  I said, What about Government help in this situation? You have lost \nyour home; you have lost everything you own. She said there hasn't been \nmuch if any in terms of Government assistance.\n  I thought to myself, we have appropriated $60 billion, and yet when \nit comes right down to it, the people who are suffering turn to the \nbest place one can turn, and that is the compassion and caring of their \nfellow Americans. But where is their Government? Where was our \npreparation? Where was our preparedness? We were told by this \nadministration: We are ready, whatever the disaster might be. It did \nnot happen. We saw those horrifying images on television as a reminder \nthat it did not happen.\n  The one issue that kept coming back was the cost of energy. It was \nannounced while I was home that even in the upper Midwest, northern \nIllinois, people can expect historically high natural gas heating \nbills. We rely on natural gas more than anything else. People in the \nNortheast use heating oil. They expect the average home to see an \nincrease of $200 or $300 a month in their heating bills this \napproaching winter.\n  It shows us that what we passed and had signed into law a few weeks \nago, the Energy bill, is not much of an energy bill. It did have some \ngood provisions in it. I voted for the bill because it helped ethanol, \nbiodiesel--alternative fuels--that I think move us in the right \ndirection. But when we offered an amendment on the floor and said to \nthe Senate, Shouldn't we as a nation accept as a challenge for every \nPresident--Democrat and Republican--from this day forward to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil by at least 40 percent by the year 2020, the \namendment was defeated on a partisan rollcall, Republicans voting no on \nenergy independence for America by 2020.\n  Now take a look at where we are. We are still heavily dependent on \nforeign oil, still finding our economy at the mercy of the OPEC cartel \nand others who run prices up as high as they can. What is even worse, \nwe are finding that the big oil companies are making obscene profits at \nthe expense of individuals and families and businesses across America.\n  The top four big oil companies in America in the first 6 months of \nthis year reported $40 billion in profits, recordbreaking profits. So \nas we stick that nozzle into the gas tank and look at those numbers \nrolling, trust me, a small part may be going to Saudi Arabia, but the \nbiggest part of it is not going to the man who owns the gas station, it \nis going to that oil company that owns the gas station: $40 billion in \nnew profits, windfall profits that consumers are paying across America. \nWe will see it with heating bills this winter, and we are going to see \nit as well with the pressure on airlines for the cost of jet fuel.\n  The obvious question is this: What will this Congress do about it? \nBefore we leave in 5 weeks, will we do anything? Will we make a move \nnow to establish a goal of energy independence by the year 2020? Will \nwe set up a strategic gasoline and jet fuel reserve so that when we \nhave these price spikes, the President has a tool he can use to reduce \nthese costs? Will we hold the oil companies accountable for these \nwindfall profits, $40 billion, that have come at the expense of average \nAmericans over the last 6 months?\n  You can understand that the President and Vice President, because of \ntheir business backgrounds, are not excited about these ideas, but the \nAmerican people expect us to do something. The Democrats have come \nforward with specific proposals dealing with energy. The Republican \nside has said, Let business continue as usual. Let these billions of \ndollars continue.\n  Then I ran into a friend of mine in Springfield with whom I have \nworked for years. We talked about credit card debt. He said he \nunderstood that his credit card company by the end of the year was \ngoing to do something that could hurt his family. I said, What is that? \nHe said they are going to increase the minimum amount you can pay each \nmonth on your balance from 2 percent to 4 percent. He said: I am not \nsure I can keep up with it.\n  I thought to myself: If you can't pay off 4 percent of your credit \ncard balance each month, how can you ever get ahead of the game? The \ninterest they are going to charge you is going to eat up 4 percent--2 \npercent at least. And if you are not paying down that principal and \nstill charging away, how are you ever going to get out from under?\n  The reason why that is especially appropriate to mention today is \nbecause today is the first day of the new bankruptcy law in America. \nThe Republican leadership here points with pride to the fact that they \nput in a new bankruptcy law.\n  The most basic question one can ask in Washington when people say \nthey want a law passed is, Who wants it passed and why? This bankruptcy \nreform bill was the darling and pet project of the financial \ninstitutions and credit card companies of America for almost 10 years. \nWhy did they want to change the bankruptcy law? Because this individual \nI mentioned in Springfield and others who become so heavily indebted to \ncredit card companies sometimes reach a breaking point. The one thing \nthat pushes them over the edge more than anything is medical bills \nuncovered by their health insurance. When these medical bills come \ncrashing on them, some are forced into the bankruptcy court.\n  Other things can happen--a death in the family, a divorce, a loss of \na job. But the No. 1 reason people go to bankruptcy court is because of \nmedical bills. So this bankruptcy reform which we passed--I voted \nagainst it--with a majority in the Senate will make it\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\nmore difficult for individuals with medical debt forced into bankruptcy \nto discharge their debt. In other words, at the end of this legal \nproceeding in bankruptcy, they are still in debt. They walk out the \ndoor with the debts all over again. The credit card debt and medical \ndebt is still there.\n  So, of course, the financial institutions and credit card companies \ncouldn't be happier. If you can't get out from under this debt, they \nwill get more money from you, they will harass you for years and months \nto come. That is the idea of breakthrough legislation by the Republican \nleadership in the Senate.\n  From my point of view, it does not help the average person in \nAmerica. It puts an unreasonable burden on people who are struggling to \nsurvive as each year we see fewer and fewer people with health \ninsurance, as each year the Republicans resist efforts to increase the \nminimum wage in this country so people who get up and go to work every \nday can make enough money to get by. As the number of impoverished \npeople in America continues to grow each year, we end up making it more \ndifficult to go to bankruptcy court and get out from under that debt, \neven if that debt is caused by medical bills.\n  That, to me, is not the people's agenda, it is not America's agenda, \nand it does not reflect what I found when I returned to Illinois. The \npeople I represent believe America can do better. We can do a lot \nbetter. We can have an energy policy that moves us toward independence \nand gives us some way to deal with these obscene profits by the oil \ncompanies that are dragging our economy down, as well as family \nbudgets. We can do better in Iraq by establishing standards of \naccountability for this administration: How many Iraqi soldiers are \ngoing to be prepared to fight, and how soon can American soldiers come \nhome? What is the progress on reconstructing Iraq? There is less \nelectricity in Iraq now than when we invaded. There is less potable \nwater available. There is a 50-percent unemployment rate and less oil \nproduction than at the time of the invasion.\n  We need to hold this administration and the Iraqi Government \naccountable so our American soldiers can come home successfully with \ntheir mission truly accomplished.\n  We also need to see accountability when it comes to health care in \nAmerica. This is a topic that neither the President nor leaders in \nCongress are willing to talk about in public, and it is the No. 1 \nissue. When I sat down with the Chamber of Commerce in Elgin, IL, and \nasked the gathering of business leaders, If you had to rank the top \nthree issues facing your business today as a challenge, how many of you \nwould put the cost of health insurance in the top three? Every single \nhand went up.\n  What are we doing about that in Washington? The answer is absolutely \nnothing. While people are making a handsome profit as providers and \ninsurance companies and HMOs, we are doing nothing to help the average \nAmerican.\n  We had a hearing on the Medicare prescription drug bill in Chicago \nwith Congresswoman Schakowsky. I feel sorry for the seniors of this \ncountry. I am glad they have a benefit coming their way, but it \ncouldn't have been more complicated. In an effort to protect the \nprofits of pharmaceutical companies, we would not let Medicare offer--\nsimply offer--one plan for all seniors across America, a plan that \ncould compete by bulk purchases and discounts in lowering the price of \ndrugs. No way. The pharmaceutical companies opposed it, and they, of \ncourse, rule the roost when it comes to Capitol Hill. They get what \nthey want. As a result, we have the jumbled mess of bureaucracy and \nredtape that our seniors have to go through to try to figure out what \nthis Medicare prescription drug benefit is all about.\n  We should have done a lot better for our seniors than this Medicare \nprescription drug bill. It is not as good as America can do. I think we \nhave an obligation to do better.\n  In the weeks ahead, the 5 weeks when we are scheduled to adjourn, I \nhope we rise to the challenge on a bipartisan basis. I hope the \nRepublican leadership looks to the real issues facing America: energy, \ndealing with the Katrina crisis with a truly independent nonpartisan \ncommission, and making certain we have accountability with what is \nhappening in the war in Iraq. That will move the Senate forward and \nmove America forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment \ntoday in loving memory and honor of Sergeant Michael Duane Acklin II.\n  Sergeant Acklin of Louisville, KY, served with the First Battalion, \n320th Field Artillery, 101st Airborne Division. Nearly 2 years ago, he \ngave his life in defense of our country in the northern Iraqi city of \nMosul. He was 25 years old and had served in the Army for 5 years.\n  On November 15, 2003, Sergeant Acklin was on an evening patrol over \nMosul in a Blackhawk helicopter, and his team was responding to an \nambush of a squad of American soldiers on the ground. As the helicopter \nhovered above the fight, a second helicopter, which had also come to \nhelp, was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.\n  That helicopter lost control and hit Sergeant Acklin's aircraft, \ncutting off the tail rotor of Sergeant Acklin's helicopter. Both \nhelicopters lost control and crashed, killing 17 soldiers. Sergeant \nAcklin was one of them. It was the largest loss of American lives \nduring a single incident in Iraq at the time.\n  Sergeant Acklin was buried in Louisville at the Zachary Taylor \nNational Cemetery, named for America's 12th President who is also laid \nto rest there. For his valor, Sergeant Acklin was awarded the Bronze \nStar and the Purple Heart. During his service, he also received the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal.\n  Michael attended Butler High School and then Western High School, \nwhere he graduated in 1996. After graduation, he worked as a bus boy, a \ncook, and at several other temporary jobs, but none gave Michael the \nchallenge or the fulfillment that he was looking for. Then he began to \nsee the Army as a way to focus his life and spirit.\n  Michael's family has a long and distinguished career of military \nservice. His grandfather, Eugene Acklin, his great-grandfather, Fred \nBible, and three of his cousins have all served in either the Army or \nAir Force. In fact, before making his decision to enlist, Michael spoke \nwith one of those cousins, Curtis Luckett Jr., an Army veteran. Michael \nalso sought the advice of his father's cousin, LTC Charles Mitchell, \nJr., a career military officer who gave him a personal perspective on \nArmy life. However, Michael made his decision to join the Army in his \nown way.\n  A devout Christian, Michael enlisted in the Army in the summer of \n1998, after hearing, according to what he told his family later, what \nhe could describe only as the voice of God. In hopes of following God's \ncalling, Michael had a friend drive him to a nearby Army recruiting \nstation, and he signed up. He felt this was to be his path into \nadulthood. His father applauded his decision, and his mother hoped it \nwould provide him the direction he was seeking.\n  While he found basic training tough, Michael embraced the discipline \nthe Army provided him, and he successfully completed his training and \nemerged with a greater awareness of his strengths and talents. Early-\nmorning wake-up calls at 4:30 and ceaseless drills gave Michael a new \nsense of commitment and confidence. He was made a recruit leader, and \nafter training to use large artillery pieces, he was assigned to the \n101st Airborne Division based in Fort Campbell, KY, not too far from \nhis home back in Louisville.\n  Sergeant Acklin was a part of the initial wave of forces sent to \nliberate Iraq in March 2003. The 101st Airborne took the lead, as it \nalways does whenever our country calls, and Michael and his unit were \ncharged with providing cover fire in support of our troops.\n  After the fall of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime, Michael's unit \nbuilt schools, cleared streets, and tracked down suspected terrorists. \nHe commanded five other men, and made sure they wrote their families \nback home often.\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\n  Michael Acklin, or ``Mikey'' as his mother Dorothy calls him, grew up \nas a bright young boy who enjoyed playing football or video games with \nthe neighborhood kids, many of whom would remain lifelong friends. He \nplayed basketball with his dad, who first taught him how to dunk. He \nwas a good kid with a big smile who was known at school to be a \nprankster, but also a good student.\n  ``My son always had a jolly outlook everyday,'' said Sergeant \nAcklin's father, Michael Acklin Sr. ``He was just always filled with \njoy.''\n  Growing up, Mrs. Acklin recalls her son playing the drums, writing \npoems, and helping younger children at church, bringing a quiet \nthoughtfulness to everything he did. Michael listened to people, that \nwas his style.\n  While stationed at Fort Campbell, Michael drove to the base everyday \nfrom his rented room in a servicemen's church. When not on duty, he \ntaught Sunday school, attended Bible studies, and helped out around the \nchurch by cooking meals or cutting the grass. His fellow soldiers began \ncalling him ``Preacher'' for his frequent praying before missions. \nMichael talked to his father about going to a Bible college and \nbecoming a minister when he got back. He was able to find a direction \nfor his life, before he was tragically taken from us.\n  We thank Michael's parents, Dorothy Acklin and Michael Acklin Sr., \nfor sharing Michael's story with us. As Michael's father said, ``I know \nmy son has gone to be with the Lord. I do know my son certainly will be \nhonored.''\n  It is my hope that we have done our part to help honor Michael today, \neven if only a small part. Words cannot erase the grief and despair \nthat hang over Michael's parents, family and beloved friends. But they \ncan declare boldly to all that Michael was a hero. He gave his life to \ndefend us, and our freedoms. His mission was to spread that freedom, \nlike a light, into places that had only known darkness. Michael may \nhave been taken from us. But the light he planted in people's hearts \nwill never be extinguished.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the family of SGT Michael Acklin II in \ntheir thoughts and prayers. I know they will be in mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Matt Kimmell\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Paxton. \nMatt Kimmell, 30 years old, died on October 11 in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, \nwhen an improvised explosive device exploded near the military vehicle \nin which he was riding. With so much of his life before him, Matt \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A man remembered for kindness, compassion, and deep faith, Matt \njoined the National Guard just 1 year after graduating from Faith \nChristian School in Carlisle. Soon committed to military life, he \nsigned up for a tour of duty and was chosen to be an Army airborne \nranger. When his training was over, he returned home, studied law \nenforcement at Vincennes University and joined the Vanderburgh County \nSheriff's Department as a road patrol deputy, where he worked 3 years \nbefore reenlisting in the Army. Universally liked and admired, his \nfriends and colleagues recounted that Matt had not joined the military \nfor glory but rather because of his deep sense of right and wrong.\n  Matt served as the newspaper carrier for the Sullivan Daily Times \nduring his childhood in Paxton. Even as a young boy, customers remember \nhim as prompt and diligent. All of his actions were underscored by his \nChristian faith. Three years ago, he married Mylissa Hall, a nurse from \nWorthington. He loved children and the couple planned to start a family \nwhen he returned from Iraq. A friend of Matt's told the Terre Haute \nTribune Star, ``He broke the mold when they made him.'' Matt's small \nhometown has been hit hard by the death of one of their own. This week, \ntownsfolk planted 542 small American flags down a half mile stretch in \nMatt's honor and they have started a fund to build a monument to him.\n  Matt was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group, based at Fort \nCampbell, KY. This brave young soldier leaves behind his wife Mylissa; \nhis father Pastor Larry Kimmell and his mother Jeanne; his brother \nMatt; and his sister Suzanne.\n  Today, I join Matt's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Matt, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Matt was known for his dedication to his family, his faith, and his \nlove of country. Today and always, Matt will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Matt's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Matt's actions will live on far \nlonger than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Matt Kimmell in the \nCongressional Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country \nand for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When \nI think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Matt's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Matt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past weekend, the people of Iraq \nvoted on their new constitution. Soon they will participate in \nparliamentary elections that will provide for a fully constitutional \ngovernment. By any measure of history, the nation of Iraq has made \nremarkable progress in the past 2 years despite the criticism of \nnaysayers who seem, in some instances, intent on scoring political \npoints more than encouraging our brave comrades to win the war in Iraq \nand assist us in winning the larger global war on terror.\n  Iraqi participation in this election yesterday was strong, including \nSunnis who boycotted the January election. The election was also more \npeaceful than the previous election, in large measure due to the \ndetermination and professionalism of the new Iraqi security services. \nIf 3 short years ago someone would have predicted the Iraqis would vote \non a constitution in the near future, the same critics who are\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\ntoday calling for retreat would have scoffed.\n  However, the critics have consistently underestimated the Iraqi \npeople, the American military, and, I might add, the American people as \nwell. America must remain engaged in stabilization efforts in order to \nensure the triumph of democracy over the return of tyranny.\n  Since the beginning of the war on terror, members of our military \nhave been asked to execute both difficult and dangerous work. As \nalways, the good men and women who serve have met these challenges with \ndetermination, courage, and honor. They are a credit to our Nation and \ndeserve our deepest respect and gratitude.\n  We all know there remains difficult work to be done in Iraq. \nTerrorists regard this country as the central battle ground in the war \non terror, and these enemies acknowledge no standards and no rules \ngoverning warfare. Their stated goal is to bring great harm to any \ngovernment or country that opposes their actions. We in the United \nStates, of course, are a primary target, and we must therefore continue \nto show leadership and courage in the fight.\n  Some critics have said that we should cut and run, that we should \nleave according to some arbitrary timetable, claiming that the Pentagon \nand the administration have failed to be realistic about the problems \nthat exist in Iraq and the challenges that lie ahead. I firmly \ndisagree.\n  President Bush and other members of the administration have \nconsistently told the American people that our efforts in Iraq will \nrequire much sacrifice, but that we must stay the course. We must not \nlet the politics of the moment undermine the path to democracy in Iraq. \nWe should consider, though, the alternative: what would happen if our \ntroops left Iraq prematurely. The country would likely face a civil war \nor would fragment in a dangerous way. Terrorists such as Ayman al-\nZawahiri, al-Qaida's No. 2 operative and Bin Laden's deputy, and Abu \nMasab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida's chief terrorist in Iraq, and others who \nvow to destroy America could be counted on to seize power in at least a \nportion of the country. At a minimum, they would find patronage in any \nregime to plan attacks and train terrorists and offer them harbor and \nmaterial support.\n  The consequences of a U.S. pullout and coalition pullout from Iraq \nshould not be in question, as a letter from Zawahiri and Zarqawi \nreleased this week by the Pentagon makes clear. In this letter, \nZawahiri tells Zarqawi when the United States leaves Iraq that al-Qaida \nmust be prepared to claim the most political territory possible in the \ninevitable vacuum of power that will arise.\n\n  Yes, Iraq would be more dangerous, not less, if we fail to finish the \njob. Failure in Iraq would empower and embolden the enemy. Failure to \nstay the course and lay the foundation of a functioning democracy would \nresult in more, not fewer, terrorist attacks, including here at home.\n  I must also express disappointment with those in this country who are \ntrying to use the situation in Iraq to score political points or \nundermine America's resolve.\n  Last week, the leadership in the Senate on the other side of the \naisle put out a statement claiming that we do not have a plan for \nvictory in Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  For the record, the Senate has been briefed numerous times by our \nmilitary leadership regarding the plan in Iraq and the war on terror. \nThis weekend's successful election was a key element in that plan to \nbuild a stable and self-governing Iraq. Sadly, the claim by political \npartisans that we do not have a plan in Iraq is nothing more than \npolitics at its worst. To imply that our military leadership does not \nunderstand what it takes to win in Iraq is simply wrong and even \ninsulting.\n  I trust the wisdom and experience of GEN John Abizaid and GEN George \nCasey over the many armchair generals inside the beltway who seem to \npontificate with great frequency. They understand the facts on the \nground and what is necessary to achieve victory.\n  Finally, some critics are fond of comparing Iraq to Vietnam. Yet the \ndifferences far outweigh the flawed comparisons some attempt to make. \nThe only obvious and striking similarity is that the enemy is counting \non American public opinion to force a retreat. In fact, Zawahiri noted \nin his letter that ``we are in a battle and more than half of this \nbattle is taking place in the battlefield of the media.'' Al-Qaida \nunderstands that they cannot win on the battlefield against the spirit \nof determination of America and our allies. Prematurely leaving Iraq \nwould have catastrophic consequences far greater than those we saw in \nVietnam, as retreat would, in effect, hand the Iraqi people over to the \nterrorists who have stated their intention and proven their ability to \nlaunch horrifying attacks.\n  Yes, we have seen significant progress in Iraq, and our confidence in \nthe desire of the Iraqi people to self-govern is well placed as we have \nseen the value that they place on liberty. We have seen record numbers \nshow up at the polls, more than 60 percent, despite threats of car \nbombs and other acts of terrorism. We have seen Iraqi elected officials \nvocally defend the values of freedom and democracy at their own peril. \nIn 2\\1/2\\ years, this country has moved from the rule of a tyrant to \nimplementing the rule of law. They have held national elections, and \nthey were followed by the writing of a constitution. They are \nformulating their own military and security forces that grow more and \nmore capable.\n  While much remains to be done, much has been accomplished. To ignore \nthese strides forward would be to diminish the good work of both the \nIraqi people and the United States and their contributions that have \nallowed this effort to occur. Yes, we must stay the course. In so doing \nwe honor both the ideals upon which this great Nation was founded and \nour own national security interests. America has sacrificed much in \nthis global war, and we do not yet know the trials that will come. We \ncan be confident that there will be a struggle and a greater sacrifice, \nbut we can also be confident that in the midst of this struggle and \nsacrifice there is hope.\n  We are encouraging democracy, freedom, progress, free markets, self-\ngovernance, and the rule of law and the Iraqi people are reaching out \nand taking hold of that hope.\n  So we must stand confident and strong, shoulder to shoulder with the \nIraqi people in the defense of their nascent democracy, confident that \nfreedom will, in the end, triumph.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, in May, Senator Jeff Bingaman and I, \nwith the encouragement of the Senate Energy Committee Chairman, Pete \nDomenici, asked the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and \nthe Institute of Medicine the following question: What are the top 10 \nactions, in priority order, that Federal policymakers could take over \nthe next decade to help the United States keep our advantage in science \nand technology? That was our question.\n  To answer the question, the academies assembled a distinguished panel \nof business, government, and university leaders, headed by Norm \nAugustine, the former chair of Lockheed Martin. The panel also included \nthree Nobel Prize laureates. The panel took our question seriously, and \nI intend to do everything within my power to take their recommendations \nseriously. Tomorrow, the Energy Committee will take the first step in \nthat response by holding a hearing to hear from Mr. Augustine and the \nAcademies. It will be the first opportunity Congress will have to hear \ntheir answer to our question.\n  This hearing is primarily about brainpower and the relationship of \nbrainpower to good American jobs. The United States produces almost \none-third of all the wealth in the world, in terms of gross domestic \nproduct but has only 5 percent of the world's population. We are a \nfortunate country indeed. The Academies explained this phenomenon in \nthis way:\n\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\n\n     . . . as much as 85 percent of measured growth in U.S. income \n     per capita is due to technological change.\n\n  This technological change is the result, in the report's words, of an \noutpouring of:\n\n     . . . well-trained people and the steady stream of scientific \n     and technological innovations they produce.\n\n  The United States has taken extraordinary steps to help create this \noutpouring of trained people and new discoveries that have given us \nsuch a disproportionate share of the world's wealth. We have in our \ncountry almost all of the world's great research universities. We have \na unique array of 36 Federal research laboratories. More Americans \nattend college than people in any other country, and the colleges they \nattend are the best in the world. We have had, until at least recently, \na system of K-12 education unsurpassed in the world.\n  Government support for all these enterprises has been massive. In \n2001, the Federal Government spent $22.5 billion for university-based \nresearch in science and engineering. This year the Government will \nprovide 60 percent of American students with grants or loans to help \nthem attend the college or university of their choice. The Federal \nGovernment will spend nearly $17 billion on grants and work-study \nprograms and will provide an additional $52 billion in student loans.\n  In my last year as Governor of Tennessee, and I am sure it must have \nbeen as true in Ohio as well, or nearly true, half of State dollars and \na larger proportion of local tax dollars went to support education. Our \nfree-market environment encouraged innovation and enterprise, as well \nas billions of dollars invested in corporate research. Finally, to top \nit all off, while we have been outsourcing jobs, we have been \ninsourcing brainpower--572,000 foreign students attend our colleges and \nuniversities. One-half of the students in our graduate programs of \nengineering, science, and computing are foreign students.\n  There are three reasons I put this question to the National \nAcademies. First, Congress is facing huge budget challenges over the \nnext decade as we grapple with restraining the growth of entitlement \nspending. I did not want tight budgets to squeeze out the necessary \ninvestments in science and technology that create good jobs. Second, as \nthe Augustine report details, there are worrisome reports from all \nsides in the new competitive world marketplace that the United States \nwill have to make an even greater effort to keep our high standard of \nliving. To put it bluntly, people in India, China, Singapore, Finland, \nand Ireland know very well that since their brains work similar to our \nbrains, if brainpower is the secret weapon to produce good jobs, then \nthere is no reason they can't have a standard of living more similar to \nours. They are working to develop better trained citizens and create \ntheir own stream of discoveries.\n  Third, I wanted to ask this question to those who should know the \nanswer. Members of Congress are not the best ones to guess what the \nfirst 10 things we should do are, in the next 10 years, to keep our \nscience and technology edge. This panel represents the best of those \nbrains. Congress is not efficiently organized to deal with broad \nrecommendations such as these. I intend to work with my colleagues to \nsee that all of the recommendations in the report are introduced and \ngiven a fair hearing in various committees that have jurisdiction. I \nsee the senior Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Ohio. Both of \nthem have been leaders in this body on this very question of how do we \nkeep our secret weapon, our brainpower advantage, in order to keep good \njobs.\n  But what should happen is that President Bush should make this report \nthe subject of his State of the Union Address and the focus of his \nremaining 3 years in office. This challenge cries out for executive \nleadership. This challenge is the real answer to most of our hopes and \nthe solution to most of our big problems. From high gasoline prices to \nthe outsourcing of chemical industry jobs, from the shortage of \nengineers to the growing number of lower wage jobs, from energy \nindependence to controlling health care costs, this is the challenge \nthat most Americans wish their Government would put up front.\n  We have begun the discussion with a bipartisan question to the wisest \nAmericans who know the answer. We have a remarkable opportunity now \nbecause of the Augustine report, upon which we will have our hearing \ntomorrow. We will have an opportunity now to act on the recommendations \nof that report in the same spirit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following items: A copy of the executive summary of the Augustine \nreport entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' This is the \nreport of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of \nEngineering, and the Institute of Medicine--4 recommendations with 20 \nspecific steps that we ought to take over the next 10 years to keep our \nbrainpower advantage so we can keep good jobs. Second, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed after that the article by Thomas L. Friedman in \nthe New York Times, on October 14, called ``Keeping Us in the Race,'' \nwhich is his commentary on the Augustine report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Rising Above the Gathering Storm\n\n\n                    Committee Biographic Information\n\n       NORMAN R.

Its overall charge is to \n     address cross-cutting\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\n     issues in science and technology policy that affect the \n     health of the national research enterprise.\n       More information, including the full body of the report, is \n     available at COSEPUP's Web site, www.nationalacademies.org/\n cosepup.\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n       The United States takes deserved pride in the vitality of \n     its economy, which forms the foundation of our high quality \n     of life, our national security, and our hope that our \n     children and grandchildren will inherit ever-greater \n     opportunities. That vitality is derived in large part from \n     the productivity of well-trained people and the steady stream \n     of scientific and technical innovations they produce. Without \n     high-quality, knowledge-intensive jobs and the innovative \n     enterprises that lead to discovery and new technology, our \n     economy will suffer and our people will face a lower standard \n     of living. Economic studies conducted before the information-\n     technology revolution have shown that even then as much as \n     85% of measured growth in U.S. income per capita is due to \n     technological change.\n       Today, Americans are feeling the gradual and subtle effects \n     of globalization that challenge the economic and strategic \n     leadership that the United States has enjoyed since World War \n     II. A substantial portion of our workforce finds itself in \n     direct competition for jobs with lower-wage workers around \n     the globe, and leading-edge scientific and engineering work \n     is being accomplished in many parts of the world. Thanks to \n     globalization, driven by modem communications and other \n     advances, workers in virtually every sector must now face \n     competitors who live just a mouse-click away in Ireland, \n     Finland, China, India, or dozens of other nations whose \n     economies are growing.\n\n\n                        CHARGE TO THE COMMITTEE\n\n       The National Academies was asked by Senator Lamar Alexander \n     and Senator Jeff Bingaman of the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources, with endorsement by Representatives \n     Sherwood Boehlert and Bart Gordon of the House Committee on \n     Science, to respond to the following questions: What are the \n     top 10 actions, in priority order, that federal policy-makers \n     could take to enhance the science and technology enterprise \n     so that the United States can successfully compete, prosper, \n     and be secure in the global community of the 21st Century? \n     What strategy, with several concrete steps, could be used to \n     implement each of those actions?\n       The National Academies created the Committee on Prospering \n     in the Global Economy of the 21st Century to respond to this \n     request. The charge constitutes a challenge both daunting and \n     exhilarating: To recommend to the Nation specific steps that \n     can best strengthen the quality of life in America--our \n     prosperity, our health, and our security. The committee has \n     been cautious in its analysis of information. However, the \n     available information is only partly adequate for the \n     committee's needs. In addition, the time allotted to develop \n     the report (10 weeks from the time of the committee's meeting \n     to report release) limited the ability of the committee to \n     conduct a thorough analysis. Even if unlimited time were \n     available, definitive analyses on many issues are not \n     possible given the uncertainties involved.\n       This report reflects the consensus views and judgment of \n     the committee members. Although the committee includes \n     leaders in academe, industry, and government--several current \n     and former industry chief executive officers, university \n     presidents, researchers (including three Nobel prize \n     winners), and former presidential appointees--the array of \n     topics and policies covered is so broad that it was not \n     possible to assemble a committee of 20 members with direct \n     expertise in each relevant area. Because of those \n     limitations, the committee has relied heavily on the judgment \n     of many experts in the study's focus groups, additional \n     consultations via e-mail and telephone with other experts, \n     and an unusually large panel of reviewers. Although other \n     solutions are undoubtedly possible, the committee believes \n     that its recommendations, if implemented, will help the \n     United States achieve prosperity in the 21st century.\n\n\n                                FINDINGS\n\n       Having reviewed trends in the United States and abroad, the \n     committee is deeply concerned that the scientific and \n     technical building blocks of our economic leadership are \n     eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering \n     strength. We strongly believe that a worldwide strengthening \n     will benefit the world's economy--particularly in the \n     creation of jobs in countries that are far less well-off than \n     the United States. But we are worried about the future \n     prosperity of the United States. Although many people assume \n     that United States will always be a world leader in science \n     and technology, this may not continue to be the case inasmuch \n     as great minds and ideas exist throughout the world. We fear \n     the abruptness with which a lead in science and technology \n     can be lost--and the difficulty of recovering a lead once \n     lost, if indeed it can be regained at all.\n       This Nation must prepare with great urgency to preserve its \n     strategic and economic security. Because other nations have, \n     and probably will continue to have, the competitive advantage \n     of a low-wage structure, the United States must compete by \n     optimizing its knowledge-based resources, particularly in \n     science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile \n     environment for new and revitalized industries and the well-\n     paying jobs they bring. We have already seen that capital, \n     factories, and laboratories readily move wherever they are \n     thought to have the greatest promise of return to investors.\n\n\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n       The committee reviewed hundreds of detailed suggestions--\n     including various calls for novel and untested mechanisms--\n     from other committees, from its focus groups, and from its \n     own members. The challenge is immense, and the actions needed \n     to respond are immense as well.\n       The committee identified two key challenges that are \n     tightly coupled to scientific and engineering prowess: \n     Creating high-quality jobs for Americans and responding to \n     the nation's need for clean, affordable, and reliable energy. \n     To address those challenges, the committee structured its \n     ideas according to four basic recommendations that focus on \n     the human, financial, and knowledge capital necessary for \n     U.S. prosperity.\n       The four recommendations focus on actions in K-12 education \n     (10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds), research (Sowing the \n     Seeds), higher education (Best and Brightest), and economic \n     policy (Incentives for Innovation) that are set forth in the \n     following sections. Also provided are a total of 20 \n     implementation steps for reaching the goals set forth in the \n     recommendations.\n       Some actions involve changes in the law. Others require \n     financial support that would come from reallocation of \n     existing funds or, if necessary, from new funds. Overall, the \n     committee believes that the investments are modest relative \n     to the magnitude of the return the Nation can expect in the \n     creation of new high-quality jobs and in responding to its \n     energy needs.\n\n\n  10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS AND K-12 SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS \n                               EDUCATION\n\n       Recommendation A: Increase America's talent pool by vastly \n     improving K-12 science and mathematics education.\n       Implementation Actions. The highest priority should be \n     assigned to the following actions and programs. All should be \n     subjected to continuing evaluation and refinement as they are \n     implemented:\n       Action A-1: Annually recruit 10,000 science and mathematics \n     teachers by awarding 4-year scholarships and thereby \n     educating 10 million minds. Attract 10,000 of America's \n     brightest students to the teaching profession every year, \n     each of whom can have an impact on 1,000 students over the \n     life of their careers. The program would award competitive 4-\n     year scholarships for students to obtain bachelor's degrees \n     in the physical or life sciences, engineering, or mathematics \n     with concurrent certification as K-12 science and mathematics \n     teachers. The merit-based scholarships would provide up to \n     $20,000 a year for 4 years for qualified educational \n     expenses, including tuition and fees, and require a \n     commitment to 5 years of service in public K-12 schools. A \n     $10,000 annual bonus would go to participating teachers in \n     underserved schools in inner cities and rural areas. To \n     provide the highest-quality education for undergraduates who \n     want to become teachers, it would be important to award \n     matching grants, perhaps $1 million a year for up to 5 years, \n     to as many as 100 universities and colleges to encourage them \n     to establish integrated 4-year undergraduate programs leading \n     to bachelor's degrees in science, engineering, or mathematics \n     with teacher certification.\n       Action A-2: Strengthen the skills of 250,000 teachers \n     through training and education programs at summer institutes, \n     in master's programs, and Advanced Placement and \n     International Baccalaureate (AP and IB) training programs and \n     thus inspires students every day. Use proven models to \n     strengthen the skills (and compensation, which is based on \n     education and skill level) of 250,000 current K-12 teachers:\n       Summer institutes: Provide matching grants to state and \n     regional 1- to 2-week summer institutes to upgrade as many as \n     50,000 practicing teachers each summer. The material covered \n     would allow teachers to keep current with recent developments \n     in science, mathematics, and technology and allow for the \n     exchange of best teaching practices. The Merck Institute for \n     Science Education is a model for this recommendation.\n       Science and mathematics master's programs: Provide grants \n     to universities to offer 50,000 current middle-school and \n     high-school science, mathematics, and technology teachers \n     (with or without undergraduate science, mathematics, or \n     engineering degrees) 2-year, part-time master's degree \n     programs that focus on rigorous science and mathematics \n     content and pedagogy. The model for this recommendation is \n     the University of Pennsylvania Science Teachers Institute.\n       AP, IB, and pre-AP or pre-IB training: Train an additional \n     70,000 AP or IB and 80,000 pre-AP or pre-IB instructors to \n     teach advanced courses in mathematics and science. Assuming \n     satisfactory performance, teachers may receive incentive \n     payments of up to $2,000 per year, as well as $100 for each \n     student who passes an AP or IB exam in mathematics or \n     science. There are two models for this program: the Advanced \n     Placement Incentive Program and Laying the Foundation, a pre-\n     AP program.\n       K-12 curriculum materials modeled on world-class standards. \n     Foster high-quality teaching with world-class curricula, \n     standards, and assessments of student learning.\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\n     Convene a national panel to collect, evaluate, and develop \n     rigorous K-12 materials that would be available free of \n     charge as a voluntary national curriculum. The model for this \n     recommendation is the Project Lead the Way pre-engineering \n     courseware.\n       Action A-3: Enlarge the pipeline by increasing the number \n     of students who take AP and IB science and mathematics \n     courses. Create opportunities and incentives for middle-\n     school and high-school students to pursue advanced work in \n     science and mathematics. By 2010, increase the number of \n     students in AP and IB mathematics and science courses from \n     1.2 million to 4.5 million, and set a goal of tripling the \n     number who pass those tests, to 700,000, by 2010. Student \n     incentives for success would include 50% examination fee \n     rebates and $100 mini-scholarships for each passing score on \n     an AP or IB mathematics and science examination.\n       The committee proposes expansion of two additional \n     approaches to improving K-12 science and mathematics \n     education that are already in use:\n       Statewide specialty high schools. Specialty secondary \n     education can foster leaders in science, technology, and \n     mathematics. Specialty schools immerse students in high-\n     quality science, technology, and mathematics education; serve \n     as a mechanism to test teaching materials; provide a training \n     ground for K-12 teachers; and provide the resources and staff \n     for summer programs that introduce students to science and \n     mathematics.\n       Inquiry-based learning. Summer internships and research \n     opportunities provide especially valuable laboratory \n     experience for both middle-school and high-school students.\n\n\n       sowing the seeds through science and engineering research\n\n       Recommendation B: Sustain and strengthen the nation's \n     traditional commitment to long-term basic research that has \n     the potential to be transformational to maintain the flow of \n     new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and \n     enhance the quality of life.\n       Action B-1: Increase the federal investment in long-term \n     basic research by 10% a year over the next 7 years, through \n     reallocation of existing funds or if necessary through the \n     investment of new funds. Special attention should go to the \n     physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information \n     sciences and to Department of Defense (DOD) basic-research \n     funding. This special attention does not mean that there \n     should be a disinvestment in such important fields as the \n     life sciences (which have seen growth in recent years) or the \n     social sciences. A balanced research portfolio in all fields \n     of science and engineering research is critical to U.S. \n     prosperity. This investment should be evaluated regularly to \n     realign the research portfolio--unsuccessful projects and \n     venues of research should be replaced with emerging research \n     projects and venues that have greater promise.\n       Action B-2: Provide new research grants of $500,000 each \n     annually, payable over 5 years, to 200 of our most \n     outstanding early-career researchers. The grants would be \n     made through existing Federal research agencies--the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation \n     (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), DOD, and the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration--to underwrite new \n     research opportunities at universities and government \n     laboratories.\n       Action B-3: Institute a National Coordination Office for \n     Research Infrastructure to manage a centralized research-\n     infrastructure fund of $500 million per year over the next 5 \n     years--through reallocation of existing funds or if necessary \n     through the investment of new funds--to ensure that \n     universities and government laboratories create and maintain \n     the facilities and equipment needed for leading-edge \n     scientific discovery and technological development. \n     Universities and national laboratories would compete annually \n     for these funds.\n       Action B-4: Allocate at least 8% of the budgets of Federal \n     research agencies to discretionary funding that would be \n     managed by technical program managers in the agencies and be \n     focused on catalyzing high-risk, high-payoff research.\n       Action B-5: Create in the Department of Energy (DOE) an \n     organization like the Defense Advanced Research Projects \n     Agency (DARPA) called the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\n     Energy (ARPA-E). The director of ARPA-E would report to the \n     under secretary for science and would be charged with \n     sponsoring specific research and development programs to meet \n     the nation's long-term energy challenges. The new agency \n     would support creative ``out-of-the-box'' transformational \n     generic energy research that industry by itself cannot or \n     will not support and in which risk may be high but success \n     would provide dramatic benefits for the nation. This would \n     accelerate the process by which knowledge obtained through \n     research is transformed to create jobs and address \n     environmental, energy, and security issues. ARPA-E would be \n     based on the historically successful DARPA model and would be \n     designed as a lean and agile organization with a great deal \n     of independence that can start and stop targeted programs on \n     the basis of performance. The agency would itself perform no \n     research or transitional effort itself but would fund such \n     work conducted by universities, startups, established firms, \n     and others. Its staff would turn over about every 4 years. \n     Although the agency would be focused on specific energy \n     issues, it is expected that its work (like that of DARPA or \n     NIH) will have important spinoff benefits, including aiding \n     in the education of the next generation of researchers. \n     Funding for ARPA-E would start at $300 million the first year \n     and increase to $1 billion per year over 5-6 years, at which \n     point the program's effectiveness would be evaluated.\n       Action B-6: Institute a Presidential Innovation Award to \n     stimulate scientific and engineering advances in the national \n     interest. Existing presidential awards address lifetime \n     achievements or promising young scholars, but the proposed \n     new awards would identify and recognize persons who develop \n     unique scientific and engineering innovations in the national \n     interest at the time they occur.\n\n\n     best and brightest in science and engineering higher education\n\n       Recommendation C: Make the United States the most \n     attractive setting in which to study and perform research so \n     that we can develop, recruit, and retain the best and \n     brightest students, scientists, and engineers from within the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       Action C-1: Increase the number and proportion of U.S. \n     citizens who earn physical-sciences, life-sciences, \n     engineering, and mathematics bachelor's degrees by providing \n     25,000 new 4-year competitive undergraduate scholarships each \n     year to U.S. citizens attending U.S. institutions. The \n     Undergraduate Scholar Awards in Science, Technology, \n     Engineering, and Mathematics (USA-STEM) would be distributed \n     to states on the basis of the size of their congressional \n     delegations and awarded on the basis of national \n     examinations. An award would provide up to $20,000 annually \n     for tuition and fees.\n       Action C-2: Increase the number of U.S. citizens pursuing \n     graduate study in ``areas of national need'' by funding 5,000 \n     new graduate fellowships each year. NSF should administer the \n     program and draw on the advice of other Federal research \n     agencies to define national needs. The focus on national \n     needs is important both to ensure an adequate supply of \n     doctoral scientists and engineers and to ensure that there \n     are appropriate employment opportunities for students once \n     they receive their degrees. Portable fellowships would \n     provide funds of up to $20,000 annually directly to students, \n     who would choose where to pursue graduate studies instead of \n     being required to follow faculty research grants.\n       Action C-3: Provide a Federal tax credit to encourage \n     employers to make continuing education available (either \n     internally or through colleges and universities) to \n     practicing scientists and engineers. These incentives would \n     promote career-long learning to keep the workforce current in \n     the face of rapidly evolving scientific and engineering \n     discoveries and technological advances and would allow for \n     retraining to meet new demands of the job market.\n       Action C-4: Continue to improve visa processing for \n     international students and scholars to provide less complex \n     procedures and continue to make improvements on such issues \n     as visa categories and duration, travel for scientific \n     meetings, the technology-alert list, reciprocity agreements, \n     and changes in status.\n       Action C-5: Provide a 1-year automatic visa extension to \n     international students who receive doctorates or the \n     equivalent in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, \n     or other fields of national need at qualified U.S. \n     institutions to remain in the United States to seek \n     employment. If these students are offered jobs by United \n     States-based employers and pass a security screening test, \n     they should be provided automatic work permits and expedited \n     residence status. If students are unable to obtain employment \n     within 1 year, their visas would expire.\n       Action C-6: Institute a new skills-based, preferential \n     immigration option. Doctoral-level education and science and \n     engineering skills would substantially raise an applicant's \n     chances and priority in obtaining U.S. citizenship. In the \n     interim, the number of H-1B visas should be increased by \n     10,000, and the additional visas should be available for \n     industry to hire science and engineering applicants with \n     doctorates from U.S. universities.\n       Action C-7: Reform the current system of ``deemed \n     exports''. The new system should provide international \n     students and researchers engaged in fundamental research in \n     the United States with access to information and research \n     equipment in U.S. industrial, academic, and national \n     laboratories comparable with the access provided to U.S. \n     citizens and permanent residents in a similar status. It \n     would, of course, exclude information and facilities \n     restricted under national-security regulations. In addition, \n     the effect of deemed-exports regulations on the education and \n     fundamental research work of international students and \n     scholars should be limited by removing all technology items \n     (information and equipment) from the deemed-exports \n     technology list that are available for purchase on the \n     overseas open market from foreign or U.S. companies or that \n     have manuals that are available in the public domain, in \n     libraries, over the Internet, or from manufacturers.\n\n\n        incentives for innovation and the investment environment\n\n       Recommendation D: Ensure that the United States is the \n     premier place in the world to innovate; invest in downstream \n     activities such as manufacturing and marketing; and create \n     high-paying jobs that are\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\n     based on innovation by modernizing the patent system, \n     realigning tax policies to encourage innovation, and ensuring \n     affordable broadband access.\n       Action D-1: Enhance intellectual-property protection for \n     the 21st century global economy to ensure that systems for \n     protecting patents and other forms of intellectual property \n     underlie the emerging knowledge economy but allow research to \n     enhance innovation. The patent system requires reform of four \n     specific kinds:\n       Provide the Patent and Trademark Office sufficient \n     resources to make intellectual-property protection more \n     timely, predictable, and effective.\n       Reconfigure the U.S. patent system by switching to a \n     ``first-inventor-to-file'' system and by instituting \n     administrative review after a patent is granted. Those \n     reforms would bring the U.S. system into alignment with \n     patent systems in Europe and Japan.\n       Shield research uses of patented inventions from \n     infringement liability. One recent court decision could \n     jeopardize the long-assumed ability of academic researchers \n     to use patented inventions for research.\n       Change intellectual-property laws that act as barriers to \n     innovation in specific industries, such as those related to \n     data exclusivity (in pharmaceuticals) and those which \n     increase the volume and unpredictability of litigation \n     (especially in information-technology industries).\n       Action D-2: Enact a stronger research and development tax \n     credit to encourage private investment in innovation. The \n     current Research and Experimentation Tax Credit goes to \n     companies that increase their research and development \n     spending above a base amount calculated from their spending \n     in prior years. Congress and the administration should make \n     the credit permanent, and it should be increased from 20% to \n     40% of the qualifying increase so that the U.S. tax credit is \n     competitive with that of other countries. The credit should \n     be extended to companies that have consistently spent large \n     amounts on research and development so that they will not be \n     subject to the current de facto penalties for previously \n     investing in research and development.\n       Action D-3: Provide tax incentives for United States-based \n     innovation. Many policies and programs affect innovation and \n     the nation's ability to profit from it. It was not possible \n     for the committee to conduct an exhaustive examination, but \n     alternatives to current economic policies should be examined \n     and, if deemed beneficial to the United States, pursued. \n     These alternatives could include changes in overall corporate \n     tax rates, provision of incentives for the purchase of high-\n     technology research and manufacturing equipment, treatment of \n     capital gains, and incentives for long-term investments in \n     innovation. The Council of Economic Advisers and the \n     Congressional Budget Office should conduct a comprehensive \n     analysis to examine how the United States compares with other \n     nations as a location for innovation and related activities \n     with a view to ensuring that the United States is one of the \n     most attractive places in the world for long-term innovation-\n     related investment. From a tax standpoint, that is not now \n     the case.\n       Action D-4: Ensure ubiquitous broadband Internet access. \n     Several nations are well ahead of the United States in \n     providing broadband access for home, school, and business. \n     That capability will do as much to drive innovation, the \n     economy, and job creation in the 21st century as did access \n     to the telephone, interstate highways, and air travel into \n     the 20th century. Congress and the administration should take \n     action--mainly in the regulatory arena and in spectrum \n     management--to ensure widespread affordable broadband access \n     in the near future.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The committee believes that its recommendations and the \n     actions proposed to implement them merit serious \n     consideration if we are to ensure that our nation continues \n     to enjoy the jobs, security, and high standard of living that \n     this and previous generations worked so hard to create. \n     Although the committee was asked only to recommend actions \n     that can be taken by the federal government, it is clear that \n     related actions at the state and local levels are equally \n     important for U.S. prosperity, as are actions taken by each \n     American family. The United States faces an enormous \n     challenge because of the disadvantage it faces in labor cost. \n     Science and technology provide the opportunity to overcome \n     that disadvantage by creating scientists and engineers with \n     the ability to create entire new industries--much as has been \n     done in the past.\n       It is easy to be complacent about U.S. competitiveness and \n     pre-eminence in science and technology. We have led the world \n     for decades, and we continue to do so in many research fields \n     today. But the world is changing rapidly, and our advantages \n     are no longer unique. Without a renewed effort to bolster the \n     foundations of our competitiveness, we can expect to lose our \n     privileged position. For the first time in generations, the \n     nation's children could face poorer prospects than their \n     parents and grandparents did. We owe our current prosperity, \n     security, and good health to the investments of past \n     generations, and we are obliged to renew those commitments in \n     education, research, and innovation policies to ensure that \n     the American people continue to benefit from the remarkable \n     opportunities provided by the rapid development of the global \n     economy and its not inconsiderable underpinning in science \n     and technology.\n\n\n                       SOME WORRISOME INDICATORS\n\n       When asked in spring 2005 what is the most attractive place \n     in the world in which to ``lead a good life'', respondents in \n     only one of the 16 countries polled (India) indicated the \n     United States.\n       For the cost of one chemist or one engineer in the United \n     States, a company can hire about five chemists in China or 11 \n     engineers in India.\n       For the first time, the most capable high-energy particle \n     accelerator on Earth will, beginning in 2007, reside outside \n     the United States.\n       The United States is today a net importer of high-\n     technology products. Its share of global high-technology \n     exports has fallen in the last 2 decades from 30% to 17%, and \n     its trade balance in high-technology manufactured goods \n     shifted from plus $33 billion in 1990 to a negative $24 \n     billion in 2004.\n       Chemical companies closed 70 facilities in the United \n     States in 2004 and have tagged 40 more for shutdown. Of 120 \n     chemical plants being built around the world with price tags \n     of $1 billion or more, one is in the United States and 50 in \n     China.\n       Fewer than one-third of U.S. 4th grade and 8th grade \n     students performed at or above a level called ``proficient'' \n     in mathematics; ``proficiency'' was considered the ability to \n     exhibit competence with challenging subject matter. \n     Alarmingly, about one-third of the 4th graders and one-fifth \n     of the 8th graders lacked the competence to perform basic \n     mathematical computations.\n       U.S. 12th graders recently performed below the \n     international average for 21 countries on a test of general \n     knowledge in mathematics and science. In addition, an \n     advanced mathematics assessment was administered to U.S. \n     students who were taking or had taken precalculus, calculus, \n     or Advanced Placement calculus and to students in 15 other \n     countries who were taking or had taken advanced mathematics \n     courses. Eleven nations outperformed the United States, and \n     four countries had scores similar to the U.S. scores. No \n     nation scored significantly below the United States.\n       In 1999, only 41% of U.S. 8th grade students received \n     instruction from a mathematics teacher who specialized in \n     mathematics, considerably lower than the international \n     average of 71%.\n       In one recent period, low-wage employers, such as Wal-Mart \n     (now the nation's largest employer) and McDonald's, created \n     44% of the new jobs, while high-wage employers created only \n     29% of the new jobs.\n       In 2003, only three American companies ranked among the top \n     10 recipients of patents granted by the United States Patent \n     and Trademark Office.\n       In Germany, 36% of undergraduates receive their degrees in \n     science and engineering. In China, the figure is 59%, and in \n     Japan 66%. In the United States, the corresponding figure is \n     32%.\n       The United States is said to have 10.5 million illegal \n     immigrants, but under the law the number of visas set aside \n     for ``highly qualified foreign workers'' dropped to 65,000 a \n     year from its 195,000 peak.\n       In 2004, China graduated over 600,000 engineers, India \n     350,000, and America about 70,000.\n       In 2001 (the most recent year for which data are \n     available), U.S. industry spent more on tort litigation than \n     on R\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 14, 2005]\n\n                         Keeping Us in the Race\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       What if we were really having a national discussion about \n     what is most important to the country today and on the minds \n     of most parents?\n       I have no doubt that it would be a loud, noisy dinner-table \n     conversation about why so many U.S. manufacturers are moving \n     abroad--not just to find lower wages, but to find smarter \n     workers, better infrastructure and cheaper health care. It \n     would be about why in Germany, 36 percent of undergrads \n     receive degrees in science and engineering; in China, 59 \n     percent; in Japan, 66 percent; and in America, only 32 \n     percent. It would be about why Japanese on bullet trains can \n     get access to the Internet with cellphones, and Americans get \n     their cellphone service interrupted five minutes from home.\n       It would be about why U.S. 12th graders recently performed \n     below the international average for 21 countries in math and \n     science, and it would be about why, in recent years, U.S. \n     industry appears to have spent more on lawsuits than on R. \n     Yes, we'd be talking about why the world is racing us to the \n     top, not the bottom, and why we are quietly falling behind.\n       And late in the evening, as the wine bottles emptied, \n     someone at the national dinner table might finally say: \n     ``Hey, what if we were really thinking ahead? What if we \n     asked some of the country's best minds to make a list of the \n     steps we could take right now to enhance America's technology \n     base?''\n       Fortunately, two senators, Lamar Alexander and Jeff \n     Bingaman, asked the National Academy of Sciences, the \n     National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine \n     to form a bipartisan study group to produce just such a list, \n     which was released on Wednesday in a report called ``Rising \n     Above the Gathering Storm.''\n       Because of globalization, the report begins, U.S. ``workers \n     in virtually every sector must now face competitors who live \n     just a mouse-click away in Ireland, Finland, India or dozens \n     of other nations whose economies are growing. Having reviewed \n     the trends in the\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\n     United States and abroad, the committee is deeply concerned \n     that the scientific and technical building blocks of our \n     economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other \n     nations are gathering strength. We are worried about the \n     future prosperity of the United States. We fear the \n     abruptness with which a lead in science and technology can be \n     lost and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost--if \n     indeed it can be regained at all.''\n       The report's key recommendations? Nothing fancy. Charles \n     Vest, the former president of M.I.T., summed them up: ``We \n     need to get back to basic blocking and tackling''--educating \n     more Americans in the skills needed for 21st-century jobs.\n       Among the top priorities, the report says, should be these:\n       (1) Annually recruiting 10,000 science and math teachers by \n     awarding four-year merit-based scholarships, to be paid back \n     through five years of K-12 public school teaching. (We have \n     too many unqualified science and math teachers.)\n       (2) Strengthening the math and science skills of 250,000 \n     other teachers through extracurricular programs.\n       (3) Creating opportunities and incentives for many more \n     middle school and high school students to take advanced math \n     and science courses, by offering, among other things, $100 \n     mini-scholarships for success in exams, and creating more \n     specialty math-and-science schools.\n       (4) Increasing federal investment in long-term basic \n     research by 10 percent a year over the next seven years.\n       (5) Annually providing research grants of $500,000 each, \n     payable over five years, to 200 of America's most outstanding \n     young researchers.\n       (6) Creating a new Advanced Research Projects Agency in the \n     Energy Department to support ``creative out-of-the-box \n     transformational energy research that industry by itself \n     cannot or will not support and in which risk may be high, but \n     success would provide dramatic benefits for the nation.''\n       (7) Granting automatic one-year visa extensions to foreign \n     students in the U.S. who receive doctorates in science, \n     engineering or math so they can seek employment here, and \n     creating 5,000 National Science Foundation-administered \n     graduate fellowships to increase the number of U.S. citizens \n     earning doctoral degrees in fields of ``national need.'' (See \n     the rest at www.nationalacademies.org .)\n       These proposals are the new New Deal urgently called for by \n     our times. This is where President Bush should have focused \n     his second term, instead of squandering it on a silly, \n     ideological jag called Social Security privatization. \n     Because, as this report concludes, ``Without a renewed effort \n     to bolster the foundations of our competitiveness, we can \n     expect to lose our privileged position.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11350-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Not later than 180 days after the end of the \n     fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall submit a \n     report to Congress on the amount of the acquisitions made by \n     the agency from entities that manufacture the articles, \n     materials, or supplies outside of the United States in that \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) The report required by subsection (a) shall separately \n     indicate--\n       (1) the dollar value of any articles, materials, or \n     supplies purchased that were manufactured outside of the \n     United States;\n       (2) an itemized list of all waivers granted with respect to \n     such articles, materials, or supplies under the Buy American \n     Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.); and\n       (3) a summary of the total procurement funds spent on goods \n     manufactured in the United States versus funds spent on goods \n     manufactured outside of the United States.\n       (c) The head of each Federal agency submitting a report \n     under subsection (a) shall make the report publicly available \n     to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\n       (d) This section shall not apply to acquisitions made by an \n     agency, or component thereof, that is an element of the \n     intelligence community as set forth in or designated under \n     section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     401a(4)).\n       Sec. 839. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     executive branch agency shall purchase, construct, and/or \n     lease any additional facilities, except within or contiguous \n     to existing locations, to be used for the purpose of \n     conducting Federal law enforcement training without the \n     advance approval of the Committees on Appropriations, except \n     that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is \n     authorized to obtain the temporary use of additional \n     facilities by lease, contract, or other agreement for \n     training which cannot be accommodated in existing Center \n     facilities.\n       Sec. 840. Notwithstanding section 1346 of title 31, United \n     States Code, and section 809 of this Act and any other \n     provision of law, the head of each appropriate executive \n     department and agency shall transfer to or reimburse the \n     Federal Aviation Administration, upon the direction of the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, funds made \n     available by this or any other Act for the purposes described \n     below, and shall submit budget requests for such purposes. \n     These funds shall be administered by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, in consultation with the appropriate \n     interagency groups designated by the Director and shall be \n     used to ensure the uninterrupted, continuous operation of the \n     Midway Atoll Airfield by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     pursuant to an operational agreement with the Department of \n     the Interior for the entirety of fiscal year 2006 and any \n     period thereafter that precedes the enactment of the \n     Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006. \n     The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     mandate the necessary transfers after determining an \n     equitable allocation between the appropriate executive \n     departments and agencies of the responsibility for funding \n     the continuous operation of the Midway Atoll Airfield based \n     on, but not limited to, potential use, interest in \n     maintaining aviation safety, and applicability to \n     governmental operations and agency mission. The total funds \n     transferred or reimbursed shall not exceed $6,000,000 for any \n     twelve-month period. Such sums shall be sufficient to ensure \n     continued operation of the airfield throughout the period \n     cited above. Funds shall be available for operation of the \n     airfield or airfield-related capital upgrades. The Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget shall notify the \n     Committees on Appropriations of such transfers or \n     reimbursements within 15 days of this Act. Such transfers or \n     reimbursements shall begin within 30 days of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       Sec. 841. Section 4(b) of the Federal Activities Inventory \n     Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-270) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Executive agencies with fewer than 100 full-time \n     employees as of the first day of the fiscal year. However, \n     such an agency shall be subject to section 2 to the extent it \n     plans to conduct a public-private competition for the \n     performance of an activity that is not inherently \n     governmental.''.\n       Sec. 842. Unless otherwise authorized by existing law, none \n     of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act, may be \n     used by an executive branch agency to produce any prepackaged \n     news story intended for broadcast or distribution in the \n     United States unless the story includes a clear notification \n     within the text or audio of the prepackaged news story that \n     the prepackaged news story was prepared or funded by that \n     executive branch agency.\n       Sec. 843. Competitive Sourcing. (a) Requirement for Public-\n     Private Competition.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the \n     funds appropriated by this or any other Act shall be \n     available to convert to contractor performance an activity or \n     function of an executive agency, that on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, is performed by more than 10 Federal \n     employees unless--\n       (A) the conversion is based on the result of a public-\n     private competition that includes a most efficient and cost \n     effective organization plan developed by such activity or \n     function; and\n       (B) the Competitive Sourcing Official determines that, over \n     all performance periods stated in the solicitation of offers \n     for performance of the activity or function, the cost of \n     performance of the activity or function by a contractor would \n     be less costly to the executive agency by an amount that \n     equals or exceeds the lesser of--\n       (i) 10 percent of the most efficient organization's \n     personnel-related costs for performance of that activity or \n     function by Federal employees; or\n       (ii) $10,000,000.\n       (2) This paragraph shall not apply to--\n       (A) a commercial or industrial type function that--\n       (i) is included on the procurement list established \n     pursuant to section 2 of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 \n     U.S.C. 47); or\n       (ii) is planned to be converted to performance by a \n     qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or by a qualified \n     nonprofit agency for other severely handicapped individuals \n     in accordance with that Act.\n       (B) depot contracts or contracts for depot maintenance as \n     provided in sections 2469 and 2474 of title 10, United States \n     Code; or\n       (C) activities that are the subject of an ongoing \n     competition that was publicly announced prior to the date of \n     enactment of this act.\n       (b) Use of Public-Private Competition.--Nothing in Office \n     of Management and Budget Circular A-76 shall prevent the head \n     of an executive agency from conducting a public-private \n     competition to evaluate the benefits of converting work from \n     contract performance to performance by Federal employees in \n     appropriate instances. The Circular shall provide procedures \n     and policies for these competitions that are similar to those \n     applied to competitions that may result in the conversion of \n     work from performance by Federal employees to performance by \n     a contractor.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation, Treasury, \n     the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk to the substitute be agreed to, the committee substitute \nnow as amended be agreed to, and it be considered as original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment, with no points of order waived by \nvirtue of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2060) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2060\n\n       Strike section 719.\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I rise, after 2\\1/\n2\\ months of waiting, to introduce the Transportation, Treasury, HUD, \nJudiciary, and related agencies fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. \nMy invaluable partner, the distinguished Senator from Washington, is \nbeing held up by airline delays, something that most of us in this body \nare acquainted with, so I will go ahead and present my opening \nstatement and open the floor for business and reserve her time until \nshe is able to get here.\n  This bill is the first real appropriations product of a brand-new \nsubcommittee that grew out of the reorganization of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee from earlier this year. It is a substantial \nand complex bill that will have a significant and, we hope, positive \nimpact on every State and community in this Nation, as it covers, among \nother things, every mode of transportation, financial services, and IRS \nrequirements, as guided by the Department of Treasury, the Federal \nresponsibility for housing and economic development under HUD, as well \nas the funding for the executive office of the President, for the \nFederal judicial system, and for other related agencies, such as GSA, \nOPM, and the Postal Service.\n  My view is that this is a good product, as good a product as we could \nhave produced given the circumstances in our allocation. I give \ntremendous credit and thanks to my friend and colleague, the ranking \nmember, Senator Murray, for her hard work, dedication, and commitment \nto working with me in a bipartisan manner to craft this legislation. As \nI said, this is a brand-new bill for us, for our staffs, and for this \nbody to consider. I think it is a good bill and that is due, in no \nsmall part, because of the participation of Senator Murray and her \npartnership with me in the legislative process. I look forward to \nworking with her through conference and final passage.\n  We started with a budget that severely underfunded many of the \nimportant programs in this bill. These are programs that historically \nhave been supported in large numbers by the Members this body. \nThankfully, in most cases we have been able to restore many of the cuts \nand shortfalls, and for that we especially thank Chairman Cochran and \nthe ranking member, Senator Byrd, who demonstrated their understanding \nand sensitivity to the needs of the Transportation-Treasury \nappropriations subcommittee. Without Chairman Cochran's help and \nSenator Byrd's acquiescence, we would have been unable to meet the \nfunding needs of most of our programs, as well as Members' priorities. \nThis bill as well is within our section 302(b) allocation of $65.819 \nbillion of budget authority and $122.064 billion in outlays.\n  In particular, despite our fiscal limitations, we worked diligently \nto ensure that transportation programs in this bill are adequately \nfunded. One of our highest priorities in fashioning the bill was to \nmeet the Federal responsibilities to provide funding for the safety, \nconstruction, and maintenance of our highways, transit systems, and \nairports. Funding of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and \nespecially for our highway and road network, creates jobs and promotes \neconomic growth. More importantly, it\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nguarantees the continued growth of our economic infrastructure by which \nwe serve our markets throughout the Nation and ultimately the world. \nOur transportation system, the system that brought our country together \nin the 19th century, is still the heart and the arteries by which we \npump our goods and products, which guarantees our current and future \nprosperity in the national and international marketplace. We cannot \nafford to shortchange this system.\n  Moreover, the delay in passing the surface transportation \nauthorization, SAFETEA, made it difficult to recommend funding for the \nFederal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration. I will not go into reasons for the delay \nin that, having had a hand in that operation, as has the occupant of \nthe chair. He and I both did. In many cases, the committee funding \nlevels for this bill were based on our best guess on how a program \nwould fare in the authorization process.\n  Some guesses were better than others.\n  Clearly, a number of changes will have to be made to this \nappropriations bill to be more consistent with safety. I am exited to \nbe addressing these issues in conference.\n  Next, the bill provides $14.78 billion for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. This is approximately $400 million more than the \nrequest. The recommendation includes $14.3 million to hire safety \ninspectors and to accelerate restoring the inspector staffing level. It \nalso adds $4 million to restore engineering and inspector staffing at \nthe Office of Certification so that new equipment and technologies can \nbe approved for use in aviation and so that our Nation can retain \nleadership in aviation.\n  I am pleased to announce that the bill does not cut the Airport \nImprovement Program by $500 million as proposed in the budget request. \nAlso, on the good news side, we have been able to fund Amtrak at $1.45 \nbillion while taking some incremental steps to reform how Amtrak \nconducts its business. These reforms include enforcement of a \nprohibition currently in law that prohibits Amtrak from subsidizing \nlosses from its food and beverage service. Most people can't believe it \nwhen we tell them that Amtrak currently spends $2 for every $1 received \nfor food and beverage service. We can no longer afford to pay for that \nluxury while failing to address the operational shortfall and serve \ninfrastructure needs in the Northeast corridor.\n  This bill also authorizes Amtrak to impose a Federal surcharge on \ntickets to address infrastructure needs. This surcharge will only go \ninto effect upon a finding by Amtrak that such surcharges would not \ndepress ticket sales.\n  Finally, we would allow Amtrak to establish assessments on commuter \nrail authorities for their use of Amtrak-owned rail segments as another \nway to begin addressing the capital needs of the Northeast corridor.\n  These are modest but we believe very significant attempts to offset \nsome of the costs that we cannot and should not provide.\n  I am also very supportive of the efforts of Senator Stevens and \nSenator Lott to move a comprehensive Amtrak reform bill through the \nCommerce Committee that will balance the funding needs for all Amtrak \nrail service.\n  We hope our modest attempts to offset certain costs can be seen as a \nstepping stone to the Commerce Committee's reform bill. There is one \nmajor disappointment in this operation, however, and that is the \nadministration's posture on Amtrak funding and reform. The \nadministration has threatened to veto this bill if the Amtrak funding \nlevel of $1.45 billion is maintained without substantial reform.\n  I have no problem with reform and indeed recognize its need. But the \nsad fact is, the administration has failed to provide adequate guidance \nand/or leadership on this issue. Even more troubling is the \nadministration's position that even were adequate reform to be \nproposed, OMB would not provide the budget amendment to supplement the \n$360 million recommended in the administration's 2006 budget, and $360 \nmillion is likely not even enough to support the cost of bankruptcy for \nAmtrak which would be a tremendously costly financial and economic \nburden to the Nation and send Amtrak into chaos and great consternation \nfor the people throughout the Nation.\n  For the Department of Treasury, the bill provides about $11.7 billion \nfor fiscal year 2006. This amount is about $50 million above the budget \nrequest and some $475 million above the fiscal year 2005 enacted level.\n  To help fight the war on terrorism, we have provided full funding for \nthe Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. I \nstrongly support Treasury's antiterrorism efforts. I commend them on it \nbecause I believe this is a vital and unique role in cutting off \nfinancial assistance to terrorist organizations, and without that \nassistance they will not be nearly as robust, and they will not provide \nnearly the challenge to our safety and security that they would were we \nnot able to cut off these ties.\n  There has been a lot of talk and Members here and people across the \ncountry are concerned about the so-called ``tax gap''--the difference \nbetween what is actually collected and what is owed. To help close that \ngap we continue providing for taxpayer services. We have provided $10.7 \nbillion for the IRS, including $6.9 billion for tax enforcement \nactivities. This amount is $443 million above the fiscal year 2005 \nenacted level.\n  These additional funds will help ensure that there will be less fraud \nand that honest taxpayers will have a greater level of confidence in \nour tax system. If average citizens do not believe others are paying \nwhat they owe, there is much less incentive to do the right thing and \npay the taxes that are owed.\n  We provided full funding for IRS's modernization efforts through its \nbusiness system modernization program. Currently, this program is IRS's \nhighest management and administrative priority.\n  Turning to the Federal judiciary, the bill includes a total \nappropriation of $5.8 billion which is a 6.5-percent increase over the \nfiscal year 2005 enacted level. This represents the funding necessary \nto meet the judiciary's fiscal year 2006 funding needs.\n  For HUD, the bill provides some $30.6 billion for fiscal year 2006, \nan increase of $5.6 billion over the request for Housing and Urban \nDevelopment activities. These additional funds include almost $4.35 \nbillion for the Community Development Fund and the CDBG which was \nslated for elimination through a reduction of over 30 percent of the \nfunding, and consolidation and submersion of the activities along with \nother programs into a new grant program within the Department of \nCommerce which, in my view, does not have the expertise and should not \nbe involved in Housing and Urban Development's very well connected \nactivities.\n  This bill also reduces a proposed rescission of ``excess'' section 8 \nfunds from $2.5 billion to $1.5 billion. Neither HUD nor the Office of \nManagement and Budget, when called before our committee, could identify \nthe rescission source. We asked them: Where is the money coming from? \nThey said: Well, we do not know, but it has been there in the past.\n  I explained to them that our Appropriations Committee had worked with \nHUD and OMB to change the manner of allocating HUD section 8 funds so \nthere would not be that amount left over. Nevertheless, they chose to \nignore that process in which they had been deeply involved, and asking \nfor $2.5 billion when we don't see any evidence that they know it is \nthere would result in cuts to priority programs, such as programs for \nthe homeless, section 202 housing for the elderly, housing for people \nwith AIDS, public housing, and the very important home program that \ngives local governments the resources to make housing-targeted \ninvestments in their own community.\n\n  In addition, I am happy to report that we have adequately funded \nalmost all HUD programs at a minimum of last year's level, which is \ngenerally higher than the request.\n  Moving next to the Executive Office of the President, we basically \nfunded them at the request level, acceding to their request to merge \nthe Office of Policy Development into the White House Office Salaries \nand Expenses Account as the administration requested.\n  We have also fully funded the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nProgram at $227 million despite the budget\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nrequest which would have funded it at $100 million in the Department of \nJustice.\n  My colleagues and I know from listening to law enforcement personnel \nin our States that this has been a critically important program which \nhas been successful throughout the Nation in helping to root out and \neradicate methamphetamine production, marijuana and ecstasy use, as \nwell as heroin and cocaine importation. This program was especially \nimportant in Missouri where methamphetamine production and use has \nreached almost epidemic proportions. It absolutely affects and taints \nevery community in this Nation, no matter how large or how small. The \ntoll of methamphetamine production, distribution, use, and addiction is \nsomething that Missouri has found much to our distress as we have \nbecome one of the leaders in its use, and the Nation has a far too high \nprice to pay in human terms as well as in economic terms.\n  Finally, we are facing a crisis precipitated by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. The extent of \nthe damage and human tragedy in New Orleans and parts of Louisiana \nbecause of these hurricanes is virtually unprecedented in the history \nof natural disasters in our Nation.\n  While there is much to be done, I am optimistic and confident that \nthe Nation will do what is necessary to overcome this tragedy.\n  I am hopeful that Members will wait until the coming Katrina and Rita \nsupplemental to offer amendments. A piecemeal approach on different \nappropriations bills is not the way to go. I understand the urge to \nwant to do something immediately, but we learned a lot of lessons in \nNew York from 9/11 and previous natural disasters, and we need to apply \nthose lessons carefully, consistently, and in a comprehensive manner to \nNew Orleans, to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  What we need first is a fully functioning FEMA with leadership and \nadequate resources. I believe the administration is taking the needed \nsteps to reach that goal. While there are still things needing to be \ndone, FEMA has all the necessary authority and funding to meet all the \ncurrent initial needs. FEMA has the know-how and the people on the \nground. It is slow going, no doubt, but it is beginning to work. Once \nthe initial assessment is complete, then and only then is the time to \nadd additional necessary funding and the needed authorities for other \nFederal agencies to help the Katrina-Rita recovery efforts.\n  For example, this means education assistance to ensure available, \ngood educational opportunities and continuity in that education. It \nmeans any needed unemployment assistance and job creation initiatives \nas we rebuild the New Orleans area. It means housing vouchers and other \nhousing assistance options. It means establishing new entities such as \na local public benefit corporation similar to the Lower Manhattan \nDevelopment Corporation which was created in the aftermath of 9/11 as a \nway to rebuild Manhattan. It means rebuilding roads and much of the \ntransportation infrastructure. It means special health care assistance. \nAnd it means EPA environmental contamination assistance to complete the \ncleanup of the disaster area.\n  I think we also need to look closely at how best to rebuild New \nOrleans and the surrounding parishes. As we have long known--especially \nnow that Katrina and Rita have delivered such a devastating wake-up \nblow--much of New Orleans is below sea level and likely will remain \nexposed and vulnerable to some level of annual flooding, to the type of \nhorrific damage and loss of life that was caused by Katrina and Rita.\n  I do not think it is enough just to build stronger and bigger levees. \nThe plan must be more thoughtful, and we will need to ensure that the \npoorest households, including those who live in public and assisted \nhousing, are not just relocated to the most risky neighborhoods. In \nfact, we must think hard about whether to rebuild many of the \nneighborhoods most at risk of hurricane damage and flooding.\n  I also strongly urge that any rebuilding plans try to ensure those \npersons and families who have been displaced by Katrina and Rita are \ngiven an opportunity to rebuild their communities and a right of first \nrefusal to any housing that is rebuilt. However, let me emphasize that \nthis is not the right bill on which to rush to create and fund new \nprograms. There will be another supplemental in the next week or so, \nand that bill is the appropriate vehicle in which to seek funding and \nestablish new programs as appropriate.\n  I understand everyone wants to help and to do what is right. However, \nwe must proceed thoughtfully. We need to work together based on \nknowledge and need.\n  As for the progress on this bill, I understand from the leadership \nthat they are looking for a vote that would be held at 5:30. We are \npreparing to offer that amendment.\n\n  I make a particular point to my colleagues and staff who are \nlistening that we are open for business. This bill has been hanging out \nthere since mid-July. People have had an opportunity to look at it. I \nhope Members with well-crafted, relevant amendments will come forward \nin order to get this bill completed without further disruption to the \nvital entities and activities we fund. We would like to finish it, if \npossible, by Wednesday night. At this juncture we do not know how many \namendments will be offered. I ask all staff involved to let the \nmajority and minority staff know what amendments Members are planning \nto propose, when Members are planning to propose them. We will work \nwith you. If they are ones we can accept, we would like to do that.\n  It is imperative to continue the activities not just of the Treasury \nand other governmental agencies but for Transportation, for Housing and \nUrban Development, to move forward on this bill so they will know the \nfunds are available.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2061\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2061.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Clarifies the ability of HUD to recover assets used in \n                  violation of a regulatory agreement)\n\n       Insert the following on page 348, after line 5, and \n     renumber sections accordingly:\n       Sec. 321. Section 421 of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1987 (12 U.S.C. Sec. 1715z-4a) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1)(A), by inserting after ``is'' the \n     following: ``or, at the time of the violations, was''; and\n       (2) in subsection (a)(1)(C), by inserting after ``held'' \n     the following: ``or, at the time of the violations, was \n     insured or held''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I understand there is a previous order and a vote will \noccur at 5:30. Has that agreement been reached?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No formal agreement has been reached to that \neffect.\n  Mr. BOND. We will hope to set that time as soon as we get concurrence \nfrom the leadership on both sides.\n  With that, I will explain briefly what this amendment does. It \nrevises section 421 of the Housing and Community Act of 1987 to clarify \nHUD's authority to recover any assets or income of a multifamily \nproject where those funds are used in violation of the project's \nregulatory agreement.\n  This provision is intended to ensure that HUD and the Federal \nGovernment can recover losses from owners of multifamily housing who \nhave intentionally and fraudulently skimmed equity from an FHA-insured \nproject for their own benefit. Without this technical correction, HUD \nends up paying the lender the value of a defaulted FHA-insured mortgage \nthat should have been paid off by the owner of a multihousing project \nout of rent receipts. Too often, the FHA or, more specifically, the \npockets of the taxpayers of the United States fund the loss.\n  In the year 2000, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nMissouri issued an unpublished decision in United States v. Crosswinds \nwhich effectively holds that the U.S. Government may only bring actions \nto recover assets used in violation of a regulatory agreement if HUD \nholds or insures the mortgage covering the multifamily project both at \nthe time of the\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nregulatory agreement violation and at the time that recovery action is \nfiled in district court.\n  As a practical matter, HUD often disposes of a property or a mortgage \nlong after it has an opportunity to act on an owner's misuse of \nproperty assets by equity skimming. This makes the current statute \nessentially a nullity, with a practical consequence that HUD is unable \nto pursue a recovery of assets no matter how abusive an owner has been.\n  That was never the intent of the statute. With this amendment we are \nrevising the section in accordance with the original intent of the \nlegislation. Without this authority, HUD and the Department of Justice \nhave limited or no ability to recover assets from owners who have \nintentionally defrauded the Government by pocketing funds that are \nderived from rents paid by tenants and intended to be used to pay the \noutstanding obligation on an FHA-insured mortgage.\n  I will wait for a leadership agreement and at that time I will ask \nfor the yeas and nays on this amendment. For the information of our \ncolleagues, we were initially advised that timeframe would be 5:30, so \nthat is the timeframe we are working out, but we are still waiting to \nhear from the leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am told that Senator Murray, the ranking member of this \nappropriations subcommittee, is delayed but apparently has landed and \nis on her way to the Senate. It would be, I am sure, her intention to \noffer an opening statement.\n  Mr. BOND. We reserved time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If it is all right with the chairman of the subcommittee \nto speak in morning business for 10 minutes, with the understanding if \nSenator Murray arrives during that time I will be happy to relinquish \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what my colleague from North Dakota has just \ntalked about is one of the mind-boggling events that has all of us not \nonly stumped but outraged. I believe it is long past due that we get \ntight control over how the money is being spent.\n  As we talk about the need to offset moneys going to the disaster, the \nfirst place we ought to look is money that might otherwise be wasted. \nSo I believe that while there is going to be a significant Federal \ninvestment, it needs to be refined, targeted, and managed effectively \nso we will not see examples of this, the rental of cruise ships and \nother items that make no sense.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe this request has been cleared by both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the pending Bond amendment No. 2061, with no \nsecond degrees in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, do I need to ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending business to offer an amendment, or may \nI simply offer an amendment at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment must be laid aside.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be done so I can \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2062\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2062.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 2006)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   CONGRESS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjustment \n     shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) (relating to cost of \n     living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will simply describe the amendment's \ncontent.\n  What this amendment does is provide that for this coming year--the \nfiscal year which began this October--the annual COLA for Members of \nCongress not go into effect. That pay increase, in effect, is estimated \nto be at about 1.9 percent for Members of Congress, and it actually \ntakes effect in January or February. The amendment is projected to save \nabout $2 million for the Federal Treasury.\n  Mr. President, as you know, some years the COLA has gone into effect \nand other years Congress has not had the COLA go into effect for \nMembers of Congress. The reason for not having it go into effect this \nyear, frankly, is symbolic. We know we are going to be spending a lot \nof taxpayer dollars to help rebuild the gulf coast area following the \nhurricane and the related events to that. We also know that unless we \nfind ways to offset that spending, we are going to go further into \ndebt, that our deficit for this year will increase. So the leaders of \nboth the House and the Senate have asked the various committees to find \nways to reduce spending in other areas so we can offset some of the \nexpense of this reconstruction with that reduced spending.\n  It seemed to me and others--and I will ask unanimous consent in a \nmoment to have some others added as original cosponsors--one way we \nmight encourage others to come forth with potential savings is to \ndemonstrate we ourselves are willing to forgo this COLA, this cost-of-\nliving increase, for this coming year. As I said, while it is not a lot \nof money in the overall Federal budget, for each Member of the Senate, \nobviously, it represents an increase in salary that I am sure would be \nappreciated by all of our families. Nonetheless, it is a contribution \nwe can make to these rebuilding efforts. I hope my colleagues will \nagree with me this would be an appropriate thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Santorum and \nCornyn be added as original cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, just one other point. The 2006 budget \nresolution instructions require savings of $34.7 billion. The House is \nexpected to modify that resolution to increase the amount of savings to \nat least $50 billion for the expenditures I talked about earlier.\n  We have approved already about $71 billion, approximately $20 billion \nof which has already been spent, as I am informed, for the Katrina-\nrelated relief spending. That is why it seems to me it would be useful \nto demonstrate our commitment to offsetting part of this spending so \nthat the budget deficit for this year and eventually the debt of the \nUnited States would not be unduly increased as a result of our desire \nto rebuild part of the gulf coast following the hurricane.\n  I hope at the appropriate time my colleagues will agree with me that \nthis is a gesture the Members of the Senate ought to make and that we \ncan make and that it will help us in the overall goal we have of trying \nto watch taxpayer dollars as much as we can and\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nensure we do not spend unnecessarily, notwithstanding our commitment to \ntry to rebuild after that tragedy in the gulf coast.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one else to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering the Transportation-Treasury bill, formally known as H.R. \n3058. It is the appropriations bill for the Departments of \nTransportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, \nand related agencies for fiscal year 2006.\n  This bill covers areas such as infrastructure, public housing, and \nthe judiciary that are critical to millions of American families and to \nkeeping our economy strong. For our country to reach its full \npotential, we need to invest in the priorities that are in this bill. \nToday, many people do not feel very secure about the future. They feel \nas though they are one slip away from losing their job, or they are \nworried about the fact that they will not be able to retire or to pay \nfor a trip to the doctor if their child gets sick.\n  To make America strong again, we need to invest at home. We need to \ninvest in our communities, in our schools, in our people, and in our \ninfrastructure. That is what the bill now before us does.\n  In the last few months, we have seen how important it is to have a \nstrong and reliable infrastructure. Tonight I want to offer my \ncolleagues an overview of what this bill funds and some of the most \nimportant investments, but first I want to note that several things \nhave changed since last year.\n  As my colleagues know, our Senate subcommittee has changed \nsignificantly. Last year, three separate appropriations subcommittees \nwere responsible for funding the agencies that are now in this bill. \nEven so, the Senate did not have the opportunity to debate and amend \nany of the appropriations bills that funded these agencies. Since then, \nthe Appropriations Committee has been restructured. As a result, this \nbill was crafted by one new and very much larger committee. We now have \n19 members. Only the Defense Subcommittee is as large.\n  Fortunately for all of us, we have Senator Bond as our very able \nchairman. Senator Bond has demonstrated his skill and fair-mindedness \ntime and again during his leadership of the former VA Subcommittee. \nThis year, he continues to demonstrate his leadership, and the proof is \nin this bill. It was reported unanimously by both the subcommittee and \nthe full Appropriations Committee back in July.\n  In addition to the changes we witnessed in the last year, we have \nseen dramatic changes in the 12 weeks since we marked up this bill. \nFirst and foremost has been the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. More than 1 million people were forced to evacuate the region, \nincluding low-income citizens who remain eligible for housing \nassistance from HUD. Today, because of the devastation, even more \npeople are eligible for Federal housing assistance.\n  Other Federal agencies that are funded in this bill have responded to \nthe hurricanes. In the Department of Transportation, the Maritime \nAdministration has deployed ships from the Ready Reserve fleet to the \ngulf to assist in recovery efforts. DOT personnel have also been \ninvolved in the effort to obtain trucks and buses to move personnel and \nequipment. Amtrak assisted in the evacuation of storm victims from both \nNew Orleans and Houston. The hurricanes showed us that we need workable \nplans to evacuate large numbers of low-income residents who depend on \npublic transit. I truly hope the Department of Transportation and FEMA \nare hard at work on those plans.\n  In the judiciary, Hurricane Katrina has required the emergency \nrelocation of 36 Federal judges and more than 400 staff. The New \nOrleans office of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has been \nabandoned, as have the Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts for \nEastern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi.\n  Another change since we marked up this bill in July concerns energy \nprices. Back in late July, the average price per gallon of regular \ngasoline was $2.27. Today it is more than 25 percent higher. Gas costs \nmore than $3 a gallon in many parts of our country. High gas prices are \nhurting our families, our businesses, and our communities. This price \nspike is already causing revenues to our Federal and State \ntransportation trust funds to diminish. That could have a serious \nimpact on the ability of our States to finance their highest priority \nroad projects.\n  The recent spike in fuel prices has also further undermined the \nfinancial condition of the Nation's airlines. Since we first marked up \nthis bill, another two major U.S. carriers and one regional carrier \nhave entered bankruptcy. That threatens the long-term availability of \nair service to the communities across the country and to tens of \nthousands of jobs.\n  Also, since we first marked up this appropriations bill, we passed \nthe authorization bill and made significant progress on Amtrak reform. \nFirst, just prior to the August recess, thanks again to the very able \nwork of Chairman Bond, the Congress passed the conference report on the \nsurface transportation bill, now known as SAFETEA-LU. This law will now \nguide the direction of our Federal highway, transit, and highway safety \nprograms for the next 5 years.\n\n  Secondly, following the markup of this bill, the Senate Commerce \nCommittee reported a comprehensive Amtrak reform bill. That bill has \nyet to come before the Senate, but it is important legislation that \nmust inform this subcommittee's deliberations going forward.\n  So as I said earlier, we have seen some dramatic and in some cases \ntragic changes since the Appropriations Committee first reported this \nbill. But even with those changes, this bill deserves the strong \nbipartisan support of the Senate.\n  This bill totals more than $141.4 billion. That is more than $11.6 \nbillion over the President's request. I think the best feature of this \nbill is that it rejects many of the painful and unwise cuts that were \nproposed in the President's budget. Whether it is funding to continue \nrail service in the country or building new runways to relieve \ncongestion at our airports, to construct new housing for low-income \nseniors and for our disabled; whether it is to invest in community \ndevelopment or provide needed assistance to taxpayers or aggressively \nenforce our drug laws, this bill rejects the President's painful cuts. \nInstead, our bill invests the funds to make our world safer and advance \nthe needs of our infrastructure and our people.\n  I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd for providing our \nsubcommittee with the necessary allocation so we could make these \ncritical investments. Chairman Bond also deserves a great deal of \ncredit for ensuring that even with so many new programs now under our \njurisdiction, every program was thoroughly reviewed and considered.\n  I thank Chairman Bond for treating me as a full partner in this \nendeavor. His door has always been open to me. While we do not see eye \nto eye on every funding level and every provision in the bill, I think \nthe bill we are considering is truly an effort at bipartisan consensus, \nand I thank the chairman for that.\n  I would like to review some of the priorities in this bill, starting \nwith aviation. This bill rejects the administration's proposal to slash \nfunding for our Nation's airports. It also preserves funding for the \nessential Air Service Program so that rural communities across the \ncountry will continue to receive air service.\n  I am also pleased that the bill attempts to boost hiring of our air \nsafety inspectors at the FAA. Last year this committee fully funded the \nPresident's request for safety inspectors. What happened? The FAA \ndownsized that office by more than 300 people. With the Nation's \nairlines in turmoil and all the\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nairlines seeking to cut costs, this is not the time to cut our safety \ninspector workforce as I described in detail on the Senate floor just a \nfew weeks ago.\n  For Amtrak, our bill includes $1.45 billion. That is a 20-percent \nincrease over the current year. Now, the DOT inspector general \ntestified that Amtrak would require between $1.4 billion and $1.5 \nbillion next year to maintain all of its current routes and services. \nThis funding recommendation falls right in the middle of that range. \nThis bill also recommends some reforms for Amtrak in the interest of \nhelping Amtrak cut costs. The President's budget asks that we throw \nAmtrak into bankruptcy and leave 22 million Americans stranded on the \nplatform. This bill categorically rejects that approach and preserves \nall current rail routes so a meaningful debate on reform can continue \nwithout the threat of a crisis.\n  Funding for the judiciary is up 6.6 percent. That is slightly higher \nthan the level that was passed by the House of Representatives, and I \nam confident that this funding level will enable the judiciary to \ncontinue its important work without the threat of staff layoffs.\n  Within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the President \nproposed to move the Community Development Block Grant Program over to \nthe Department of Commerce and cut its funding by more than a third. I \nam very pleased to say that we will continue to fund CDBG in this bill, \nand we limited the funding cut to just 8 percent.\n  Some of the more damaging cuts in the President's HUD budget include \ncuts to new construction for housing for the disabled and cuts to \nfunding for housing funds for AIDS patients, and those have been \nrejected.\n  Within the Executive Office of the President, the White House \nproposed to cut funding for the drug law enforcement activities of the \nhigh intensity drug tracking areas by more than 50 percent. Our bill, \nhowever, rejects that cut entirely and fully funds the HIDTA Program.\n  Turning to Federal workers, this bill provides a 3.1-percent pay \nraise for all Federal employees. It is an identical adjustment for \nmilitary and civilian workers.\n  I am also very pleased that Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski \nreached a compromise on competitive sourcing. It will provide a level \nplaying field when it comes to efforts by the Federal Government to \ncontract out Federal jobs.\n  As I have outlined, this bill makes some critical investments in our \ntransportation infrastructure, in our ability to house the poor and \nadminister justice, and the pressing needs, of course, of our highways \nand airways and transit systems. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan bill so we can strengthen our local communities and our \nentire country.\n  I will repeat the words of my chairman, Senator Bond, and encourage \nmy colleagues to bring their amendments to the Senate floor. The sooner \nwe start these amendments, the sooner we can review them and perhaps \nget them adopted. One thing I do know is, as of right now, there is \nstill hope that the St. Louis Cardinals are going to reverse course and \nwin the National League Championship Series. I cannot guarantee to any \nof my colleagues that Chairman Bond is going to greet their amendments \nwarmly, but I know he will greet them less warmly if the Cardinals are \neliminated this evening, so I suggest to all my colleagues they bring \ntheir amendments to the floor as soon as possible so they can be \nconsidered and we can move forward on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and good \npartner very much for her kind words.\n  Surely this bill was an interesting and challenging bill because it \nbrought so many new agencies together. The Senator from Washington has \nhad much greater experience in the Transportation appropriations area. \nHer input in that area and all the other areas was invaluable. I share \nher views that this is a good bill. As I stated earlier, I hope we will \ncome forward with amendments as soon as possible.\n  I know the Senator probably watched, as I did, the Seahawks' \nmagnificent victory yesterday--truly awesome. As far as the Cardinals, \nChris Carpenter pitches tonight and there is hope. So there is still a \nsmile on my face. We are both in a good mood. If you wish to have \namendments favorably reviewed, please come, bring them down. Even if my \nCardinals continue to win, as it gets later in the week we will be \ngetting short of time and short of patience. So we will very much \nappreciate having those amendments now.\n  For the information of all my colleagues we hope are watching, there \nwill be a vote at 5:30. This is a vote that is on a technical change in \nthe underlying legislation to allow the Federal Government to recapture \nfunds from a multifamily housing project owner who skims rent off the \nproject and leaves the project in default to be paid for out of FHA \nfunds, out of public funds, and thus pockets the rents.\n  This is a situation that was certainly not foreseen. It is a very \nundesirable situation where, in effect, the money from the taxpayer is \ngoing indirectly into the pockets of an owner of a project who has \ntaken rent money instead of applying it to the mortgage.\n  There is a vote at 5:30. We hope Members will come forward with their \namendments. I hope we can wrap up these amendments by Wednesday night \nto get ready for the World Series, for whosoever happens to be in it at \nthe time. I still have my hopes.\n  I see no other Member seeking the floor and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is going to vote in a couple \nof minutes on an amendment Senator Bond and I offered that addresses \nfraud and abuse at HUD properties. These are technical changes that are \nneeded to provide the HUD Office of Inspector General the tools they \nneed to continue this effort.\n  The amendment clarifies that the Government can recover double \ndamages from project owners, heirs, officers, and management companies \nthat have violated their project agreements with HUD. These damages \nwill apply even if the violators no longer have a mortgage or are doing \nbusiness with HUD. The provision allows violations to basically be \nconsidered as a false claim. Large damage awards are a proven deterrent \nin minimizing fraud and abuse in these programs.\n  There is a backlog of enforcement actions awaiting this change, \nincluding nursing homes that have been skimming equity from properties \nthat are covered with HUD insurance. We have to put a stop to these \nabuses. I encourage all colleagues, when this vote occurs in a few \nminutes, to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as my colleague and comanager of the bill, \nthe Senator from Washington, has just stated, we are preparing to vote \non an amendment that is a technical correction to the Housing and \nCommunity Act of 1987 to make sure that HUD has the authority to \nrecover any assets or income for a multifamily project where the funds \nare used in violation of the project's regulatory agreement. It is \nnecessary to ensure that HUD and the Federal Government can recover \nlosses from owners of multifamily housing who have intentionally and \nfraudulently skimmed equity from an FHA-insured project for their own \nbenefit. Without this technical correction, HUD, FHA, ends up paying \nthe lender the value of a defaulted FHA-insured mortgage that should \nhave been paid off by the owner of the multifamily housing out of rent \nreceipts. I hope my colleagues will look at it and see this is nothing \nbut common sense and adopt it.\n  At the same time, I reiterate for those who may be listening, we want \nto move forward on this bill as quickly as possible. We hope people who \nhave amendments will come forward. We are\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nlooking for an agreement to take up the DC appropriations bill which \nhas to be added to this to go to conference. It will be a separate \nconference, but since the House has DC in with the HUD bill, they will \nhave to be considered at once. We ask that everybody bring forth those \namendments and be prepared for a filing deadline tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I see the time for the vote on the amendment has \narrived, and I suggest we proceed to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Increase in the Minimum Wage.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than--\n       ``(A) $5.85 an hour, beginning on the 60th day after the \n     date of enactment of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005;\n       ``(B) $6.55 an hour, beginning 12 months after that 60th \n     day; and\n       ``(C) $7.25 an hour, beginning 24 months after that 60th \n     day;''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (b) Applicability of Minimum Wage to the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) shall apply to the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.\n       (2) Transition.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the minimum \n     wage applicable to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be--\n       (A) $3.55 an hour, beginning on the 60th day after the date \n     of enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as \n     may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section \n     6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and every 6 months thereafter until the \n     minimum wage applicable to the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands under this subsection is equal to the minimum \n     wage set forth in such section.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I look forward to the opportunity to \ndiscuss this amendment and to the opportunity for the Senate to be able \nto express itself on the issue of increasing the minimum wage for the \nworking families of this country. It has not been increased now for \nsome 9 years. We have not increased the minimum wage for some 9 years. \nThere will be those who will ask: Why are we thinking about increasing \nthe minimum wage on this legislation? We have tried to get stand-alone \nlegislation so that it could be considered. We have been unable to do \nthat. We have been unable to get another vote on an increase in the \nminimum wage over these period of years.\n  In this particular appropriations bill, there is another amendment \ndealing with the increase in salaries for Members of the Senate. This \nwill be the seventh increase we have had in 9 years, but we have not \nhad an increase in the minimum wage over that same period of time. It \ndoes seem to me that there is a certain amount of equity, a certain \namount of justice, a certain amount of fairness when we are talking \nabout an increase in the salaries or the cost of living for Members of \nthe Senate. We certainly ought to be considerate of the interests of \nthose who have been left behind by the failure of Congress to support \nthe increase in the minimum wage.\n  Who are the minimum wage workers? The minimum wage workers are men \nand women of dignity, first of all. These are men and women who work \nhard, play by the rules, are trying to provide for their families, \ntrying to look out for their children, and trying to look after a \nparent. We know these are men and women who work in nursing homes and \nare looking after senior\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\ncitizens, men and women who have contributed so much to this Nation, \nwho have sacrificed greatly for this Nation by more often than not \nsubverting their own kinds of interests and their own futures to the \nbenefit of their children. Now, during their golden years, they need \nsome help and assistance, and many of those who work and assist the \nelderly people in nursing homes are men and women who earn a minimum \nwage.\n  Who else are they? They are the men and women who clean the great \nbuildings of American commerce every evening, hard working, going \naround and cleaning out those buildings. They are men and women of \ndignity. They want to do a decent job, and they do a decent job. They \nneed to have a decent pay.\n  Many of them are workers working in schools as teachers' assistants, \nas teachers' aides. These are men and women who are working with \nseniors, who have made great contributions to our Nation. They are men \nand women who are working with children who are attempting to get an \neducation. They are working part time or even full time as teachers' \nassistants.\n  Primarily, this is an issue involving women because 60 percent of \nthose who would benefit from this legislation are women. More than one \nthird of the women who are receiving the minimum wage have children. So \nan increase in the minimum wage is a women's issue, and since so many \nof the women who receive the minimum wage have children, it is a \nchildren's issue. It is a women's issue, and it is a children's issue. \nIt is also a civil rights issue because 35 percent of those who would \nbenefit from an increase in the minimum wage are men and women of \ncolor.\n  So it is a children's issue. It is a women's issue. It is a family \nissue. We hear a great deal in this body about family issues, about \nfamily responsibilities, family obligations. These are men and women \nwho are earning the minimum wage and who are trying to provide for \ntheir families on that minimum wage. They know they cannot do it. So \nthey have one or two or even three minimum wage jobs. How much time do \nthey have with their children? They are trying to provide for their \nchildren but have no time to spend with them.\n  I will give real stories of what families are going through, the \nsacrifices they have made, the lost opportunities, the conversations \nthey were not able to have with their children, the missed birthdays \nthat come and go, the Christmases that come and go and they do not have \nthat gift for that child or they do not have those pairs of skates so \nthe children can join other children.\n  The fact is that hard-working men and women in this country have not \ngotten a raise in 9 years, and yet we in the Senate are adjusting our \nsalaries to inflation effectively for the seventh time in the ninth \nyear. So we have a women's issue, a children's issue, a family issue, a \ncivil rights issue, and most of all it is a fairness issue.\n  Americans understand fairness. Americans understand that if a person \nworks 40 hours a week for 52 weeks of the year, they should not have to \nlive in poverty, and these men and women are living in poverty. All we \nare trying to do is what we have done many times in the past.\n  This has not been a partisan issue. It has only been in recent years \nthat it has been a partisan issue. If we look at this chart, we will \nsee that over the period of the years when there was the first minimum \nwage, going back to 1938, it was 25 cents. There was President \nRoosevelt, then Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower increased the \nminimum wage. Democrats and Republicans. President Kennedy increased \nthe minimum wage. So did President Johnson increase the minimum wage. \nThen President Eisenhower, President Ford, then President Carter, then \nBush 1, President Bush, increased the minimum wage, and then President \nClinton. So Republicans as well as Democrats have fought for an \nincrease in the minimum wage, although over the period of these last \nyears, that has not been the case. Every time we have tried for an \nincrease in the minimum wage, we have been opposed by a Republican \nadministration and by the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate. That is not fair. It is time we altered and changed that.\n  It is appropriate that we take a moment or two to look at what has \nbeen happening in our country: Americans struggling to survive in this \neconomy, in what we call the Bush economy. Too many Americans are \nliving in poverty. We have 1 in every 10 families living in poverty. \nOne out of every five children in the United States now, one out of \nevery five Hispanic Americans, one out of every four African Americans, \nis now living in poverty in the United States. If we look at the \noverall figures from years 2000 to 2004, 5.4 million more Americans are \nliving in poverty today than were living in poverty in the year 2000. \nAn increase in the minimum wage is not going to solve all of these \nproblems, but it is going to help 15 to 16 million Americans become \nbetter off in regard to their economic condition to some extent.\n  Let us take a look at what has happened to the minimum wage over the \nperiod of recent years. This is the 2004 Federal poverty line. This red \nline indicates the minimum wage. Going back to the early 1960s, we saw \nthat the minimum wage even exceeded the poverty wage. This is constant \npurchasing dollars. This is in constant real dollars. We saw an \nincrease even above the poverty line. Then it bounced around just \naround the poverty line, and then we have seen now what has happened in \nrecent times where the real minimum wage has fallen so far from the \npoverty line. Most Americans believe if one is going to work and work \nhard, they should not have to live in poverty, but this is what is \nhappening in the United States over the period of the recent years. The \ntotal number of individuals who have fallen into poverty has increased \nsignificantly because of the failure of Congress to deal with any kind \nof increase in the minimum wage.\n  The amendment I have offered is a three-phase increase. It provides \nfor an increase of 70 cents 60 days after it is signed, 70 cents a year \nafter, and 70 cents a year after, from $5.15 to $7.25. It will put the \nminimum wage up to this level, which it will still be well below what \nit was in the 1960s through the 1970s and even up to the 1980s. It will \ncertainly not recover all of its purchasing power, but it will make a \nvery serious and important difference to millions of Americans.\n  For anybody who is viewing this discussion this evening, this chart \nis self-evident. What has been happening is an increased pressure on \nfamilies' pocketbooks, which has virtually soared since the year \n2001. We find gasoline has increased some 71 percent; health insurance \nup 59 percent; housing up 44 percent; college tuition up 35 percent. \nThese are basics.\n\n  If they can afford a car to be able to drive, or even participate in \na car pool, we see the explosion in gasoline prices in spite of an \nEnergy bill we passed here which did virtually nothing on this issue.\n  We continue to see the escalation of health care costs, housing has \ngone up, and college tuition. All this has gone up. What has not gone \nup is the minimum wage.\n  This chart shows what an average family is up against. The average \ncosts for a family for health insurance premiums per year now is up to \n$10,880. If you look at the salary of a full-time, minimum-wage worker, \nit is $10,700. You wonder how in the world can they even afford one \ncoverage, which is so important to families, which is to be able to \nprovide health coverage. Of course they cannot afford it, and so they \ndo without it. In some States, they get some protection from some of \nthe safety net programs, but we have seen the increasing pressure on \nthose safety net programs in recent years.\n  What would $4,400 mean, which is what it would be when the minimum \nwage is fully implemented? What would that mean? We have been \nencouraged by the living wage campaigns that have taken place in \ncommunities all over this country. They have taken place in Boston. \nThey have taken place in Cambridge, MA, and other communities in my \nState. They have taken place in Baltimore and in many other cities--in \nLos Angeles. And they have made a real difference. It has made a real \ndifference in the quality of life for people. In many of those \ninstances when they go to a living wage, they go up to $12 or $14 an \nhour. We are only increasing this to $7.25. So we are going to be well \nbehind the living wage that has been accepted overwhelmingly.\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\n  We know when it has been on the ballot in the States of Nevada and \nFlorida, it has been passed overwhelmingly by the people in those \nStates. People have overwhelmingly, when they have addressed this in \nall parts of the country, supported an increase. The only people who \nhave not supported it have been the Republican leadership. We are going \nto give them an opportunity to address this issue on this legislation.\n  This is what it provides. The $4,400 increase means almost 2 years of \nchild care, full tuition for a community college, a year and a half of \nheat and electricity--maybe not after this winter, when we are finding \nout in my part of the country on the natural gas bill they expect to \nhave an increase of some 70 percent in the cost of heating oil and \nnatural gas, but we know it would make an important difference in those \nterms--and more than a year of groceries or more than 9 months of rent.\n  Does this sound very excessive to those who believe we are already \ndoing what we should for some of the most hard-working Americans?\n  This chart is enormously important. Although it doesn't reflect the \nhuman dimension of what families are faced with or what a difference in \nthe minimum wage will mean, what it does do is show what has happened \nin relation to increased productivity. What does that mean? It means \nthe production levels workers have been able to achieve. What we have \nseen over a period of years--this chart goes back to the 1960s. If you \nlook at the minimum wage even prior to that time, an increase in the \nminimum wage has always reflected an increase in productivity. It makes \nsense. That is the best way to answer people who say this is going to \nbe inflationary. It is not when you are increasing productivity.\n  This is what had happened. We had always seen the minimum wage had \nbeen kept slightly higher than productivity in the 1960s and going into \nthe 1970s. Now what we see is productivity is up 155 percent over 45 \nyears ago. What we have seen is the decline of the minimum wage. This \nincludes the increase in the minimum wage that we had during the 1990s. \nWe see the extraordinary decline. We have not seen the minimum wage go \nup to reflect the increase in productivity. We have seen the minimum \nwage go down, in spite of the increase in productivity.\n  We have workers working longer, working harder, being more \nproductive. They are working longer hours. They are working many more \nmonths of the year than any other worker in the world--American \nworkers. American workers are. We will have a chance to show that \ntomorrow, the comparison between American workers and other workers. We \nhave American workers working longer, working harder, being more \nproductive, and you would think the increase in the minimum wage would \nreflect it, right? Wrong. We do not see that increase reflected.\n  This chart shows again, all of these indicators, that the purchasing \npower of the minimum wage has collapsed over the last 50 years. The \nminimum wage now is the lowest in over 50 years compared to average \nwages. For years the minimum wage was reflective of what the average \nwage was. They tried to keep it about 56 to 60 percent, that was the \ndesire for years for the minimum wage. But look what has happened. This \nis another indicator. The minimum wage is now 32 percent of the average \nwages for American workers. Look at the decline.\n  We are talking about a segment of our society. We are talking about a \nsegment of Americans. It is all reflected in this--when we had the \nHurricane Katrina, when we saw so many millions of Americans who had \nbeen left behind in opportunity, and they are getting short shrift in \ntheir wages. These are millions of Americans who are left behind, and \nthat is reflected by the fact that the number of Americans living in \npoverty has increased.\n  We have some indication of what has happened as the minimum wage \nremained stagnant over this period of time. We see Members of Congress \nhave had an increase in salary of $31,600. People will have to answer \nto that, whether they are going to vote themselves a pay increase and \nvote down an increase in the minimum wage. That will be the issue that \nwill be before the Members. That is why this particular measure is of \nso much importance.\n\n  We will have a chance to go through this in greater detail. This \nissue is most of all about fairness for American workers. We know there \nwill be about 7\\1/2\\ million Americans who will be affected by the \nincrease in the minimum wage. The ripple effect on the wages of others \nof low income is expected to effectively double that. We are talking \nabout impacting more than 15 million Americans--some obviously more \nthan others. But we are talking about whether we are going to be one \ncountry with one history and one destiny and whether this institution \nis going to increase the minimum wage and try to begin to catch up for \nso many we have left behind.\n  We will take the opportunity tomorrow. Some will come out and refute \nthis with the old arguments that this will be bad for the economy. This \nwill be bad for the economy because it will have a inflationary effect \non the economy. Let me show what this is, in terms of the economy. All \nAmericans combined earn $5.4 trillion a year. This is all Americans. \nIncreasing the minimum wage to $7.25 is vital to workers but a drop in \nthe bucket in the national payroll. All Americans combined earn $5.4 \ntrillion. An increase to $7.25 would be less than one-fifth of 1 \npercent of the national payroll, one-fifth of 1 percent. I hope our \nfriends on the other side who say this is going to be an inflator, we \nare suffering difficult economic times now--all of which are true--will \nlet me point out that this is one-fifth of 1 percent of national \npayroll. They will say that this is going to be an inflator? This \ndoesn't hold.\n  We have seen in Great Britain they have increased their minimum wage \nto $8.85 3 weeks ago. They increased it to $8.85, and they have \nprovisionally accepted a plan to go up to $9.37 next year. If you asked \nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer about the adverse impact in terms of \nthe British economy, he said: It has been good for the economy. It has \nbeen healthy for the economy. We have moved a million children out of \npoverty. We have moved families out of poverty. People are spending and \ninvesting and it has strengthened our economy.\n  We will have an opportunity to go through the traditional arguments: \nWe can't afford this because it is an inflator. I hope our friends on \nthe other side will be able to respond to that. They will also say this \nis going to mean job losses. We have gone through that time in and time \nout. We will have the charts to show at the times that we have \nincreased the minimum wage it has actually meant increasing employment. \nThat certainly has been true in more recent times that we have done it, \nand we have the charts to reflect that.\n  Then we will hear this is a decent idea but it only goes to--we \nshould just have a training wage. We should not. We have already had \nthat kind of debate and discussion.\n  Those are all arguments we are going to hear from the other side. \nBasically, they are rooted in the concept they do not believe that men \nand women who work hard, men and women of dignity, that they are \nentitled even to a fair day's pay.\n  We are not, even with the increase of the minimum wage, able to reach \nthe poverty line for these millions of Americans. It does seem to me \nwith all the things we have seen in this country in the most recent \ntimes, when we peeled back the veil of the American society, as had \nbeen done in Katrina and Rita, and we saw who was out there and who was \nadversely impacted, Americans said, Oh, my goodness, why have so many \npeople been left out? Why have so many people been left behind?\n  This increase in the minimum wage is not going to solve all of their \nproblems. It will not. But it will make an important difference to more \nthan 15 million Americans who are hard working, trying to make ends \nmeet, playing by the rules, looking out after their families. They \ncertainly deserve this increase, particularly if we intend to increase \nthe salaries for Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, this morning I and a number of other \nSenators held a policy committee hearing on the issue of FEMA and some \nof the expenditures dealing with Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath of \nthe devastation of the gulf coast of our country. Some of what we \nlearned is enormously distressing. I will share some of it with my \ncolleagues, including some ideas about what we ought to be doing about \nit.\n  One of the people who came to Capitol Hill this morning was a man \nnamed Paul Mullinaux, a truck driver who owns his own tractor and \ntrailer and lives in Florida. He was contracted by FEMA to haul ice to \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina and for the devastation on the gulf \ncoast. Mr. Mullinaux is a person who, when asked to perform this \nservice--obviously he was paid for it, but with his refrigeration truck \nand with an opportunity, he went to New York City and picked up a load \nof ice in his 18-wheeler and his refrigerated trailer. That load of ice \nwas for delivery to Carthage, MO. He wasn't sure why it was to be \ndelivered to Missouri, but it was. He took his 18-wheeler to Carthage, \nMO.\n  When he arrived at Carthage, MO, they told him that what he needed to \ndo was to go to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. So he had driven his \n18-wheeler with a load of ice from New York City to Carthage, MO. Then \nhe was told, go to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He got in his \ntruck and went to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.\n  When he got to Alabama, he told us this morning, he spent 12 days \nsitting on the Maxwell Air Force Base tarmac with apparently hundreds \nof other trucks and a load of ice. He said other trucks were loaded \nwith ice, they were loaded with blankets, they were loaded with all \nkinds of things that evacuees would have needed, the victims of the \nhurricane would have needed. For 12 days he and his truck, with his \nmotor running for the refrigeration to keep the ice cold, sat there. \nFinally, at the end of 12 days he was told he was to take his truckload \nof ice to Idaho.\n  Remember, this is a truck driver contracted by FEMA to pick up a load \nof ice in New York and take it to the gulf coast to try to help the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina. He got the ice in New York, went to \nMissouri, then was told to go to Alabama. He went to Alabama, sat there \n12 days and then was told, by the way, now you should take this ice to \nIdaho and put it in storage.\n  Mr. Mullinaux told them, I wasn't aware there was a hurricane in \nIdaho and I don't intend to drive to Idaho with this ice. At that \npoint, they talked about calling the National Guard to escort him off \nthe military base because he had a bad attitude. I would have had a bad \nattitude sitting there 12 days with a refrigeration truck running with \na load of ice that was supposed to go to hurricane victims. At the end \nof 12 days, he refused to go to Idaho, so they sent him--and he said \nthey sent many other trucks--to Massachusetts to offload the ice in a \nwarehouse where it is now being stored.\n  Think of this. The Federal Government, through FEMA, paid $15,000 to \na trucker to pick up a load of ice in New York to help hurricane \nvictims and they told him to go to Missouri. He went to Missouri. They \nthen told him to go to Alabama. He went to Alabama. They then told him \nto wait for 12 days. He sat on the base in Alabama for 12 days and then \nthey told him to take the ice to Idaho, to put it in storage. When he \nrefused, they said, well, then, take it to Massachusetts. He took it to \nMassachusetts and it is now in storage. From New York, to Missouri, to \nAlabama, to Massachusetts.\n  In effect, the American taxpayer has paid this one trucker $15,000 to \nhaul ice from New York to Massachusetts to benefit the victims of \nHurricane Katrina. It is unbelievable and staggering incompetence that \nFEMA is paying this kind of money. But it was not only Paul Mullinaux; \nit was not just him. It was hundreds and hundreds of other truckers \nwith exactly the same experience. Loaded with blankets, loaded with \nice, loaded with the things the victims needed, sitting in an airbase, \nbeing paid $800, $900 a day per truck while victims waited. \nIncidentally, Paul Mullinaux said they had a small television in that \ntruck of theirs sitting on the tarmac of the military base along with \nhundreds of other truckers, and they were seeing on the nightly news \nthe victims who were begging and pleading for the things they needed to \nkeep them warm, to give them sustenance, food, ice, good water, \nblankets, clothing. And they were all on trucks, sitting there, day \nafter day after day after day after day, and, finally, never delivered.\n  The question is, when you hear this sort of staggering incompetence, \nwho is in charge? Who is accountable? Harry Truman used to have a \nlittle sign on his desk that said ``The buck stops here.'' Where does \nthe buck stop with this? Is anybody accountable? FEMA? It used to be an \nagency we were enormously proud of. Regrettably, many of the top \npositions in that agency were filled with cronies who had no \ninformation, no experience, no capability with respect to disaster \npreparedness or disaster response. And this is but one small story of \nPaul Mullinaux, a trucker who came here to tell his story, furious as a \ntaxpayer about what has happened.\n  Al Knight and Mike Moran came, Knight Enterprises. They were hired by \na subsidiary of Halliburton to do some work down in the Gulf of Mexico \nto try to deal with the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. They went out \nas a result of an oral contract and hired 75 skilled, experienced \nelectricians to do a job. It wasn't very long before the subcontractor \nwith Halliburton said, don't worry about that; your electricians will \nnot be on the job very long. We are bringing in new people.\n  Guess what. They did bring in new people. My guess is a fair number \nof them were undocumented workers. They say almost none of them spoke \nEnglish. They say their electricians were trying to work beside them \nand these were not skilled electricians. In many cases, they didn't \nknow what they were doing.\n  Why were they there? Why were they there to replace Louisiana workers \nwho wanted the jobs to help get back on their feet, people who were \nvictimized by Hurricane Katrina and Rita? Why were others brought in \nfrom out of state to take those jobs? Money. Just money. Because the \nPresident said, by the way, with respect to reconstruction in the Gulf \nof Mexico, in Louisiana and related States, Mississippi and so on, we \nwill get rid of the Davis-Bacon requirement.\n  What is Davis-Bacon? It says the Federal Government, when it does \nwork in your region, is going to pay the prevailing wage. They will not \ncome in and hire a bunch of fly-by-night operators in order to drop the \nwages to dirt-poor levels. We will, as a Federal Government, pay \nprevailing, regional wages, when we do contracting in a region. But \nwhen the President said, by the way, Davis-Bacon does not work, does \nnot count, with respect to reconstruction in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand elsewhere, he opened the door for these firms to hire a bunch of \nworkers for dollars a day with no benefits, and put them up in \nconditions--by the way, this picture was taken last weekend. Those are \nsome of the workers who are brought in to take jobs that days ago \nbelonged to the people of Louisiana. Workers who got hit by these \nhurricanes were anxious to get these jobs to try to get back on their \nfeet. No more. The jobs now belong the these folks who live in these \nconditions--the exploitation of workers in this country. That is what\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nhappens when you get rid of the Davis-Bacon requirement of paying the \nprevailing wage--bring somebody in and exploit them.\n\n  And, oh, by the way, one of the witnesses this morning said he saw \njobs advertised by companies to do the reconstruction that claimed \ntheir workers can have free meals at the Red Cross. What does that \nmean, ``free meals at the Red Cross''? That means you don't have to pay \nthem much. You can underpay them. You can have them live like this, as \nshown in this picture. You can exploit them. And, oh, by the way, we \ncan get free meals for you at the Red Cross.\n  What a shame this is. The fact is, there is a right way and a wrong \nway to do reconstruction in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, and \nthat is to not devastate the local prevailing wage. It is to reach out \nand hire the people in that region who have been victimized by these \nnatural disasters. It is not to waste money. There is such prevailing \nwaste here, it is almost unbelievable.\n  Ms. Sheila Crowley testified this morning. She has a Ph.D. She is \npresident of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. There is $11 \nmillion being spent each day to put people in hotels who are displaced \nbecause of Hurricane Katrina. Think of that. So $11 million tonight is \nwhat the estimate is for hotel rooms.\n  Now, why are we still paying for these hotel rooms? Because the \nadministration decided they did not want to use a voucher program. They \ndo not like vouchers. A voucher program would have been to say to a \nperson displaced: Here is a voucher. Go find yourself an apartment. It \nwould have used existing housing stock. It would have made a great deal \nof sense and very quickly put people in housing. But the administration \ndoes not like vouchers, so the people who run these programs have been \nprevented from doing that.\n  Let me come back for a moment to the testimony by Paul Mullinaux. I \nhave asked FEMA if we can find some accountability in FEMA. Who is it \nthat decided we should have a truck pick up ice in New York and deliver \nit to Massachusetts for the purpose of helping victims of Katrina down \nin Louisiana and Mississippi? Who decided to do that? Who authorized \nthe payment of $15,000 for that truck and hundreds of other trucks just \nlike it full of materials that victims needed, full of food and \nsupplies and clothing and ice that victims needed? Will we find the \nanswer to that? Will we find some accountability somewhere? I hope so \nbecause as we produce additional money for reconstruction and as we \nprovide additional money to FEMA, the question is, Is this money being \nspent in a manner that meets any commonsense test at all? The fact is, \nthis does not meet any test at all, that I am aware of, of efficiency \nor of effectiveness. Someone, some group of people is completely brain \ndead when it comes to managing the resources that belong to the \ntaxpayers of this country. I would like to find out who. This country \ndeserves better. America deserves better than this. We can do better as \na country.\n  Let me just finally say this: We had a FEMA that was extraordinary. I \nknow that because in my State we had a city of nearly 50,000 people \nthat was nearly completely evacuated because of a flood. I watched FEMA \nup close. They were extraordinary: professional, sharp, on the mark, on \nthe ball, doing the right things.\n  Now FEMA is a joke. I am sure there are wonderful people still \nworking at FEMA. But I see people inside FEMA, who are career people, \nwho say what has happened inside is to hollow out this great \norganization. You put people at the top who have no experience at all \nin this area--just hire a couple cronies, friends, and say, ``Go do \nthis,'' with no experience in disaster preparation or disaster \npreparedness--and this is what you get.\n  I hope we can find some accountability. I hope we can put some new \npeople in charge, in place, to be responsible for this country and to \nits taxpayers. We are going to spend billions more dollars out of this \nChamber. I have watched it with respect to reconstruction in Iraq, and \nI am now watching it with respect to reconstruction in the wake of \nHurricane Katrina. In both cases, it appears to me that massive amounts \nof money are being wasted. There is substantial waste, fraud, and \nabuse. Instead of yawning at that problem, this Congress ought to be \nfurious. We ought to make sure we put a stop to it right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11411-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11411-S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENERGY COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the 12th century, in the Bay of Biscay, \nBasque sailors began to hunt right whales. The Basques melted the \nwhales' blubber into oil to fuel their lamps. When the whales died out \nin Spanish waters, the Basques sailed north to Iceland pursuing the \nsource of their lamp oil. By the 16th century, whalers hunted \nextensively in Icelandic waters to find the fuel for light.\n  As our former colleague Phil Gramm wrote in 1973, from American \ncolonial times through the middle of the 19th century, whale oil \nprovided the major source of artificial lighting in America and Europe. \nBut in the middle of the 19th century, America faced an energy crisis. \nThe price of whale oil was rising. From a low of 23 cents a gallon in \n1832, it rose to $1.45 a gallon in 1865.\n  But then in 1859, people discovered petroleum oil in western \nPennsylvania. The rising price of whale oil encouraged an engineer to \ninvent a process to convert that western Pennsylvania black oil into a \nnew fuel, kerosene.\n  The whale oil era was ending, and the petroleum era began.\n  One hundred fifty years later, at the turn of the 21st century, \ngasoline prices are rising. As late as December 2002, Montana gasoline \nprices averaged a little more than $1.30 a gallon. On September 5 of \nthis year, the average price hit about $2.90 a gallon.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina's disruption of oil refineries, many \nMontanans feel gouged by sky-high gasoline and diesel prices. High gas \nprices hit low-income Montanans particularly hard. Peggy Grimes, \ndirector of the Montana Food Bank Network, says: ``[P]eople are going \nwithout food more often and coming to visit local food pantries more \noften.'' Just think of people having to make choices such as that.\n  Rising natural gas and fuel oil prices have many Montanans concerned \nabout how they will heat their homes this winter. And rising fertilizer \ncosts will hit many Montana farmers hard.\n  In the short term, petroleum price increases are forcing painful \nadjustments. In the medium term, we need to invest in conservation, \nweatherization, and upgrading the efficiency of cars, appliances, and \nmachines that use energy. And in the long term, we need to adjust \nintelligently to higher petroleum costs, systematically and \npurposefully diversifying our energy sources.\n  In the middle of the 19th century, America led the way to the next \nenergy era, leaving the whale oil era behind. Now, at the beginning of \nthe 21st century, America must once again lead the way to another \nenergy era, an era that severs the world's dependence on Middle Eastern \noil. Domestic oil and gas production will remain a critical part of our \nenergy security for some time. But to lead the world to a new era, we \nwill have to make major investments in new innovative forms and uses of \nenergy.\n  Once again, we have cause to look again across the waters to Iceland.\n  Iceland is leaving the petroleum era behind. Iceland is entering the \nhydrogen era. The government has announced its intention to become a \nhydrogen-based economy by 2030.\n  In Iceland, icy water cascades down from massive glaciers. And in \nIceland, boiling water bubbles up from just beneath the surface. \nIceland already harnesses these renewable resources to generate \nvirtually all of its electricity and heating from hydroelectric and \ngeothermal sources.\n  But with no fossil fuel resources, Iceland relies heavily on imported \noil to power cars, buses, and the fishing trawlers that provide 70 \npercent of Iceland's income.\n  To break that dependency, and to reduce greenhouse gases, Iceland is \nturning to fuel cells. Fuel cells use hydrogen and oxygen to generate \nelectricity to power engines. And the vehicles powered by those engines \nemit only water as exhaust.\n  Iceland plans to use its cheap electricity to split water--\nH2O--into its component parts--hydrogen and oxygen. Iceland \nuses the process of electrolysis. Electrolysis runs an electric\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\ncurrent through bonded elements to separate the elements.\n  Iceland's capital Reykjavik intends to replace its entire fleet of 80 \nbuses with fuel cell buses. Next, Iceland hopes to convert private \ncars. And after that, Iceland hopes to switch the huge Icelandic \nfishing trawlers to hydrogen power.\n  Iceland thus hopes to convert its renewable hydroelectric and \ngeothermal energy into a form that can power its transportation system, \nand, in the process, Iceland hopes to slash emissions and end its \ndependence on fossil fuels.\n  Maria Maack, the project director of Iceland New Energy, explained:\n\n       We are so reliant on our fisheries, and the fisheries are \n     totally dependent on oil. So we have a chance to be quite \n     independent of this. . . [I]t's being independent and relying \n     on ourselves to continue the way we live.\n\n  Bragi Arnason, a chemistry professor at the University of Iceland and \na leader in hydrogen technology, beamed:\n\n       I think we could be a pilot country, giving a vision of the \n     world to come.\n\n  This is my sixth address to the Senate on competitiveness. Starting \nthis summer, I spoke on competitiveness generally. I spoke on the role \nof education in meeting that challenge so we Americans can be more \ncompetitive in the future. Education at all levels--K through 12, \ncontinuing education, higher education, technology schools--is the \nlong-term key for America to remain the biggest and strongest economic \npower in the world, given the challenges of China, India, and other \ncountries that are taking advantage of the Internet and other \ntechnologies which are making other countries more competitive than \nthey have been in the past.\n  I spoke on the role of trade, how we have to be more aggressive in \ntrade to market our products overseas better and knock down trade \nbarriers. I spoke on the role of controlling health care costs which \nmake us less competitive worldwide. Our health care costs per capita \nare twice that of the next expensive country, and I doubt we are twice \nas healthy. I spoke on the role of capital and savings. We are not a \nnet savings country, we are basically a net deficit country. Other \ncountries save so much more than we save. That means capital that is \navailable to develop new technologies, both technical technologies and \nhuman technologies.\n  Today I wish to speak about the role of energy in competitiveness. If \nwe are to be a strong country and meet the foreign challenge, clearly, \nwe need to be much more independent in energy production.\n  Iceland's Professor Arnason is not alone in his vision of a hydrogen \nfuture. At the University of Montana, Missoula College of Technology, \nDean Paul Williamson has a similar vision. He is working to use \nhydrogen as the focal point to build a state-of-the-art college of \ntechnology and futures park. He wants to create something that folks in \nGeneva will get on a plane to come to America to see. So we are not \nalways going overseas to see what they are doing, they will come to see \nwhat we are doing. It is a laboratory of excellence, to serve as a \ngateway to alternative technology in a much larger community.\n  Dean Williamson's vision is to marry Montana's resource base with the \nbest trained workforce, and he is working to make the Missoula College \nof Technology a focal point to transform that vision into reality. \nMissoula College of Technology is creating the educational venue, and \nwith it, they will match a business gateway to help to bring business \nand industry to the area, creating networks of microenterprises.\n  All around Montana and the Nation, people are working on renewable \nand alternative energy research and industry. Rising energy prices, \ncombined with smart Government incentives, have spurred innovation, and \nwe are already beginning to reap the benefits.\n  I have already talked about one example, hydrogen. Another example is \ncoal conversion.\n  Coal gasification can be used to help produce hydrogen, and coal \ngasification can also be used to produce fertilizers, other chemicals, \nand diesel fuel. Our State's Governor, Brian Schweitzer, and I have \ntargeted a process to turn Montana's coal into clean-burning diesel and \njet fuel. The process is called Fischer-Tropsch, or F-T for the German \nscientists who developed it in the 1920s.\n  Energy technology firms in America and elsewhere are fine-tuning F-T \nto make it even cleaner. F-T fuels are relatively clean. The process \ncan recover sulfur, mercury, and arsenic as marketable byproducts.\n  Jack Holmes, president of Syntroleum, extols the cleanliness of F-T \ndiesel. He says it can be burned straight or blended with regular \ndiesel fuel. He says:\n\n       It's like a single-malt scotch.\n\n  Not quite, but we get the drift of it.\n  Governor Schweitzer calculates:\n\n       It would cost less than $1 per gallon to make that diesel.\n\n  The break-even point for F-T comes when crude oil sells for more than \n$35 a barrel. These days, that looks like a pretty safe bet.\n  To develop processes such as these in the just-passed Energy bill, I \nworked to include an investment tax credit for the coal gasification \ntechnology used by the F-T process. In the highway bill, I worked to \ninclude a 50-cent-a-gallon tax credit for companies that generate fuel \nusing an updated version of the F-T process. I also included a Federal \nloan guarantee so that companies can finance these capital investments.\n  We have real opportunity here. The coal-to-fuel technology can be a \nwin for everybody if we do it right and if we make sure that any \nfacility uses the cleanest and most advanced technology available--\nagain, if they do it right. It will help lessen our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy while creating thousands of jobs in America. \nI am proud to join our Governor in trying to bring a new investment in \nthis technology to Montana and to the Nation.\n  A third example is renewable and alternative energy in the form of \nwind energy. They may call Chicago ``the windy city,'' but many say \nGreat Falls, MT, is the windiest city in America. ``Wind is like water \nflowing out of the mountains,'' says Bob Quinn, a farmer from Big \nSandy, MT. Big Sandy is a little bit east of what we call the eastern \nfront. It is the Rocky Mountains and the Continental Divide. The \neastern front falls off similar to a big cliff. That is why we call it \nthe front. By the time it gets to Big Sandy, which is not too far away, \nit is similar to water flowing out of the mountains.\n  Closer to the mountains, the wind is turbulent, but across the \nprairie, it flows uniformly similar to a huge river, and that makes it \nattractive as a wind farm site.\n  Five years ago, Bob traveled to Germany to research his ancestry. He \nvisited a distant cousin who had developed a wind project and was \ncontemplating others in Chile or South Africa.\n\n  Bob asked him, Why are you thinking about going clear to Chile to \nbuild a wind farm when you can buy one in Montana, where we have this \nriver of wind? The cousin reconsidered and chose Montana. Along with \nanother partner and two cousins, they formed WindPark Solutions America \nand began looking for sites.\n  They settled on Judith Gap, a town of about 150 people in central \nMontana. Eventually, WindPark sold the project to Invenergy Wind, a \nChicago-based company that will own and operate the project. Invenergy \nis now building a $150 million facility, the Judith Gap wind farm.\n  Billings resident Ludlow Howe manages the construction. His work \ncrews erected 130 turbines in two phases. The wind farm will cover an \narea about 8 miles long and 5 miles wide, straddling Highway 191 \nbetween Judith Gap and Harlowton.\n  So far, workers have assembled at least 27 towers, colored white-gray \nto blend with the sky. Each tower is 260 feet tall. On top of each \ntower sits a generator box the size of a motor home. Seven-ton rotors \nwith 122-foot blades sweep up to 387 feet into the air. Each turbine \nweighs more than 400,000 pounds. A system of 140 bolts secures each \ntower to its base.\n  The rotors come from Houston, the turbines come from North Carolina, \nand tower sections come from China, Korea, and Fargo, ND.\n  Ludlow says of the wind turbines:\n\n       They will actually seek out the wind at 9 miles per hour. \n     They will pitch their blades, just like a sailboat.\n\n  They will trim their sails.\n  The plant should be in full operation soon. NorthWestern Energy will \nbuy power from the 150-megawatt wind\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nfarm for customers in central and western Montana.\n  Wheatland County Commissioner Tom Bennett says admiringly:\n\n       It's environmentally friendly. It's renewable. It's \n     something we'll have forever. You tell me any negative on \n     this. We couldn't find any.\n\n  A fourth example of renewable and alternative energy is biomass and \nethanol.\n  Energy competitiveness can also come from a clear commitment to the \ndevelopment of biomass and ethanol-based fuels. Currently, most \nalternative fuels are not profitable without a Federal subsidy, but if \nwe continue to support the industry until it reaches profitability, \nmuch as with wind power, it will become a self-sustaining model in its \nown right.\n  A Pentagon-sponsored study called ``Winning the Oil Endgame,'' \nprojects that biomass and ethanol-based fuels can create 750,000 new \njobs. This effort could revitalize rural and agricultural areas of \nAmerica. It could add tens of billions of dollars to farmers' revenue \nevery year.\n  Rural America is at the center of the next age of domestic energy \nproduction. Rather than spending $50 billion a year overseas to buy oil \nfrom foreign countries, we could be buying into rural America. We must \ncontinue to support these new industries.\n  The man who headed the research team that created the hybrid Toyota \nPrius tells his young researchers:\n\n       Forget about concentrating on such things as trivial \n     increments in performance or cost cutting. If you restrict \n     yourself to refining the prevailing paradigm, you will never \n     come up with an earth-shattering idea or technology.\n\n  That is the guy who heads the team that formed the new hybrid Prius, \nwhich is doing very well.\n  America needs to follow that sage advice. We need to move beyond \ntrivial increments in refining the prevailing petroleum paradigm. We \nneed to move on to the next Earth-shattering ideas and technologies.\n  During World War II, America created the Manhattan Project in an \neffort to develop the first nuclear weapons and win the war against \nfascism. That important effort involved sites at Hanford, Los Alamos, \nOak Ridge, and more than 30 locations in all. By 1945, the project \nemployed more than 130,000 people. It cost nearly $2 billion, or $20 \nbillion in 2004 dollars, that is, in current dollars.\n  Today, America needs a new Manhattan Project. As Tom Friedman put it \nin his book, ``The World is Flat,'' we need ``a crash program to . . . \ndevelop clean alternative energies.''\n  On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy told the Congress:\n\n       I believe that this nation should commit itself to \n     achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a \n     man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\n\n  Don't you remember that? That was a real challenge, an important and \nnecessary challenge. It lifted us up, helped us develop technologies, \nand made America feel good about itself.\n  Today, America needs a new challenge. As Friedman puts it, we need \n``a similar legacy project . . . a crash program for alternative energy \nand conservation to make America energy-independent in 10 years.''\n  Developing new energy sources in America will contribute to energy \nindependence. Energy independence will contribute to national security, \nand energy independence will contribute to the stability of energy \nsources, allowing business to go forward without the jolts of supply \ndisruptions. People facing the jolt of supply disruptions is a huge \nadditional part of the problem of dependence.\n  As well, developing new energy sources in America has the potential \nto turn renewable and alternative energy development into comparative \nadvantage for America, to gain an advantage for America. If we can \nfigure out how to make clean, cheap energy before other countries, then \nthose other countries will pay American companies to build energy \nproduction there.\n  Because of our early investments in the 1970s, America had an \nopportunity to become the world leader of the fossil alternative \nenergy. With lower energy prices and decreased Federal support, \nhowever, our advantage dwindled.\n  Countries such as Denmark and Germany built on our initial research. \nDenmark and Germany have become the world leaders in wind generation. \nDanish companies are now the No. 1 provider of wind services in \nAmerica, outnumbering even American companies.\n  The Danish became world leaders in wind power production by first \ngrowing the industry at home. According to the Danish Wind Industry \nAssociation, the Danish wind industry has created 20,000 new jobs. It \nexports 90 percent of the wind turbines it creates, and it supplies 20 \npercent of Denmark's electricity.\n  This is all because Denmark was the second country to reach the \ncritical production level of 100 megawatts a year in 1987. That was 4 \nyears after America. But we decided to end wind power subsidies for a \ntime. That put them ahead.\n  There is a silver lining, however. America still has the resources to \ncreate technologies that could be turned into comparative advantages. \nBecause of our wind power penetration, we are still fairly advanced \ncompared to other nations. With a concerted effort for research, \ndevelopment, and production of wind generation--or solar power or other \nenergy programs that we have been working on--we could easily become \nthe world leaders in those industries if we put our mind and effort to \nit.\n  America has underinvested in research and development. This happens \nbecause firms invest in R based on the private return to their firms \nalone.\n  The social rate of return to investment, however, exceeds the private \nreturn. As economists put it, positive externalities exist. These \nexternal benefits come from knowledge spillovers, the creation of \npublic goods, and economies of scale. The existence of these \nexternalities--an awful word, but it is so powerful--counsels that the \nGovernment needs to subsidize R until the private rate of return \nmatches the social rate of return. Traditionally, governments have used \na few different policy tools to subsidize R: the first as government \nresearch grants to industry and educational institutions but, second, \nto provide tax incentives for R A third tool is the increasingly \npopular and effective technique of offering prizes to spur innovation.\n  For example, in 1714, the British Government offered the longitude \nprize, a prize of 20,000 pounds, for precise determination of a ship's \nlongitude. John Harrison solved the problem and eventually won the \nprize using precision clocks.\n  A year ago, SpaceShipOne won the Ansari X Prize competition. The X \nPrize Foundation offered $10 million to the first private venture to \nsend a privately funded craft into space twice in a week.\n  The Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, MA, offers a $1 million \nprize each for the solutions of seven Prize problems. The problems are \nclassic mathematical questions that have resisted solution over the \nyears.\n  Prizes like these involve little risk for the Government. And these \nprizes provide a very efficient, market-based approach to subsidy. For \nevery success, there will be numerous failures. It is extremely \ndifficult to predict who the winner will be. America needs to invest in \na basket of potential technologies.\n  In 1874, it was a dream of science fiction: Jules Verne envisaged a \nworld in which water would replace coal as the fuel of the future.\n  Now Icelanders believe they can do just that; they can turn that \ndream into science fact. And they have taken steps to create the \nworld's first hydrogen society.\n  In old Icelandic sagas, whales were either good or evil. The evil \nwhales swallowed boats and men. Just talking about such whales while on \na boat would bring bad luck.\n  In contrast, the blue whale protected both boats and men. Blue whales \nwould scare away all the evil whales. According to old Icelandic sagas, \nblue whales would warn fishermen by circling a boat three times in a \nrow.\n  Sometimes energy sources can also appear to be good or bad. With \nhydrogen, Iceland hopes it has found the energy equivalent of a good \nblue whale.\n  Certainly, with the 1970s oil shocks and now the Katrina-related \nprice spikes, we have been warned at least three times in a row to seek \nout safer seas.\n  In the 19th century, America plotted the course to a more productive \nenergy future. In this new century, let us see that America once again \nleads the way.\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nLet us once again chart a course to more secure energy waters. And let \nus once again explore the uncharted oceans of possibilities and bring \nthe energy that we need safely home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11414-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             R TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, because I support innovation and continued \neconomic growth, I am pleased to announce my cosponsorship of S. 627, \nthe Investment in America Act of 2005 sponsored by my colleague Senator \nHatch.\n  With a permanent R tax credit, companies will no longer have to \nworry about the potential for expiration and may more accurately gauge \nlong-term investment for research and development. Certainty to the \nmarket will help provide much-needed stability and assist U.S. \ncompanies in overseas competition. This permanent tax credit will allow \ncompanies the flexibility they want, and gives them the time needed to \ndevelop new and innovative ideas.\n  In global terms, it is extremely important that the United States \nremains a leader in a variety of sectors, from technology to \nmanufacturing. Countries such as France, Japan, Australia, Pakistan, \nSpain, India, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, United \nKingdom, and Canada all have permanent R credits. If we want to stay \ncompetitive, we must put our country on at least equal footing to that \nof our foreign competitors.\n  In Montana, over 100 companies engage in research and development and \nstand to benefit from the R tax credit. When Steve Lethert, \ncontroller of Wood's Powr-Grip Company from Laurel, MT, visited my \noffice, he expressed that a permanent tax incentive is vital to his \ncompany's growth. This bill will not only help the United States \neconomy at large but will benefit those in the Big Sky State.\n  In March 2004 when Senator Hatch proposed to extend the credit for 18 \nmonths during debate of the Jumpstart Our Business Strength, JOBS, Act \nof 2004. I was pleased to support that measure, and hope that the \nSenate will soon provide permanency to such an advantageous tool for \nour businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11414-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, today, I rise to speak on an innovative \nand creative proposal submitted by the Republic of the Philippines that \nwould provide debt relief to the 100 most heavily indebted nations. \nThis proposal was presented to the Boards of the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank on September 20, 2005, by the Honorable Jose De \nVenecia, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Congress of the \nRepublic of the Philippines. The proposal has received a positive \nreception by financial and political authorities in Western Europe and \nwill be considered by the Paris Club at its next meeting.\n  The proposal, known as the Debt-for-Millennium Development Goals--\nMDG--Investments program, would allow creditor countries to convert up \nto 50 percent of the debt-service payments from debtor countries into \nequities or other forms of investment capital. Such equities would \nsubsequently be use to finance MDG initiatives, including, but not \nlimited to, reforestation, energy, mass housing, irrigation, food \nproduction, and postharvest facilities, ecotourism projects, safe water \nsystems, hospitals, infrastructure, and microfinancing.\n  The Debt-for-MDG Investments proposal is voluntary and would augment \nthe agreements made by G8 countries to depreciate multilateral debt \nowed by heavily indebted countries. Creditor countries will have a say \nin which projects they support in a specific debtor country. For \nexample, under the proposal, a creditor country may decide to help \nfinance housing construction to address the needs of low-income \nhouseholds in a debtor country. In addition, the proposal would provide \ndebtor countries with the opportunity to improve on its infrastructure \nand make the economic and social investments required for them to \nachieve a self-sustaining economic stability.\n  Developing countries with heavy debt burdens face tremendous \nchallenges in meeting the Millennium Development Goals of the United \nNations and in promoting their own economic development and growth. The \nPhilippine Debt-for-MDG Investments program proposal is one innovative \nand creative approach in bringing together the G8 countries to help \naddress the debt burdens of the 100 most heavily indebted nations. I \nencourage my colleagues to review the Republic of the Philippines' \nproposal in the hopes that it will spark productive discussion and \ndebate on this international problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my statement, \nand the September 20, 2005, statement of Speaker De Venecia before the \nBoards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            (Sept. 20, 2005)\n\n                        Debt for MDG Investments\n\n                          (By Jose De Venecia)\n\n       On this eve of the 2005 World Summit, I am honored to be \n     given this opportunity to elaborate before this distinguished \n     body on the Philippine proposal for a ``Debt-for-MDG-\n     Investments'' program to help realize the UN's Millennium \n     Development Goals--the foremost of which is to cut world \n     poverty in half by 2015.\n       Since the late eighteenth century--a time of the \n     overturning of monarchies and the emergence of ordinary \n     people on the stage of history--visionaries inspired by \n     scientific progress and the promise of the new international \n     economy have dreamt of an end to poverty.\n       Yet a World Bank study finds that, until now, 1.2 billion \n     people still have a daily spending power equal to about the \n     price of a hamburger, or a can of soft drink and a chocolate \n     bar, in the West.\n       And, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, \n     about 815 million people go to bed hungry (among them 200 \n     million children under the age of five).\n       Of course, the Good Book says the poor we will always have \n     with us.\n       But--in our age of the information revolution--it has \n     become more and more difficult to segregate poverty and \n     wealth: To prevent the poor from realizing what is possible.\n       So that--in the long run--the peace and prosperity of the \n     rich depend on the well-being of all the others.\n\n\n                         the world debt burden\n\n       Since the 1980s, the weakest economies have been weighted \n     down by their burden of external debt.\n       Nowadays, the 100 most-heavily-indebted poor and middle-\n     income countries must service over 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars \n     in combined debt-stock yearly.\n       Debt-servicing in effect deprives these countries of scarce \n     resources and hard-earned savings which they could otherwise \n     invest in economic growth, job-creation, and poverty-\n     reduction.\n       To pay off interests and principals, our governments are \n     forced to slash social spending and investment in \n     infrastructure. They are also forced to impose more--and \n     higher--taxes.\n       Typically, debt-ridden states must sacrifice budget \n     allocations for education, health care, housing, and \n     development projects in the name of financial responsibility \n     and continued access to international capital markets.\n       And, all too often, even such sacrifices come to naught, \n     because the higher a poor country's debt-stock, the lower the \n     level of foreign-investor confidence--and the higher the \n     premium that lenders charge on its debt-paper.\n       In sum, the debt-burden of the developing world--a burden \n     that's still growing--has\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\n     been blocking economic progress for billions of the world's \n     poorest peoples.\n       Now the creditor-countries must realize that the poor \n     economies need a respite from the burden of their debts.\n       This is the only way they can achieve the higher--and \n     better-quality--economic growth which is the key to reducing \n     global poverty that the MDG seeks.\n\n\n                The HIPC Initiative of the G-8 Countries\n\n       Let me say--up front--that we welcome the decision of the \n     G-8 countries to condone tens of billions of dollars in loans \n     of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries or HIPCs (pronounced \n     ``hipicks'')--which are states mostly from the African \n     continent.\n       This is a compassionate--and praiseworthy--step the G-8 has \n     taken--to reduce to ``sustainable'' levels the debt-stock of \n     this most vulnerable group of countries.\n       We must all realize, however, that the HIPCs make up a \n     relatively-tiny group--when compared to the absolute number \n     of poor peoples in the so-called middle-income countries.\n       In fact, over three-quarters of the world's poorest peoples \n     are found, not in Africa, but in Southeast Asia, South Asia, \n     the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.\n       ``Middle-income'' countries with large populations--such as \n     Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, and the Philippines--\n     have much larger absolute numbers of people who themselves \n     subsist on less than US$1 a day.\n       And the countries of which these absolutely-poor people are \n     part are also saddled by debts just as debilitating as those \n     of their African counterparts.\n\n\n                        Beyond Debt Forgiveness\n\n       Undeniably--if we are to achieve substantially the \n     Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of the \n     world's poor by 2015--the global community must organize \n     deeper, wider, and faster debt relief than that awarded to \n     the largely-African HIPCs.\n       Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University--in his Report on the \n     UN Millennium Project--has warned that the world community \n     has barely enough time to meet its MDG targets.\n       We believe it naive to ask for debt-write-offs for the \n     middle-income countries.\n       The cost of universal debt-forgiveness may be too much for \n     even the rich countries to bear.\n       Realistically, middle-income countries such as the \n     Philippines seek no more than a breathing spell from their \n     huge debt-service burdens.\n       Laying down their debt-burdens--even for a short while--\n     would give them enough ``fiscal space'' to finance their \n     requirements of growth and poverty-reduction under the social \n     objectives of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n                        The Philippine Proposal\n\n       The ``Debt-for-MDG-Investments'' program that my Government \n     proposes seeks to provide that fiscal breathing space.\n       We offer the Philippine proposal as a complement to the \n     agreement by the G-8 countries to write off multilateral debt \n     owed by the poorest countries.\n       We plead neither for debt-forgiveness nor for debt-\n     cancellation.\n       Our proposal requires no new monies from the parliaments \n     and governments of the rich countries. Neither do we envision \n     any reduction or loss of face-value in the creditor's \n     financial asset.\n       Furthermore, participation by creditors in the debt-for-\n     equity program will be voluntary.\n       And creditors would have the option of choosing which MDG \n     projects to support in a specific debtor-country.\n       We propose only that the rich countries plow back into the \n     economies of the debtor-countries--over an agreed-on period--\n     an agreed-on portion of the debt-service payments they \n     receive.\n       These payments would be plowed back in the form of \n     equities, or other kinds of financial assets, and channeled \n     toward MDG programs--such as reforestation, mass-housing, \n     safe water systems, hospitals, infrastructure, or micro-\n     financing.\n       To be sure, there have been debt-for-equity and debt-for-\n     nature initiatives in the past.\n       For instance, the United States--through its Tropical \n     Forest Conservation Act--allowed debt relief, debt buy-back, \n     or debt restructuring for countries like the Philippines on \n     their bilateral loan obligations.\n       But those instances have been few, small, and sporadic.\n       What we propose is a large-scale conversion of debt for MDG \n     projects--a plow-back of up to 50 percent of debt-service \n     payments received.\n       Creditors may also choose to convert up to 50% of their \n     debt-stock holdings immediately. This will save a debtor-\n     country up to half of its debt-service payments.\n       In countries where debt-stocks are huge and where the debt-\n     service payment alone is significant, the creditor may choose \n     to convert only the stream of debt payments.\n\n\n                  Positive response in Western Europe\n\n       We are offering this program for consideration by the Paris \n     Club and the G-8 governments; by the multilateral financial \n     institutions and the regional development banks; and by the \n     world's large commercial banks.\n       And I am pleased to tell you that the Philippine proposal \n     has been received positively by financial and political \n     authorities in Western Europe.\n       The Italian Government, for one, agreed to ``give favorable \n     consideration to the Philippine proposal--once [it] is \n     submitted to the Paris Club.''\n       For its part, the German Government has promised it ``will \n     work to ensure your proposals are discussed openly and \n     constructively in the Paris Club.''\n       In London, senior Treasury officials on the International \n     Poverty Reduction Team also assured me they would consider \n     the proposal seriously in the Paris Club.\n       Subsequently I was able to meet with Jean-Pierre Jouyet, \n     President of the Paris Club. After hearing me out, he decided \n     to create immediately a `Technical Committee' of experts to \n     evaluate our proposal for presentation to the Club's 21 \n     member-states.\n\n\n                            menu of options\n\n       Our ``Debt-for-MDG-Investments'' program will be backed by \n     tangible assets--most of which would be value-creating, job-\n     generating, and tradable in themselves.\n       A particular creditor may convert his debt-holdings into \n     equities in new projects that have their own prospective \n     income streams.\n       Or he may choose to put it in trusts or endowment funds for \n     social investments--such as USAID has done through the World \n     Wildlife Fund, under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act.\n       As a third alternative, debt-service receipts may be plowed \n     back into new lending for long-term social-reform programs. \n     This third alternative the World Bank and other multilateral \n     institutions may be inclined to consider.\n       We are extra-cautious in our approach to the holders of \n     public-sector bonds, domestic government securities, and \n     Brady Bonds--because we do not wish to give them any cause \n     for alarm.\n       Nonetheless, we eagerly invite them--as they see fit--to \n     convert their bond-holdings into equity in assets being \n     privatized by developing-country governments.\n       Technically, no one should lose under this Philippine \n     proposal. The debt-service and/or principal amount is merely \n     converted into equities in new or existing projects of at \n     least equal value, and with their own earnings potential.\n\n\n                          the philippine case\n\n       To illustrate how far this proposed program would benefit a \n     specific middle-income state, let me cite the case of the \n     Philippines.\n       Our MDG projects over 2005-2010 will cost roughly $6.5 \n     billion in social investments yearly.\n       Our domestic financing capacity for these projects is $5 \n     billion yearly. Thus we face a residual-financing gap of $1.5 \n     billion.\n       Meanwhile, for 2005 alone, the Philippines will be paying \n     roughly US$2 billion in interest and another US$ 2.5 billion \n     in principal amortization on our foreign debt.\n       If, say, 50 percent of this total amount were freed under \n     our proposal, the Philippines will have the equivalent of \n     112.5 billion pesos (at more than 50 pesos to one U.S. \n     dollar) worth of anti-poverty projects--enough to ensure it \n     is able to meet all its Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n                         re-investment choices\n\n       Debtor-countries like the Philippines can readily offer \n     specific projects as the object of debt-for-MDG investments. \n     Creditors may wish to consider the following.\n       1. Debt-for-Reforestation--These are projects that will \n     regenerate forest resources; bring back green cover to the \n     bald mountains in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; restore \n     the ecological balance and create hundreds of thousands of \n     jobs in upland rural communities throughout the poor \n     countries.\n       By taking advantage of carbon credits under the Kyoto \n     Protocol, investors in reforestation projects can realize \n     investment paybacks within three years.\n       Moreover, it has been well-established that reforestation \n     projects in tropical countries can turn a $100,000 investment \n     into $3 million in ten years from timber sales alone.\n       2. Debt for Energy--Current runaway oil prices have given \n     impetus to the search for indigenous and renewable \n     alternatives to hydrocarbons.\n       The successful Brazilian experiment of substituting ethanol \n     from sugar cane for petroleum is already being adopted by \n     many countries not only to lower their dependence on foreign \n     crude but also to lower their energy costs.\n       High oil prices have now made the conversion of cane sugar \n     to ethanol more profitable than its traditional use to \n     produce sugar granules.\n       The Philippines has set itself the goal of replacing 30% of \n     the gasoline it consumes with ethanol within three to five \n     years. Setting up a sufficient number of ethanol factories in \n     our sugar-producing regions will require investments of \n     roughly $1.5 billion.\n       3. Debt for Mass-Housing--The lack of shelter is a common \n     problem in many developing countries.\n       In the Philippines alone, we have a backlog of up to four \n     million units. This is due mainly to the lack of long-term \n     financing at interest rates our low-income households could \n     afford.\n       Housing loans that extend over 15 to 25 years will create \n     mass demand in our construction sector. And this demand will \n     ripple widely throughout the economy. Not only is building \n     labor-intensive. Its has strong linkages with other \n     industries.\n       4. Debt for irrigation, food production, and post-harvest \n     facilities--In many developing countries, the interrelated \n     problems of rural poverty, under-employment, hunger, and \n     malnutrition are best dealt with through strategic \n     investments in basic food production, irrigation, and farm-\n     storage facilities.\n       Off-farm employment can be enlarged through investments in \n     high-value crops and\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\n     animal production, food processing and other post-harvest \n     facilities.\n       Creditor-countries can set up community-based corporations \n     in these activities with equity participation from local \n     government units, cooperatives, or non-government \n     organizations.\n       5. Debt for Eco-Tourism--Many poor countries have natural \n     tourist attractions which are often located in untouched \n     regions far from the usual tourist spots.\n       In the Philippines alone, there are dozens of white-sand \n     beaches, secluded coves, and diving sites, historical \n     attractions, and mountain vistas--all with strong potential \n     to attract global tourists.\n       Foreign investment can make these potential tourism sites \n     attractive by giving them modern infrastructure such as \n     airports, communication lines, and hotel facilities.\n       Investors may also wish to develop specific areas as \n     complete travel ``packages''--much as Bali, in Indonesia, has \n     become. Ecological tourism in the new countries will bring \n     many benefits--even apart from enabling the developing \n     country to generate foreign exchange.\n       6. Debt for Wealth-Creating Projects. Many developing \n     countries possess natural resources they are unable to \n     exploit because of their lack of investment capital. The \n     Philippines, for one, can potentially become the world's \n     fifth-largest minerals producer. Substantial deposits of \n     gold, copper, and nickel have been discovered in many parts \n     of the archipelago.\n       Oil and gas wells are now operational in the Malampaya \n     areas in offshore Palawan.\n       In addition, land-reclamation programs may be launched in \n     coastal cities like Manila, Cebu, Davao--all of which need \n     room for expansion. These programs could raise billions of \n     pesos for the foreign investor and the Philippine State.\n       Reclamation, as we know has been a major stimulus to the \n     economies of Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n\n                           Social Investments\n\n       Bilateral or multi-lateral creditors, who offer official \n     loans, will be attracted to social investment opportunities \n     for their Debt-for-MDG programs.\n       There are many ways through which official lenders can plow \n     back their debt-service receipts into social investment in \n     the poor countries. Among them are the following:\n       1. Debt for Education. Millions of young people in poor \n     countries have little or no access to basic education. Debt-\n     payments can be plowed back into school buildings, \n     instructional materials, and better pay and training for \n     public-school teachers in the poor countries.\n       They can also fund school-feeding programs and ``wages for \n     learning'' incentive schemes that keep potential drop-outs in \n     school--as well as college scholarships and ``study-now-pay-\n     later'' programs. In making these social investments, \n     creditors can deal directly with local. government units and \n     school boards.\n       2. Debt for Hospitals and Health Care. Debt-relief funds \n     can also be channeled to primary health-care facilities such \n     as puericulture centers, general hospitals, and diagnostic \n     laboratories. Even more useful are mass vaccination programs \n     to prevent epidemic that now kill people in poor countries in \n     great number.\n       3. Debt for Micro-Finance. The United Nations regards \n     microfinance as a key strategy in poverty reduction. The \n     success of microlending in Bangladesh and elsewhere proves \n     how much poor people (particularly rural women) can do--given \n     a little capital.\n       The hundreds of micro-banks operating throughout the Third \n     World can use recycled debt-service payments to expand their \n     coverage and to raise their loan levels to the local \n     entrepreneurs they serve.\n       If we are to realize the vision we share--of halving the \n     world's' most abject poor in 10 years' time--we will need the \n     concerted action of the world's richest economies.\n       According to the ``Report on the UN Millennium Project,'' \n     the MDGs will require from the donor-states at least $50 \n     billion more yearly--on top of the US$88 billion the rich \n     countries have already committed in Official Development \n     Aid--to fund sufficiently their action points, reform \n     programs, and development requirements.\n       Persuading the G-8 countries and the Paris Club to raise \n     this new money will obviously be hard to do.\n       So we say outright that the world's donor and creditor \n     communities need not raise new money. They can easily meet \n     the most urgent needs of the poor and middle-income countries \n     just by agreeing to plow back a portion of their debt \n     payments into the economies of the poor countries--through \n     our Debt-for-MDG-Investments program.\n       The rich countries commonly reproach the poor countries for \n     dissipating in corruption too large a part of the foreign aid \n     they receive.\n       We believe this reproach to be richly deserved. We expect \n     that the debtor-countries which subscribe to the Philippine \n     proposal will agree to observe adequate standards of \n     transparency in their handling of recycled debt-payments--\n     particularly those that go into social investments. (In the \n     case of equity investments, investors will presumably be \n     protected by the normal business constraints.)\n\n\n                       An end at last to poverty?\n\n       In conclusion, let me emphasize that we in the so-called \n     middle-income countries are not seeking the charity of the \n     rich.\n       Whatever the outcome of this proposal, we shall continue to \n     honor our debts.\n       But we appeal to our creditors: Together let us seek \n     creative ways of easing our debt-burden--ways that will also \n     help us meet our obligations to you.\n       Right now, all we seek is some fiscal breathing space--\n     which will allow us to realize our national Millennium \n     Development Goals by 2015.\n       With your consent and your support--and with a little help \n     from the various institutions of the United Nations, as well \n     as the world's large commercial banks--we can launch together \n     a massive international effort, truly to ``make poverty \n     history.''\n       Thank you for hearing me out, and good day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11416-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING JAMES E. KELLEY\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I wish \nto honor the life of a great man, Jim Kelley, who died Sunday, leaving \nbehind a legacy of generosity and selflessness. He was known as a \nvisionary businessman, a dedicated public servant, and a kind-hearted \nhumanitarian. His friends and family will miss him dearly, and I know \nthat sentiment is shared by countless others across Indiana and the \ncountry.\n  Jim grew up during the Great Depression on a farm in northeast \nIndiana. Through hard work and study, Jim became a great business \nsuccess, a position he used to support his many philanthropic efforts. \nThere was hardly a Fort Wayne charity or non-profit that did not \nbenefit from Jim's generosity. In addition to helping existing \ncharities, Jim actively sought new ways to help the people in his \ncommunity and even families halfway around the world. From creating a \ngolf tournament to support local charities to organizing humanitarian \ntrips to help foster families in the former Soviet Republic of Moldova, \nJim's philanthropy had no boundaries.\n  Jim believed in equality and worked hard to provide opportunities for \nall Hoosiers. When he purchased Brookwood Golf Club in the 1960s, it \nbecame the first privately owned course in the area to welcome African-\nAmerican golfers. He was also a supporter of Union Baptist Church, the \noldest African-American church in Fort Wayne.\n  As Chairman of the Democratic Party in Allen County, Jim became one \nof the most influential Democrats in the County's history. His role \nhelped restore the Democratic Party in Allen County and provided him \nwith yet another avenue to improve the quality of life for area \nHoosiers.\n  There is a saying that life is not about what you take out of it, but \nwhat you put back in. Jim lived that sentiment to the fullest. He \ntouched countless lives through his work, from local families in Fort \nWayne to children an ocean away in Eastern Europe. While Jim was a \nleader in many aspects, including business, politics and community \nservice, it is his generosity of spirit that Hoosiers will remember \nmost. I am proud to be among the many Hoosiers to call him my friend, \nand I will miss him.\n  Indiana lost a great man this week. It is my sad honor to enter the \nname of James Kelley in the official record of the U.S. Senate for his \nservice to Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11416-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11416-S11417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING JOHN W.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize the many important accomplishments of John W. \nMack, as the Los Angeles Unified School District opens a new elementary \nschool on South Catalina Street in Los Angeles bearing his name.\n  Earlier this year, John W. Mack stepped down from his post as \npresident of the Los Angeles Urban League after 36 years of service. \nDuring his tenure, John led the venerable civil rights organization \nthrough an amazing period of growth and accomplishment. His ability to \nbuild coalitions with a wide variety of groups enabled him to keep the \nLos Angeles Urban League focused on providing opportunity to African \nAmericans and other minorities over the years. Under John's leadership, \nthe Los Angeles Urban League's budget grew from $1.7 million to nearly \n$25 million; providing funding for innovative, results-oriented\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\njob training, job placement, education, academic tutorial, youth \nachievement and business development programs, serving more than \n112,000 people annually. Countless individuals credit John and the Los \nAngeles Urban League for helping them turn their lives around for the \nbetter, start businesses, and complete their education.\n  John Mack has an innate ability to forge partnerships with elected \nofficials, corporate leaders, local clergy, and community residents. \nHis ability to build bridges has made him a highly respected advocate \nfor equal opportunities in education, law enforcement and economic \nempowerment and has garnered him many awards. His coalition-building \nskills also proved useful during his youth, as he was an early leader \nof the civil rights movement with Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me and the thousands of people touched \nby his work in commending John W. Mack for his great leadership and \ntireless advocacy throughout his lifetime. Naming an elementary school \nafter a man who devoted so much of his life to bettering our Nation \nwill remind all who walk through its halls about the importance of \ncommunity service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11417-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11417-S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN CELEBRATION OF BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS AWARDS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nselection of Booker T. Washington Elementary School as a No Child Left \nBehind-Blue Ribbon Schools Award recipient. This prestigious honor is \nawarded to exemplary schools that meet one of two criteria. The \nnominated school must have at least 40 percent of a nominated school's \nstudent population come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and each \nsegment--including Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, low-income and special \neducation students must show scholastic improvement, or the school must \nscore in the top 10 percent on State achievement tests. This is a well \ndeserved honor for Booker T. Washington Elementary School, attesting to \nyears of tireless commitment that this school, as well as the First \nState, brings to educating our youth.\n  Booker T. Washington Elementary School is located in historic Dover, \nDE, the State's Capital. The school was founded in 1919 to serve \napproximately 240 African-American children from two schools in the \ndowntown Dover area. Today, the school serves approximately 350 \nstudents. Booker T. Washington's student body is now comprised of 56 \npercent African American, 2 percent Asian American, 8 percent Hispanic, \nand 34 percent Caucasian students. Twenty-three percent of the students \nare identified as special needs students. Approximately 9 percent of \nthe students have limited English proficiency. Forty-four percent of \nthe students qualify as low income. The school's small size and \nculturally rich student and staff population enhance the educational \nand social-emotional growth of the children and affords the school the \nopportunity to personalize the learning experience for the children.\n  The mission of Booker T. Washington is to offer the best educational \nprogram possible in order to develop the mind and character of each \nchild. To accomplish this mission, the school has established a firm \nfoundation in the core subject areas. Led by Principal Marcia Johnson, \nthey have established high expectations for all children and \ncommunicate these expectations daily in the staffs' work with them. \nBooker T. Washington provides an environment that celebrates and \npromotes understanding of self and others, and expects that everyone \nwill behave in a manner that represents the standards that have been \nset for the school community. Booker T. Washington has established \nclose working relationships with the parents and the community and \ndepends on their support to help the school meet its goals.\n  Booker T. Washington's primary program nurtures the continuing growth \nof children's knowledge and understanding of themselves and their \nworld. The remarkable growth of all children over the past 5 years is \nevident in the decreases in the achievement gaps between all subgroups \nof children served in the school. Not only is this school meeting \nyearly targets for all subgroups set by the State and capital school \ndistrict, but they are also moving more children into higher \nachievement levels. The growth that children have made is also a direct \nresult of staff members' use of data to make instructional decisions \nand their willingness to change their instructional practices by \nparticipating in professional development activities based on best \npractices. Collaborative decisionmaking and the participation of \nparents and the community in the decisionmaking process have added to \nBooker T. Washington's success.\n  The faculty and staff view themselves as a work in progress. They \nunderstand how far they have come over the past 5 years to change the \ncommunity's perception of their school and to provide instructional \nactivities that will move children toward the goals the district, \nState, and No Child Left Behind legislation have set for them as \nlearners. Five years ago, there were vast differences in student \nachievement in the areas of reading, writing, and mathematics. Today, \nalthough some discrepancies remain, the gap has narrowed significantly \nand continues to close. The school's selection as a national blue \nribbon school is a testament to their hard work and dedication.\n  Delaware is a small State, but we are building a growing record of \nachievement in public school education. Helping lead the way are the \nstudents at Booker T. Washington Elementary School, along with their \nteachers and parents. Collectively, they are truly an inspiration to \nother schools and communities in Delaware and throughout our Nation.\n  Today we also celebrate the selection of Long Neck Elementary School \nas a No Child Left Behind-Blue Ribbon Schools Award recipient. This \nprestigious honor is awarded to exemplary schools that meet one of two \ncriteria. The nominated school must have at least 40 percent of a \nnominated school's student population come from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, and each segment--including Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, \nlow-income and special education students--must show scholastic \nimprovement, or the school must score in the top 10 percent on State \nachievement tests. This is a well deserved honor for Long Neck \nElementary School, attesting to years of tireless commitment that this \nschool, as well as the First State, brings to educating our youth. It \nis also the fourth elementary school from the Indian River School \nDistrict to receive this national recognition, a remarkable \naccomplishment for any school district.\n  It is not surprising that such an award is bestowed upon a school \ncommitted to the philosophy that all students can achieve academic \nsuccess. The teachers and staff at Long Neck Elementary, led by \nPrincipal Charlynne Hopkins, are steadfast in their schoolwide goal \nthat all students are expected to meet Delaware's academic standards. \nFurthermore, Long Neck Elementary is dedicated to encouraging students \nto not only meet these standards but to exceed them regardless of their \nlimitations.\n  Long Neck Elementary School is located in the rural town of \nMillsboro, DE. The school is composed of a large percentage of students \nfrom low socio-economic backgrounds. Over half of the school's 522 \nstudents receive free or reduced-price lunches. Long Neck Elementary \nhouses a diverse population of students from prekindergarten to the \nfifth grade. The racially diverse student body includes students from \nall ethnic backgrounds, including African American, Hispanic, and \nAmerican Indian. In addition, Long Neck Elementary has an academically \ndiverse student population. The school offers an EXCEL program for high \nachieving students as well as an intensive learning center and other \nspecial education services for struggling learners. It is by combining \nthe efforts of the entire school family that the needs of students at \nLong Neck Elementary are met and exceeded.\n  At Long Neck Elementary, the school family consists of parents, \nteachers, support staff and community members, all working together \ncollaboratively for the benefit and growth of its students. An active \nand continually growing parent teacher organization there works to \nenable parents to support their school and their children. In addition, \nparents and community members partner with the school through its \nCreative Mentoring program, classroom volunteer opportunities, an\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\n``adopt a class'' program, and a weekly career corner on the Long Neck \nElementary School's televised news program. Lastly, the school \nimprovement committee, which consists of staff, parents, and community \nmembers, identifies and allocates resources to enhance achievement for \nall students.\n  At Long Neck Elementary, students are not only challenged \nacademically. They are also expected to demonstrate model behavior. \nGood citizenship is reinforced through a character education program \nwhere students are honored monthly with certificates and medals for \ndemonstrating the six pillars of good character which promotes making \npositive choices and becoming a productive member of society.\n  No school could achieve the gains and progress Long Neck Elementary \nhas met without having a staff that believes every child can learn and \nwho are committed to providing students opportunities to reach their \nfullest potential. Long Neck Elementary has implemented professional \nlearning communities where teachers work closely together, both within \nand across grade levels, to promote learning. All members of the staff \nassist students in improving their academic performances, increasing \nthe likelihood that they will find success through their school years \nand go on to become productive and active members of society. This is \ndone through after school programs, differentiated instruction, and \nextra support programs. In addition, instructional staff members \nparticipate in numerous learning-focused professional development \nactivities, which enable them to provide students with instructional \nstrategies that are sound and research-based.\n  Tirelessness of staff and parents at Long Neck Elementary have made \npossible real progress in closing that school's achievement gap. Along \nwith the National Blue Ribbon Schools Award, the school also earned \n``Superior'' rating from the State of Delaware in 2003, 2004, and 2005. \nLong Neck Elementary School is a school that demonstrates that all \nstudents can learn. The school's selection as a national blue ribbon \nschool is a testament to their hard work and dedication.\n  Delaware is a small State, but we are building a growing record of \nachievement in public school education. Helping lead the way are the \nstudents at Long Neck Elementary School, along with their teachers and \nparents. Collectively, they are truly an inspiration to other schools \nand communities in Delaware and throughout our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11418-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JACK GHERTY OF LAND O'LAKES\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize an \nindividual who has made a significant positive difference in U.S. \nagriculture, agribusiness, rural communities and cooperative \nenterprise.\n  That individual is Land O'Lakes' President and Chief Executive \nOfficer Jack Gherty, retiring after a 35-year career with the \ncooperative and 16 years as its President and CEO.\n  During his tenure as CEO, Land O'Lakes was transformed from a \nregional to a national farmer-owned business and membership \norganization--giving producers a powerful presence in the marketplace \nand, from my experience, an equally powerful and positive voice in the \npolicy arena.\n  Jack Gherty's role in Land O'Lakes' transformation comes as no \nsurprise, for agriculture, rural communities and cooperatives have \nalways been close to his heart.\n  Gherty grew up on his family's western Wisconsin dairy and livestock \nfarm, in a close-knit rural community, where the local cooperative was \nat the center of agribusiness activity.\n  He learned the importance of diligence and teamwork. He learned to \nvalue family, community and the land. And, he learned the important \nrole farmer-owned businesses can play in helping preserve the integrity \nof family-based agriculture and rural communities.\n  Jack carried these lessons with him when he left the farm in the mid-\n1960s and earned business and law degrees from the University of \nWisconsin. They were also part of his work in the late 1960s as a VISTA \nvolunteer on the tough, poverty-stricken south side of Chicago.\n  In 1970, Jack joined the Land O'Lakes law department. Over the next \nseveral years, he held a number of executive positions within the \ncooperative. In 1989, the board selected him to serve as Land O'Lakes' \nPresident and CEO.\n  In this leadership role, Gherty continued to be driven by a strong \nset of personal values. He combined this with the belief that the most \ncritical role a CEO must play is defining organizational culture, and \nhe immediately began working with the board and his leadership team to \nset the foundation for Land O'Lakes' future--the organization's vision, \nmission and values.\n  Over the past 16 years, Gherty's vision, mission and values have \nserved Land O'Lakes and its members well. Not only has Land O'Lakes \nbuilt business success while remaining true to its cooperative \nprinciples, the company has gained a reputation for uncompromising \nstandards of ethics and integrity and has established a strong record \nof corporate social responsibility.\n  As a Minnesotan, I am proud to count Land O'Lakes as a Minnesota-\nbased company. I am proud of its ethics. I admire its contributions to \nthe success of family-based agriculture and producer-owned \nagribusiness. I share its rural and family values. I applaud its \ncommitment to community.\n  I am equally proud of Jack Gherty's record as its leader and of the \nvalues that have shaped his career--and, in turn, the Land O'Lakes of \ntoday.\n  A few years ago, Jack Gherty traveled here to Washington D.C. to \nspeak at the 35th Anniversary celebration for VISTA. At that time he \nsaid, ``The most successful and satisfied people are not those who are \nout to make an impression, but rather those who are out to make a \ndifference.''\n  Jack Gherty has made an impression by making a difference, and I am \npleased to share his achievements with you today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11418-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AMMON, IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

I have lived close to Ammon my entire life; it is a fine \ncommunity and a great place for families.

Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we \nface--not just in Iowa but all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our towns. This is about economics, but it is \nalso about our culture and identity. After all, you won't find the \nheart and soul of Iowa at Wal-Mart or Home Depot out in the strip \nmalls. No, the heart and soul of Iowa is in our family farms, and on \nMain Street in communities all across my State. That is why we need to \nbe as generous as possible--and creative as possible--in keeping our \ndowntowns not just alive but thriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my State--is in a class by itself. It is smart. It is effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the town of Burlington, IA, is making an effort to \nimprove the aesthetics and function of its downtown area. So many of \nour rural communities are fading away, but with the assistance of \nFederal funding through a Main Street grant, Burlington is revitalizing \nits downtown. Downtown Burlington has been waiting for a grocery\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nstore for years, and all studies and market analysis done in the city \nfor the past 10 years have shown that a grocery store would be a great \nasset to the area. Becky and Tom Shockley, two Burlington citizens, \nhave led the charge to get this project completed, and will be \ninvesting almost $4 million into this project made possible through the \nMain Street Challenge Grant. This project serves the people of \nBurlington in more ways than just providing them a grocery store; it \nwill create jobs, increase the tax base, and help to improve the \ncommunity at large.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our towns and rural communities. I have been \npleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main Street \nIowa Challenge Grants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa Department \nof Economic Development help provide technical assistance, but, as we \nhave seen in Burlington, success itself comes from local leadership, \nlocal teamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is a shining example of new construction and a catalyst \nfor future projects. With a continued increase in residents living in \ndowntown Burlington, a grocery store is a much needed addition. When \npeople see one of the anchor businesses on Main Street being renovated \nor expanded, this can change the whole psychology of a town or \ncommunity. It offers hope. It serves as a catalyst for a far-reaching \nripple effect of positive changes.\n  So I congratulate Becky and Tom Shockley and the citizens of \nBurlington for putting together a winning proposal to secure a Main \nStreet Challenge Grant. Their efforts to reinvigorate their historic \ndowntown are setting a terrific example for other small towns across \nAmerica, and for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11419-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN APPRECIATION OF CONNECTICUT'S METROPOLITAN DISTRICT COMMISSION\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today is Metropolitan District \nCommission Day in Connecticut and it is with great pleasure that I send \nmy congratulations to the commission as it celebrates another year of \nimpressive service to the people of Connecticut and our State's \nriverfronts.\n  Seven years ago, Connecticut's Metropolitan District Commission took \non a groundbreaking mission. Expanding its role of providing water and \nsewer services to the Hartford region, the commission made a historic \nstep to partner with the organization Riverfront Recapture to maintain \nConnecticut Riverfront parks and provide funding for park rangers in \neach of the parks. Metropolitan District Commission believed then as it \nbelieves today that creating and maintaining an attractive waterfront \nenvironment is valuable to everyone in a community.\n  Of course, the Metropolitan District Commission is no newcomer to \ncivic engagement. For decades the commission has participated in \nenhancing the Connecticut River's water quality--making it possible to \nuse the once-polluted river for a rich variety of recreational \nactivities, including fishing tournaments, triathlons, rowing regattas, \nand dragon boat races.\n  Metropolitan District Commission's partnership with Riverfront \nRecapture is only natural. The team has worked together skillfully to \ncreate a welcoming presence in the parks and attracting visitors as \nwell as residents. Last year, more than 786,000 people visited the \nriverfront parks and as much as $4 billion worth of development \nprojects are underway or planned within walking distance of the parks. \nThe Metropolitan District Commission's funding efforts and maintenance \ncapabilities are critical to making the mission succeed. \nUnsurprisingly, this exceptional partnership is attracting national \nattention as a model for urban parks management.\n  By commemorating the contributions of the Metropolitan District \nCommission today, we honor the spirit of entrepreneurship that has \nprofited the people of Connecticut and their guests so significantly.\n  I am very happy to join colleagues in honoring the Metropolitan \nDistrict Commission on this day, October 25, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11419-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL BRAD APPLEGATE\n\n Mr. SMITH.

In doing so, I also pay tribute to all those who wear our \nNation's uniform, as Colonel Applegate's professionalism and capability \nis characteristic of all those who serve to protect our Nation.\n  Brad Applegate began his association with the Air Force while \nattending Indiana University when he received an Air Force Reserve \nOfficer Training Course aviation scholarship. Upon graduating, he \nreceived his commission in the U.S. Air Force, and shortly thereafter, \nbegan his training as an F-15 pilot. From that time until now, Brad has \nserved in many locations and has been awarded several decorations. As \nan F-15 pilot, he is quick to tell you that homeland security has long \nbeen his specialty.\n  My association with Colonel Applegate is relatively late in his \ncareer. With the recent round of Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, \nproposals from the Defense Department, the people of the Pacific \nNorthwest woke up to the news that the reassuring roar of the F-15 \nEagles from the 142nd Fighter Wing might not be flying over their heads \nin the years to come. I learned quickly that the Portland Air National \nGuard base was among the first bases to be scrutinized by the BRAC \nCommissioners and analysts.\n  With little more than a weekend to prepare, Colonel Applegate \norganized his team, sifted through the scant and murky details of the \nproposal, and prepared such an extensive briefing to the Commissioners \nand analysts that the efforts of the 142nd presentation became a model \nfor bases across the country. The media will give, and the politicians \nwill take, credit for saving the bases, but I am here today to set the \nrecord straight in regards to the preservation of the 142nd Fighter \nWing in Portland. The intelligence, skill, and knowledge of COL Brad \nApplegate and his team is why we will continue to have air defenses in \nthe Pacific Northwest. Without his leadership skills, my part of the \ncountry would be an open target for our enemies.\n  Colonel Applegate will soon be retiring from military service after \nmore than 20 years of dedicated service to his Nation. The leadership \ntorch of the 142nd Fighter Wing will soon be passed to another very \ncapable fighter pilot and leader, and the important work of our Air \nNational Guard will continue.\n  Mr. President, I would like to offer my words of appreciation and \nthanks to COL Applegate and the countless others who wear our Nation's \nuniform. Although our Nation has dangerous enemies who wish to do us \nharm, I sleep better at night knowing that the reassuring roar of the \nF-15 Eagles will continue to fly overhead in the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11419-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11419-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11419-5", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11419-S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE \n              AGREEMENT WITH THE SULTANATE OF OMAN--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 \n(Public Law 107-210) (the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the \nCongress of my intention to enter into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) \nwith the Sultanate of Oman.\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\n  The Agreement will generate export opportunities for U.S. companies, \nfarmers, and ranchers, help create jobs in the United States, and help \nAmerican consumers save money while offering them more choices. \nEntering into an FTA with Oman will build on the FTAs that we already \nhave with Israel, Jordan, and Morocco, as well as the FTA that we have \nconcluded with Bahrain, and will be an important step on the path to \nfulfilling my vision of developing economic growth and democracy in the \nMiddle East and creating a U.S.-Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by \n2013.\n  Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at \nleast 90 days in advance of signing the FTA.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill clarify certain National Park Service authorities for the Golden \nGate\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nNational Recreation Area and San Francisco Maritime National Historic \nPark.\n  I also want to thank Congresswoman Pelosi for introducing a similar \nbill in the house. As a San Francisco native and a former mayor, I know \nthese parks are extremely popular tourist sites and I believe this bill \nwill allow the National Park Service to restore and renovate these \nparks in order to maintain their status as top tourist destinations.\n  The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is one of the largest urban \nnational parks in the world--home to such renowned sites as the \nPresidio of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island. Additionally, the San \nFrancisco Maritime National Historic Park, located at the west end of \nSan Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, includes a fleet of landmark vessels \nand a maritime museum.\n  Presently, the revenue collected by these parks must be spent in the \nsame fiscal year in which it is collected. Otherwise, any revenue that \nis not spent is deposited in the National Treasury. This current policy \nmakes it difficult for these two parks to pursue long term, major \nrestoration projects. This bill makes the necessary changes to allow \nthese parks to undertake needed substantive restoration as opposed to \nsmaller, less significant projects allowed under the current revenue \nsystem.\n  The bill also calls for a modest boundary adjustment between the two \nadjacent parks in order to be consistent with the current \nadministration of San Francisco's Municipal Pier.\n  I am introducing this bill with the hope that it will allow these two \nparks to retain the revenue necessary for maintenance in order to \ncontinue to attract visitors from around the world to these historic \nsites of California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GOLDEN GATE NATIONAL RECREATION AREA.\n\n       Section 4(f) of Public Law 92-589 (16 U.S.C. 460bb-3) is \n     amended by striking ``Haslett Warehouse, Cliff House \n     Properties and Louis' Restaurant,'' and all that follows and \n     inserting ``Cliff House Properties and Louis' Restaurant, the \n     Secretary may enter into a contract for the management \n     (including rental or lease) of the aforementioned properties \n     with such terms and conditions as will protect the \n     Government's interest.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to clarify \njurisdiction of Federal Courts over a tort action brought by an alien, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nthat clarifies the meaning and scope of the Alien Tort Statute.\n  This 200-year-old law has spawned dozens of legal cases involving \nU.S. multinational companies, human rights groups, foreign plaintiffs, \nthe State Department, and millions of dollars in litigation costs. \nNumerous companies in California are in the midst of these lawsuits as \ndefendants and it is my view that legislation can help refine and \nimprove the law.\n  Judges have grappled in interpreting and applying the statute for \nyears now without a consensus view emerging. I think it would be fair \nto say that confusion reigns supreme when it comes to alien tort suits.\n  Given this opaque legal picture, last summer the Supreme Court ruled \non a case, Sosa v. Alvarez Machain, in an attempt to reconcile \nconflicting decisions from judges across the country.\n  The Court's June 2004 ruling was notable, for embracing certain \nprinciples that will help guide the Judiciary branch on alien tort \nclaim issues but for leaving many questions unanswered as well.\n  It held that a substantive, legal basis exists for foreigners to sue \nU.S. individuals and corporations over alleged human rights violations \noccurring in overseas locations. The Court essentially affirmed that a \nlimited, implicit sanction for courts exists to decide certain alien \ntort claims.\n  At the same time, the opinion provided a wide berth for what the \nclaims might actually be. The Court hedged on key issues, without \nclearly demarcating what suits ought to go forward under the statute \nand which ones should be summarily dismissed.\n  In particular the ruling did not address: which international law \nclaims by foreigners should be heard in a U.S. district court, and the \nstandard of liability for U.S. companies facing these human rights \ncharges.\n  To clarify these areas, the Justices wrote that they would welcome \n``any congressional guidance'' on the breadth of the statute. During \noral arguments a number of the Justices appeared to concur that a \nlegislative approach would make sense. One Justice even commented that \n``I just wonder if it isn't wise to . . . let Congress have a look at \nthis thing.''\n  Those views were echoed by a Washington Post editorial that followed \nsoon after. The paper stated that the alien tort law has ``formed the \nbasis for litigation against U.S. companies involved with nefarious \nregimes abroad. And while horrid conduct by an American company ought \nto be, where proven, grounds for action in American courts, the \nparameters of such litigation are surely a legislative question, not \none for the freewheeling discretion of judges. . . . But the court left \nopen the possibility that at least some of these suits can proceed in \nthe absence of further congressional action.''\n  The Court's perspective, along with the Post commentary, indicates, \nat least to me, a sense of caution about imposing by judicial fiat \naction that is better left to consideration and refinement by the \nCongress.\n  The Court's hesitation to legislate from the bench shifts the \nresponsibility to this body, I believe, to pass legislation that \nsettles on a reasonable legal means that plaintiffs and defendants \nalike can rely on to litigate their differences.\n  I believe the measure we are introducing today accomplishes this \nbasic and important goal.\n  Right now, courts are essentially adrift in terms of being able to \npinpoint the underlying meaning, scope and intent of this 200-year-old \nstatute. In its entirety, it reads: ``The district courts shall have \noriginal jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, \ncommitted in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United \nStates.''\n  The economy of words makes the law abstruse and subject to varying \ninterpretation. And complex, lengthy and unnecessary litigation has \nburdened the courts as a result.\n  This new bill will establish a fair, legal basis for filing suit \nunder the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). And it will have the added benefit \nof explicating the law's dual jurisdictional and substantive nature.\n  The measure: specifies a legal standard convicting defendants of \nwrongdoing if they directly participate with specific intent to commit \nthe alleged tort; codifies international claims under the Alien Tort \nlaw to include genocide, torture, slavery and slave trade, \nextrajudicial killing, and piracy; expands on existing statutory law, \nthe Torture Victim Protection Act; states that Federal courts shall not \nproceed with tort claims when the President adequately certifies that \nsuch exercise of jurisdiction will have a negative impact on the \nforeign policy interests of the U.S.; maintains that every effort \nshould be made to try these cases in the country of origin before \ngranting jurisdiction in U.S. courts; invokes a 10-year statute of \nlimitations on ATS charges filed against U.S. multinational companies; \nand disallows contingency fee arrangements for legal representatives of \nplaintiffs or defendants.\n  The Supreme Court's delineation that the Alien Tort law is \njurisdictional in one sense, but recognizes a restricted category of \nsubstantive claims encompassed by the law of nations, leaves many \nunresolved questions.\n  The historical origins of the ATS, passed by the First Congress as \npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, suggest that certain offenses \nrelevant to that period in American history--piracy, infringing the \nrights of ambassadors, and prevention of safe travel abroad--were meant \nto be prosecutable. But Justice Souter's Alvarez-Machain opinion notes \nthat a slim legislative history of the statute makes it difficult to \nsurmise the law's true intent.\n  At the same time, Justice Souter opined: ``Still, the history does \ntend to support two propositions. First, there is every reason to \nsuppose that the First Congress did not pass the ATS as a \njurisdictional convenience to be placed on the shelf for use by a \nfuture Congress or state legislature that might, some day, authorize \nthe creation of causes of action or itself decide to make some element \nof the law of nations actionable for the benefit of foreigners. The \nanxieties of the preconstitutional period cannot be ignored easily \nenough to think that the statute was not meant to have a practical \neffect. . . . The second inference to be drawn from the history is that \nCongress intended the ATS to furnish jurisdiction for a relatively \nmodest set of actions alleging violations of the law of nations.''\n  The opinion ranges further, that, such a ``modest set of actions'' \nindeed applies to current times, not merely offenses grounded in law \ntwo hundred\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\nyears ago. The critical portion reads: ``Accordingly, we think courts \nshould require any claim based on the present-day law of nations to \nrest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized \nworld and defined with specificity comparable to the features of the \n18th century paradigms we have recognized.''\n  I am uncomfortable with such a nebulous, open-ended legal approach \npermitting courts to entertain suits based on a ``norm of international \ncharacter'' and ``specificity'' consistent with crimes of early \nAmerican history. Adjudicating cases based on these broad historical \nand legal precepts is admirable. In practical terms it remains very \ndifficult.\n  The Congress ought to weigh in and play a constructive role. Without \nlegislation, judges will continue to reach markedly different \nconclusions under the law, based on arbitrary interpretations of case-\nspecific facts and other considerations.\n  Let's take the legal mystery out of the statute and what qualifies as \nan alien tort and replace it with something that is concrete and \nappropriate for the times.\n  At the heart of this legislation is codifying a class of violations \nof international law that will discourage defendant companies from \nconsorting with human rights violators in any respect. They will be \nheld liable if they do so by a specific standard that judges whether \nthey intentionally and directly caused certain violations of human \nrights.\n  A plaintiff victim will be able to vindicate their rights by filing \nan express statutory cause of action based on a half dozen egregious \nwrongs. Regardless of the foreign policy and trade implications, \ndefendant U.S. companies will be held fully accountable under the bill \nfor bad corporate behavior in their overseas business operations.\n  That is as it should be. Certain alien torts in violation of the law \nof nations ought to be cognizable and this legislation ensures that \nresult. Moreover, the fact that specific crimes are made actionable and \nenforceable will aid human rights organizations in their fight to \nstrengthen the deterrent effect of the law for potential violators.\n  Regarding the defendant perspective, in one friend of the court brief \nsubmitted in the Alvarez Machain case, the argument was made that ``. . \n. companies face enormous uncertainty regarding the scope of potential \nclaims under the statute. . . . Because ATS cases are based upon an \nimplied cause of action without any clear standards of liability, there \nmay be little companies can do to protect themselves against potential \nclaims, short of simply ceasing to do business in the many nations \nwhose human rights practices come up short against evolving Western \nideals.''\n  The business community ought to embrace this legislation precisely \nbecause it wipes away this uncertainty. The best way to encourage U.S. \nmultinationals to invest abroad is: 1. by specifying a universe of the \nmost egregious human rights violations that they may be held liable for \nand 2. offering a clear, understandable legal standard that judges \ntheir actions accordingly. This legislative measure tackles both issues \nhead on.\n\n  There are estimates that dozens of existing alien tort suits claim \ndamages--collectively--in excess of $200 billion dollars. That's an \nextraordinary sum that rightly concerns the U.S. business community, \nparticularly given numerous inconsistent federal courts verdicts handed \ndown in the past two decades.\n  This legislation deters private plaintiffs from filing sweeping and \nspecious claims simply because a corporation has a U.S. legal nexus and \ndeep pockets. Yet, it expands the basis for foreign plaintiffs pursuing \ncertain international law causes of action in federal court by \ncodifying their rights in a judicious way.\n  While some in the U.S. business community would prefer that the Alien \nTort statute be deleted from the U.S. Code altogether, I would \nrespectfully disagree. A fair compromise that balances the interests of \nU.S. companies and human rights organizations is what this legislation \nseeks to accomplish.\n  The Congress has waded into this debate before, passing the Torture \nVictim Protection Act in 1991, and this new legislation contains many \nsimilar elements: a statute of limitations, a statutory exhaustion \nprovision, and specifying torture and extrajudicial killing as within \nthe adjudicatory discretion of a district court.\n  There is precedent, then, for the Legislative branch acting to \nprovide civil redress for victims of torture. Asserting \nextraterritorial jurisdiction under the ATS, for torture and other jus \ncogen violations, has a firm footing in American jurisprudence.\n  The legislative history of the TVPA is important because it spells \nout the constitutional grounds justifying that statutory law and this \nnew legislation as well.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee report on the TVPA states as follows: \n``Under article III of the Constitution, the Federal judiciary has the \npower to adjudicate cases `arising under' the `law of the United \nStates.' The Supreme Court has held that the law of the United States \nincludes international law. . . . Congress's ability to enact this \nlegislation also derives from article I, section 8 of the Constitution \nwhich authorizes Congress `to define and punish . . . Offenses against \nthe Law of Nations.' ''\n  Existing case law confirms the point that Congress has given the \nfederal courts the power to interpret and apply international human \nrights law. The notable Paquete Habana decision states, in part, that \n``international law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and \nadministered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as \noften as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for \ntheir determination. . .  Congress, however, has not only expressed no \ndisagreement with our view of the proper exercise of the judicial \npower, but has responded to its most notable instance by enacting \nlegislation [the Torture Victim Protection Act] supplementing the \njudicial determination in some detail.''\n  The view expressed in the Alvarez Machain case last year was much the \nsame, that no development in the last two centuries has ``categorically \nprecluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of \nnations as an element of common law.''\n  Different precedent, Tel Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, also posits \nthat civil liability should ensue from certain violations of \ninternational law, suggesting that the ``limits of section 1350's [the \nATS] reach'' be defined by ``a handful of heinous actions--each of \nwhich violates definable, universal and obligatory norms.''\n  This legislation fills that legal vessel with the most egregious \ncrimes: genocide, torture, slavery and slave trading, extrajudicial \nkilling, and piracy. These jus cogen offenses are singled out through \n1. stare decisis, 2. the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law, \n3. academic writings, 4. official annual human rights assessments from \nthe State Department and 5. among the writings and publications of many \nhuman rights and international law advocacy groups.\n  Congress is in the best position to make the determination of what \nfalls within the ambit of the statute, not judges across America who \nlack expertise, time, and resources to assess what constitutes \ndefinable, specific, universal, and obligatory norms of international \nlaw. The bill, I would submit, represents a good faith effort in \npermitting these tortious acts, all firmly established and well defined \nin international law norms, to be prosecuted in U.S. district courts.\n  I was interested to read the views last year of the head of the \nNational Foreign Trade Council, William Reinsch, that ``these cases are \ngoing to end up in the Supreme Court . . . and the Court will over time \nend up defining what in its judgment constitutes the law of nations and \nwhat does not. But that seems to us a fairly circuitous way of doing \nthings.'' I would concur, particularly since the Supreme Court's \ndecision last year in the Alvarez Machain case did not clear up the \ninherent vagaries in the law.\n  A significant provision in this legislation creates a standard of \nliability that requires plaintiffs to show that a defendant directly \nparticipated with specific intent in carrying out the alleged tort. In \nmy view, we need to deter legal fishing expeditions, whereby plaintiffs \ncome to the bar with flinty facts backing weak charges.\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nTheir real intent, it seems, is to rely on an extensive legal discovery \nprocess to uncover matters that embarrass companies and delay their \nbusiness plans.\n\n  In the groundbreaking 1980 Filartiga v. Pena-Irala case, for example, \nthe threshold requirement laid out was that the offense needed to be \n``clear and unambiguous'' to be viable under the statute. Succeeding \ncases have affirmed a standard essentially requiring proof of a \ndefendant aiding and abetting the worst human rights violations. This \nbill replaces the current aiding and liability standard for good \nreason: these foreign-based claims demand a particularity of facts that \nis both strong and specific.\n  I would submit that the existing ambiguous grant of jurisdiction \nneeds more refinement to provide judges legal bright lines for deciding \nthese cases. My bill offers precise, and fair, treatment for which \ncases get standing in a U.S. court.\n  A common theme in dozens of cases alien tort cases is whether the \nfacts and law combine to present a nonjusticiable political question. \nEach cause of action is obviously different, and whether the matter \nought to be under the province of a different branch of government \nrequires careful analysis.\n  I would certainly agree that certain prudential doctrines, act of \nstate, political question, foreign sovereign immunity, forum non \nconveniens, and considerations of comity among nations, at times can be \nappropriately invoked to limit jurisdiction.\n  Part of that consideration can usefully come from statements of \ninterest and certifications submitted by the Executive branch; for that \nreason, the legislation I'm offering preserves a suitable role for the \nExecutive branch to weigh in. If a judge determines that a \ncertification offered by the State Department adequately justifies that \nharm will come to U.S. foreign policy interests if an alien tort suit \nproceeds, then dismissal is warranted.\n  In regards to restricting the statute of limitations to ten years, \nequitable tolling considerations should be explicitly considered in \ninterpreting provisions in the legislation. There are numerous factors \nthat give rise to equitable tolling and long-established judge-made \ndoctrine in this area is not inconsistent with the goals of my bill.\n  Complementary legislation which I raised earlier, the Torture Victim \nProtection Act, upholds the principle of equitable tolling. The \nJudiciary Committee report on that measure notes some common examples:\n  ``The statute of limitation should be tolled during the time the \ndefendant was absent from the United States or from any jurisdiction in \nwhich the same or a similar action arising from the same facts may be \nmaintained by the plaintiff, provided that the remedy in that \njurisdiction is adequate and available. Excluded also from calculation \nof the statute of limitations would be the period when a defendant has \nimmunity from suit. The statute of limitations should also be tolled \nfor the period of time in which the plaintiff is imprisoned or \notherwise incapacitated.''\n  I would submit that all of these listed circumstances, and others, \nare sufficient to suspend the running of the time under my legislation.\n  Let me conclude by referring back to one of the Supreme Court's \nfoundational points in the Alvarez-Machain case that ``despite \nconsiderable scholarly attention, it is fair to say that a consensus \nunderstanding of what Congress intended has proven elusive.''\n  The 33 words contained in the law remain a ``legal Lohengrin'' since \n``no one seems to know whence it came'' added a judge hearing a \ndifferent case some years ago. As a result, costly, complex litigation \nproceeds forward across the country.\n  Courts deserve guidance from Congress about how to treat and \ninterpret the statute, particularly in light of the growing importance \nof international trade and commerce. In a major address Supreme Court \nJustice O'Connor recently observed that ``international law has emerged \nin ways that affect all courts, both here and abroad. The reason is \nglobalization. Its importance should not be underestimated. Thirty \npercent or more of our gross domestic product is internationally \nderived.'' Yet these particular suits, brought by foreigners for \nmassive monetary damages, threaten the international economic \nactivities that are important to sustaining the American economy.\n  The suits should be able to go forward, but judges need better legal \ntools to make heads or tails of the cases that come before them hence \nthe motivation for introducing the Alien Tort Statute Reform Act.\n  With full understanding of the Supreme Court's admonition to act with \njudicial caution in framing the alien tort statute, I believe it is \ntime for Congress to bring clarity to the law and this proposed \nlegislation does so.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, \nthrough the hearing process and other means, to give this matter \nserious consideration by the Legislative branch.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide financial aid to local law enforcement \nofficials along the Nation's borders, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Border Law \nEnforcement Relief Act of 2005. This bill will provide local law \nenforcement in border communities with much needed assistance in \ncombating border-related criminal activity. For far too long, law \nenforcement agencies operating along the border have had to incur \nsignificant costs due to the inability of the Federal Government to \nsecure our Nation's borders. It is time that the Federal Government \nrecognizes that border communities should not have to bear this burden \nalone.\n  The bill I am introducing today is aimed at enhancing security in the \nborder region by giving law enforcement agencies the manpower and \nresources they need to combat border-related crimes. Specifically, the \nbill would establish a competitive grant program within the Department \nof Homeland Security to help local law enforcement situated along the \nborder cover some of the costs they incur as a result of dealing with \nillegal immigration, drug trafficking, stolen vehicles, and other \nborder-related crimes, and authorizes $30 million a year to carry out \nthe program. Funds allocated under the grant program could be used to \nhire additional personnel, obtain necessary equipment, upgrade law \nenforcement technology, and cover overtime and transportations costs.\n  Law enforcement agencies serving communities within 100 miles of the \nU.S. border with Mexico or Canada, as well as any other agencies \nlocated outside of this geographical limit located in an area which has \nbeen designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a ``High \nImpact Area,'' would be eligible to apply for the grants. Priority in \nawarding grants would go to law enforcement agencies serving \ncommunities with populations under 50,000. Two-thirds of the funds \nwould be set aside for the six states with the highest alien \napprehension rates and one-third for areas designated as ``High Impact \nAreas.''\n  It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to adequately \nsecure the Nation's borders and prevent the flow of undocumented \npersons and illegal drugs into the country. Despite the fact that the \nBorder Patrol apprehends over 1 million people each year trying to \nillegally enter the United States, the number of illegal aliens in the \nUnited States continues to rise as thousands of individuals enter the \ncountry through our porous borders. The border region is also a major \ncorridor for the shipment of drugs--according to the El Paso \nIntelligence Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \nUnited States enter the country through the Southwest border.\n  By virtue of their proximity to an international border, many of \nadverse consequences of the failure of the Federal Government to \nadequately secure the border fall on the border communities. In \ntraveling around the New Mexico-Mexico border region, I have heard \nrepeatedly how drug trafficking, kidnappings, human smuggling, and the \ndestruction of private property, such as the tearing down ranchers' \ncattle fences, are impacting our communities.\n  The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with Canada and 1,989 \nmiles with Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies located \nalong the border are small, rural departments charged with patrolling \nlarge areas of land with few officers and very limited resources. \nCounties along the Southwest border are some of the poorest in the \ncountry and are not in the position to cover the additional costs \nassociated with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other \nborder-related crimes.\n  According to a 2001 study by the United States-Mexico Border Counties \nCoalition, local law enforcement and criminal justice costs associated \nwith illegal immigration exceed $89 million every year. The States of \nArizona and New Mexico have declared states of emergency in order to \nprovide local\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\nlaw enforcement with immediate assistance in addressing criminal \nactivity along the border. It is time that the Federal Government step \nup and share some of this burden.\n  We are making some headway in terms of increasing the number of \nBorder Patrol agents along the border. Despite the fact that the \nadministration only requested funding to hire an additional 210 Border \nPatrol agents in its 2006 Budget Request, Congress has appropriated \nenough funding to hire and train an additional 1,500 agents. We are \nmaking some progress, and I am pleased that additional agents have been \nsent to New Mexico, but we must face the reality that much more needs \nto be done and we are a long way off from securing our borders and \npreventing the illegal flow of drugs and undocumented person into this \ncountry. I believe that this is an area that Congress can, and should, \nbe doing more.\n  We need more Border Patrol agents, better technology, and a \ncomprehensive strategy to meet our security needs. We also need to \nreform our broken immigration system so we are able to more effectively \ntarget those who pose a threat to our country. However, we must also \nremember the role local law enforcement play in responding to criminal \nactivity that occurs in the border region. Increasing funding for local \nlaw enforcement will help border communities alleviate some of these \nproblems and enhance security in the border region.\n  Federal assistance is desperately needed to help border law \nenforcement agencies address the unique challenges that arise from \nbeing situated along an international border and the lack of overall \nborder security. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to this \nimportant bill and give law enforcement the resources they need to meet \nthese challenges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1878. A bill to prohibit predatory payday loans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1879. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to limit \nclaims in bankruptcy by certain unsecured creditors; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    Bankruptcy Reform Implementation\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I opposed the bankruptcy reform bill \nbecause it was an outdated bill that failed to include adequate \nconsumer protections. We saw a record number of consumer bankruptcy \nfiling prior to the October 17 implementation deadline for the harsh \nnew bankruptcy. Not enough was included in the legislation to protect \nconsumers from predatory lenders or to make credit counseling a viable \nalternative to bankruptcy or to better inform over extended consumers \nabout the true costs of their debts. I was disappointed that the Senate \nfailed to effectively address these issues in a meaningful way, and \ninstead, passed an outdated bill that forces working families into more \ncostly and difficult bankruptcy proceedings. I am committed to making \nimprovements in this flawed law.\n  Today, I am introducing two bills that address flaws in the \nbankruptcy reform law. The first bill is the Predatory Payday Loan \nProhibition Act. This bill would prevent federally-insured financial \ninstitutions from originating predatory payday loans. Payday loans are \nsmall cash loans repaid by borrowers' postdated checks or borrowers' \nauthorizations to make electronic debits against existing financial \naccounts. Payday loan amounts are usually in the range of $100 to $500 \nwith full payment due in 2 weeks. Finance charges on payday loans are \ntypically in the range of $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed, which \ntranslates into triple digit interest rates in the range of 390 percent \nto 780 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate. Loan \nflipping, which is a common practice, is the renewing of loans at \nmaturity by paying additional fees without any principal reduction. \nLoan flipping often leads to instances where the fees paid for a payday \nloan well exceed the principal borrowed. This situation often creates a \ncycle of debt that is hard to break.\n  Industry analysts conservatively estimate that more than 15,000 \npayday advance locations across America extend about $25 billion in \nshort-term credit to millions of households experiencing cash-flow \nshortfalls. Too many of its customers are low-income, working families. \nMore and more customers are the financially stretched middle class, \nincluding people who have maxed out their credit cards, people perhaps \nwho have lost a job, or people with no savings to fall back on during a \nsituation that causes a cash-flow shortfall, such as a medical \nemergency.\n  Payday lending is also rampant in the military. One in five \nservicemembers have used payday lenders in the last year, according to \nthe report, ``Payday Lenders Target the Military,'' by the Center for \nResponsible Lending. Payday lenders exploit people in financial need \nand profit enormously from these loans. We must act to protect \nvulnerable consumers from these predatory lenders.\n  In addition, I previously introduced S. 1347, the Low-Cost \nAlternatives to Payday Loans Act. This bill would authorize award \ndemonstration project grants for eligible entities to provide consumers \nwith low-cost, small loan alternatives to more costly and predatory \npayday loans. Loan alternatives that meet the needs of consumers and \nare at a fair price must be developed.\n  Today, I am also introducing the Bankruptcy Prevention Credit \nCounseling Act. The new bankruptcy reform law does not allow consumers \nto declare personal bankruptcy in either chapter 7 or chapter 13, \nunless they receive a briefing from an approved nonprofit credit \ncounseling agency within 6 months of filing. The credit counseling \ninstructional course requirement is intended to provide financial \neducation to consumers who declare bankruptcy so they can attempt to \navoid future financial problems.\n  About one in three consumers in credit counseling enter a debt \nmanagement plan. In exchange, creditors may agree to concessions so \nthat consumers pay off as much of their outstanding debt as possible. \nExamples of concessions can include a reduced interest rate on the \namount they owe and the elimination of fees. Unfortunately, most credit \ncard companies have become increasingly unwilling to significantly \nreduce interest rates for consumers in credit counseling.\n  The Bankruptcy Prevention Credit Counseling Act would prevent \nunsecured creditors, primarily credit card issuers, from attempting to \ncollect accruing interest and additional fees from consumers in \nbankruptcy, if the creditor does not have a policy of waiving interest \nand fees for debtors who enter a consolidated payment plan at a credit \ncounseling agency. Since the new bankruptcy law requires that consumers \nenter credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy, we must ensure \nthat consumers are given a fair chance at reducing their debt burden.\n  I also offered the text of the amendment of my bill, S. 393, the \nCredit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act, as an amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill. My amendment, intended to provide consumers with \nadequate, timely, and meaningful disclosures, was unfortunately \ndefeated. As the bankruptcy reform law makes it more difficult for \nconsumers to discharge their debts in bankruptcy, we have a \nresponsibility to provide meaningful additional information so that \nconsumers can make better informed debt management decisions. The \nbankruptcy reform law includes a requirement that credit card issuers \nprovide a generic warning about the consequences of only making the \nminimum payment. This requirement fails to provide consumers the \ndetailed information that my amendment would have provided, which means \ndetailed, personalized information necessary for them to make better \ninformed choices about their credit card use and repayment. My \namendment would have required companies to inform consumers of how many \nyears and months it would take to repay their entire balance, and the \ntotal cost in interest and principal, if the consumer makes only the \nminimum payment. My legislation would also have required consumers to \nbe provided with the amount they would need to pay to eliminate their \noutstanding balance in 36 months. Finally, my legislation would have \nrequired that creditors establish a toll-free number so that consumers \ncan access trustworthy credit counselors. In response to criticisms \nthat my amendment was not feasible, I, along with\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\nSenator Sarbanes, requested that the Government Accountability Office \nstudy the issue. I am hopeful the report will provide helpful \ninformation as we must continue to improve meaningful and \nunderstandable disclosures that will help Americans better manage their \ncredit card debts.\n  I want to take a moment to thank Senator Sarbanes, and his Banking \nCommittee staff, for working with me on this and many other financial \nliteracy related issues. In addition, I also want to thank Senator \nLeahy and the staff of the Judiciary Committee for all of their efforts \nto try and improve the flawed bankruptcy legislation.\n  I fear that the bankruptcy reform law will significantly harm \nfamilies who have suffered financially due to illnesses, the loss of a \njob, or the death of a loved one. I remain committed to working with \nall of my colleagues to better protect and inform consumers and to hold \nthe credit card industry accountable for its aggressive marketing of \ncredit to our debt burdened society.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Predatory Payday \nLoan Prohibition Act of 2005. Currently, federal law authorizes insured \ndepository institutions to export interest rates, as provided under the \nlaws of the state where the bank or credit union is located, to out-of-\nstate borrowers. My bill would effectively eliminate the ability of \nfinancial institutions to do this by prohibiting federally-insured \nfinancial institutions from originating predatory payday loans.\n  What constitutes a payday loan? These are small cash loans repaid by \nborrowers' postdated checks or borrowers' authorizations to make \nelectronic debits against existing financial accounts. Payday loan \namounts are usually in the range of $100 to $500 with payment in full \ndue in two weeks. Finance charges on payday loans are typically in the \nrange of $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed, which translates into triple \ndigit interest rates in the range of 390 percent to 780 percent when \nexpressed as an annual percentage rate. Loan flipping, which is a \ncommon practice, is the renewing of loans at maturity by paying \nadditional fees without any principal reduction. Loan flipping often \nleads to instances where the fees paid for a payday loan well exceed \nthe principal borrowed. This situation often creates a cycle of debt \nthat is hard to break. Today, industry analysts conservatively estimate \nthat more than 15,000 payday advance locations across America extend \nabout $25 billion in short-term credit to millions of households \nexperiencing cash-flow shortfalls.\n  I am appalled that the payday lending industry is portrayed as a \nlegitimate business. Too many of its customers are low-income, working \nfamilies. More and more customers are the financially stretched middle \nclass including people who have maxed out their credit cards, people \nperhaps who have lost a job, or people with no savings to fall back on \nduring a situation that causes a cash-flow shortfall, such as a medical \nemergency. Payday lending is also rampant in the military. One in five \nservicemembers have used payday lenders in the last year, according to \nthe report, ``Payday Lenders Target the Military,'' by the Center for \nResponsible Lending. Payday lenders are concentrated around military \nbases, such as the Navy bases in Norfolk, Virginia, the Army's Fort \nLewis in Washington State, and the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton \nin California. The Department of Defense confirms the Center's report \nby listing payday lending as one of the top 10 priority issues facing \nmilitary families, according to Dr. David Chu, the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Personnel and Readiness. To the predatory lenders, our \nmilitary personnel's government paychecks represent a reliable source \nof fees. Also, payday lenders can be relatively confident that \nborrowers will continue to pay, because military personnel face harsh \nconsequences, such as court martial or dishonorable discharge, for not \nrepaying their debts. I am pleased that in my home state a local credit \nunion, Windward Community Federal Credit Union, Kailua, Hawaii, has \ndeveloped an affordable, alternative product to offer the many Marines \nwho live in its service area. Earlier this year I introduced another \nbill to encourage replication of such practices. S. 1347, the Low-Cost \nAlternatives to Payday Loans Act, would authorize demonstration project \ngrants to eligible entities to provide low-cost, small loans to \nconsumers that would provide alternatives to more costly, predatory \npayday loans so that more people could have access to payday loan \nalternatives.\n  Payday loan providers claim that they are offering a simple financial \nproduct that addresses an emergency or temporary credit need that \nusually cannot be met by traditional financial institutions. An \nanalysis of payday lending statistics by the Center for Responsible \nLending indicates that the majority of payday loan borrowers have \nmultiple loans each year with two thirds having five or more payday \nloans annually and half of these borrowers having 12 or more payday \nloans annually. Some borrowers seek loans from two or more payday \nlenders, multiplying the potential for getting trapped in debt. \nResearch by the Community Financial Services Association of America, \nthe payday loan industry's national trade association, found that 40 \npercent of payday loan customers renew their payday loans a staggering \nfive times or more.\n  The payday loan industry exploits people that are in financial need. \nCongress has failed to act to prevent the exploitation of working \nfamilies that are short on cash due to unexpected medical expenses or \nother needs. We must act to protect consumers from these unscrupulous \nlenders. I remain committed to restricting all forms of predatory \nlending, including payday loans, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Consumer Federation of America, \n     Community Reinvestment Association of NC, Consumer Action, \n     Consumers Union, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, \n     National Consumer Law Center and U.S. PIRG applaud you for \n     sponsoring legislation to prohibit lending based on checks or \n     debits drawn on federally insured depository institutions. \n     You have recognized that it is an unsafe banking practice for \n     consumers to be enticed by payday lenders to write checks or \n     authorize debits when there is no money on deposit to cover \n     these cash advances. We are also pleased that your bill would \n     prohibit banks from partnering with payday lenders, a tactic \n     used by storefront lenders to evade state small loan and \n     usury laws.\n       The ``Predatory Payday Loan Prohibition Act of 2005'' \n     prohibits the relatively new practice of holding a check as \n     security for a loan. Using the check as security for the \n     payment of a payday loan is the key to the coercive \n     collection tactics used by the lenders. As the lender holds \n     the check, at the end of the short term loan, the consumer is \n     generally forced to choose among three untenable options: 1) \n     allowing the check to be debited from their bank account \n     where it will deplete money needed for food and other living \n     necessities, 2) allowing the check to bounce, exposing the \n     borrower to coercive collection tactics when lenders threaten \n     civil or criminal liability for unpaid checks, and from the \n     risk of losing their bank account or checkwriting privileges, \n     or 3) renewing the loan at the original high cost. Loans \n     based on personal checks drawn on the borrower's bank account \n     that will be deposited to repay the loan on the next payday \n     is the modern version of lending secured by wage assignments, \n     a credit practice long recognized as inherently unfair which \n     violates FTC rules.\n       Your legislation also stops payday lenders from partnering \n     with federally insured depository institutions to evade state \n     usury or small loan rate caps. A few federally insured state \n     chartered banks persist in ``renting'' their charters to \n     payday lenders, a practice curtailed by most federal bank \n     regulators, to make loans in states that enforce their usury \n     or small loan laws.\n       Although payday lender-bank charter renting has been \n     curtailed by regulatory action, only legislation will create \n     a clear prohibition to stop this practice that undermines \n     state small loan regulation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jean Ann Fox,\n       Director of Consumer Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Peter Skillern,\n       Executive Director, Community Reinvestment Association of \n     NC.\n     Linda Sherry,\n       Director, National Priorities, Consumer Action.\n     Susanna Montezemolo,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Monica Gonzales,\n       Vice President of Legislation and Regulatory Affairs, \n     National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n     Margot Saunders,\n       Of Counsel, National Consumer Law Center.\n     Ed Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group (U.S. PIRG).\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Bankruptcy \nPrevention Credit Counseling Act. The new bankruptcy reform law does \nnot allow consumers to declare personal bankruptcy in either Chapter 7 \nor Chapter 13, unless they receive a briefing from an approved \nnonprofit credit counseling agency within 6 months of filing. The \ncredit counseling instructional course requirement is intended to \nprovide financial education to consumers who declare bankruptcy so they \ncan attempt to avoid future financial problems.\n  About one in three consumers in credit counseling enter a debt \nmanagement plan. In exchange, creditors may agree to concessions so \nthat consumers pay off as much of their outstanding debt as possible. \nConcessions can include a reduced interest rate on the amount they owe \nand the elimination of fees. Unfortunately, most credit card companies \nhave become increasingly unwilling to significantly reduce interest \nrates for consumers in credit counseling. A study by the National \nConsumer Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America revealed \nthat 5 of 13 credit card issuers increased the interest rates they \noffered to consumers in credit counseling between 1999 and 2003. \nAmerican Express and Wells Fargo completely waive all interest for \nconsumers in credit counseling. However, the majority of credit card \nissuers charge interest rates above 9 percent for account holders that \nenter into credit counseling, with several charging more than 15 \npercent.\n  My bill would prevent unsecured creditors, primarily credit card \nissuers, from attempting to collect accruing interest and additional \nfees from consumers in bankruptcy, if the creditor does not have a \npolicy of waiving interest and fees for debtors who enter a \nconsolidated payment plan at a credit counseling agency.\n  Since the new bankruptcy law requires that consumers enter credit \ncounseling before filing for bankruptcy, we must ensure that credit \ncounseling is truly effective and a viable alternative to bankruptcy. \nCredit card issuers undermine the good intentions of those consumers. \nThey have sharply curtailed the concessions they offer to consumers in \ncredit counseling, contributing to increased bankruptcy filings. \nAccording to a survey by VISA USA, 33 percent of consumers who failed \nto complete a debt management plan in credit counseling said they would \nhave stayed on the plan if creditors had lowered interest rates or \nwaived fees. Credit card companies have an obligation to ensure that \neffective alternatives are readily available to the consumers they \naggressively pursue.\n  We must make sure that credit counseling is an effective tool to help \nconsumers avoid bankruptcy. In order to do this, credit card issuers \nshould waive the amount owed in interest and fees for consumers who \nenter a consolidated payment plan. Successful completion of a debt \nmanagement plan benefits both creditors and consumers. Mr. President, \nfor many consumers, paying off their debt is not easy. My bill will \nhelp people who are struggling to repay their obligations. I encourage \nall of my colleagues to support this legislation to help consumers \nenrolled in debt management plans to successfully repay their \ncreditors, free themselves from debt, and avoid bankruptcy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 273\n\n       Whereas market-based polices and private sector leadership \n     have allowed the Internet the flexibility to evolve;\n       Whereas given the importance of the Internet to the global \n     economy, it is essential that the underlying domain name \n     system\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\n     and technical infrastructure of the Internet remain stable \n     and secure;\n       Whereas the Internet was created in the United States and \n     has flourished under United States supervision and oversight, \n     and the Federal Government has followed a path of \n     transferring Internet control from the defense sector to the \n     civilian sector, including the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) with the goal of full \n     privatization;\n       Whereas the developing world deserves the access to \n     knowledge, services, commerce, and communication, the \n     accompanying benefits to economic development, education, \n     health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock \n     of democratic self-government that the Internet provides;\n       Whereas the explosive and hugely beneficial growth of the \n     Internet did not result from increased government involvement \n     but from the opening of the Internet to commerce and private \n     sector innovation;\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2005, President George W. Bush \n     announced that the United States intends to maintain its \n     historic role over the master ``root zone'' file of the \n     Internet, which lists all authorized top-level Internet \n     domains;\n       Whereas the recently articulated principles of the United \n     States on the domain name and addressing system of the \n     Internet (DNS) are that the Federal Government will preserve \n     the security and stability of the DNS, will take no action \n     with the potential to adversely affect the effective and \n     efficient operation of the DNS, and will maintain the \n     historic role of the United States regarding modifications to \n     the root zone file, that governments have a legitimate \n     interest in the management of country code top level domains \n     (ccTLD), and the United States is committed to working with \n     the international community to address the concerns of that \n     community in accordance with the stability and security of \n     the DNS, that ICANN is the appropriate technical manager of \n     the Internet, and the United States will continue to provide \n     oversight so that ICANN maintains focus and meets its core \n     technical mission, and that dialogue relating to Internet \n     governance should continue in multiple relevant fora, and the \n     United States encourages an ongoing dialogue with all \n     stakeholders and will continue to support market-based \n     approaches and private sector leadership;\n       Whereas the final report issued by the Working Group on \n     Internet Governance (WGIG) of the United Nations indicates \n     that an entity affiliated with the United Nations should \n     assume global governance of the Internet;\n       Whereas a United Nations taskforce report suggests that, in \n     addition to terminating the leadership role of the United \n     States with respect to the Internet, the authority and \n     functions of ICANN should be transferred to an entity \n     affiliated with the United Nations;\n       Whereas that report contains recommendations for relegating \n     the private sector and nongovernmental organizations to an \n     advisory capacity, and some nations advocating such a change \n     have stated that the private sector and nongovernmental \n     organizations should have no future role in Internet \n     governance;\n       Whereas the European Union has also proposed transferring \n     control of the Internet to the United Nations, and such a \n     transfer of control of the Internet would confer significant \n     leverage to the governments of Iran, Cuba, and China, and \n     would impose an undesirable layer of politicized bureaucracy \n     on the operations of the Internet that would result in an \n     inadequate response to the rapid pace of technological \n     change;\n       Whereas some nations that advocate radical change in the \n     structure of Internet governance censor the information \n     available to their citizens through the Internet and use the \n     Internet as a tool of surveillance to curtail legitimate \n     political discussion and dissent, and other nations operate \n     telecommunications systems as state-controlled monopolies or \n     highly-regulated and highly-taxed entities;\n       Whereas some nations in support of transferring Internet \n     governance to an entity affiliated with the United Nations, \n     or another international entity, might seek to have such an \n     entity endorse national policies that block access to \n     information, stifle political dissent, and maintain outmoded \n     communications structures;\n       Whereas the structure and control of Internet governance \n     has profound implications for homeland security, competition \n     and trade, democratization, free expression, access to \n     information, privacy, and the protection of intellectual \n     property, and the threat of some nations to take unilateral \n     actions that would fracture the root zone file would result \n     in a less functional Internet with diminished benefits for \n     all people; and\n       Whereas the World Summit on the Information Society will \n     meet in November 2005 in Tunisia to discuss the possibility \n     of transferring control of the Internet to the United Nations \n     or another international entity, and that summit will likely \n     be the beginning of a prolonged international debate \n     regarding the future of Internet governance:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to continue to oppose any effort \n     to transfer control of the Internet to the United Nations or \n     any other international entity;\n       (2) applauds the President for--\n       (A) clearly and forcefully asserting that the United States \n     has no present intention of relinquishing the historic \n     leadership role the United States has played in Internet \n     governance; and\n       (B) articulating a vision of the future of the Internet \n     that places privatization over politicization with respect to \n     the Internet; and\n       (3) calls on the President to--\n       (A) recognize the need for, and pursue a continuing and \n     constructive dialogue with the international community on, \n     the future of Internet governance; and\n       (B) advance the values of an open Internet in the broader \n     trade and diplomatic conversations of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/17/senate-section/article/S11440-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11440-S11441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 274--EXPRESSING SYMPATHY AND PLEDGING THE SUPPORT OF \n THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO THE VICTIMS OF THE DEVASTATING \n EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK SOUTH ASIA AND CAUSED THE SEVERE LOSS OF LIFE \n   AND DESTRUCTION ON OCTOBER 8, 2005, AND PLEDGING IMMEDIATE UNITED \n STATES ASSISTANCE TO SAVE LIVES AND HELP THE REGION RECOVER FROM THIS \n                           MONUMENTAL TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \nLugar) submitted the following resolution;

Res. 274\n\n       Whereas on October 8, 2005, at 8:50 am local time, a \n     devastating earthquake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, \n     struck parts of Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan, causing \n     massive loss of life and destruction;\n       Whereas it is estimated that more than 39,000 people \n     residing in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Northwest \n     Frontier Province of Pakistan and between 1,000 to 2,000 \n     people located in Indian-administered Kashmir have perished \n     as a result of the earthquake and that tens of thousands of \n     others have been injured;\n       Whereas the capital city of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, \n     Muzaffarabad, located\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\n     near the epicenter of the earthquake, was one of the worst-\n     affected cities, suffering tens of thousands of deaths and \n     widespread destruction throughout the city;\n       Whereas millions of people throughout the region have been \n     left homeless as a result of this earthquake;\n       Whereas the earthquake damaged and destroyed sanitation \n     systems and hospitals and left thousands of people more \n     vulnerable to deadly diseases such as measles and cholera;\n       Whereas the Senate and the people of the United States \n     acknowledge with deep sadness that this severe tragedy \n     occurred during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a time \n     when Muslims across the world observe a fast during the \n     daylight hours and focus on worship, contemplation, and \n     strengthening family and community ties;\n       Whereas the United States immediately deployed material and \n     technical assistance to the region, including plastic \n     sheeting, blankets, water containers, food, and a United \n     States Agency for International Development Disaster \n     Assistance Response Team to assess humanitarian needs, \n     coordinate assistance from the United States, and provide \n     technical assistance as required;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense immediately dispatched 8 \n     military helicopters and is providing additional helicopter \n     support to assist in relief and rescue operations in remote \n     areas that are largely inaccessible by road;\n       Whereas the United States made an initial pledge of \n     $50,000,000 in humanitarian assistance to help Pakistan cope \n     with its massive relief and recovery needs;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her \n     October 12, 2005, visit to Pakistan, said that the United \n     States would support Pakistan over the long-term in the \n     Pakistani Government's efforts to provide assistance to the \n     victims of the earthquake and rebuild parts of the country \n     devastated by the earthquake;\n       Whereas the United Nations launched a $272,000,000 \n     international flash appeal to support recovery efforts;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that as many as \n     2,500,000 people are homeless and 1,000,000 are in need of \n     immediate assistance;\n       Whereas Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has appealed \n     for international assistance and called for more medicine, \n     tents, and cargo helicopters;\n       Whereas Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared the \n     earthquake a ``national calamity'' and pledged to rebuild the \n     lives of thousands of people in Indian-administered Kashmir \n     affected by the earthquake;\n       Whereas during humanitarian crises, such as the earthquake \n     that struck South Asia, women and children often become more \n     vulnerable to exploitation and abuse and have difficulty \n     accessing humanitarian relief;\n       Whereas India has begun sending a consignment of 25 tons of \n     emergency relief supplies, including medicines, blankets, \n     tents, and food items, to Islamabad, the first time India has \n     provided assistance to Pakistan in over 30 years; and\n       Whereas the recovery and reconstruction of the devastated \n     areas will require the concerted leadership of the United \n     States working with the governments of the affected countries \n     and with the international community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its sympathy and support for the people of \n     South Asia following the devastating earthquake that struck \n     Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan on October 8, 2005, during \n     the Islamic holy month of Ramadan;\n       (2) conveys its most sincere condolences to the families, \n     communities, and governments of the more than 39,000 people \n     that lost their lives in this terrible natural disaster;\n       (3) expresses its admiration and full support for the \n     courageous rescue and relief workers, including personnel of \n     the United States Agency for International Development and \n     the United States military, who are saving lives and \n     providing relief and assistance to those affected by the \n     earthquake;\n       (4) supports the initial pledge by President George W. Bush \n     of $50,000,000 in humanitarian assistance, the deployment of \n     United States military assets to the region to assist in \n     relief and recovery efforts, and provision of additional \n     United States assistance necessary to save lives and help the \n     region recover from this monumental disaster;\n       (5) commends the ongoing international relief effort that \n     includes the work of individual countries, numerous \n     international organizations, and various relief and \n     nongovernmental entities;\n       (6) commends the Governments of Pakistan and India for \n     their cooperation in the common cause of saving lives and \n     providing humanitarian relief to people on both sides of the \n     Line of Control; and\n       (7) encourages further cooperation between India and \n     Pakistan on relief operations and efforts to fortify and \n     expand peace and stability in the region as they cope with \n     the impact of the earthquake over the next several months and \n     seek to rehabilitate the lives of those affected.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the resolution we passed does express \nsupport for those victims of the South Asia earthquake. I encourage our \ncolleagues to make statements for the Record.
