Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5385, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3585) making appropriations for military \n     quality of life functions of the Department of Defense, \n     military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 11, \n     2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Akaka/Obama amendment No. 5128, to provide, with an offset, \n     an additional $2,500,000 for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for the Office of Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5144\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank Senators Hutchison and \nFeinstein, the managers of this bill, for the opportunity to offer and \ndiscuss my amendment to provide emergency agricultural disaster \nassistance for our farmers and ranchers. Normally, most of my \ncolleagues know I would not offer this amendment on an unrelated \nmeasure. Our hand is forced. We are told it is highly unlikely there \nwill be an Agriculture appropriations bill considered separately. We \nhave no alternative but to offer this measure to this legislation.\n  This amendment will determine whether thousands of farm families will \nbe able to continue next year. We have had 2 years of unusual natural \ndisasters that have affected agriculture across this country. These \npeople need to know whether they can continue in the business of \nfarming and ranching. Their bankers need to know. This legislation is \ncritical to that determination.\n  For over a year, I, along with many of my Senate colleagues--let me \nindicate that it is already nearly 20 of my colleagues--have come on a \nbipartisan basis to cosponsor this bill, including Senator Coleman of \nMinnesota; Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska; my own colleague, Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota; Senator Salazar of Colorado; Senator Hagel of \nNebraska; Senator Johnson of South Dakota; Senator Thune of South \nDakota; Senator Enzi of Wyoming; Senator Baucus of Montana; Senator \nReid of Nevada; Senator Clinton; Senator Obama; Senator Durbin; Senator \nLeahy; Senator Harkin; Senator Cantwell; Senator Burns of Montana; \nSenator Schumer; and Senator Roberts of Kansas. Repeatedly, we have \ncome to the Senate to try to get disaster assistance considered.\n\n  Last spring, as part of the hurricane supplemental, the Senate \napproved an agricultural disaster package for the 2005 crop-year. That \nmeasure was dropped in conference due to opposition from the \nadministration and the House leadership. I have taken out the \nprovisions that drew the opposition of the administration. Those direct \npayments that were an offset to the dramatic runup in energy prices are \nnot in this bill.\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\n  The legislation I am offering today is nearly identical to the \nbipartisan relief provision I introduced on September 20, 2006. My \namendment is bipartisan and has 19 cosponsors.\n  The need for this amendment is compelling. In North Dakota last year, \nas this picture shows, we faced extraordinary flooding. Over a million \nacres were prevented from being planted. Hundreds of thousands of acres \nthat were planted were drowned out because of excessive rainfall. There \nwas no disaster assistance for those farmers.\n  This year, in the irony of ironies, we now have experienced an \nextraordinary drought. This is a picture from my home county, Burleigh \nCounty, where the capital of North Dakota is located. This is a corn \ncrop, but nothing was produced. It is only one of thousands of fields \nthat were not worth harvesting.\n  This drought has been determined by the USDA meteorologist to be the \nthird worst drought in our Nation's history. Only the Dust Bowl of the \n1930s and the prolonged drought of the 1950s compared to what many \nparts of the country have been facing.\n  This chart shows the U.S. Drought Monitor. It shows how severe the \ndrought was all across the Midwest and Southeast. Its darkest colors \nrepresent exceptional drought. North Dakota and South Dakota were the \nepicenter of this drought in late July. It has been totally devastating \nto my part of the country. If assistance is not granted, literally \nthousands of farm families will be forced off the land. That is a fact.\n  The independent bankers of my State said to a White House \nrepresentative who was in my office that if assistance does not come, 5 \nto 10 percent of their customers in North Dakota will be forced out of \nbusiness. Mr. President, 34 farm organizations have told Congress that \nassistance is needed and it is needed now. In addition, we have a \nletter from the State commissioners of agriculture from all across the \ncountry saying that emergency agricultural disaster assistance is a \nhigh priority requiring action by Congress this year. It could not be \nmore clear. Assistance is needed. It is needed now.\n  As I noted last May, the Senate approved disaster assistance, only to \nbe thwarted by the threat of a veto. In June, the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations once again approved emergency disaster assistance as \npart of the Agriculture appropriations bill for 2007. Thus far, that \nbill has failed to come to the Senate.\n  On numerous occasions, including the last day we were in session \nbefore we recessed for the elections, I tried to get the Senate to \nadopt disaster relief legislation. Again, the effort was stymied.\n  Today, we have another chance to do what is necessary and what is \nright. My amendment incorporates many of the provisions already \napproved by the Senate, but I have made a few modifications to address \nthe objections raised by the administration. The economic assistance \nprovisions help producers offset rising energy costs, and the direct \ngrants to States to assist specialty crop and livestock sectors have \nbeen removed. Those provisions, at the insistence of the White House, \nhave been removed.\n  Also, the administration has stated that we need to wait until \nharvest is concluded. The harvest is now over for 2006; the losses are \nreal and significant throughout many parts of the country.\n  The crop and livestock production loss provisions contained in the \noriginal legislation were retained and will apply for both the 2005 and \n2006 production years. Crop producers will still need to demonstrate a \n35-percent loss before they get any assistance. The Livestock \nCompensation Program will only be made to producers whose operations \nare in counties designated as disaster areas by the Secretary and who \ncan demonstrate they have suffered a material loss. The legislation \nalso contains additional funding for conservation operations to help \nrestore and rehabilitate drought and livestock losses on grazing land. \nScientists have told us this is imperative. Because of the \nmodifications, the cost of providing disaster assistance for 2005 and \n2006 has been reduced from $6.7 billion to $4.9 billion--a reduction of \nnearly $2 billion.\n  Farmers and ranchers need assistance for the 2005 and 2006 fall \ndisaster losses, and they need it now. If these emergencies are not \naddressed, literally tens of thousands of farm families and Main Street \nbusinesses will suffer, many irreparably. It is time to act and allow \nthe Senate to vote on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying I regret having to offer this \namendment to this legislation. I have no choice. We have no choice. The \nover 20 Members of the Senate who have come forward to sponsor this \nlegislation in various variations of the legislation have no choice. If \nwe do not act now, tens of thousands of farm families will not be able \nto continue. The stakes are high. I urge my colleagues to give \nfavorable consideration to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nConrad's agriculture disaster assistance amendment and am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this important legislative package. The package would \nprovide comprehensive, critical relief dollars for agriculture \ndisaster. It would provide assistance for a drought that has plagued \nour Nation's family farms, including those in my home State of South \nDakota.\n  Producers in South Dakota have suffered from drought conditions that \nhave rivaled the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. These chronic conditions have \nalready ruined the wheat and corn crop for many producers in the State \nand resulted in thousands of cattle being sold off prematurely in \nauction barns. Those who have already sold the factory are left with \nonly a mortgage to pay and no relief in sight.\n  Senator JOHN THUNE and I jointly traveled across South Dakota this \nsummer to some of the areas hit hardest by this drought. We \nconsistently heard about the astronomically high price for hay and fuel \ncosts for transportation, if a producer could even find forage to \npurchase. We saw the effects of the drought on corn and soybeans, many \nof which barely got out of the ground and were stunted by desert-like \nconditions. Some producers saw yields that measured out to the tenth of \nthe bushel, after being socked with severe fuel and fertilizer costs.\n  At a stop at the Ft. Pierre Livestock Sale Barn, we met with ranchers \nwho finally had to sell out because of extreme conditions. The Herreid \nLivestock Sale Barn saw an estimated 2,500 to 3,500 head per week over \nthe summer instead of the usual 200 to 300 cattle per week for that \ntime of year.\n  I invited USDA Secretary Mike Johanns to travel to South Dakota and \nsee this extensive damage firsthand. The Secretary of Agriculture came \nto my home State, but, unfortunately, rolled out a grossly inadequate \nagriculture disaster assistance program. This empty shell game is a \nglaring example of the ``too little, too late'' approach that this \nadministration has too often employed with agriculture disaster \nassistance.\n  The Agriculture Department released only $2 million in Grasslands \nReserve Program money and less than $7 million in Emergency \nConservation Program funds to South Dakota over the summer. These \ndollars barely made a dent in the backlog of producers who have applied \nfor these programs, leaving many out in the cold.\n  While in my home State, the Secretary announced the release of \nsection 32 funds for distribution in our agriculture communities, \namounting to $50 million in block grants to drought-impacted States. \nAlthough South Dakota has been subject to chronic extreme and \nexceptional drought conditions, the State received only $4.3 million. \nIt was announced that Texas, however, would be given $16.1 million in \nassistance.\n  The administration's disaster relief package provides just a fraction \nof the dollars that the 2005 disaster relief measure, that my \ncolleagues and I successfully attached to the most recent agriculture \nappropriations bill, would contain for my home State of South Dakota. \nOver $100 million would be directed toward producers impacted by \ndevastating conditions, including comprehensive livestock and crop \nassistance measures.\n  The agriculture appropriations bill, however, has yet to see the \nlight of day for debate on floor of the U.S. Senate. It is my hope that \nthe majority leadership would allow this bill to be considered with due \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n  My colleagues and I also passed agriculture disaster assistance as \npart of the supplemental spending measure that funded Katrina relief \nefforts and the war in Iraq. Because of a Presidential veto threat, \nhowever, the vast majority of meaningful agriculture disaster \nassistance was stripped out. The White House said that it would reject \nmoney for our troops in Iraq and victims devastated by Hurricane \nKatrina if that spending package contained a nickel of agriculture \ndisaster relief for our Nation's farm and ranch producers.\n  Secretary Johanns adopted a ``wait and see'' approach to aiding our \nrural communities. The Secretary said this summer that he wanted to see \nhow the harvest looked after the combines ran before considering \nfurther agriculture disaster aid for this production year. As the worst \ndrought since the Dust Bowl, however, combines haven't run at all in \nparts of South Dakota. Our Nation's food security demands immediate \nassistance, not stop-gap measures and delay tactics.\n  Agriculture disaster is like any other disaster, and producers \ndeserve meaningful relief. The administration continues to dig in their \nheels on drought assistance for our Nation's producers. Yet, this White \nHouse places a priority on rebuilding Iraqi agriculture while crying \npoor and lack of revenue at home.\n  The truth is that the administration has the authority to provide \nmore comprehensive drought assistance at the stroke of a pen, if it \nwants, just as it did in 2002.\n  I urged President Bush to establish a program that would target those \nwho suffer from actual losses, avoiding the type of waste and abuse \nthat was disclosed with the implementation of the 2002 program. I \nexpressed my interest in working with the Department of Agriculture to \ndevelop an effective and timely plan before more producers sold the \nfamily farm and were forced out of business. It has become painfully \nclear that real drought relief is not on this administration's current \nagenda.\n  The administration's lack of action on drought assistance underscores \na need to pass this drought amendment today. This comprehensive \nagriculture disaster assistance measure covers 2005 and 2006 losses \nwith a livestock compensation program and resources for crop production \nlosses, and funds are included for impacted sheep producers. Small \nbusiness assistance grants will also offer critical help. This \namendment qualifies agriculture disaster money as an emergency, \ndeserving immediate attention--attention that has so far been denied.\n  Producers are faced with critical financial decisions, and for many \nrelief was needed frankly, months ago. Because of this drought and the \ndelay in assistance, many producers won't be able to rebuild their \nherds.\n  A meaningful agriculture disaster relief package already passed the \nSenate--it was only because of this administration's veto threat that \nit was stripped out in conference by leadership.\n  Today I am pleased to join with my colleagues in offering \ncomprehensive agriculture disaster assistance for 2005 and 2006. I \nthank Senator Conrad for offering this important legislation. An \nagriculture disaster is a natural disaster, like a tornado or a \nhurricane, and providing relief for our Nation's producers is simply \nfair and simply just.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Conrad for \nhis leadership, my colleague Senator Johnson, and so many others, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who have worked together to try to construct \na piece of legislation that would provide some disaster help for \nfarmers, and then to try to get it through the Congress and get it to \nthe President's desk for his signature.\n  This has been a long, tortuous trail. Twice before the Senate has \npassed disaster relief for family farmers--twice. Both times it went to \na conference with the House. I was a conferee on both occasions. I was \ninvolved with my colleagues in attaching it to the appropriations bill \nas it went to a conference. We got to conference. Both times the \nPresident threatened to veto the legislation, to block it. And he got \nthe conferees on the House side to require that it be taken out of the \nconference report. Therefore, this is the third attempt on the floor of \nthe Senate to do this piece of legislation. And it is very important.\n  Let me talk for a moment about this issue of farming because we all \ncome to work and we wear neckties and suits and take showers at the \nstart of the day. Farmers take showers at the end of the day because \ntheir work is hard. They feed cattle. They plow the ground. They grease \na tractor. They run a combine. They put up hay. They do all the things \nthat represent very hard work out in the land, and they are economic \nall-stars.\n  The ability of the American family farmer to feed more and more \npeople is pretty extraordinary. But they work very hard and they \nproduce a product. If things cooperate, if they get decent weather, \nenough rain, the disasters don't come, the insects aren't there, then \nthey produce a crop. They produce a kernel of corn, perhaps some wheat, \na kernel of barley, some rice. What happens is the wheat gets puffed by \na company someplace, after it gets hauled by railroad, and then it gets \nput in a box and sold as puffed wheat. The farmer gets almost nothing. \nThe railroads take too much, and the box of puffed wheat costs an \nunbelievable amount of money.\n  The same is true with crisping rice. It goes into a box called Rice \nKrispies. The same is true with corn. They flake the corn, put it in a \nbox, and call it corn flakes. The railroads get a lot of money for \nhauling that corn to market, the people who sell the corn flakes get a \nlot of profit, and the farmer gets almost nothing. That is what farming \nhas always been about. But they only get the crop in the first place if \nthey do not get wiped out by a natural disaster--whether disease, \ninsects, or so on.\n  Now, what has happened in the last couple of years, particularly in \nour part of the country, the Dakotas were called the epicenter of a \ndrought, the epicenter of a drought. So those farmers, who in the \nspring went out and planted their crops, discovered they did not have \nany crop growth at all. Nothing came up in those fields.\n  It is pretty unbelievable to drive by a field that is supposed to be \na field of grain and see it look like a moonscape. I drove to Zeeland, \nND, one day, a very small town just north of the South Dakota border. \nAnd as I drove into that town, to my left was a patch of ground that \nlooked like moonscape--no vegetation at all. There had been no rain \nthere. One hundred ranchers gathered in a small community hall in \nZeeland, ND, to talk about what this meant to them. One after another, \nthey stood up to talk about what it means when you don't get rain.\n  One fellow from another part of our country who had moved back to \nNorth Dakota said: I had never, ever understood why they measured rain \nin hundredths. How much rain did you get? Twenty hundredths, twenty-\nfour hundredths. I never understood before why they measured rain in \nhundredths until I came to North Dakota, a State with 15 to 17 inches \nof annual rainfall in an entire year. And then what happens? It stops \nraining, and you have a drought and nothing grows; or it rains too \nmuch, and you get one-third of the annual rainfall in one day. We have \nhad both happen. One happened the year before, in 2005; one happened in \n2006.\n  Some will say: Well, you just come and talk about farming all the \ntime. Family farmers this, family farmers that. There is a writer in \nNorth Dakota, a farmer, a rancher, down near Almont, I believe. His \nname is Rodney Nelson. He asks in some of his prose some very important \nquestions: What is it worth to our country? What is it worth for a \nyoung person to know how to plow a field, to grease a tractor? What is \nit worth for a young person to know how to weld a seam, how to combine \na field of grain? What is it worth to have a young person know how to \nbuild a lean-to, how to take care of cattle, how to care for livestock? \nWhat is it worth to have young people know how to work in the bitter \ncold and do chores in the morning in the bitter cold, or to be out in \nthe fields when it is unbelievably hot, combining that field of grain? \nWhat is that worth? There is only one university in America where those \nstudies are taught, and that is America's family farms.\n  What is it worth to us? Do we want to save those farmers when they \nrun\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nthrough some tough times, when they reach a tough patch? That is what \nhas happened here.\n  Always before our country has said: Do you know what. When you are \nout there alone, living under a yard light, and you and your family are \ntrying to make a living and you get hit with a natural disaster, this \ncountry is going to help. This country wants to reach out a hand and \nsay: You are not alone. We want to help you.\n  Well, in the new farm bills, they took out the disaster title. There \nought to be one. I intend to offer legislation to put a disaster title \nback in the farm bills so we are not begging at the end of every \nsession to try to provide some help to farmers who otherwise are going \nto go broke.\n  Let me describe, as my colleague has done, this picture of a soybean \nfield in North Dakota. There are not any soybeans there. That is a \nfield that is dead, with barely any green at all. Normally, these \nsoybeans would be lush, filling that piece of ground, and would be a \nfoot tall. But, as you can see, these plants are worthless. There is \nnot much alive in that photograph.\n  I have talked to farmers who sold off their entire herds. I talked to \na young farmer who built a herd of cattle for 3 years. It was his \nlife's goal to take over from his parents. He built his herd for 3 \nyears and was barely making it, and then this drought hit and he had \nnothing to feed his cattle. If you don't have anything to feed your \ncattle, those cows are going to market. His cows are gone. He is out of \nbusiness.\n  Shown in this picture is a man from my State who was a rancher. His \nname is Frank Barnick. He is shown walking on a creekbed. It does not \nlook like that. It looks like, again, a moonscape. That is a creekbed \nthat would hold water for his cattle, but it is dry. Frank said this is \nthe worst drought he has ever seen.\n  These people, Frank and his neighbors and friends, are not asking a \nlot from this country. They are asking if this country cares whether \nfamily farmers are able to live on the land and continue farming. They \nhope that the answer is yes and that this country understands farmers \ncontribute something very important. Family farmers contribute \nsomething very important to this country. A fellow who I thought was a \nwonderful author, used to write in a book about the nurturing of family \nvalues in America. He always described that family values in America \ncame from family farms, the seedbed of family values, and they rolled \nto small towns and big cities, nurturing the value system and culture \nalong the way.\n  We have attempted time and time again to get some disaster aid for \npeople who need help. We asked the President, in the middle of the \ndrought this year, to come out and do a drought tour. He was not able \nto do that. I went back and recalled that President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt came out for a drought tour. We don't have a lot of \nPresidents stop through North Dakota. When they do, we are enormously \nhonored to have them join us and be a part of North Dakota.\n  I wanted to read you a couple of things that President Roosevelt \nsaid. He stopped in Huron, SD, exactly 70 years ago. Then he stopped in \nNorth Dakota--both on a drought tour, both on a train--and spoke to \npeople. Here is what he said to our neighbors to the south in Huron, \nSD, on a drought inspection trip. He said:\n\n       No city in an agricultural country can exist unless the \n     farms are prosperous.\n\n  I understand our economy has grown in ways that make this less than \nan agricultural country, but it certainly has not been the case with \nrespect to agricultural States, where a predominant part of our \neconomic base is still agriculture and family farming.\n  Here is what else the President said in Huron, SD, 70 years ago, \nunderstanding that family farmers were having great trouble during that \ndrought:\n\n       I have come out here to find you with your chins up, \n     looking toward the future with confidence and courage. I am \n     grateful to you for the attitude you are taking.\n\n  That is the only way you could ever farm. There isn't anybody who \nwould decide to be a farmer if they didn't look forward to the future \nwith hope. They plant a seed and hope. They hope what they planted will \nproduce a crop. It is the only way farmers can exist.\n  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt went to North Dakota 70 years ago on a \ndrought tour, here is what he said:\n\n       But, when you come to this water problem through here, you \n     are up against two things. In the first place, you are up \n     against the forces of nature and, secondly, you are up \n     against the fact that man, in his present stage of \n     development, cannot definitely control those forces.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Today, out here, I do not ask you to have courage and \n     faith. You have it. You have demonstrated that through a good \n     many years. I am asking, however, that you keep up that \n     courage and, especially, keep up the faith.\n       If it is possible for Government to improve conditions in \n     this State, Government will do it.\n       We hope that Nature is going to open the Heavens. When I \n     came out on the platform this morning and saw a rather dark \n     cloud, I said to myself, ``Maybe it is going to rain.'' Well, \n     it didn't. All I can say is, I hope to goodness it is going \n     to rain, good and plenty.\n       My friends, I want to tell you that I am glad I came here. \n     I want to tell you I am not going to let up until I can give \n     my best service to solving the problems of North Dakota.\n\n  Again, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 70 years ago to family farmers: If \nit is possible for Government to improve conditions, we will do that. \nHe said to the farmers: You are not alone. We want to help.\n  Let's say that again today, let the Congress say that to our farmers: \nYou matter. You make a difference to this country's future. Your \ncontribution to our culture and our economy is important. This Congress \nhas not forgotten that. We will remember it today by investing in the \nfuture and saying to family farmers: We want you to be able to continue \nto farm. We don't want you wandering, as you go into spring planting, \nwhether you are going to have the ability to remain on the farm with \nyour family, producing food for a hungry world.\n  We want to pass a disaster aid package, one that puts this Congress \nin the same position that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in 70 years \nago, saying, if it is within the capability of this Government to help, \nwe intend to help.\n  Again, let me compliment my colleague, Senator Conrad. I am pleased \nto work with him, as I have for many decades. This is an important \namendment to offer now. While this is not the optimum place to offer \nthis amendment, as this appropriations bill deals with different \nappropriations, we have not had the opportunity to do anything but this \nbecause we have not been given the opportunity to move this legislation \nseparately. We offer it hoping for good will and for the support of \nothers.\n  This is not partisan. It is bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats \nfrom farm country understand the importance and the value of doing this \nkind of legislation that says to family farmers: You matter to this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I join in thanking my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for giving me the opportunity to speak about the trials of \nMinnesota farmers. I join in this bipartisan plea to deal with an issue \nthat is of great importance to many Minnesota farm families.\n  While my colleagues from North Dakota speak from the other side of \nthe aisle, our call for assistance for our farmers is made with one \nvoice. I particularly thank Senator Conrad for his leadership on this \nissue. After last week's election, there was a lot of discussion about \nhow the parties can, and should, work together, how we should find \ncommon ground on behalf of the American people. Here is one of our \nfirst opportunities to display bipartisanship. Supporters of this \ndisaster assistance package hail from all over the country and from \nboth parties. This amendment is just the sort of bipartisan cooperation \nthat this body should embrace to meet the Nation's needs.\n  The need for agricultural disaster assistance is great. Minnesota \nfarmers have had to fend for themselves in the face of real natural \ndisaster; first, against record flooding in 2005 and now record drought \nin 2006. In the sugar sector alone, revenue was reduced by $60 million \nin Minnesota in 2005, thanks to this natural disaster. In one county, \ncrop loss exceeded $52 million and farmers were prevented from planting \nover 60,000 acres, thanks to saturated fields. Now with one of the \nworst droughts ever experienced in the Great\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\nPlains, Minnesota farmers have experienced hundreds of millions of \ndollars of crop loss in 2006. The pictures that we saw of North Dakota \nshow the same reality that is faced in Minnesota.\n  It isn't just about statistics. It is about farmers enduring personal \nstruggles. This summer, in Lake Bronson, MN, about 100 farmers showed \nup, out of a town of 180, to talk about the impact on their lives and \nfamilies. It is about the farmers calling my office, desperate to save \nthe family farm. I have received letters from scores of Minnesota \nfarmers talking about the impact on their lives, on their families, \nfamilies that go back through generations of farming today could come \nto an end because we haven't done something that needs to be done. The \nproducers who will not be coming back to the fields next year as a \nresult of catastrophic weather aren't just losing a family business, \nmany are losing a family tradition.\n  In June, I came this floor appalled that the Senate would pass an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill that offers a helping hand \nto some Americans and a cold shoulder to others. Since then, the only \nthing that has changed is that the burden of natural disaster has grown \nheavier on American farmers with the addition of last summer's record \ndrought.\n  It isn't that this Congress has refused to pass agricultural disaster \nassistance. In fact, we provided $1.6 billion in emergency agricultural \nassistance. Of course, none of my farmers will benefit from this \nassistance unless they happen to own a farm in one of the Gulf States. \nCongress still hasn't provided a dime for farmers suffering from \nnatural disasters outside of the gulf region. It would shock many \nAmericans to learn that natural devastation must come in the right \npackage to be worthy of Federal aid. The message being sent is that \nrecord flooding and droughts don't count, only hurricanes.\n  I traveled to the gulf to see the hurricane damage firsthand in order \nto more fully understand what my fellow Americans who live far from my \nhome in Minnesota are suffering. I have wholeheartedly supported their \ncause in Congress. At its core, this is an issue about equity and \nfairness for all regions that are suffering. And to the thousands of \nMinnesotans whose very livelihoods have been jeopardized and those \nlosing farms due to last year's disastrous weather, withholding \nassistance is nothing short of cruel.\n  Some folks in Washington have cited the overall success of \nagriculture in 2006, the aggregate numbers, as a justification for \nwithholding assistance. Congress didn't look at the overall economy \nwhen determining what sort of assistance to send to the gulf after the \nhurricanes. We didn't cite the Nation's robust GDP growth and lower \nunemployment rate as reasons not to assist gulf communities whose local \neconomies were devastated by natural disaster, nor should we propose \nsuch a false standard for comprehensive agricultural disaster \nassistance.\n  Let us seize the opportunity for this body to show Americans that we \nunderstand and reflect the character and the heart and soul of America, \na big heart that understands that Americans are there with a helping \nhand for all those deserving of assistance in times of extraordinary \nneed. Let us show America that the Senate will work in a bipartisan \nspirit to meet their needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this critical amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may call up amendment No. 5123.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would reserve the right to object. This \npresents us with somewhat of an awkward situation because I have \nwithheld offering my amendment. The only amendment pending is the \namendment of the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka. But we have been on my \namendment. We withheld actually offering it. I would ask my colleague \nif she would at least allow us to call up my amendment--Senator Akaka \nwas waiting to speak on the amendment--and then be able to lay that \namendment aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection? The Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I also wish to speak to the \namendment that is about to be called up by the Senator from North \nDakota. In order to maintain continuity, I would hope that I could \nspeak after the Senator from Hawaii, if that is going to be the \nspeaking order. If we are going to go to the Senator from Maine as an \nintermediary event, that is fine, too. If we are going to continue on \nthis amendment, I would like to participate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I had told the Senator \nfrom North Dakota that he could offer the amendment, and then I asked \nthat he set it aside so that Senator Collins could offer her amendment, \nafter which we would have a voice vote, but his amendment would still \nbe in order. I did not know that Senator Akaka was going to speak on \nit. I ask the Senator from Maine if it would be acceptable to allow the \nSenator from Hawaii 10 minutes, the Senator from New Hampshire 10 \nminutes, if that is acceptable, and then the amendment would be set \naside and Senator Collins and Senator Feingold would be recognized for \ntheir amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, that is certainly fine with me. I was \ntrying to follow the direction I got from the chairman and the floor \nmanager when we talked a few minutes ago. But if she wants to pursue \nthis and proceed as she has suggested, I have no objection, and I \nwithdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Hawaii seek recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I now call up my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may offer his \namendment.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Coleman, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Hagel, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Thune, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n     Reid, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Harkin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Roberts, \n     Mr. Dayton, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Akaka, proposes amendment \n     numbered 5144.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nbe Senator Akaka for 10 minutes, Senator Gregg for 10 minutes, after \nwhich the amendment would be set aside and Senator Collins would be \nrecognized for the Collins-Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I would like to be \nincluded in that order so that I may be able to respond to whatever the \nSenator from New Hampshire might say.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, after Senator Gregg, I amend my \nrequest to include up to 5 minutes for Senator Conrad, after which \nSenator Collins would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for the \nopportunity to speak at this time. I rise today in support of Senator \nKent Conrad's amendment. I thank Senator Conrad for his leadership and \nagreeing to include a provision on behalf of the senior Senator from \nHawaii, Dan Inouye, and myself to H.R. 5385, the Fiscal Year 2007 \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. President, I was in Hawaii on October 15, 2006, when we felt a \nviolent tremor, an earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude that rocked \nthe Hawaiian Islands, and it set off a series of aftershocks for days \nafterward.\n  The earthquake loosened rocks, dirt, and building foundations, and \nsubsequent heavy rains have continued to\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nundermine the structural integrity of public utilities, buildings, \nroads, and related infrastructure. In recognition of these damages, \nPresident Bush on October 17, 2006, declared the State as a major \ndisaster area. While this declaration enabled some relief from the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, a significant amount of \ndamage remains unaddressed.\n  The farming community was hit particularly hard by the earthquake. \nThe water intakes for the Lower and Upper Hamakua Ditches and the \nKohala Ditch on the Big Island were buried by landslides. The \nearthquake and the many aftershocks also caused the collapse of earthen \ntunnels and wooden flumes and cracks in dams. These irrigation systems \nprovide the sole source of water for most farmers and other members of \nrural communities in the region. The Big Island also suffered a \ncollapsed lane on the Hawaii Belt Road on the Hamakua Coast, north of \nHilo town.\n  The provision would add $21 million to address the agriculture \ndamages caused by the October 15th earthquake:\n\n       $12 million to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, \n     NRCS, Emergency Watershed Protection Program for the repair \n     of the Lower Hamakua Ditch and the Waimea Irrigation System/\n     Upper Hamakua Ditch--which were heavily damaged by the \n     earthquake, and are negatively impacting the farming \n     community on the Big Island; $3 million to the Big Island \n     Resource Conservation and Development Council to repair of \n     the Kohala Ditch system that was also severely damaged by the \n     earthquake; $6 million to the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for \n     its Emergency Conservation Program to repair broken \n     irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water tanks. \n     Of this amount, $2 million will go towards repairing the \n     damages to stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and \n     Kohala areas, and another $2 million is needed under the \n     Emergency Loan Program to cover losses of agricultural \n     income.\n\n  Mr. President, last week I met with Big Island farmers and ranchers \nwhose livelihoods have been dramatically impacted by the October \nearthquake. They need water for their farms or they risk losing cattle \nand crops. The damage done to Hawaii's irrigation systems is too severe \nto be repaired by the State alone. I promised that I would not abandon \nthese hard-working individuals.\n  I ask my colleagues to support Senator Conrad's amendment, which \nwould also help Hawaii's farmers and ranchers recover from last month's \nearthquake.\n  Senator Inouye and I urge our colleagues and ask them for their \nsupport. Thank you very much. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there are some things so ironic around here \nthat you just have to smile. We are just coming off this election--and \nI congratulate my colleagues on the other side for their success with a \nsignificant and dramatic win. But if we listen to the rhetoric from \nthem, and certainly from the pundits who analyzed the election, it was \nobviously about the war in Iraq, but it was also about fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I don't know how many times I have read from national pundits, from \nthe Washington Post and the New York Times, how the Democratic Party is \nnow the party of fiscal discipline. Yet the first amendment brought to \nthe floor of this Senate--the first amendment--increases the national \ndebt by $4.9 billion. It exceeds the budget by $4.9 billion and claims \nit is an emergency, on an issue which has already been addressed by \nthis Senate, I think, two, maybe three times, and rejected.\n  Well, maybe the folks out there who voted and thought they were \nvoting for fiscal discipline when they voted to bring in the other \nparty should take a look at this amendment and ask: Where did this come \nfrom? Is this a bill of goods I just got sold?\n  The first amendment brought up by the other side of the aisle after \nthey win this significant, important, dramatic victory is to ask for \n$4.9 billion above the budget, throw it on the debt, increase spending. \nIt is, as I said, ironic. It makes you wonder. I wonder where we are \nheaded under this new regime. There is something called a regular \nappropriations process. In fact, it is very likely that we will get to \nan agriculture bill, an appropriations bill before we adjourn this \nsession, euphemistically referred to as a lameduck session. When that \nbill comes up, if it is the belief, contention, and argument of those \nin the farm communities who have been affected by what they feel is a \nbad crop-year--if they believe they need additional funds, that bill \nwill have the opportunity to shift funds around, move funds to those \naccounts that are needed, and which need additional funding, within the \ncontext of the budget, within the limitations of the budget. That is \ncalled regular order. But this is not regular order. This is a daytime \nrobbery of the Treasury, a heist, in open daylight, and I give them \ncredit for that.\n  There is nothing secretive about this. This is just saying we have \nthe votes, so we are going to come to the floor and spend $4.9 billion \nand add it to the Federal debt and call it an emergency. It is going to \nstuff the budget. It is not good policy. It is not good fiscal policy. \nIt clearly, in my humble opinion--I may have misread the election. I \nwasn't up for reelection, but I have certainly read a lot about it, and \nI participated on the stump enough.\n  I think it sells the people of this country who voted in the election \na bill of goods they didn't think they were buying--in fact, just the \nopposite. I understand there are some folks on my side of the aisle who \nalso feel compelled to vote for this amendment. I regret that, too, \nobviously. I hope they will reconsider. In any event, it is an \namendment that violates the budget. It is, therefore, subject to a 60-\nvote point of order. We have 60-vote points of order here in order to \ntry to maintain some semblance of fiscal discipline. This will be our \nfirst exercise in trying to maintain that semblance of fiscal \ndiscipline in what you might call the new congressional year. It will \nbe a good test for us as a Senate for my colleagues on the other side \nwho are about to become the majority party, and for us on this side, \nwho will become the honorable minority. It will be a good test for us \nto see if we have the courage to actually initiate fiscal discipline in \nthis new Congress. The opportunity is there. All we need is 41 votes.\n  Mr. President, 59 people can vote for their constituencies, vote to \nraise spending, raise the debt, vote to increase spending outside the \nbudget. It will be a good test to see whether there are 41 people here \nwho took the message away from the election that the pundits have told \nus is the message, that the national Democratic Party told us is the \nmessage, and that some of our own folks on our side told us is the \nmessage, which is that they expect the Congress to start living within \nits budgets. It will be a good test of whether at least the working \nminority heard that message.\n  At this point, I will make a point of order.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution, I \nraise a point of order against the emergency designation in the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague with great \ninterest. He is the chairman of the Budget Committee, someone with whom \nI work closely and have respect for and affection for. But he has \ntalked about this violating the budget. There is no budget. No budget \nhas been passed. My colleagues have been in control, and we have not \npassed a budget. Let's be square about this. There is no budget.\n  No. 2, this is not the new Congress; this is a continuation of the \nold Congress. The old Congress didn't get the job done. Let's be \nstraight about that.\n  No. 3, the Senator said this has been defeated in the past in the \nSenate. Wrong. This has passed the Senate. This passed the Senate with \n77 votes. It wasn't defeated; it was passed with 77 votes on a \nbipartisan basis. The package that passed was more generous than this \npackage because the White House raised objection to that package. The \nWhite House said it was too much money. The White House said they did \nnot want the direct payments as an offset to the skyrocketing energy \nprices, so we took those provisions out and saved $1.8 billion. That is \nthe package that is before this body. It is the package that has \npassed. In fact, in the appropriations process, it passed several\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\ntimes. In fact, it is waiting in the Agriculture appropriations bill \nright now.\n  Unfortunately, that bill, we are told, is not going to be considered. \nSo the only opportunity we have to address the emergency disaster \nconcerns of people all across this country is with this amendment, make \nno mistake. This amendment is fully bipartisan. We now have 20 \ncosponsors.\n  This is an emergency. So pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95, \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006, I move to \nwaive section 402 of that concurrent resolution for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I must respond briefly to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, whom I also greatly admire and with whom I have enjoyed \nworking. He has always been a responsible and effective Member of this \nSenate, to say the least.\n  Let me make the point; he said there is no budget. There is no grand \nbudget, that is true, but there is a budget. That is why he had to \nwaive the Budget Act in order to get to this point. It is a function of \nthe fact that we put in place, as those who follow the arcane nature of \nthis institution know, a set of 302 allocations which are guiding how \nmuch money can be spent in the Senate, and that is essentially the \nbudget. It is a pretty aggressive mechanism to put in place. \nInnumerable budget points of order have been brought under that, some \nsustained, some not sustained.\n  As to this amendment, this amendment did fail. It failed on an issue \nof germaneness. So there is a history here. But more importantly, the \nessence of the problem of this amendment is it busts the budget. It \nadds $4.9 billion to the debt. And I would argue that maybe the Senator \nfrom North Dakota doesn't feel he is in the new structure, but I \nbelieve most people think, in this post-election environment, where the \nelection was so dramatic, that Congress shouldn't be functioning under \nthe old rules of just breaking the budget; we should be living under \nthe discipline, and we are not. That is my point.\n  If the American people's intent--and I think it was--was to send a \nmessage to us as the keepers of their pocketbooks, we are, in my \nopinion, not living up to that request when the first amendment brought \nto the floor of the Senate after this election is an amendment to \nincrease spending by $4.9 billion above the budget and add that money \nto the debt. It is not good policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this doesn't bust the budget. No, no, no. \nWe have always handled natural disasters in this way, with an emergency \ndesignation. That is the rule, that is the precedent, that is what we \nhave done before, and that is what we should do now. This is not \nbreaking the budget. That is just not the case. The Senator knows it is \nnot the case.\n  This is a circumstance, as we have dealt with every natural disaster \nin the past: We make a determination whether an emergency exists. \nClearly it does. We have been struck by the third worst drought in our \nNation's history. This provision passed this body with 77 votes.\n  The people who are out there expect the Congress, expect the Senate \nto respond to the needs of the American people. We have a need for \nsecurity. We have a need, an absolute need, for a return to fiscal \nresponsibility. We also have a need to deal with natural disasters when \nthey strike the American family. This is a set of disasters almost \nunprecedented in our history. The people who have been hit by them \ndeserve a response. That is what this amendment seeks to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator has a minute and a half \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from New Hampshire want to continue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It has come to my \nattention that this language is not only increasing the appropriations, \nit may also have authorizing language in it. Is this amendment subject \nto rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This amendment does constitute legislation on \nan appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to speak to the other side. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we recognize the Senator would be within \nhis rights to make a motion under rule XVI. I say to the Senator, we \nhope he will not do that. We hope we will have a chance for a vote on \nthe Senate floor on this question. I say to my colleagues, if we don't \nget a vote now, we are not going to stop until we do get a vote.\n  I say to my colleague, it is certainly reasonable to bring a \nchallenge under the Budget Act and to require a supermajority vote, but \nI hope very much that the Senator will not use rule XVI on a matter of \nthis importance to so many people across the country. I implore the \nSenator not to invoke rule XVI.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is laid \naside.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5123\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Feingold, \nI call up amendment No. 5123 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Coleman, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sununu, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n     Warner, Ms. Snowe, Mr. McCain, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. \n     Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 5123.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To extend the Office of the Inspector General for Iraq until \n80 percent of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the \n         Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund has been expended)\n\n       On page 82, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       Sec. 126. Section 3001(o) of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law 108-106; 117 Stat. \n     1238; 5 U.S.C. App., note to section 8G of Public Law 95-\n     452), as amended by section 1054(b) of the John Warner \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 \n     (Public Law 109-364), is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(o) Termination.--(1)(A) The Office of the Inspector \n     General shall terminate 10 months after 80 percent of the \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Iraq \n     Relief and Reconstruction Fund have been expended.\n       ``(B) For purposes of calculating the termination of the \n     Office of the Inspector General under this subsection, any \n     United States funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for fiscal year 2006 for the reconstruction of Iraq, \n     irrespective of the designation of such funds, shall be \n     deemed to be amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n       ``(2) The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     shall, prior to the termination of the Office of the Special \n     Inspector General under paragraph (1), prepare a final \n     forensic audit report on all funds deemed to be amounts \n     appropriated or otherwise made available to the Iraq Relief \n     and Reconstruction Fund.''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nJohn McCain, Bill Nelson, and Judd Gregg be added as cosponsors to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment, which the Senator from \nWisconsin and I have offered, would ensure continuing vigorous, \naggressive oversight of American tax dollars in Iraq by repealing the \npremature termination date for the Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction. This office will be prematurely \nterminated by provisions that were recently enacted as part of the \nconference report on the Defense authorization bill. Our amendment will \nrestore the special IG's termination date to its previous schedule of \n10 months after 80 percent of the funds for the Iraqi reconstruction \nprojects have been expended.\n  The special IG has been very effective, and the important work of \nthis watchdog must continue as long as American funds are being used \nfor Iraq reconstruction. We should not terminate this mandate to \nprevent waste, fraud, and abuse by some arbitrary and premature date. \nIn fact, it is inconceivable to me that we would terminate this office \nwhich has played such a vital role in spotlighting waste, fraud, and \nabuse and has more than proven its worth.\n  The Office of the Special Inspector General has saved the American \ntaxpayers literally millions of dollars. In fact, when one looks at the \ncombined impact of the audits, the investigations, the cost avoidances, \nand other savings, the potential financial impact of this office has \nbeen nearly $2 billion. Yet the office has cost the American taxpayers \nonly $73 million since it was created. So $2 billion in savings, in \ncost avoidances, versus a cost of only $73 million. This means that for \nevery dollar the special inspector general has spent, there has been a \nfinancial impact of $25--an impressive ratio.\n  There is no question that the inspector general's office has been \nextremely effective. Its work has led to convictions, to indictments, \nto the recovery of funds, and to improvement in contracting. It was the \ninspector general who told us about cost overruns on contracts--\nHalliburton contracts, for example. It was the inspector general who \nhighlighted shoddy construction of health clinics, of a special police \nstation. It was the inspector general who made recommendations that \nhave improved contracting oversight and procedures in Iraq.\n  We are talking about billions and billions of dollars. It makes \nabsolutely no sense at all for this office, which has been such an \neffective watchdog, to be brought to a premature end.\n  Some people say: Why can't you just have the regular IG from the \nDepartment of Defense or the Department of State or USAID undertake \nthis work? I think in many ways the question answers itself. There are \nmany departments and agencies that are involved in the Iraqi \nreconstruction projects. We need to have a special IG who has the \nauthority to follow the money no matter from what agency or department \nit originated. Also, the special IG has proven its worth time and \nagain. The special IG is in Iraq even as we speak and has had a team on \nthe ground in harm's way. Also, the DOD IG's office has not had a team \non the ground in Iraq auditing, inspecting, and investigating on an \nongoing basis.\n  I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Wisconsin who has \nbeen such a leader in this area, who originated the idea of having a \nspecial inspector general in the first place, and I was very pleased to \npartner with him in that effort years ago.\n  Let's correct this mistake right off so that the office doesn't have \nto start shutting down its operations in anticipation of the \ntermination date next October. We can remedy this mistake right now, \nand we should do so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of amendment \n5123 offered by Senators Collins and Feingold. This bipartisan \namendment would extend the life of the Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR, and restore the bipartisan \nagreement made regarding the termination of the SIGIR in the Senate-\npassed fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill.\n  The Collins-Feingold amendment is necessary to undo the damage of a \nveiled provision inserted in the fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization \nconference report by the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee \nthat terminates the SIGIR by an artificial date that has no basis in \nthe progress of reconstruction projects.\n  This amendment will sustain the valuable work of the special IG to \nmonitor, audit, and inspect funds made available for assistance for \nIraq in both the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund and in other \nimportant accounts, which totals nearly $32 billion.\n  The amendment will restore the formula for calculating the SIGIR's \ntermination to 10 months after 80 percent of the funds appropriated for \nIraq reconstruction have been expended. While I strongly support this \namendment, I believe the SIGIR's authority should extend as long as \nnecessary to ensure that the billions of dollars appropriated for \nIraq's reconstruction be granted adequate oversight.\n  It is important that the special IG auditors continue their work as \nlong as taxpayer funds are being spent on reconstruction efforts. Thus \naspects of this amendment--including the 80 percent expended trigger \nand the exclusion of future Iraq reconstruction appropriations will \nneed to be revisited in the coming months. I intend to work with other \nSenators to ensure that all future Iraq reconstruction funds are \nsubject to the continued oversight of the SIGIR.\n  Wasteful spending and profiteering are especially offensive in \nwartime, and our soldiers and the American people deserve more \noversight of how their tax dollars are being spent in Iraq, not less \noversight.\n  The special inspector general's work to date has been enormously \nvaluable to the executive branch, to Congress, and to American \ntaxpayers. The SIGIR has completed more than 55 audit reports, issued \nmore than 165 recommendations, and seized more than $13 million in \nassets. What the SIGIR has uncovered proves the need for the work of \nthis office to continue.\n  The SIGIR's investigations have sent American reconstruction \nofficials to jail on bribery and conspiracy charges, exposed numerous \ninstances of colossal mismanagement in construction projects, and \nuncovered case after case of waste, fraud, and abuse at the taxpayers' \nexpense. In fewer than 3 years, the special IG's operations have \nresulted in savings to the U.S. Government and the taxpayers of more \nthan $24 million and uncovered considerable wasteful or fraudulent \nspending.\n  The Collins-Feingold amendment will abolish the artificial and \narbitrary termination date inserted by one Member of the other body and \nextend the SIGIR's charter with the recognition that the office has \nperformed crucial work, with much more remaining to be done.\n  I appreciate the work of Senators Collins and Feingold in offering \nthis commonsense amendment and urge its adoption by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has been a \nwonderful leader on this issue. It is always a pleasure to work with \nher. I am also pleased to be working with Senator Lieberman and a \nnumber of other distinguished Members on this effort as well. It is \ntruly the kind of bipartisan work not only the American people have \ncalled for with these elections but the American people deserve, and I \nhope it is a sign of things to come.\n  As Senator Collins noted, this is an important bill. I have worked \nhard with a few of my colleagues to create the SIGIR several years ago \nand I am very proud of what we have accomplished.\n  To go back to how this started, this is all the way back to October \n2003. We all remember the famous $87 billion bill that became famous \nfor other reasons. But included in the bill was the creation of the \noriginal inspector general as a part of the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. I was pleased we got it in there, but I obviously wasn't \ncertain it would work out and that it would be done well, but in fact \nthat is exactly what happened. Regardless of your view of the wisdom of \nthe Iraq war, we were able to come together and say: In any event, the \ntaxpayers' dollars for reconstruction should be monitored and \nevaluated; there should be accountability.\n  Well, thanks to the appointment of Stuart Bowen, who is the inspector \ngeneral, that is exactly what has happened. The agency has worked \nextremely well. As Senator Collins indicated, they go out into the \nfield in Iraq\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\nin a way that other agencies have not done to do very effective \nreports.\n  Now, these reports are troubling, many of them. They indicate things \naren't working well in a lot of places and a whole lot of money has to \nbe spent on security rather than on reconstruction. Nonetheless, they \nare doing the taxpayers a service. We have run into a problem because \nthe Iraq war, of course, has been far less successful than people \nexpected, and this whole situation has continued much longer than was \noriginally anticipated. So not only did we create it in October 2003, I \nhad offered an amendment in June 2004 to extend it, and then again in \n2005 with the help of Senator Collins and then again this year in 2006. \nAnd unfortunately, after we had agreed to extend it because not all of \nthe dollars had been expended, a provision was added in the House in \nconference that basically cuts this off artificially. It goes against \nthe whole assumption, which is that this agency should continue to do \nits work until 80 percent--10 months after 80 percent of the funds have \nbeen expended. That is the formula. We now estimate that work cannot be \ndone until approximately the end of 2009, given how long it is going to \ntake to expend this money. To cut this off prematurely in October of \n2007 is to simply undo the good work of this agency.\n  So I am pleased Senator Collins and I were able to add an amendment \nto the recent Defense authorization bill that expanded oversight \nauthority. We actually expanded its jurisdiction so it could monitor \nand audit United States taxpayers' dollars being used for Iraq \nreconstruction regardless of the type of account. So that actually \ninvolves another $11 billion in accounts that need to be evaluated and \nthe taxpayers are going to get what they deserve. This is the problem \nwith the provision that cuts this off prematurely. This is no time to \nterminate the office that has done so much to protect taxpayer dollars \nin Iraq. Our work on the Defense authorization bill provided the Senate \nwith an estimated additional $11 billion in oversight responsibility \nand that makes SIGIR's total oversight responsibility approximately $32 \nbillion.\n  Now, for people listening, what kind of money is $32 billion? I \nunderstand that roughly the entire foreign aid that we give to all of \nthe countries in the world in one year is only $20 billion. This is $32 \nbillion, just for reconstruction in Iraq. Surely there needs to be \naccountability for this, and we need to give this important office the \ntime to do its work and to make sure the money isn't subject to waste, \nfraud, or abuse.\n  I am delighted we are working together, Senator Collins and I and \nothers, and I do hope we can simply reverse this unfortunate error in \nthe House version of the conference report and that we can restore this \noffice to its full form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I again want to commend the Senator from \nWisconsin for his leadership on this issue. It has been a great \npleasure to work with him. I mentioned we have 24 cosponsors of the \namendment. I did want to acknowledge that Senator Lieberman and Senator \nColeman have played important roles in drafting this bill, and both the \nchairman and the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, are cosponsors as well.\n  Finally, I want to thank the two floor managers, Senator Hutchison \nand Senator Feinstein, for working with us on this bill. Senator \nFeinstein is also a cosponsor of it, and I very much appreciate Senator \nHutchison assisting us to bring this to the floor. So I say thank you \nto my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, if there is no further debate on the amendment, I ask \nthat the amendment be brought to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5123) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5144\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been advised that the other side \nmay intend to raise rule XVI against my amendment. I would ask them \nbefore they make that judgment, it would be entirely in order for me to \noffer my amendment to the Vietnam PNTR legislation. And if we are going \nto get treated this way, then I reserve my right to offer the amendment \non the Vietnam PNTR. That will assure that the Vietnam PNTR will not \nget done during this week. So if others are going to treat us that way, \nthey should be prepared for me to play hardball, too.\n  I have been very patient. I have operated under the regular rules \nrepeatedly. But if others are going to give us short shrift, if they \nare going to tell the farmers and the ranchers who have suffered \ndisaster that they don't even get a vote, then I am prepared to play \nhardball, too.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that this amendment, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota just talked about, is an amendment dealing with \nagriculture. This is a military construction bill that is before us. \nThe Senator from North Dakota said we might want to raise a germaneness \nquestion, which is rule XVI, and that would be treating the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and others who support this legislation improperly. I \nwould make the point that the reason rule XVI is there is to make sure \nwe don't have amendments that are offered to appropriations bills that \nare not germane. I think it is a great stretch to suggest an emergency \nsupplemental for agriculture is germane to military construction. That \nis not treating my colleague any way other than how every other \ncolleague is treated here on a whole variety of different issues.\n  There are lots of opportunities we all would love to have to offer \namendments to appropriations bills we don't take because it is not \ngermane, and we don't do it as a result of that. That is the way in \nwhich the Senate operates under some semblance of order. It doesn't \nnecessarily operate as seamlessly as we would like, but this is one of \nthe rules we have kept intact and used because we want to try to keep \nto the subject at hand, particularly on the issue of appropriations.\n  So throw on top of that what I can tell you in my State and in lots \nof other States and in lots of other races around the country is the \ncry of deficit spending, which was heard loudly and clearly and echoed, \nby the way, by both sides of the aisle, of how we were going to have \nmuch more fiscal responsibility, and here we are with the first \namendment with nearly $5 billion in emergency spending on a military \nconstruction bill having nothing to do with military construction. It \nmay be bipartisan but, as far as I am concerned, that is no excuse. \nThis is not what I think the message from the electorate was, that we \nneed to have a whole bunch of new spending nongermane to the matter at \nhand.\n  So while I understand the need--and we have farmers in my State who \nhave suffered through floods earlier this year and I am sure will be \nimpacted by this, but it is absolutely essential that we take this \nissue seriously, and I intend to do that.\n  So at this point I am going to suspend and ask for a quorum call and \nI will be back in a minute. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I understand the Chair has reviewed the \namendment, amendment No. 5144, and I now raise a point of order against \nthe amendment. But first, before I do that, I understand the Chair is \ncurrently reviewing this amendment, so I am going to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Let me be very clear. Senators have a right to invoke rule XVI. But \nlet's be clear. This is how emergency disasters have been dealt with \nyear after year after year in this body. What I am seeking to do is to \nget a vote. The farmers and ranchers of this country deserve a vote. \nNow, they can deny the vote, at least temporarily, but if they think \nthat is the end of the story, they are wrong. We are going to be back. \nAnd, look: If my colleagues are going to invoke rule XVI on this \nmeasure, when the underlying legislation has passed this body with 77 \nvotes, and by that device prevent a vote, then things are going to get \nvery tough around here. I know the rules of the Senate. If Members \nthink they can ramrod things and deny farmers and ranchers in this \ncountry a vote on desperately needed disaster assistance, then this \nSenate is going to slow way down. My colleagues can use their rights \nand I will use mine. Let there be no doubt about what the result will \nbe. This place is going to have a hard time functioning if there is not \ncomity, if there is not fairness, and if people are denied a vote \nrepeatedly. That is what is occurring.\n\n  The precedent is clear in this Senate. Virtually every disaster \npackage has been legislation on an appropriations bill. Rule XVI was \nnot invoked because it was recognized that is one of the few ways to \nachieve the result.\n  The Senator has the right to invoke rule XVI. This Senator has a \nright to object to unanimous consent agreements, to put the legislation \non Vietnam PNTR, and to move to seek a vote. It is only fair the \nfarmers and ranchers of this country, who have been devastated, get a \nvote. Let the Members vote. That is what the people were saying in this \nelection. They want a process that is fair and that gets results for \nthe American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this amendment \nbe set aside until we have the withdrawal of the previous motion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note that the majority leader is on the \nSenate floor. I am prepared to speak for just about 5 minutes, if that \nis acceptable. I thank the majority leader, and I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter and Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 4051 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n(Purpose: To make available $18,000,000 for the provision of additional \n mental health services through Vet Centers to veterans who served in \n                     combat in Iraq or Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 106, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 229. Of the amount appropriated by this title, up to \n     $18,000,000 may be available for necessary expenses, \n     including salaries and expenses, for the provision of \n     additional mental health services through centers for \n     readjustment counseling and related mental health services \n     for veterans under section 1712A of title 38, United States \n     Code (commonly referred to as ``Vet Centers''), to veterans \n     who served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank the managers \nof the bill for accepting this amendment. I do this as Senator \nKennedy's cosponsor, along with Senators Akaka, Boxer, and Jeffords.\n  What we have found is that all of the vet centers around the country \nare enormously overburdened in trying to be able to take care of \nreturning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, particularly those with PTSD \nmental health issues. The staffing, unfortunately, is not up to what it \nneeds to be. Demand has doubled. So we have an obligation, which I \nthink everybody accepts, to try to make certain we do what is necessary \nfor those who have served as they return.\n  This amendment would add money that is offset; it comes out of the \nfund within the bill itself. I am grateful to both Senators Feinstein \nand Hutchison for their willingness to accept it. This will provide \nquality care in our vet centers. We had a study in the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee in the House which found that the number of returning \nveterans requesting services has doubled.\n  One in four vet centers that have been surveyed around the country \nhave been forced to actually limit services or establish waiting lists \nfor critically needed services. So I think this will help us meet a \nneed, and I am grateful for my colleagues being willing to accept it.\n  It is our obligation to do everything possible to ensure that \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan can make the transition \nhome successfully.\n  ``Welcome home'' must be more than something we say to our veterans. \nIt must be measured in actions taken, not just words spoken.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment to increase funding for the VA vet \ncenters to provide critically needed services to our returning \nveterans.\n  The VA vet centers provide readjustment counseling and outreach \nservices to all veterans who served in any combat zone. Our veterans \nearned these benefits through their service to country, and we must \nfulfill Nation's commitment to them by providing the highest quality \nservices possible. Unfortunately, a recent report reveals that VA vet \ncenters need additional funding in order to provide the trained \nprofessionals necessary to offer quality mental health services.\n  The vet center program was established to assist Vietnam-era veterans \nwho were experiencing readjustment problems. In 1991, Congress extended \nthe eligibility to veterans who served during other periods of armed \nhostilities after the Vietnam era. The goal of the centers is to \nprovide a broad range of counseling, outreach and referral services to \nhelp veterans successfully readjust to civilian life. Services include \nindividual counseling, group counseling, marital and family counseling, \nbereavement counseling, medical referrals, assistance in applying for \nVA benefits, and employment counseling.\n  A recent report by the House Veterans Affairs Committee Democratic \nstaff found that in 9 months, between October 2005 and June 2006, the \nnumber of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who turned to \nvet centers for post traumatic stress disorder services doubled.\n  The increased demand for services is beginning to affect access to \nquality care. In fact, one in four vet centers surveyed has been forced \nto limit services or establish waiting lists for critically needed \nservices. After serving this Nation and fighting for our country, our \nveterans should not have to fight for critical adjustment services.\n  In November of 2004, VA Secretary Nicholson approved a mental health \nstrategic plan, acknowledging gaps in mental health services due to the \nsurge in demand from veterans of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nCongress provided approximately $100 million to fund the VA mental \nhealth strategic plan. However, a recent GAO report shows that the VA \nhas diverted or failed to utilize money that was intended for staffing \nat vet centers and has not provided a full accounting of what has \nhappened to the funding. The GAO is expected to issue a full report on \nthese funding gaps later this year, but the preliminary results \nindicate a possible misuse of mental health dollars.\n  One-third of the veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan come \nto the VA with mental health concerns. We have seen the cases of PTSD \nrise sharply along with the need for readjustment care when veterans \nreturn home. It is imperative that our vet centers have enough trained \nprofessionals to offer quality mental health services. There are 207 \nvet centers across the country. They are currently unable to deal with \nthe increasing demand for mental health services. Each of these centers \nneeds additional funding to hire sufficient staff to deal with the \nrecent influx of patients. y\n  John Rowan, National President of Vietnam Veterans of America, \nrecently said, ``The resources are not there in the VA Vet Centers.'' \nMr. Rowan went on to say that ``Not only is the mental health and well-\nbeing of veterans being placed at risk, the Vet Centers themselves are \nat risk. Because of significantly increased work loads, some centers \nhave introduced waiting lists. Accommodating the ever-increasing demand \nfor readjustment counseling is taking a heavy toll on already \noverworked staff.'' We need to do more to help our veterans.\n  My amendment would provide $18 million to hire additional mental \nhealth staff at VA vet centers. This amount was recommended by the \nVietnam Veterans of America to allow the VA to hire the appropriate \nstaff needed to deal with the influx of veterans who need help. The \nVietnam Veterans of America and the National Military Family \nAssociation support my amendment.\n  Our soldiers have sacrificed greatly for their country, and we owe \nthem the best care when they return. Many wounds of war are not \nvisible, which makes it that much more important that vet centers have \nall the resources they need to serve those veterans who are suffering \nin any way. I ask all my colleagues to support this amendment to \nprovide appropriate funding to staff our vet centers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Saturday, all across the country, we \nhonored our Nation's veterans, and we renewed our commitment to care \nfor them, in the way Abraham Lincoln advised us in his Second Inaugural \nAddress: ``to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall \nhave borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.''\n  From the very beginning of America, brave men and women have \nsacrificed their lives or suffered wounds while serving our country. We \nowe each of them a debt of gratitude that we can never truly repay, and \nwe must honor them and support them whenever we can.\n  In doing so, we must take great care to remember that not all wounds \nare visible and that, when we call upon our best and brightest, we \noften send their precious minds, as well as their bodies, into harm's \nway. The continuing current missions in Iraq and Afghanistan have been \nespecially demanding of, and damaging to, our troops.\n  A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation and conducted by a medical research team at the Walter Reed \nArmy Institute of Research surveyed soldiers and Marines returning from \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other locations yielded disturbing results. \nAccording to the survey, post-traumatic stress disorder, major \ndepression, substance abuse, or other mental health disorders may \nafflict nearly 1 in 5 service members returning from Iraq and more than \n1 in ten returning from Afghanistan.\n  The Veterans Health Administration estimates that a large percentage \nof the veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who have sought VA care have \nexhibited symptoms of one or more mental disorders and have sought \ntreatment from veterans centers. Last month, the Washington Post \nreported that, as of the end of June, the VA treated a third\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nof the more than 184,000 veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq for these \nsymptoms. Nearly half of those treated were diagnosed as possible \nvictims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  According to the Post, the VA's estimate represents a tenfold \nincrease in the number of cases treated in only 18 months, and the \nnumber is likely to increase as our forces continue to serve multiple \ntours of duty in hostile areas. The number may be further increased by \nongoing medical outreach programs conducted by the military to increase \nservice members' awareness of the indications and implications of the \ntypes of psychological trauma associated with combat deployments.\n  As their awareness grows, many more veterans will likely seek mental \nhealth treatment, and veterans groups are deeply concerned that the VA \nis already straining to meet the increased demand. All too frequently \nwe read reports of reduced services, staff shortages, and long waits \nfor minimal or intermittent care.\n  In August, the Washington Post reported the example of a veteran of \nIraq who receives only 30 minutes of treatment a month for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. In October, the Post reported that another \nveteran of Iraq was told he would have to wait 2\\1/2\\ months for an \nappointment at a VA facility to treat his sleep disorder.\n  We need to be sure that our veterans receive the care they deserve, \nand that the VA has the capacity to provide adequately specialized \nservices to every veteran who needs counseling or treatment. We can't \nallow the heavy demands of our commitments overseas to impair the \nquality of assistance that our veterans actually receive. The more we \nask of our brave men and women, the more we must provide them in \nreturn.\n  The Kerry amendment will help the Veterans' Administration to better \naddress the surge in mental health needs of our veterans and help to \nprovide a higher standard of medical care to them in a more productive \nand efficient manner. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Our veterans need and deserve this support. We owe them nothing less \nin light of the intense dangers and stresses they have faced and \nendured so courageously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am looking for the chairman on this \nbill. I know she has no objections. I request a voice vote on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The amendment (No. 5142) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, unfortunately, the Republican leader just \nleft the floor. We were about to be in a position to resolve this \nmatter. I ask the leader's staff to ask the leader to return to the \nfloor so we can resolve this.\n  Maybe for the interest of my colleagues, I will try to reflect on \nwhere we are. I had offered an amendment for disaster aid for farmers \nand ranchers. The chairman of the Budget Committee, within his rights, \nraised a budget point of order against my amendment. It was then \nsuggested that rule XVI would be raised as well. We have had, over the \nlast several hours, a series of discussions to find a way to resolve \nthis matter. At this hour, it appears the best way to resolve it is to \nhave a commitment that we would go to the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill tomorrow and try to do that in a tight timeframe of limited \namendments, and that I would have a chance to offer the amendment at \nthat time and other Senators' rights would be reserved, and that I \nwould withdraw my amendment from this bill with the understanding that \nwe would go to the Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow. That is \nwhat we had tentatively agreed to. I think we just have to have the \nleader indicate publicly that that is his understanding as well. Then \nwe can break the gridlock here and proceed to finish Military \nConstruction.\n  While we are waiting, I might indicate how much I appreciate the \npatience of the chairman and the ranking member of the Military \nConstruction bill and their very constructive efforts to try to find a \nway out of this. I for one deeply appreciate it. I also very much \nappreciate the work of both the majority leader, Senator Frist, who has \nmade his best efforts to try to resolve this matter, and our own \nleader, Senator Reid, for his assistance as well. Certainly a special \nthanks goes to Senator Bennett and ranking member Senator Kohl for \ntheir constructive efforts and their agreement to go to their bill \ntomorrow. I also thank Senator Dorgan, my colleague, for his efforts to \ntry to move this matter along.\n  With that, I yield the floor and hope that we have a chance to hear \nfrom the majority leader, so we can start the process to unwind this \nand reach a conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while the Senator who was talking is \nstill on the floor, let me say if a unanimous consent request is \npropounded that is consistent with what he has said, I would have to \nobject. I want to make sure everybody knows this.\n  We have a bill, Energy and Water, authored by this Senator and \nSenator Reid, soon to be majority leader. It is our bill, Energy and \nWater. We want to make sure that during these operative days we are \ngoing to get some work done and that this bill gets in line to be taken \nup. We are not asking for any special privileges, but if you are going \nto propound it the way you have, then I am going to ask that House bill \n5427, which is Energy and Water, be put in order behind the Agriculture \nbill, to be taken up after it. Otherwise, I would object, until we sit \ndown and talk and make sure that H.R. 5427 gets some position in the \nSenate before we are gone and find no way to take it up. Those in \nleadership know I have been talking to the leaders and others. So I am \nnot bringing anything up that is brand new. In these times, you don't \nknow what is going to come up. This is the best way to bring it up and \nnobody can say you didn't bring it up. I am bringing it up to whoever \nis supposed to have things brought up to them. I hope that is enough. \nThe distinguished leader is here. I wanted to put that in the Record so \nnobody had a misunderstanding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I notice the majority leader has returned \nto the floor. I tried to recount for our colleagues the status of our \ndiscussion, and the understanding that we had reached, that I would \nwithdraw my amendment from this bill with the understanding that we \nwould go to the Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow and have a \nchance to offer it there. All Senators' rights would be reserved. That \nis the status of it. I just ask if that is the majority leader's \nunderstanding. If it is, I will then be willing to withdraw my \namendment from the Military Construction bill and we can conclude that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the last hour or so we have had numerous \ndiscussions on the floor, as our colleagues have observed, and many \nparticipated in the discussion. My understanding and the general \nagreement that we have is to go to the Agriculture Appropriations bill \ntomorrow. That does facilitate the progress we need to make on the \ncurrent bill that is on the floor, which I hope and expect to be able \nto finish tonight. If that is the case, we plan on going to the \nAgriculture bill tomorrow. All rights will be reserved for all \nSenators, of course. We don't have an agreement, but that is the \nintention. The disaster ag relief bill is very important and has been \ntalked about by Republicans and Democrats and we expect to debate it \ntomorrow. It is a more appropriate place for this amendment. So I think \nthis is a good understanding.\n  Other bills, such as Energy and Water, we want to come to very soon. \nWe have a number of appropriation bills--10 of them--out there. I have \nnot talked to the Democratic leader specifically about the Energy and \nWater bill. I am not sure if the chairman has, but it is a bill that I \nhope we will be able to go to quickly, as well.\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished leader, \nif it is being asked of the Senate that we concur by unanimous consent \nthat the arrangement to bring up Agriculture in the method and manner \ndescribed, if that is going to be a UC, then I have to object because I \nwant to be treated fairly on a comparable bill.\n  If nothing else other than a simple sentence is added that says when \nthe Agriculture bill is completed that the next bill to be taken up \nwould be H.R. 5427, the Energy and Water appropriations bill, if that \nis part of the UC, I have no objection.\n  Mr. FRIST. I don't think there is a formal UC on the floor, but I \nhave to object to that only because as leader, I am going to have every \nchairman coming out putting bills in order. I want to be able to keep \nthat flexibility a bit, just as we have today, because if we don't \nreach some sort of agreement working together, we are not going to \nfinish even the first MILCON bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  What I can say is what I intend to do tomorrow--again without any UC; \nI guess we can write up something--is complete this bill that is on the \nfloor tonight and then tomorrow go to the Agriculture bill, finish that \nbill, and then very high on the list would be Energy and Water.\n  What I don't want to do is get in the overall sequencing of bills \nwhen I don't know how long this bill is going to take--hopefully \ntonight--or the Agriculture bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire--first, I thank the \nleader for his words, which appear to be accommodating and perhaps \nefficient at this moment. I am not sure, but I want to ask another \nquestion.\n  Mr. FRIST. I hope so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The leader is aware of an Agriculture amendment that \nhas rather broad support that we discussed today in the meetings and \nother Democrats have discussed with me which has to do with how manure \nand the like from cows and pigs is defined under the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. I want to \noffer that amendment on the Agriculture bill. Nothing is going to \npreclude that in what we have talked about, is it?\n  Mr. FRIST. No, all rights will be preserved for Senators as we go on \nthe Agriculture bill tomorrow. My understanding is the Senator from \nNorth Dakota will withdraw--in fact, why don't we go ahead and do that. \nThe pending amendment will be withdrawn, and we will proceed with the \nMILCON bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5144, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for being very \nconstructive. I thank my friend from New Mexico for his zealous \nguarding of the rights of his chairmanship of his committee. I \ncertainly recognize that position.\n  I think we have made significant progress. We can move to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill tomorrow. That is the place this \namendment ought to be. I only offered it on this bill because we had no \nprospect of going to the Agriculture appropriations bill any time this \nyear without this agreement.\n  I thank the majority leader. I thank very much the chairman of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, the very able Senator from \nUtah. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl. I very much thank \nthe chairman of this committee, the Senator from Texas, and the Senator \nfrom California, the ranking member, who have been so constructive \ntoday. And again, special thanks to my colleague Senator Dorgan for his \nassistance throughout.\n  I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the two Senators from North \nDakota. We have worked well together. I think we have come to the right \naccommodation. He has been a gentleman to work with, and I appreciate \nit.\n  I am now going to start clearing amendments with voice votes. They \nhave been cleared on both sides of the aisle. We have a couple of other \nsmall issues that need to be cleared. I hope by the time I finish, we \ncan go to final passage.\n  I ask Senator Brownback to come to the floor to work out his issue \nbecause we are about to go to final passage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5122\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5122 offered \nby Senator Stevens and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Stevens, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5122.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, we are now down to two amendments that \nwe are still clearing with the proper committees and one more that is \nstill not yet agreed to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand the chairman and ranking \nmember are trying to work out the final amendments on this bill, and \nthey have both done an excellent job in putting the Military \nConstruction bill together for the Nation. But also, while my colleague \nfrom Idaho is on the floor, Senator Craig, who is leading on the \nauthorization side, I wanted to come to the floor on behalf of the \npeople of Louisiana and the gulf coast, really, to thank the chair and \nranking member for putting in this MILCON bill, the Military \nConstruction appropriations bill, a full authorization for the veterans \nhospital that was destroyed or heavily damaged in Hurricane Katrina, \nand then, of course, flooded again in Hurricane Rita. Four hundred \nthousand veterans from Louisiana rely on this hospital, as well as \nhundreds of thousands from the gulf coast: Texas, Mississippi, and \nAlabama.\n  We have worked very hard to reestablish the veterans infrastructure \nalong the gulf coast. This has been extremely problematic because of \nsome tensions between several committees. But the good work of Senator \nHutchison from Texas and Senator Feinstein from California and, of \ncourse, Senator Craig's good help and support has helped us to get this \nauthorization done in this way. We are extremely grateful. It may be \nthe first public-private partnership in the Nation, or one of the \nearliest. We think it is going to be an excellent model of health care, \nnot only for our veterans but a real economic anchor, if you will, for \nthe revitalization of New Orleans and the gulf coast. We are looking \nforward to doing an excellent job with this money for the taxpayer and \nfor the veterans, who have come to rely on this hospital and the \nservices we provide as a lifeline, literally. Now they look at it as \nmore than just a place to go for health care; they look at it as a flag \nthat will be raised in the devastated part of New Orleans to rebuild \nthis great city and region. It has really become a symbol of hope, not \njust for veterans, which it always is, and their families, but now it \nhas become a symbol of hope for our whole community.\n  So I just wanted, while that is being worked out and other things are \nbeing worked out, to take this time to thank them and to tell them how \ngrateful we are in Louisiana and those in the New Orleans area for \ntheir help and support and for their confidence in moving this project \nforward. As a member of the committee, I have been very pleased to work \non this and have it accomplished in this way.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to announce for our colleagues \nthat it is our intention in the next 15 minutes to finish this bill and \ngo to final passage. We are intending to voice-vote final passage. \nHowever, we are still working out two amendments: an amendment by \nSenator Reid and an amendment by Senator Allen. I cannot say for sure \nthat there will not be a record vote on one of those amendments, but we \nare trying to avoid that. I will just say the disposition of the Reid \nand Allen amendments will be the last measures in this bill to be \nagreed to, and we will then go to final passage.\n\n  I would just tell my colleagues we are hoping not to have any more \nrollcall votes, but it is not totally clear yet. I hope to be able to \nfinish this by 7 o'clock. I will report back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5143\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5143 by \nSenator Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Allen, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5143.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I urge passage of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5143) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n         Yellowstone County National Veterans Cemetery Project\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is the distinguished Senator from California aware of the \nneed for a new veterans cemetery in Yellowstone County in Montana?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am aware that there is a need for more veterans \ncemeteries nationwide. I would be very interested in hearing about the \nsituation in Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In Montana, we have the highest percentage of veterans \nper capita of any State in the country. Yellowstone County has 17.5 \npercent of all of the State's veterans, and when added to the \nsurrounding counties, the greater Yellowstone area includes 25 percent \nof the State's veterans. The other national cemetery in the area--the \nLittle Bighorn National Cemetery--is full. Eastern Montana faces a \nsevere shortage in burial locations for Veterans.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What is being done to address this need?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On November 7 of this year the voters of Yellowstone \nCounty in my home State of Montana overwhelmingly approved a mill levy \nto provide $250,000 to the opening phase of the construction of the new \nYellowstone County National Veterans Cemetery. However, the local mill \nlevy only provides part of the funding needed and is to be used in \nconjunction with anticipated Federal funding as well as\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nprivate donations because the first phase of the project has a \npreliminary cost estimate of over $1 million for roads, irrigation, and \nsite improvements. Federal funds are needed for the project to begin. \nThis funding is very important to Montana because we are out of burial \nspace for our veterans. This new cemetery would provide burial spaces \nfor our veterans for the next 20 to 30 years.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I applaud the initiative of the residents of \nYellowstone County, and I can assure the distinguished Senator from \nMontana that I will work in conference on this bill to include language \nin the Statement of Managers directing the Secretary of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs to review the status and progress of the \nYellowstone County National Veterans Cemetery project and report his \nfindings back to Congress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate the commitment of my distinguished \ncolleague from California to the State of Montana's veterans.\n\n\n               Child Care Center at Beale Air Force Base\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss an issue of critical importance to the military families at \nBeale Air Force Base in Yuba City, CA.\n  The Child Development Center, CDC, at Beale Air Force Base is in dire \nneed of refurbishment. While the Beale community has gone to great \nlengths to ensure that the dependents of military personnel at Beale \nhave a safe place to be cared for and to learn, the reality is that the \nexisting CDC is woefully inadequate.\n  The existing structure which is approximately 40 years old is worn, \noutdated, and far too small. In fact, I understand that for over the \npast 5 years, the waiting list for placing students in the facility has \nnot dropped below 100 children.\n  To make matters worse, the CDC may even pose a potential health risk \nto children. Old and worn carpet cannot be replaced because doing so \nwould expose the children to asbestos. This is unacceptable.\n  Our men and women who are serving our country simply should not have \nto worry that their children are being exposed to hazardous material. \nWe owe them far more than that.\n  The Air Force has reached the conclusion that it will take $14 \nmillion to refurbish the Beale CDC. It is my understanding that funding \nto upgrade the CDC is included in the fiscal year Defense plan for \n2008. It is extremely important that this funding for the CDC be \nincluded in the President's budget request for 2008.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I share my home State colleague's concern for the \nChild Development Center at Beale. As the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, I, too, \nbelieve that it is critical to fund the CDC at Beale. The Air Force has \nincluded $14 million in its Future Years Defense Plan for fiscal year \n2008, which clearly indicates the Air Force intends to include this \nproject for funding in the President's budget request. I strongly urge \nthe Air Force to retain this project in its projection for funding in \nnext year's request.\n\n\n                 funding for blinded veterans' services\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as we consider legislation to fund the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2007, I want to briefly \ndiscuss the importance of providing adequate funding for blinded \nveterans' services.\n  Visual impairment or blindness is an increasingly frequent injury \namong our fighting men and women. In my visits to military hospitals, I \nhave seen firsthand the impact that these severe eye injuries can have \non the lives of our young men and women in uniform. While none of them \never complains, the sacrifice they have made for their country is \nstarkly evident, and we owe it to them to ensure they are taken care of \nwhen they return home.\n  The good news is that VA's Blind Rehabilitative Service is a global \nleader in providing comprehensive blind rehabilitation to America's \nblinded veterans, and the care available from the Nation's 10 Blind \nRehabilitation Centers is dependable and effective. The bad news is \nthat, while these 10 rehabilitation centers provide inpatient care \neffectively and efficiently, that is not always the case at other VA \nmedical centers across the country.\n  The VA Medical Center in Denver, CO, treats approximately 900 blinded \nveterans, many of whom require rehabilitative services that the Denver \nfacility cannot provide. Instead, those men and women must travel to \nTucson, AZ, or even farther to the American Lake Blind Center in \nWashington State to receive the care they have earned. The problem is \nnot limited to my State of Colorado; VA's own analysis in April 2005 \nfound that 78 VA medical centers currently do not have any basic \nexisting outpatient blind rehabilitative services.\n  I am glad that, in its budget request for fiscal year 2007, the VA \nprovided an increase in its line item for blind services of $5.4 \nmillion over last year. However, I am concerned that with growing \nmedical costs and the rising numbers of service members returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan with severe eye injuries, such an increase is not \nenough.\n  Walter Reed Army Medical Center recently reported to the Veterans \nHealth Administration that, between March 2003 and April 2006, 16 \npercent of all service members evacuated from the war in Iraq had eye \ninjuries, and of the 1,800 service members wounded with traumatic brain \njury, 19 percent experienced post trauma visual Syndrome, PTVS, with \nneurological visual impairments requiring long-term specialized care. \nIt is clear from these figures that the VA workload with respect to \nlow-vision and blinded veterans is going to increase in coming years, \non top of the already aging population of veterans with blindness.\n  The strong report language contained in this legislation, which \ndirects the VA to begin implementing a plan to expand more outpatient \nblind rehabilitation services and training and directs the VA to report \nback to Congress on the status of these efforts, is a good start. I am \ngrateful to Chairwoman Hutchison and Ranking Member Feinstein and their \nstaffs for their work in this area and hope we can work together to \nbuild on these efforts to ensure adequate funding for blinded veterans' \nservices in years to come.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Salazar for his \ndedication to our Nation's veterans and to the effort to provide \ncomprehensive care to blinded veterans in particular. I certainly \nunderstand the devastating impact that severe eye injuries have on the \nlives of service men and women returning from combat and agree we must \nwork to ensure that our efforts in Congress keep pace with the rising \ncosts of providing care to these men and women and with the growing \nnumbers of service members returning home in need of such care.\n  The language contained in this report is strong, and I am confident \nit will help to push the VA in the right direction as we strive to \nprovide care for blinded veterans in the most comprehensive and \nefficient way possible. I remain committed to that effort and to \nworking with my colleagues in both parties to see that blinded veterans \nreceive the best services our government can provide.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, again, I thank the chair and the ranking \nmember for their leadership on this legislation and look forward to \nworking closely with both of them on behalf of our Nation's blinded \nveterans.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I support the Smith and Burns amendments \nand take just a few minutes to address both issues which are truly an \nemergency.\n  First, Mr. Smith has filed an amendment to extend the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act for 1 year. Without a one \nyear extension, the 780 counties that benefit from the Act will face \ndifficult funding decisions regarding the next school year. This act \nexpired September 30th of this year and the last payment is in the \nprocess of being made. Without this funding, school districts will have \nto decide what programs should be cut in order to make ends meet. For \nmany districts this will include the decision of which schools to keep \nopen and which schools to close. We are about to experience an \nemergency in our schools if funding is not addressed.\n  The act has been an enormous success in achieving and even surpassing \nthe goals of Congress. This act has restored programs for students in \nrural schools and prevented the closure of numerous isolated rural \nschools. It has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural \nschool students with educational opportunities comparable to\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\nsuburban and urban students. Over 4,400 rural schools receive funds \nbecause of this act.\n  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts and county road \ndepartments to address the severe maintenance backlog. Snow removal has \nbeen restored for citizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have \nbeen upgraded and replaced and culverts that are hazardous to fish \npassage have been upgraded and replaced.\n  The legacy of this act over the last few years is positive and \nsubstantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit \nthe forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute to \nimproving the health of our national forests.\n  If we do not work to reauthorize this act, all of the progress of the \nlast years will be lost. Schools in timber dependant communities will \nlose a substantial part of their funding. These school districts will \nhave to start making tough budget decisions such as keeping or \ncanceling after school programs, sports programs, music programs, and \ntrying to determine what is the basic educational needs of our \nchildren. Next, counties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so \nthat only the essential services of the county are met because that is \nall they will be able to afford.\n  Thirty of our colleagues, have joined Senator Wyden and me in \nrecognizing the importance of the reauthorization of this Act by \ncosponsoring S. 267.\n  Next, Mr. Burns' has filed an amendment addressing wildfire \nsuppression funding. As we all know, this has been an extraordinary \nyear with 89,524 fires on 9.5 million acres of land across the country \nto date. Indeed, this has been the worst fire season on record in terms \nof acres burned. By way of comparison, the 10-year average projection \nfor fiscal year 2006 was 60,726 fires on 4.9 million acres, or about \nhalf of what is likely to burn for this year.\n  Due to the severity of this year's fire season, the Forest Service \nand Department of the Interior, DOI, will exhaust their appropriated \nfunds for wildfire suppression before the end of this fiscal year which \nwill force them to borrow from nonfire program accounts. Additional \nfunds are needed to repay these borrowed funds or these agencies will \nface serious disruptions to critical programs. When borrowing from non-\nfire program accounts occurs, it causes numerous project delays and \ncancellations, strained relationships with state and local agency \npartners, and disruptions in essential program management efforts. \nFrequently, these cancellations and delays increase costs and the time \nneeded to complete the projects. Again, we need to address this \nemergency before it causes significant havoc for our public lands.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in July the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee approved the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill. As a member of the committee, I \nsupported this measure, and it is now being considered by the full \nSenate.\n  The bill provides a total of $94.3 billion in spending, including \nfunding to make a number of critical upgrades to our military \ninfrastructure. As a member of the appropriations subcommittee that has \noversight on military construction, I was able to use my position to \nensure that $23.4 million was included for three military construction \nprojects in South Dakota.\n  Investing in our military infrastructure ensures that our military \npersonnel have the tools they need to perform their mission. This bill \nprovides $7.5 million to construct a new base civil engineer \nmaintenance complex for the South Dakota Air National Guard at Joe Foss \nField. This funding is necessary because the current complex is \nundersized and inadequate. The new facility will help the 114th Fighter \nWing maintain a combat-ready force of civil engineers.\n  In addition to this infrastructure upgrade, Ellsworth Air Force Base \nwill receive $3 million to install an urgently needed base water well. \nLikewise, a new Armed Forces Reserve Center will be constructed in \nSioux Falls. Currently Army Reserve and Navy Reserve operations are \nhoused in leased facilities that are over 40 years old. The new center \nwill consolidate all operations into a new complex.\n  The bill also includes nearly $78 billion for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, which is $6.45 billion above last year's funding \nlevel. This amount includes $28.7 billion for medical services--an \nincrease of $3 billion from last year.\n  Most importantly, the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected \nPresident Bush's budget proposal to implement a $250 annual enrollment \nfee and increased pharmacy copayments for category 7 and 8 veterans. \nThese fees are designed to generate revenue in order to help offset VA \nexpenditures. In reality, they may force veterans to seek health care \nelsewhere because they cannot afford either the annual enrollment fees \nor the increased copayment costs.\n  Rather than relying on budget proposals aimed at driving veterans out \nof the VA in order to save money, I am pleased that the Senate opposed \nPresident Bush's proposal. I firmly believe that we should provide \nadequate funding to ensure all those who have defended our country \nreceive the health care they have earned and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I continue to have deep concerns about the spending \npriorities of the Bush administration, but I do believe this bill will \nhelp provide our service members with top-notch military facilities. \nAnd while we can always do more for our veterans, this bill is a step \nin the right direction toward honoring our commitment to all those who \nserved.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill because of its \ncommitment to VA health care as well as its support of vital and \nnecessary military facilities in the State of Colorado.\n  I am pleased that this bill increases funding to essential programs \nthat maintain and improve the quality of life for our veterans. It \nimportant to note that this is the sixth consecutive year that Congress \nhas increased funding for veterans health care programs. This year the \ncommittee recommends that Veterans Health Administration be \nappropriated at $32.67 billon, which is a $3.32 billion increase over \nlast year's level.\n  Furthermore, I would like to commend the committee for maintaining \ntheir commitment to Capital Asset Realignment Enhanced Services, CARES, \nprocess. CARES is the most comprehensive analysis of the VA's health \ncare infrastructure that has ever been conducted and is important in \nprioritizing the VA's budget. Specifically, I am especially pleased \nwith the committee's recommendation of $52 million for a replacement \nhospital in Denver, CO.\n  The current Denver VA hospital was built more than 50 years ago and \nmedical technology has far surpassed what the builders of the Denver VA \noriginally envisioned. While I cannot say enough about the care and \nservice our veterans receive at the current facility, many changes and \nimprovements can and should be made, and a new facility is the only way \nto accomplish these goals.\n  The construction plans present credible proof that a new Fitzsimons \nfacility will increase healthcare quality and quantity for our \nveterans. It is my hope, and it is a likely one, that a new hospital \nwill also serve as a regional beacon for modern veteran medical care \nscience and will fill an important void for the large number of \nveterans in Colorado.\n  I would like to acknowledge the recommendation of $161 million for \nthe National Cemetery Administration, which saw an increase of $4.1 \nmillion over the fiscal year 2006 level. Specifically, I am pleased the \ncommittee recognizes the need for a VA cemetery in the Pikes Peak \nregion of southern Colorado. This area is home to over 125,000 \nveterans, and would be well served by a national cemetery.\n  Additionally, I support portions of this appropriations bill that \nrecommend $50.1 million for necessary military construction \nimprovements at Fort Carson, and an additional $130.6 million for \nprojects in Colorado.\n  Specifically at Fort Carson, this bill recommends funds for the \ncompletion of phase 2 of the airfield arrival/departure complex as well \nas funds for the Special Operations Complex. Fort Carson, known as the \nMountain Post, plays an essential role for the Army.\n  I am also pleased at the committee's recommendation that directs the \nU.S. Air Force to submit a master infrastructure recapitalization plan \nfor the\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\nU.S. Air Force Academy facilities. This plan will begin the process of \nupdating and improving necessary infrastructure concerns. As the \nAcademy enters its sixth decade of operation, these important \nimprovements will better enable the Academy to fulfill its mission of \neducation, training and equipping cadets.\n  Other projects in Colorado funded by this bill includes funds for the \nSpace Test and Evaluation Facility at Schriever Air Force Base, \ncontinued construction at the Pueblo Chemical Weapons Depot, $10.7 \nmillion for a consolidated fuels facility at Buckley AFB and $7 million \nfor the Air National Guard F-16 Fighter Squadron Operations Center, \nalso at Buckley AFB. These projects are vital to the continued success \nof our military at all levels.\n  I urge the Senate to expeditiously pass this bill in order to send it \nto the President's desk as soon as possible. I would also like to thank \nChairwoman Hutchison for her leadership and diligence on this committee \nover the years and look forward to continuing to work with her in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Senate \nconcerning the legislation before us, the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. This bill is \nparticularly important in this time of ongoing war, structural changes \nin the force, and an aging veteran population. The committee has worked \nto produce a bill that, while imperfect, addresses many of the issues \nthat challenge our armed services and veterans, and I thank them for \ntheir work.\n  America remains at war, a war that continues to unite Americans in \npursuit of a common goal--to defeat terrorism. Americans have and will \ncontinue to make sacrifices for this war. Our service men and women in \nparticular are truly on the front lines in this war, separated from \ntheir families, risking their lives, and working extraordinarily long \nhours under the most difficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious \nbut necessary task their country has set for them.\n  It is important that we understand the context of this year's \nmilitary construction legislation. Three processes are playing out \nsimultaneously that require reasoned and appropriate congressional \naction on this bill. First, America's struggle for peace in Iraq \ncontinues. Second, our largest service, the Army, is undertaking \nsignificant structural changes and redeploying thousands of troops. \nThird, the recent round of base realignment and closure that \nstreamlined the defense infrastructure is now being implemented. These \nthree issues have defined the requirements of the legislation before \nus. The committee has recognized the challenges and outlined military \nconstruction spending that, in large part, meets them.\n  I am pleased to note that the Appropriations Committee has met the \nspending level requested by the administration for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. This is particularly important in light of the \ngrowing numbers of young veterans who look to the VA for care. To date \nmore than 184,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have sought care \nthrough the VA. Of that number, 30,000 have been found to exhibit \nsymptoms similar to post-traumatic stress or PTSD, and I applaud the \ncommittee's support for PTSD programs and funding. This legislation \nalso provides $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for \nfiscal year 2007, nearly equivalent to the President's request.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for her \nwillingness to work with the Senate Armed Services Committee, SASC, to \nensure this bill generally funds MILCON projects consistent with the \nauthorizing committee's views. The chairman has always made a \nconsiderable effort to work with the authorizers to mitigate \ndifferences in the defense funding and authorizing bills.\n  In particular, I appreciate the chairman's efforts to remove an \nunrequested and unauthorized MILCON project for Lackland Air Force Base \nafter I brought my concerns to her attention. That project was not \nrequested by the administration, nor is it listed in the Air Force's \nUnfunded Priority List, UPL. It was added only after the Air Force \nChief of Staff sought the funding outside the regular process, without \nthe concurrence of DOD or OMB and without any notification to or \nfeedback from the authorizing committees.\n\n  When the authoring committees finally learned about this project, we \nhad already completed committee markups and passed Defense \nauthorization bills in both chambers. The authorizing committees \nrefused to add an out-of-scope provision into the final conference \nreport to authorize this Air Force earmark, and as such, the chairman \nhas since agreed to remove it from the pending bill in a manager's \namendment on the Senate floor.\n  I wanted to spend time on the Senate floor to highlight this Air \nForce MILCON earmark because it demonstrates how authorizers and \nappropriators can and should work together. While ideally the provision \nwould never have been included in the bill since it wasn't requested, \nthe chairman was more than willing to listen to my concerns as an \nauthorizer, and she acted most appropriately by agreeing to remove the \nearmark. Again, I thank Senator Hutchison for her steadfast leadership \nand accommodation of the authorization committees' wishes.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us is not entirely free of earmarks. I \nam concerned that, while this bill is some $434 million below the \nadministration's request, it nonetheless recommends almost $90 million \nin unrequested spending that is directed at unauthorized projects. \nWhile I recognize that many of the earmarks added to this legislation \nmay sound worthwhile, they do not belong in the bill or its report. \nNeedless to say, it is distressing that in this time of fiscal \nconstraints, lawmakers continue to earmark military funds while \nunderfunding the President's overall request.\n  Let me mention a few examples of money earmarked in the committee \nreport for specific projects that were not requested by the Department \nof Defense: $1.5 million for a general instruction building in Fort \nLewis, WA; $1.5 million for officer's quarters in Ravenna, OH; $1.5 \nmillion for a dining facility at Camp Roberts in San Miguel, CA; $3.4 \nmillion for an Aviation Readiness Center at Helena Regional Airport, \nMT; $1.4 million for an engine shop in Fort Worth, TX; $900,000 for an \ninformation technology complex at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH; and $2.0 \nmillion for a regional training institute in West Virginia.\n  Almost all the earmarked money will go to the States represented by \nmembers of the committee. These examples are only part of the nearly \n$60 million in unrequested earmarks that siphon funds away from \nimportant programs needed for enhancing our warfighting capability. \nThis means that the armed services have come to us with urgent needs, \nand we have responded by giving them less than what they asked for \nwhile requiring that they spend it to suit our parochial needs rather \nthan military necessity.\n  The problems facing our active and retired veterans, whether in the \nform of force structure or modernization or enhancing quality of life \nbenefits, are properly addressed in a deliberative budget process. \nHowever, we should think twice before diverting money away from \nmilitary necessities to fund home State projects. The American taxpayer \nexpects more of us, as do our brave service men and women who are \nfighting this war on global terrorism on our behalf.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are now ready to go to final \npassage. I ask for a voice vote on passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 5385), as amended, was passed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the title \namendment be agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       An Act making appropriations for Military Construction and \n     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think that finalizes the bill, the \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations bill for 2007. I thank all of my colleagues for their \ncooperation and patience, especially my colleague, Senator Feinstein, \nmy ranking member who has been such a great colleague to work with on \nthis bill. Her staff and my staff have done an incredible job. I \nappreciate this opportunity and look forward to going to conference and \nhaving our military personnel be housed and have the equipment that is \nin the Military Construction bill which they so readily deserve.\n  Especially, I have to say that funding the veterans and their needs \nis a special privilege for all of us because we have young men and \nwomen coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan as we speak with injuries \nthat we want to assure are cared for and healed, and where necessary \nthat we have the rehabilitation which they so richly deserve.\n  I think we have done a good job of covering these needs. I am very \npleased that we have taken one more step to finalize this bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I might, I thank the chairman, my \nfriend, the Senator from Texas. We usually have a very easy time with \nthis bill. There are usually not many amendments to this bill. But \nperhaps because this is the first vehicle to move a number of items, \nthey seemed to come up this afternoon. I think the chairman has shown \ngreat leadership and flexibility. Sometimes they go together and \nsometimes they do not, but she has possessed both today.\n  I am very grateful, and the Democratic side is very grateful for it \nas well. This is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It takes good \ncare of veterans. It eliminates the problem of financing that we had \nlast year. Overall, it is an excellent bill. I am very proud to have \nworked with the chairman. I thank her.\n  I thank the majority staff. And, of course, I thank my staff, of \nwhich Christina Evans is sitting on my left, and B.G. Wright and Chad \nSchulken back in the box.\n  It has been a good day. At least we have accomplished a substantial \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sourivong\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I ask that the Senate join me in \npaying tribute to SGT Kampha Sourivong, who made the ultimate sacrifice \nwhile protecting freedom. Sergeant Sourivong, of Iowa City, IA, was \nassigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry Regiment, 34th \nInfantry Division, Army National Guard, based out of Iowa Falls, IA. He \nwas mobilized for Operation Iraqi Freedom with the unit in September \n2005 and arrived in Iraq in early May 2006. He died at the age of 20, \non September 30, 2006, in Al Asad, Iraq, when his military vehicle \nencountered small arms fire.\n  Sergeant Sourivong will be posthumously awarded the following awards \nand decorations for his heroic service: the Bronze Star, the Purple \nHeart, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with Mobilization device, the \nArmy Good Conduct Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army \nService Ribbon, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\n  My thoughts and prayers have been with Sergeant Sourivong's parents, \nPatty and Maliphone Sourivong, his brother and sister, and all those \nother family and friends who are grieving the loss of this young man. \nThe Sourivong family described Kampha as ``a very caring person'' who \n``had a lot of friends, loved his family, loved his brother and loved \nhis sister'' and someone who ``would give the shirt off his back to \nsomeone in need.''\n  I am grateful for the sacrifice that both Sergeant Sourivong and his \nfamily have made. Our Nation will forever be in their debt. While the \ntragic loss of this young American is deeply saddening, he will be \nremembered proudly as the hero that he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10908-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10908-S10909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING CONGRESSWOMAN HELEN CHENOWETH-HAGE\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in recent weeks, many of our thoughts have \nbeen turned to Helen Chenoweth-Hage, her memory, and her family.\n  As you know, Helen was laid to rest in October after a tragic \nautomobile accident took her life. We honor and remember this \nremarkable woman, and I feel privileged to share with you some of my \nmemories and thoughts about her and the time that we served together in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives.\n  There will never be another public servant in Idaho like Helen. I \nserved alongside her in the House of Representatives and worked on many \nissues with her, from fighting Federal mandates in north Idaho to \nfighting for our military at Mountain Home Air Force Base and Gowen \nField in Boise. She stood firm in her convictions and beliefs, honoring \nthe promises she made to those who put her in office. Helen knew, \nwithout a doubt, what she believed in, and she lived those beliefs in \nword and deed unwaveringly.\n  She worked very hard to make sure she had an understanding of what \nwas at stake. When she started her congressional career in 1995, she \nread every piece of legislation that was coming up for a vote on the \nHouse floor. She felt she owed it to those who sent her to Congress. \nShe surprised more than a few committee chairmen by showing up at \nhearings being held by committees she didn't serve on, simply because \nof her desire to know more and understand an issue.\n  One of her most-oft repeated matras was ``Love many, trust few, and \npaddle your own canoe.'' And that is exactly what she did--she was not \nsomeone who would check the wind before deciding what to do. She \nlistened, asked questions, read documents, studied the issues, and \ntalked with experts and plain folks. She took all that information she \ngathered and then made her decision. At her center was a very \nprincipled, gracious woman--one who was strong in her beliefs and kind \nto all those around her, regardless of theirs. In many ways, she \nmirrored the principled center many of us admire about President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Idahoans have lost a true champion for smaller government and \npersonal freedoms. Helen brought Idaho into the national spotlight. She \nstood tough on the issues and spoke out often, even after she left the \nHouse of Representatives in 2001. She could always be counted on to \ncall out hypocrisy in government and placed her reputation on the line \nmany times to hold to her beliefs on what was best for Idahoans.\n  Perhaps the best way to remember Helen is to quote her own words in \nan interview done with Reason Magazine in October 2000. When the \nreporter asked how she would like to be remembered, this is what she \nsaid:\n\n       That I have been true to real Republican principles. It's \n     been people like Tom Coburn, Mark Sanford, and myself who \n     have constantly said, `Let's not forget who we are and why we \n     are here.' And that is to protect individual rights, American \n     sovereignty, and private property. If there is not a force of \n     law and justice to protect private property, then we have \n     lost the basis of our freedoms.\n\n  She said something else in that interview that strikes a resonant \nchord with me, in particular. When asked what the greatest threat to \nAmerican Liberty was, she said:\n\n       Too much federal and state government. The lack of respect \n     of people working in government for individuals. An idea that \n     certain people who occupy powerful positions in the \n     administration can make better decisions about an individual \n     and their life choices than can that individual.\n\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n\n  Helen will always be remembered as a champion of the individual--the \nrugged, self-reliant American that is in all of us--and I thank her for \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10909-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10909-S10910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BOB DOLE ON GEORGE McGOVERN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, civility is alive and well in the great \nState of South Dakota.\n  During the recess, there was an extraordinary, bipartisan celebration \nhonoring our former colleague, Senator George McGovern. The occasion \nwas the dedication of the George and Eleanor McGovern Library at Dakota \nWesleyan University in Mitchell, SD.\n  The dedication brought together former President Bill Clinton, former \nmajority leader Bob Dole, former majority leader Tom Daschle, Senator \nJohn Thune, Representative Stephanie Herseth, Governor Mike Rounds, and \n5,000 of Senator McGovern's closest friends and admirers.\n  Governor Rounds noted that Senator McGovern was a ``patriot'' and \nthat ``all of us gathered here today have a whole lot more in common \nthan what divides us as Americans.'' Senator Thune noted that his \nfather always voted for George McGovern, even as the children urged him \nto vote Republican, because George was a decorated WWII fighter pilot. \nPerhaps it was Senator Dole, with his characteristic humor, who best \ncaptured the significance of Senator McGovern's inspiring career.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Senator Dole be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you very much for that generous introduction, and for \n     the honor of receiving the first McGovern Prize for \n     Leadership and Public Service. It is something that I will \n     cherish, not least of all because of its namesakes who have \n     set the standard--in friendship as well as in leadership. \n     This week's events remind us once again that George McGovern \n     is a uniter and not a divider. Who else could bring together \n     Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Al Neuharth, Tom Daschle, John Thune, \n     and Peter, Paul and Mary?\n       As you know, at times George and I have had our political \n     differences. Though not the differences you might think. For \n     example, here at Wesleyan he was twice elected president of \n     his class. I have yet to be elected president of anything--\n     though I'm thinking of running against Bill Clinton for \n     president of the Senate spouses.\n       For me tonight is both an opportunity to salute an old \n     friend, and to repay an old debt. You see, three years ago \n     George came to the dedication of the Dole Institute of \n     Politics at the University of Kansas. What he said about me \n     then more than made up for what he said about me when I ran \n     for President in 1980, 1988 and 1996. So I figured the least \n     I could do was to return the favor, and make up for what I \n     said about him, when he ran for President in 1968--and 1972--\n     and 1984.\n       I've long since accommodated myself to a career pitching \n     Pepsi and other stimulants. And George has happily resigned \n     himself to the fact that the only presidents in South Dakota \n     are on Mount Rushmore. At our stage of life we both adhere to \n     the wisdom of W.C. Fields, who expressed his philosophy as \n     follows: If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again. Then \n     give up. No use being a damn fool about it.\n       Of course, in all that truly matters, George has never \n     given up. Neither has his beloved Eleanor. Sixty-six years \n     after they enrolled as undergraduates on this campus, sixty-\n     three years after they declared their marriage vows, the \n     McGoverns of Mitchell are still making a difference, still \n     living every day in the spirit of this school's motto: \n     sacrifice or service.\n       Having been both a candidate and a candidate's spouse, I \n     speak from experience when I say that for spouses it isn't \n     sacrifice or service, it's sacrifice and service. But then \n     Eleanor McGovern has always been a leader and humanitarian in \n     her own right. What ever else you can say about us, it's \n     pretty clear that both George and I married above ourselves.\n       That's not all we have in common. ``There is a \n     wholesomeness about life in a rural state. . .life tends to \n     be more authentic and less artificial.'' The words are \n     George's but the sentiment applies as much to Russell, Kansas \n     as to Mitchell, South Dakota. We both can attest to the fact \n     that small towns nurture large dreams, and a generosity \n     unbounded as the Great Plains. Generosity is what this \n     evening's all about--the generosity of donors, and of those \n     who seek their donations. I want to congratulate Ambassador \n     Kimmelman and President Duffett as well as the trustees and \n     the campaign committee and every single individual whose \n     generosity has helped to realize a dream called the McGovern \n     Library and Center for Leadership and Public Service.\n       Since we're all being so generous, maybe george would let \n     me borrow his fundraising team. We could use your help at KU. \n     I can't imagine a more appropriate tribute to the McGoverns \n     than a library, and not just because George taught here at \n     Wesleyan before he put classroom theory to the test in a \n     public career that spans half a century. In fact, he and \n     Eleanor are both educators at heart. They understand, for \n     they personify, the essential truth of education--that so \n     long as books are kept open, then minds can never be closed. \n     In years to come, this place will be an incubator of informed \n     Citizenship. What more could any teacher ask for?\n       Generosity takes many forms. In the case of the McGoverns, \n     it means a lifetime of principled service, and a personal \n     decency that transcends any party label. I'm tempted to say \n     it transcends generations as well. It has been said by this \n     state's second most famous son, Tom Brokaw, that George and I \n     belong to the greatest generation. Actually, we were fairly \n     average americans, who suddenly found ourselves caught up in \n     the historical whirlwind--a tornado as random and \n     devastating as any that slashed across the prairies of my \n     youth.\n       If we were prepared for the curve balls that came our way, \n     it was only because of the values passed on to us by pioneers \n     and parents who had confronted more than their share of \n     challenges. When hard times engulfed the American farmer like \n     a Kansas dust storm, we clung all the tighter to our \n     neighbors. I don't know about George, but my own commitment \n     to feeding the hungry is rooted in those distant days when \n     millions of Americans struggled to put food on the table. \n     Hunger is bipartisan. So is compassion.\n       It wasn't only economic democracy that was called into \n     question during those bleak years. Also on the line was the \n     idea--enshrined in places like Mitchell and Russell--that \n     every life is precious because every human is created with a \n     plan and a purpose. The great test of our time was moral as \n     well as military. It was met by 16 million citizen soldiers, \n     backed by millions more on the home front. All of them heroes \n     in the age old struggle for popular government.\n       The word hero gets thrown around a lot. It's a lot easier \n     to be a hero if someone is shooting at you, as happened to me \n     on an Italian hillside--or attempting to shoot down your \n     plane, as George will recall from 35 missions with his fellow \n     B-24 bomber pilots. Nor was it any accident that he named his \n     plane the Dakota Queen--for the young bride to whom he would \n     return after the war, with a Distinguished Flying Cross \n     pinned to his uniform. When in another context George said, \n     ``Come home, America,'' I think it was that America to which \n     he referred--a country that in every generation has produced \n     heroes, and is, in turn, a land fit for heroes to come home \n     to.\n       In this America we fight as one, though we vote and pray \n     and speak as many. One of the unfortunate aspects of modern \n     politics is our tendency to label, dehumanize and even \n     demonize opponents who are, after all, opponents--not \n     enemies. George McGovern is a leader, not a label. The man we \n     honor this evening is a proud liberal who nevertheless found \n     much to admire in such common sense conservatives as Bob Taft \n     and Barry Goldwater. A Methodist preacher's son, raised in a \n     republican household, he cast his first vote for Henry \n     Wallace. As a young activist he was spellbound by the \n     eloquence of Adlai Stevenson. But in later years he would \n     praise my hero, Dwight Eisenhower, for his statesmanship and \n     restraint while in the White House.\n       George got to Congress ahead of me. By the time we served \n     in the Senate, it's a safe bet that our votes usually \n     cancelled each other out. As fate would have it, I was \n     Republican national chairman in 1972, the year George ran \n     against President Nixon. In politics, as earlier, I tried to \n     be a good soldier. but there are times when party loyalty \n     asks too much. More than once I returned speech drafts \n     objecting to the official line against the Democratic nominee \n     for President. By election day, I think I had upset more \n     people around the White House than George did. enough, \n     anyway, so that I became expendable once the votes were \n     counted.\n       Come to think of it, George, there's another thing we have \n     in common. We were both left unemployed by the Nixon White \n     House.\n       If ever a candidate was entitled to nurse a grudge, it was \n     George McGovern. Except no man I know is less inclined to \n     waste time or energy in holding grudges. His generosity of \n     spirit extended to the man who defeated him in 1972. I will \n     never forget a day in June, 1993, when we buried Pat Nixon in \n     the rose gardens at the Nixon Library and birthplace. After \n     the formal service concluded, we were invited inside--away \n     from the prying eye of television--so that President Nixon \n     could deliver a tribute of his own to his wife of fifty-three \n     years. Among other things, he spoke of the joys of \n     grandparenting, describing what happened when their youngest \n     granddaughter, Jennie, asked Mrs. Nixon how she wished to be \n     addressed.\n       After rejecting ``grandmother'' as too formal, and \n     ``grandma'' as a bit too elderly for her liking, Pat \n     suggested to the little girl that she call her ``Ma.'' Jennie \n     then put the same question to her famous grandfather. To \n     which he replied, ``Oh, you can call me anything, Jennie, \n     because I've been called everything.'' At that moment I \n     wasn't the only person in the room who was struggling to \n     control his emotions. Not twenty feet from Nixon stood \n     George, dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief.\n       Later that day, a reporter approached him, curious to know \n     why he was there. George\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n     replied that he had always admired Mrs. Nixon, and wished to \n     honor her memory. The reporter persisted. Why should he honor \n     the wife of the man whose alleged dirty tricks may have \n     denied him the White House?\n       And you know what George told him? In what may be the \n     classiest remark I've ever heard, George looked him straight \n     in the eye and said, ``You can't keep on campaigning \n     forever.''\n       Four years later I had my own taste of defeat, following a \n     hard fought campaign as President Ford's running mate. When \n     it was over, I got some bracing advice from Hubert Humphrey--\n     yet another proud son of South Dakota who knew what it felt \n     like to lose a close one. Hubert, like George, had a gift for \n     bipartisan friendship that made him a genuinely beloved \n     figure in the Senate. We worked closely on issues dealing \n     with agriculture and nutrition. He was promoting Minnesota \n     dairy farmers, and I was pushing Kansas wheat, but we shared \n     a common vision--the same vision with which George McGovern \n     gave life to President Kennedy's Food for Peace Program--with \n     which he inspired school lunch programs and food stamps and \n     which, even now, underlies his dream of a world in which no \n     child goes to bed hungry.\n       George and Eleanor call this the third freedom. They have \n     even set a deadline of 2030 by which they hope to banish \n     hunger around the globe. To some this may seem impossibly \n     visionary. Not to the McGoverns. ``People call me an \n     idealist,'' Woodrow Wilson once said. ``Well, that is how I \n     know I am an American.''\n       Is it idealistic to insist, as George and I do, that school \n     children deserve not only a square lunch, but breakfast as \n     well? Is it idealistic to demand that the children of low \n     income and working families have the same access to basic \n     nutrition as their well-heeled classmates? Is it idealistic \n     to want to share American's bounty with hungry children in \n     other lands--to feed their bodies out of our abundance, to \n     demonstrate that the freedom we cherish is not the freedom to \n     starve, but the freedom to soar.\n       Is that idealistic--or just plain American? Here in the \n     Heartland our ideals and our interests are inseparable. To us \n     freedom is a theory, a mere abstraction, unless it improves \n     the quality of life for those who are set free. Earlier I \n     mentioned Mount Rushmore. One of the four Presidents \n     enshrined there is Theodore Roosevelt. One hundred years ago \n     TR professed horror when told of Americans who, when \n     traveling abroad, apologetically asked their foreign hosts to \n     refrain from judging the United States based on its \n     politicians.\n       But they must judge his country by the actions of its \n     politicians, said TR. Was that idealistic? Or was it simply \n     the old rugged faith in the ability of so-called ordinary men \n     and women to govern themselves? It is easy to be cynical \n     about modern day politics. But the easy course will never fix \n     what is broken. In America, government is nothing if it is \n     not self-government. For in the mirror of democracy we see \n     reflected back to us both our noblest, and our meanest, \n     attributes. It is the purpose of this college to promote the \n     best that we can be. It is the goal of the McGovern Center to \n     foster service before self. And it is the hope of America \n     that our politics can be as decent as our people--that \n     civility need never be confused with weakness--nor compromise \n     with surrender.\n       When we come home to this America, we will fulfill the \n     promise of our birth. We will create a legacy to inspire \n     generations yet unborn. And we will uphold the McGovern \n     tradition of idealistic leadership--for that is how we know \n     we are Americans.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10910-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEROICS OF ALAN JOHNSTON\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize with \nthe highest esteem Mr. Alan Johnston of Windsor, ME, for the tremendous \ncourage and enormous valor he demonstrated in Iraq in 2004 that helped \nsave many lives.\n  CPT Aaron P. Hill of the U.S. Marine Corps recounted in a witness \nstatement that Alan Johnston's heroic actions on August 7, 2004, had he \nbeen in military uniform, would have earned him a medal. Mr. Johnston, \na civilian contractor who was overseeing construction of two medical \nclinics in Iraq, acted swiftly and selflessly to rescue others during a \nsuicide attack on the headquarters facility at the Al Kasik Military \nBase located approximately 35 miles northwest of Mosul, Iraq.\n  Captain Hill was part of a unit advising Iraqi soldiers in Northern \nIraq. He credits Mr. Johnston with saving a number of lives after \ninsurgents drove two water trucks packed with as many as 8,000 pounds \nof explosives to the headquarters building. The blasts from this \ninsurgent attack lasted over 90 minutes and destroyed the 2-level \nheadquarters building, resulting in 14 deaths and an estimated 40 \nseverely to critically injured people.\n  Acting without hesitation, Mr. Johnston sounded the alarm, throwing \nthose around him to the floor, saving many lives. In the devastation \nthat followed, acting with total disregard to his own safety, Mr. \nJohnston emerged from the wreckage and began to assist in evacuating \nand treating the survivors. Despite the continuing barrage of mortars \nand rockets, Mr. Johnston continued to offer help with his medical \nexpertise, calm demeanor, and steadfast devotion to helping his fellow \nman.\n  Mr. Johnston not only reduced casualties and treated the wounded but \nrestored critical support systems, including power and water. He also \nhelped to find ways to feed the thousands of Iraqi soldiers dependent \non the American military for support.\n  Alan Johnston, a 6-year veteran of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nand an emergency medical technician for nearly 18 years, suffered \ninjuries to his head and leg but treated himself and remained at the \nbase in Iraq for 3 months after the attack. He left Iraq in December of \n2004 and underwent another series of leg surgeries once he returned to \nthe United States.\n  As a result of Captain Hill's eyewitness account of Alan Johnston's \nactions, last month I had the solemn privilege of pinning the Defense \nof Freedom Medal on Mr. Johnston's lapel at a medal ceremony held at my \nAugusta, ME, office with Mr. Johnston's family present, officially \nacknowledging these courageous actions. This award is a rare and unique \ncommendation issued only to civilians and is equivalent to the Purple \nHeart awarded to military service men and women.\n  But what is most remarkable is that this occasion marked the first \ntime a civilian, private contractor was awarded this particular medal. \nMr. Johnston's lifesaving response to serve and sacrifice on behalf of \nothers was something he chose to do. It was not his duty. It was not \nhis responsibility it was his goodwill and American patriotism that \ndrove him to put his life at risk in order to assist and save others. \nThere is only one word that sufficiently describes this exemplary \nMainer, and that word is hero. I was extremely proud to present him \nwith the Defense of Freedom Medal.\n  Mr. Johnston's awe-inspiring willingness to think of others ahead of \nhimself will forever be remembered by those whose lives he touched and \nsaved that day. The courageous commitment and valiant care demonstrated \nby Alan Johnston of Windsor, ME, exemplifies the very best of what it \nmeans to be a Mainer and an American\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10910-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10910-S10911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROB McCLINTIC\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of my \nlongtime friend and staff member, Rob McClintic. After 23 years of work \nin the U.S. Congress, Rob has decided to retire from the Senate.\n  Rob started with my office on March 13, 1998, while I was still in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. When I won the election to the \nSenate in 2000, I couldn't imagine not bringing Rob to work in the \nSenate with me.\n  Rob is often the first contact with my constituents and visitors. As \na staff assistant, Rob has been tasked with answering phone calls from \nconstituents and greeting visitors. Everyone who works in Congress \nknows that answering phones is an extremely important job and can be \ntremendously challenging. This is one of the main ways that Senators \nand Representatives hear how their constituents are feeling on \nimportant issues. Rob has at busy times answered well over 100 or more \nphone calls a day. In 23 years on the Hill, Rob surely has answered \nover 600,000 phone calls. This is, needless to say, a tremendous feat.\n  Rob is also responsible for giving tours of the Capitol building and \nfor setting up other tours around Washington, DC. His knowledge of the \nhistory of the Capitol is outstanding. He knows every corner of the \nCapitol and provides a personal touch on each and every tour. Rob not \nonly just gave tours, he made sure that the visitors from Michigan \nenjoyed their stay in DC, and experienced the history of Congress.\n  Prior to working for me, Rob worked for Congressman Phil Sharp from \nIndiana, Rob's home State, from April 1983 through January 1995 and \nCongresswoman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio from August 1995 through February \n1998.\n  Upon leaving the Senate, Rob will be moving back to his home State of \nIndiana to be closer to friends and family. I know his family is proud \nof him and will welcome him home with open arms.\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\n  I also know that Rob's friendly demeanor and unparalleled \nprofessionalism will be dearly missed here in Washington, DC. Rob \nMcClintic is irreplaceable.\n  Mr. President, I am sad because I am losing my trusted and valued \nstaffer who has worked with me for nearly a decade, but I am happy to \nsee a dear friend move on to new challenges, and I wish him the best of \nluck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10911-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO FALLEN U.S. FOREST SERVICE FIREFIGHTERS FROM CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I have a very heavy heart as I pay \ntribute to five fallen U.S. Forest Service firefighters from \nCalifornia. It is an honor to talk about their heroic deeds, but it is \nheartbreaking.\n  These five heroes died in the line of duty while protecting families \nand homes in the Esperanza Fire west of Palm Springs. We deeply mourn \nthe loss of Engine Captain Mark Loutzenhiser, Fire Engine Operator Jess \nMcLean, Assistant Fire Engine Operator Jason McKay, Firefighter Daniel \nHoover-Najera, and Firefighter Pablo Cerda.\n  Mark Loutzenhiser was 44 years old and had 21 years of firefighting \nservice. He was a certified emergency management technician, EMT. He \nhad previously worked as a hotshot crewman for the Vista Grande Hot \nShots and also as a volunteer firefighter for Riverside County. He \nmajored in fire science at Mount San Jacinto College. He was a longtime \nresident of Idyllwild, CA, and was a wonderful supporter and coach for \nthe youth sports program. He is survived by his wife Maria \nLoutzenhiser.\n  Jess McLean was 27 years old and had 7 years of firefighting service. \nHe had been a hotshot for 3 years with the Vista Grande Hot Shots. He \ngraduated from Banning High School in 1997 and attended fire science \nclasses at Crafton Hills College. He was a resident of Beaumont, CA. He \nis survived by his wife Karen McLean and his mother Cecelia McLean.\n  Jason McKay was 27 years old and had 5 years of Forest Service \nexperience and 4 years as a volunteer firefighter in Adelanto. He also \nserved on the Mojave Greens Type II crew. He was a certified EMT and \nearned an associate's degree in fire science. He was a resident of \nPhelan, CA. He is survived by his mother Bonnie J. McKay and his father \nRobert McKay.\n  Daniel Hoover-Najera was 20 years old and in his second season of \nfirefighting. He worked on the Tahquitz Type II crew in 2005 and was a \nseasonal employee in 2006. He graduated from San Jacinto Mountain View \nHigh School in 2004. He was a resident of San Jacinto, CA. He is \nsurvived by his mother Gloria Ayala and his father Timothy Hoover.\n  Pablo Cerda was 23 years old and in his second season with the Forest \nService. He was previously of the Tahquitz Type II crew. He graduated \nfrom Los Amigos High School in Santa Ana in 2001 and attended Fire \nAcademy of Riverside Community College. He was a resident of Fountain \nValley, CA. He is survived by his father Pablo Cerda, Sr.\n  These five U.S. Forest Service firefighters on Engine Crew 57 on the \nSan Jacinto Ranger District were dispatched early on the morning of \nThursday, October 26 to fight the Esperanza fire. As the fire blazed \nout of control, they bravely fought it when they were overrun by \nflames.\n  Mark, Jess, Jason, Daniel, and Pablo are true examples of why we call \nfirefighters heroes. They bravely and selflessly risked their lives \ntime and time again trying to protect California. No more could be \nasked of anyone. Tragically, they have fallen in one of these battles. \nWe know why their friends, family, and colleagues are so proud of them \nand so devastated by their loss. Their loss reverberates throughout \nCalifornia and our Nation.\n  I send my sincere condolences to their families, their communities, \nand all of the firefighters who had the honor of serving with Mark, \nJess, Jason, Daniel, and Pablo over the years.\n  These firefighters are extraordinary heroes. And we will not rest \nuntil we have found those responsible for this horrific crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10911-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10911-S10916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, as the session winds down I have been \nthinking back over the year. As always, there has been a lot more \nactivity than action, but we are making progress on the people's \nbusiness.\n  But not everything we do here is legislative in nature. Senator Pryor \nand I had the opportunity to chair the National Prayer Breakfast in \nFebruary, a nonofficial, nonpartisan, and nondenominational gathering \nof people from all over the world who are seeking better ways to \nconnect with each other and find strength beyond ourselves. Many of our \ncolleagues in the House and Senate participated. For their reference \nand for the benefit of other interested readers of this Record, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of a transcript of the event, including a \nvery interesting talk by U2 lead singer and humanitarian Bono, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Mark Pryor: Good morning. Thank you very much for \n     being here. I am Senator Mark Pryor, from Arkansas, and I am \n     one of the co-chairs of this event along with my very good \n     friend Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota. We are so grateful \n     that you have come from every state in the Union, and from \n     160 nations around the world. To start us out on an uplifting \n     and prayerful note, I am happy to introduce Karen Mason from \n     Little Rock, Arkansas. She has a song to share today about \n     gratitude, and it expresses how we all are feeling today.\n       Mrs. Karen Mason: Psalm 100 says that protocol for coming \n     into the presence of our heavenly King is to enter into His \n     gates with thanksgiving, to come into His presence with \n     gratitude, with a heart of gratefulness, and this song is my \n     song of gratitude to my heavenly King.\n       (Song.) (Applause.)\n       Senator Norm Coleman: Good morning, folks, I am Senator \n     Norm Coleman, from the state of Minnesota, and before we \n     enjoy our breakfast and more fellowship around the tables, I \n     would like to introduce our head table's special guests and \n     say a few words of grace. To my far left, Karen Mason, and \n     the four women from Point of Grace, who will be introduced \n     later in the program. Next to them is Senator David Vitter \n     from Louisiana, then we have Senator Barack Obama, Illinois' \n     new senator. Next to him is someone who we will introduce \n     more fully later, for now one word will suffice--Bono. Next \n     to him is my wife Laurie, whose love and support has brought \n     me to this moment. On the other end, we have Congressman \n     Lincoln Davis from Tennessee. Next to him we have \n     Representative Tom Osborne of Nebraska, we will just call him \n     Coach. Next to him is Senator Ken Salazar from Colorado. Then \n     we have Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the great state of \n     Texas. Next, a former main speaker at this event, Senator Joe \n     Lieberman of Connecticut, and next, a member of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael \n     Mullen. Finally, the spouse of my co-chair, Jill Pryor.\n       Let us pray to bless the food, which I will do in a moment. \n     But first I would like to recite the most holy prayer in \n     Judaism which is called the Shema, and I have prayed it since \n     I was a little boy.\n       Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Elohaynu, Adonai Echad--Hear O \n     Israel, Adonai is your God, Adonai is your God.

I am \n     happy to introduce my good friend Mark Pryor. He is a \n     Democrat from a red state.\n       Senator Pryor: And my good friend Norm Coleman who is a \n     Republican from a blue state and maybe that is why we get \n     along so well. (Laughter.)\n       Senator Coleman: We came to Washington together, and one of \n     the first things we heard from our senior colleagues was \n     Harry Truman's advice: If you want a friend in Washington, \n     buy a dog. The hardest thing in public life is not making \n     decisions, it is finding people you can trust to guide you \n     and encourage you to do the right thing.\n       Senator Pryor: And that is a real challenge, because with \n     every senator, every congressman, and every other leader who \n     is here, we got to where we are because of our friends. \n     Someone described public service as being like cutting \n     flowers from a garden and\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\n     putting them in a vase--they look great, but before too long \n     they need some nourishment.\n       Senator Coleman: And for me that is what this breakfast and \n     our weekly breakfast group in the Senate is all about--\n     putting back in what the job takes out. You should already \n     know by now that what you are experiencing is a very big \n     public version of what we experience privately on a personal \n     scale every week in the Senate and in the House. People from \n     all kinds of backgrounds come together to share a meal, \n     deepen our relations, pray to God for His guidance and \n     blessings, and look for the inspiration to live our faith \n     more completely. We would also like to provide a special \n     welcome to four heads of state who have honored us with their \n     presence. President Miro Jovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Prime \n     Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam of Mauritius, Prime Minister \n     Said Musa of Belize, and King Abdullah bin al-Hussein II of \n     Jordan. (Applause.)\n       Senator Pryor: We hope that this breakfast is an \n     encouragement to you to do similar things where you live. I \n     want to read a few verses from the gospel of John, chapter \n     21. It says:\n       Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea \n     of Tiberias. Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, \n     but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. He \n     called out to them, ``Friends, haven't you any fish?''\n       ``No,'' they answered.\n       He said, ``Throw your net on the right side of the boat and \n     you will find some.'' When they did, they were unable to haul \n     the net in because of the large number of fish.\n       Jesus said to them, ``Bring some of the fish you have just \n     caught.''\n       Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It \n     was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net \n     was not torn. Jesus said to them, ``Come and have \n     breakfast.''\n       When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \n     ``Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?''\n       ``Yes, Lord,'' he said, ``you know that I love you.''\n       Jesus said, ``Feed my lambs.''\n       Again Jesus said, ``Simon son of John, do you truly love \n     me?''\n       He answered, ``Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.''\n       And Jesus said, ``Take care of my sheep.''\n       The third time he said to him, ``Simon son of John, do you \n     love me?''\n       Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, ``Do \n     you love me?'' He said, ``Lord, you know all things; you know \n     that I love you.''\n       Jesus said, ``Feed my sheep.''\n       That is the spirit in which we meet together today.\n       Senator Coleman: I am a tennis player, but not a very good \n     one. I read somewhere that when you hit a tennis ball, it is \n     only on the racket for a tenth of a second. The rest is all \n     backswing and follow-through. The prayer breakfast is like \n     that. We are here for just a moment, but the months and years \n     of work that went into this event is the backswing, and \n     hopefully there will be years of fruitful follow-through.\n       Listen to the words of Psalm 100. May this be your \n     affirmation today as well.\n       Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. Worship the Lord \n     with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. Know that \n     the Lord is God. It is he who made us and we are his; we are \n     his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with \n     thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him \n     and praise his name. For the Lord is good and his love \n     endures forever; His faithfulness continues through all \n     generations.\n       Senator Pryor: Amen to that. Norm, it has been a great \n     pleasure and joy for me to work with you on this prayer \n     breakfast, and seeing all these people it makes me feel like \n     we can do anything. What about next week we go in the office \n     and fix the federal budget deficit? (Laughter.)\n       Senator Coleman: You know, Mark, miracles do happen. One of \n     my favorite quotes was from David Ben-Gurion, first Prime \n     Minister of Israel, who said, ``Anybody who doesn't believe \n     in miracles is not a realist.'' (Laughter.)\n       Senator Pryor: Now to kick off the main part of the \n     program, I am going to introduce our second musical \n     selection. You've noticed we have music this morning. When \n     Moses led Israel out of Egypt, he also led them in song. King \n     David is recorded as writing and singing many, many songs. \n     The apostles of the first century are recorded on many \n     different occasions as singing songs. Music is an important \n     way in which we can express our faith. Point of Grace is four \n     young women with a passion for conveying the character of God \n     through music. This is a song about prayer and friendship \n     that expresses the heart of why we gather today. Ladies and \n     gentlemen, Point of Grace.\n       [Point of Grace woman]: Thank you so much, Senator Pryor, \n     for inviting us to be here today. It is a great honor, to be \n     here with all of you to celebrate not only our faith but the \n     great friendship that we all share. This is called ``Circle \n     of Friends.''\n       (Song.)\n       Senator Barack Obama: Good morning. Mr. President, Madam \n     First Lady, our speaker today, Bono, for the outstanding work \n     you are doing. Thank you all for being here. I offer a \n     reading from the letters to the Romans, chapter 12, verses 3 \n     through 12:\n       ``For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do \n     not think of yourselves more highly than you ought, but \n     rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance \n     with the measure of faith God has given you. Just as each of \n     us has one body with many members, and these members do not \n     all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form \n     one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have \n     different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's \n     gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his \n     faith. If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, \n     let him teach; if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it \n     is contributing to the needs of others, let him give \n     generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; \n     if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully. Love must \n     be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be \n     devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another \n     above yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your \n     spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, \n     patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.''\n       Praise be to God.\n       Senator David Vitter: Good morning. I am David Vitter of \n     Louisiana.\n       Senator Ken Salazar: Good morning. I am Ken Salazar from \n     Colorado.\n       Senator Vitter: Ken and I both came to the U.S. Senate last \n     year.\n       Senator Salazar: We came from different regions of the \n     country, different parties, and different perspectives on \n     some issues, but we were both drawn to the Senate prayer \n     breakfast.\n       Senator Vitter: It is a truly wonderful refuge from the \n     bitter partisanship and win-at-any-cost atmosphere that, \n     unfortunately, we so often face outside that prayer circle.\n       Senator Salazar: As I said, Senator Vitter and I are \n     members of the United States Senate breakfast. At that \n     breakfast we pray together, Democrats and Republicans alike, \n     and put aside what are sometimes very divisive and bitter \n     political and policy differences. There we focus on our \n     common humanity and our faith in God. And like many of my \n     Republican and Democratic colleagues in the U.S. Senate and \n     those of you in this distinguished audience today, I grew up \n     in a family and a community with a deep and abiding faith, \n     and with a desire to translate our values into the service of \n     our neighbors and into the betterment of our nation and our \n     world. My own faith begins with my family. My family \n     founded one of the first settlements in the New World, and \n     named that city Santa Fe, the City of Holy Faith, in New \n     Mexico. Over the more than four centuries since that time, \n     my family has sacrificed and endured through war, poverty, \n     death and discrimination. Yet during those four centuries, \n     we have survived because of our faith that all of God's \n     children have within their minds and their hearts the \n     ability to create a more perfect and better world with the \n     freedom and intellect endowed upon us by our Creator.\n       As Jesus said in the book of John:\n       ``If anyone says `I love God' and hates his neighbor, he is \n     a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen \n     cannot love God whom he has not seen.''\n       Let us pledge today to redouble our efforts to mend the \n     rifts that too often exist between religious traditions, \n     nations and political parties. Let us remember the love of \n     neighbor and love of God are linked by an unbreakable bond, \n     and that our lives and our work should be motivated by love \n     and compassion for our fellow man.\n       In closing I would like to share with you a prayer that is \n     very close to my heart, one that was created and given by \n     Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm Workers of \n     America. There he says, ``Let the spirit flourish and grow, \n     so that we will never tire of the struggle. Let us remember \n     those who have died for justice, for they have given us life. \n     Help us love even those who hate us, so that we can change \n     the world.''\n       In conclusion, a part of a prayer that my family has handed \n     down over the centuries goes as follows: Infinitas gracias \n     damos, por tus grandes beneficios que asi sin hacer servicio, \n     nos das mas que merecemos. This means, in general, ``We thank \n     you infinitely, oh God, for all the great blessings that you \n     have given us.''\n       And today, God, we pray that you would continue to unite \n     our nation and our world.\n       Senator Vitter: I guess my family are newcomers to this \n     country compared to Ken's. We came from France to Louisiana \n     in the latter 1800s, but we share the same deep, rich \n     Catholic faith. At the Senate prayer breakfast I have talked \n     about the very Catholic concept of grace. It is God's \n     blessing given from above, unearned, undeserved. It is a very \n     un-Washington concept that we are not in control. And prayer \n     breakfasts have also deepened my sense of the power of \n     prayer. Amazing things can happen when we truly acknowledge \n     that we are not in control and ask for God's grace, however \n     unearned and undeserved.\n       These parts of my faith meant a lot to me this year, as we \n     were hit by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in my home state of \n     Louisiana and on the Gulf Coast. What better example of \n     humans not being in control. And they sustain me today as we \n     face the often overwhelming challenge of rebuilding, and the \n     even more worrisome thought that the country has forgotten or \n     moved on. So I call on that power of prayer this morning. I \n     ask for your real prayer commitment to the people of the Gulf \n     Coast. We all ask for God's grace, that He touch us, bless \n     us, awaken us to this and other great ongoing national \n     challenges. And I pray that we meet and not forget this test \n     of our national character here at home.\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\n       U.S. Representative Lincoln Davis: Mr. President, First \n     Lady, speakers, and musicians, on behalf of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and my congressional co-chair of the prayer \n     breakfast, we welcome you today. I want to give you a brief \n     history. In 1942 the prayer breakfast groups were inaugurated \n     in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. \n     Later, in 1953, members of the Senate and House prayer groups \n     gathered together with President Eisenhower for prayer and \n     worship, to seek divine guidance for national leadership and \n     to reaffirm faith and dependence on God. This gathering \n     became known as the Presidential Prayer Breakfast until 1970, \n     when the name was changed to the National Prayer Breakfast in \n     order to put more emphasis on the gathering rather than the \n     individuals involved. In my mind this was a fitting thing to \n     do. And today, 64 years later, on the 54th anniversary of the \n     National Day of Prayer, we gather again to celebrate the \n     glory of faith. I am amazed at the amount of people who are \n     here from outside of our country, at this wonderful event, \n     highlighting the global nature of faith.\n       I would like to thank all the members of Congress and both \n     the House and Senate who are here today. This last year has \n     been a wonderful time for me every Thursday morning as we \n     gather in the House restaurant, and I have served as co-\n     chairman with the wonderful fellow, Coach, named Congressman \n     Tom Osborne. It has been a delight, and as we gather each \n     morning, as members of Congress share their lives, their \n     story about their family and their faith journey, it is one \n     of the best moments that we have.\n       When I first came to Congress in January of 2003, I quickly \n     found that the weekly prayer breakfast, where I would join \n     with my colleagues giving thanks to the Lord and ask for \n     guidance in our work for the country, was my favorite hour of \n     the week. For this reason I have always looked forward to the \n     prayer breakfasts. However, I truly believe that any amount \n     of time we spend in prayer are the best moments of our life, \n     and it helps us to continue with our faith. Thank you for \n     joining us this morning. My good friend, Tom Osborne.\n       U.S. Representative Tom Osborne: Thanks very much, Lincoln. \n     Mr. President and First Lady, it is good to be with you this \n     morning. I see a lot of politicians out there, and it reminds \n     me of this event I went to not long ago. There were these \n     three politicians, and one guy said to them: okay, let's get \n     to the bottom of this thing--let's suppose you guys are laid \n     out in your coffins and people are walking by and they're \n     talking about you, what one thing would you want them to say \n     about you? The first politician said, I'd want somebody to \n     walk by and look down and say: this was an honest man. The \n     second politician said, I'd want somebody to walk by and look \n     down and say: this was a great family man. The third \n     politician said, yeah, I'd want somebody to walk by and look \n     down and say: I think he's still moving. (Laughter.)\n       Sometimes--at this time of the morning, that is about the \n     way you feel.\n       Lincoln covered the House prayer breakfast very well. Each \n     Thursday, 30 to 40 of us meet together, and the speakers are \n     always members of Congress. The interesting thing is, people \n     share their lives and talk about their families and their \n     hopes and their aspirations and their struggles, it seems \n     that the labels begin to come off--Republican, Democrat, \n     liberal, conservative, and on and on. You begin to see the \n     person behind the mask and you begin to see people as they \n     really are. Every time I have come away from that breakfast, \n     I have had a great appreciation and usually a genuine love \n     for that person as I have heard them talk about their life.\n       It has been an unwavering tradition that the only speakers \n     we have are members of Congress. But we were notified one day \n     that King Abdullah was going to come from Jordan, and, we \n     have had a senator or two come by but we have never had a \n     king before, so we didn't know what to do. We said, we had \n     better ask him to speak. And so he spoke, and it was really \n     an interesting morning, because he talked about his country, \n     he talked about things that were going on in the world, he \n     talked about the Koran, and then he talked about Jesus. It \n     was really a very meaningful time, because at that point I \n     began to realize that this person that we often put in a box, \n     and this person that often is so clearly identified with a \n     particular ideology, cuts across so many areas. And I know \n     that is why so many of you are here today from so many \n     countries, because of an interest in this particular topic.\n       Lincoln and I wanted to thank you and welcome you this \n     morning, and we certainly hope that you will experience God's \n     presence here as we meet today, and that the world will be a \n     better place for our having been here. Thank you very much. \n     (Applause.)\n       Senator Joseph Lieberman: Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, your \n     majesty King Abdullah, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, \n     it is with great gratitude and joy that I greet you all, of \n     different faiths but all brothers and sisters in a shared \n     faith in God. In the language and spirit of the Hebrew Bible, \n     ``B'rukhim ha-baim b'Shem Adonai''--Blessed be those who have \n     come in the name of the Lord.\n       I am greatly honored to have been asked this morning to \n     offer prayer for our national leaders. I pray that God will \n     open my lips so that my mouth may declare his praise.\n       In Genesis 2:7 it is written that God formed the man of \n     dust from the ground, and he blew into his nostrils the soul \n     of life, and man became a living being. In 1776, God moved \n     the founding generation of Americans to breathe a soul into \n     their new land and make it a living nation, when they \n     acknowledged the self-evident truth that there is a Creator, \n     and that he created us all equal, and that we are all endowed \n     by our Creator with unalienable rights, including among them \n     the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, \n     and that governments are formed to secure those rights. That \n     declaration gave America not only its independence but its \n     purpose. And it was not just a national purpose but a global \n     purpose, because God's endowment of those rights was truly \n     not just to Americans but to all the men, women and children \n     of His creation. So I pray this morning that God will bless \n     America, and each American, as we work to advance our faith-\n     based purposes; to unite all of God's children here at home \n     and throughout the world; to support the causes of freedom, \n     opportunity, unity and hope, and defeat the evils of \n     oppression, poverty, illness, hatred and fear.\n       We pray, Lord, that you will hold our president and his \n     family and all national leaders in your hands, and protect \n     them and us as they lead us forward to achieve the humane and \n     universal mission you have given us, so that together we may \n     come to the day when the mountains will be made low and the \n     valleys will be raised up, when the crooked places will be \n     made straight and the rough places smooth. For on that day, \n     which we all pray and work for, the earth will surely be full \n     of the glory of God. Amen. (Applause.)\n       Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: I am Senator Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison from Texas. Mr. President, First Lady Laura, King \n     Abdullah, Heads of State, and all distinguished visitors from \n     around the world and from our wonderful country. As \n     religious, community and political leaders, we deal with the \n     most difficult problems our people face. Complete success \n     frequently proves illusive, and the victories we do achieve \n     often come with setbacks and failures. A passage that renews \n     my energy and restores my focus is Second Corinthians chapter \n     4, verses 16 to 18:\n       ``Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are \n     wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. \n     For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an \n     eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes \n     not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen \n     is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.'' (Applause.)\n       Admiral Michael G. Mullen: Good morning, Mr. President, \n     Mrs. Bush, other distinguished Heads of State, and \n     distinguished visitors. I am Admiral Mike Mullen, I am the \n     Chief of Naval Operations and this morning I represent the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff. I am honored to be here and to have \n     this opportunity. I have been asked to say a few words about \n     myself which I don't do well but I will give it a shot. I \n     like to describe myself as a husband and father, an American, \n     a sailor in the United States Navy, and a naval officer, in \n     that order. I have been married for 35 years to my partner \n     for life, Deborah, and we are very proud of our two sons, \n     Jack and Michael, currently serving on active duty in the \n     Navy. I am originally from Los Angeles, son of hard-working \n     parents who moved out west after the Depression in search of \n     a better life. They found it there and gave it to me. I hold \n     their memories dear. Born and raised a Catholic, I also hold \n     my faith dear. I know its enormous power, have seen it with \n     my own eyes during countless visits with soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen employed in harm's way. \n     Just like the power of prayer, faith can move mountains. This \n     morning I ask you to join me. I would like to offer a prayer \n     for our world's leaders.\n       Father in heaven, we gather in prayer today to ask your \n     blessing over the lives and decisions of those who lead \n     nations around the world. It is a time of great challenge and \n     great adversity. Theirs is an especially mighty task and a \n     deeply noble calling. For upon the shoulders of our leaders \n     rests the hopes and the dreams of billions of people. From \n     the pen and from the podium, they direct the future not only \n     of this generation but of generations yet unborn. May you \n     guide them in that pursuit, oh Lord, and give them strength. \n     Help them serve with integrity and with compassion. Help them \n     choose love over hate, courage over fear, principle over \n     expediency. Let them find new and even better ways to be \n     providers and peace makers. Let them be guided from the \n     wisdom found in Romans 12, which tells us, ``Do not be \n     conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of \n     your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God. Let \n     love be genuine, hate what is evil, hold fast to what is \n     good. Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what \n     is noble in the sight of all.''\n       In the sight of all, oh Lord, let our leaders be noble and \n     learn from your example. Let them realize that to be right \n     with you is to be right. And finally, from this sailor to the \n     One who made the seas, be pleased to guide the ships of state \n     to safe harbor. In the face of storms and shoals and fainting \n     hearts, we trust you with everything we have, everything we \n     are, and everything we hope to be. You not only chart our \n     course, you help us hold the tiller. You brave the waves \n     and calm the waters. You really are Emmanuel, God with us. \n     May that truth be known today to those who lead our \n     nations. With grateful hearts we pray, Amen.\n       Senator Coleman: There are a lot of Catholics on this \n     program. Mr. President, I\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\n     thought they were all on the Supreme Court. (Laughter.)\n       In my day, I have introduced the president, I once \n     introduced Dr. Billy Graham, but as a former roadie for the \n     60s rock band Ten Years After, this ranks right up there as \n     one of the high points of my introducing career. Mark and I \n     were joking about this earlier, this kind of makes us the \n     rhetorical warm-up act for U2. (Laughter.)\n       Our message today comes from a person who has gotten the \n     attention of the world by walking with God, talking about \n     things that matter, and letting his light shine. He is an \n     extraordinary musician, charismatic leader, and is \n     unabashedly, uniquely himself. We have an expression that a \n     celebrity is a person who is famous for being famous. But our \n     speaker this morning is known around the world as a person of \n     conscience, a person of influence, but most of all, a person \n     of faith. His organization is called DATA--Debt, AIDS, Trade \n     in Africa. They are working to bring people, organizations, \n     leaders and politicians together to make a unified effort to \n     change the future of Africa.\n       He has come to challenge us, to reach across the \n     boundaries, to care for the poor and to walk the talk of our \n     faith. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono. (Applause.)\n       Bono: Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. President, First \n     Lady, King Abdullah, other heads of state, distinguished \n     guests. Please join me in praying that I don't say something \n     we will all regret. That was for the FCC.\n       If you are wondering what I am doing here at a prayer \n     breakfast, well so am I. I am certainly not here as a man of \n     the cloth, unless that cloth is leather. And I am certainly \n     not here because I am a rock star, which leaves only one \n     possible explanation: I have got a messianic complex. It is \n     true. And to anyone who knows me, it is hardly a revelation.\n       I am the first to admit that there is something unnatural, \n     something even unseemly about rock stars mounting the pulpit \n     and preaching at presidents, then disappearing to their \n     villas in the south of France. Talk about a fish out of \n     water. It was weird enough to have Jesse Helms come to a rock \n     show. But, this is really weird, isn't it?\n       One of the things I love about this country is the \n     separation of Church and State--although I have to say in \n     inviting me here both Church and State have been separated \n     from something else completely: their mind!\n       Mr. President, are you sure about this? It is very \n     humbling, and I will try to keep my homily brief. But be \n     warned: I am Irish.\n       I would like to talk about the laws of man, here in this \n     city, where those laws are written. I would like to talk \n     about higher laws. It would be great to assume that one \n     serves the other, that the laws of man serve these higher \n     laws, but of course they don't always. I presume, in a way, \n     that that is why you are all here. I presume the reason for \n     this gathering is that all of us here--Muslims, Jews, \n     Christians--are searching our souls for how to better serve \n     our family, our community, our nation, our God. And some of \n     us are not very good examples, despite what Norm says.\n       I am certainly searching, and that, I suppose, is what led \n     me here. Yes, it is odd, having a rock star at the breakfast. \n     But maybe it is odder for me than for you, because, you see, \n     I have avoided religious people most of my life. Maybe it has \n     something to do with my having a father who was a Protestant \n     and a mother who was a Catholic in a country where the line \n     between the two was, quite literally, often a battle line; \n     where the line between Church and State was, at the very \n     least, a little blurry and hard to see.\n       I remember how my mother would bring us to chapel on \n     Sundays and my father used to wait outside. One of the things \n     that I picked up from my father and my mother was the sense \n     that religion often gets in the way of God. For me, at least, \n     it got in the way, seeing what religious people, in the name \n     of God, did to my native land. And even in this country, \n     seeing God's second-hand car salesmen on the TV cable \n     channels offering indulgences for cash. In fact, all over the \n     world, seeing the self-righteous roll down like a mighty \n     stream from certain corners of the religious establishment. I \n     must confess, I changed the channel. I wanted my MTV.\n       So, even though I was a believer, and perhaps because I was \n     a believer, I was cynical--not about God, but about God's \n     politics.\n       In 1997, a couple of eccentric septuagenarian British \n     Christians went and ruined my shtick, my reproachfulness. \n     They did it by describing the Millennium, the year 2000, as a \n     Jubilee year; as an opportunity to cancel the chronic debts \n     of the world's poorest people. They had the audacity to renew \n     the Lord's call and were joined by Pope John Paul II, who, \n     from an Irish half-Catholic's point of view, may have had a \n     little more of a direct line to the Almighty, to declare the \n     Year of Jubilee.\n       So Jubilee. Why Jubilee? What was this Year of Jubilee, \n     this year of our Lord's favor? I had always read the \n     Scriptures, actually, even the obscure stuff. There it was in \n     Leviticus 25:35:\n       ``If your brother becomes poor, and cannot maintain \n     himself, you shall maintain him. You shall not lend him your \n     money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.''\n       Jubilee is such an important idea that Jesus begins his \n     ministry with this. Jesus is a young man, he has met with the \n     rabbis, he has impressed everybody, people are talking. The \n     elders say, he is a clever guy, this Jesus, but, he has not \n     done much, yet. He has not spoken in public before. When he \n     does, his first words are from Isaiah: ``The Spirit of the \n     Lord is upon me because He has anointed me to preach the good \n     news to the poor.'' And Jesus proclaims the year of the \n     Lord's favor, the year of Jubilee in Luke 4:18. What he was \n     really talking about was an era of grace, and we are still in \n     it.\n       So fast-forward 2,000 years. That same thought--grace--is \n     now incarnate in a movement of all kinds of people. It was \n     not a bless-me club, it was not a holy huddle. These \n     religious guys were willing to get out in the streets, get \n     their boots dirty, wave the placards, follow their \n     convictions with actions, making it really hard for people \n     like me to keep our distance--ruining my shtick. I almost \n     started to like these church people.\n       But then my cynicism got another helping hand. It was what \n     Colin Powell, a five-star general, called the greatest W.M.D. \n     of them all: a tiny little virus called A.I.D.S. And the \n     religious community, in large part, missed it. The ones that \n     did not miss it could only see it as divine retribution for \n     bad behavior--even on children? Even if the fastest-growing \n     group of HIV infections were married, faithful women?\n       Ah, there they go, I thought to myself. Judgmentalism is \n     back. But in truth, I was wrong again. The Church was slow \n     but the Church got busy on this the leprosy of our age. Love \n     was on the move. Mercy was on the move. God was on the \n     move. Moving people of all kinds to work with others they \n     had never met, never would have cared to meet. We had \n     conservative church groups hanging out with spokesmen from \n     the gay community, all singing off the same hymn sheet on \n     AIDS. See, miracles do happen. And we had hip-hop stars \n     and country stars. This is what happens when God gets on \n     the move. Crazy, crazy stuff happens. Popes were seen \n     wearing sunglasses! Jesse Helms had a ghetto blaster now! \n     Evidence of the Spirit moving--it was breathtaking. It \n     literally stopped the world in its tracks.\n       When churches started demonstrating on debt, governments \n     listened--and acted. When churches started organizing, \n     petitioning, and even that most unholy of acts today, God \n     forbid, lobbying on AIDS and global health, governments \n     listened--and acted. I am here today in all humility to say: \n     you changed minds, you changed policy, and you changed the \n     world. So thank you. (Applause.)\n       Check Judaism. Check Islam. Check pretty much anyone. God \n     may well be with us in our mansions on the hill. I hope so. \n     He may well be with us in all manner of controversial stuff. \n     Maybe, maybe not. But the one thing we can all agree on--all \n     faiths, all ideologies--is that God is with the vulnerable \n     and poor. God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where \n     the poor play house. God is in the silence of a mother who \n     has infected her child with a virus that will end both their \n     lives. God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war. God \n     is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives, and God is \n     with us if we are with them. (Applause.)\n       ``If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of \n     the finger and the speaking of wickedness, and if you give \n     yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the \n     afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your \n     gloom will become like midday, and the Lord will continually \n     guide you and satisfy your desire even in scorched places.''\n       It is not a coincidence that in the Scriptures poverty is \n     mentioned more than 2,100 times. It is not an accident. That \n     is a lot of air time. The only time Jesus Christ is \n     judgmental is on the subject of the poor, Matthew 25:40: ``As \n     you have done it unto the least of these my brethren, you \n     have done it unto me.''\n       As I say, good news to the poor. Here is some good news for \n     you, Mr. President. After 9-11, we were told America would \n     have no time for the world's poor. We were told America would \n     be taken up with its own problems of safety. And while it is \n     true that these are dangerous times, America has not drawn \n     the blinds and double-locked the doors. In fact, you have \n     doubled aid to Africa. You have tripled funding for global \n     health. And Mr. President, your emergency plan for AIDS \n     relief and support of the Global Fund--yours' and Congress'--\n     have put 700,000 people onto life-saving anti-retroviral \n     drugs and provided eight million bed nets to protect children \n     from malaria. (Applause.)\n       Outstanding human achievements. Counterintuitive, I think \n     you will admit, but historic. You should be very, very proud. \n     But here is the bad news: There is so much more to do. There \n     is a gigantic chasm between the scale of the emergency and \n     the scale of the response.\n       And finally--getting to higher levels, higher callings--\n     this is not about charity in the end, is it? It is about \n     justice, the good news yet to come. I just want to repeat \n     that: This is not about charity, it is about justice. And \n     that is too bad. Because we are good at charity. Americans as \n     well as the Irish are good at charity. We like to give and we \n     give a lot, even those who cannot afford it. But justice is a \n     higher standard. Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice; \n     it makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our \n     pieties, it doubts our concern, and it questions our \n     commitment. 6,500 Africans are still dying every day of \n     preventable, treatable disease, for lack of drugs we can buy \n     at any drugstore. This is not about charity; this is about \n     justice and equality. Because there is no way we can look at \n     what is happening in Africa and, if we are honest, conclude \n     that deep down, we would let it happen anywhere else, if we \n     really accepted that Africans are equal to us. And I say that \n     humbled in the company of a man with an African father.\n       Look at what happened in Southeast Asia with the Tsunami. \n     150,000 lives lost to the\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\n     greatest misnomer of all misnomers, Mother Nature. Well, in \n     Africa, 150,000 lives are lost every month--a tsunami every \n     month. And it is a completely avoidable catastrophe.\n       It is annoying, but justice and equality are mates, aren't \n     they? Justice always wants to hang out with equality. And \n     equality is a real pain.\n       You think of these Jewish sheep-herders going to meet with \n     the Pharaoh, mud on their shoes, and the Pharaoh goes, \n     ``Equal? Equal?'' And they say, ``Yeah, that is what it says \n     here in the Book--we are all made in the image of God, sir.'' \n     Eventually the Pharaoh says, ``Look, I can accept that. I can \n     accept the Jews--but not the blacks. Not the women. Not the \n     gays. Not the Irish. No way.'' So on we go with the journey \n     of equality. On we go in the pursuit of justice.\n       We hear that call in the ONE Campaign, a growing movement \n     of more than two million Americans--five million by the next \n     election, I can promise you--united in the belief that where \n     you live should no longer determine whether you live.\n       We hear that call even more powerfully today, when we mourn \n     the loss of Coretta Scott King, mother of a movement for \n     equality, one that changed the world but is only really \n     getting started, because these issues are as alive as they \n     ever were; they just change shape and they cross the seas.\n       Preventing the poorest of the poor from selling their \n     products while we sing the virtues of the free market--that \n     is not charity, that is a justice issue. Holding children to \n     ransom for the debts of their grandparents--that is not \n     charity, that is a justice issue. Withholding life-saving \n     medicines out of deference to the Office of Patents--that is \n     not charity, that is a justice issue. And while the law is \n     what we say it is, God is not silent on the subject. That is \n     why I say there are laws of the land and then there is a \n     higher standard. And we can hire experts to write them so \n     they benefit us, so that these laws say that it is okay to \n     protect our agriculture but it is not okay for African \n     farmers to protect their agriculture, to earn a living. As \n     the laws of man are written, that is what they say. But God \n     will not accept that. Mine will not. Will yours?\n       I close this morning on very thin ice, probably. This is a \n     dangerous idea I have put on the table here: my God versus \n     your God, their God versus our God, versus no God. It is very \n     easy in these times to see religion as a force for division \n     rather than unity. And Washington is a town that knows \n     something of division. But the reason I am here, and the \n     reason I keep coming back, is because Washington is a town \n     that is proving it can come together on behalf of what the \n     Scriptures call ``the least of these.'' It is not a \n     Republican idea, it is not a Democratic idea, it is not even, \n     with all due respect, an American idea, nor is it unique to \n     any one faith.\n       ``Do to others as you would have them do to you.'' Jesus \n     says that.\n       ``Righteousness is this: that one should give away wealth \n     out of love for Him to the near of kin and to the orphans and \n     the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for the \n     emancipation of the captives.'' The Koran says that.\n       ``Thus sayeth the Lord: Bring the homeless poor into your \n     house. When you see the naked, cover him. Then your light \n     will break out like the dawn and your recovery will spring \n     forth speedily; then the Lord will be your rear guard.'' The \n     Jewish Scripture says that. Isaiah 58 again. It is a very \n     powerful incentive: The Lord will watch your back. Sounds \n     like a good deal to me, especially right now. (Applause.)\n       A number of years ago, I met a wise man who changed my \n     life, in countless ways, big and small. I was always seeking \n     the Lord's blessing. I would be saying, look, I have got a \n     new song, look after it. I have a family, and I am going away \n     on tour, please look after them. I have this crazy idea, \n     could I have a blessing on it. And this wise man asked me to \n     stop. He said stop asking God to bless what you are doing. \n     Get involved in what God is doing, because it is already \n     blessed.\n       Let's get involved in what God is doing. God, as I say, is \n     always with the poor. That is what God is doing, and that is \n     what He is calling us to do.\n       I was amazed when I first got to this country and I learned \n     how much some churchgoers tithe: up to ten percent of the \n     family budget. How does that compare with the federal budget, \n     the budget for the entire American family? How much of that \n     goes to the poorest people in the world? It is less than one \n     percent of the federal budget.\n       Mr. President, Congress, people of faith, people of \n     America, I want to suggest to you today that you see the flow \n     of effective foreign assistance as tithing, which to be truly \n     meaningful will mean an additional one percent of the federal \n     budget tithed to the poor. And what is that one percent that \n     we are asking for in the ONE campaign? It is not merely a \n     number on a balance reader pulled out of the air. One percent \n     is the girl in Africa who gets to go to school, thanks to \n     you. One percent is the AIDS patient who gets her medicine, \n     thanks to you. One percent is the African entrepreneur who \n     can start a small family business, thanks to you. One percent \n     is not redecorating presidential palaces. One percent must \n     not be--or do not give it--money down a rat hole. This one \n     percent is digging waterholes to provide clean water, like I \n     saw with Bill Frist in Uganda. That is what we are asking \n     for. (Applause.)\n       One percent is a new partnership with Africa, not \n     paternalism towards Africa, where increased assistance flows \n     toward improved governance and initiatives with proven track \n     records and away from the boondoggles and white elephants \n     that we have seen before.\n       America gives less than one percent now. We are asking for \n     an extra one percent to change the world, to transform \n     millions of lives--and I say this to the military men now not \n     just transform hundreds of thousands of communities, indeed \n     millions, but transform the way they see us, which might be \n     smart in these dangerous times. One percent is national \n     security. One percent is enlightened economic self-interest, \n     and a better, safer world rolled into one. Sounds to me that \n     in this town of deals and compromises, one percent is the \n     best bargain around.\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n       Senator Pryor: Thank you.\n       You may know, friends, that the National Prayer Breakfast \n     came into being as a way to support and encourage the \n     president and his family. Back in the 1950s, newly elected \n     Dwight Eisenhower declared to a close friend in the Senate, \n     ``I live in the loneliest house in the world.'' President \n     Eisenhower was invited to be part of a small, private Senate \n     breakfast group which is still meeting today. At some point \n     one of the people in that group declared, ``It sure would be \n     an encouragement to the nation to know we are meeting like \n     this.'' And so the first National Prayer Breakfast was held. \n     The model of leaders meeting in private to share their lives, \n     their testimony, and to pray has spread, and this is \n     spreading to scores of nations around the world.\n       This morning we are honored to have our first couple with \n     us. Mrs. Bush, we want to express the comfort and reassurance \n     we have felt from your loving personality. Thank you. \n     (Applause.)\n       And now, Mr. President, we want you to know that we all \n     pray for you. The awesome burdens you carry are beyond \n     anything any of us can even imagine. We thank you for being a \n     man of real faith and of prayer. It is evident that this is a \n     deep, personal faith. And I want to thank you for encouraging \n     people of faith to take a larger role in our society. I \n     remember the story of the people coming around Moses, to hold \n     up his arms as he led the people. We have come here today to \n     do that for you.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce the \n     President of the United States.\n       President George W. Bush: Thank you all. (Applause.)\n       Thanks for the warm welcome. Laura and I are delighted to \n     be here. This lovely personality said this morning: keep your \n     remarks short. (Laughter.)\n       I appreciate this prayer breakfast a lot, and I appreciate \n     the spirit in which it was formed. Ike said he was living in \n     the loneliest house in America--but what he forgot to say is: \n     the rent is pretty good. (Laughter.)\n       It is great to be here with distinguished guests from all \n     around the world. Your Majesty and Prime Ministers and former \n     Prime Ministers, friends with whom I have the honor to work, \n     you are welcome here. I appreciate the fact that people from \n     different walks of life, different faiths have joined us. Yet \n     I believe we share one thing in common: We are united in our \n     dedication to peace and tolerance and humility before the \n     Almighty. (Applause.)\n       I want to thank Senators Pryor and Coleman for putting on \n     this breakfast. I appreciate Senator Frist, Representative \n     Blunt, Representative Pelosi, other members of the United \n     States Congress who have joined us on the dais and who are \n     here for this breakfast. I thank the members of my Cabinet \n     who are here. Get back to work. Laughter.)\n       I find it interesting that the music is from Arkansas. \n     (Laughter.) I am glad it is, because they know how to sing \n     down there. (Laughter.)\n       I was trying to figure out what to say about Bono, and a \n     story jumped to mind about this really good Texas preacher. \n     And he got going in a sermon and a fellow jumped up in the \n     back and said, ``Use me, Lord, use me.'' The preacher ignored \n     him and finished his sermon. The next Sunday, the preacher \n     gets up and is cranking on another sermon when the guy jumps \n     up again and says, ``Use me, Lord, use me.'' After the \n     service, the preacher walked up to him and said, ``If you're \n     serious, I'd like for you to paint the pews.'' Next Sunday, \n     he's preaching, the guy stands up and says, ``Use me, \n     Lord, use me, but only in an advisory capacity.'' \n     (Laughter.)\n       So I have gotten to know Bono. (Laughter.) He is a doer. \n     The thing about this good citizen of the world is that he has \n     used his position to get things done. You are an amazing guy, \n     Bono. God bless you. (Applause.)\n       It is fitting we have a National Prayer Breakfast, because \n     our nation is a nation of prayer. In America, we do not \n     prescribe any prayer. We welcome all prayer. We are a nation \n     founded by men and women who came to these shores seeking to \n     worship the Almighty freely. From these prayerful beginnings \n     God has greatly blessed the American people, and through our \n     prayers we give thanks to the true source of our blessings.\n       Americans remain a prayerful people today. I know this \n     firsthand. I cannot tell you the number of times while \n     traveling out there in our country, people walk up, total \n     strangers, and say, Mr. President, I am praying for you and \n     your family. It is one of the great blessings of the \n     presidency, and one of the most wonderful gifts a person can \n     give any of us who have the responsibility to govern justly. \n     So I thank my fellow citizens for their gracious prayers and \n     wonderful gifts.\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n       Every day, millions of Americans pray for the safety of our \n     troops, for the protection of innocent life, and for the \n     peace we all hope for. Americans continue to pray for the \n     recovery of the wounded, and to pray for the Almighty's \n     comfort on those who have lost a loved one. We give thanks \n     daily for the brave and decent men and women who wear our \n     nation's uniform, and we thank their families as well.\n       In this country we recognize prayer is a gift from God to \n     every human being. It is a gift that allows us to come before \n     our Maker with heartfelt requests and our deepest hopes. \n     Prayer reminds us of our place in God's creation. It reminds \n     us that when we bow our heads or fall to our knees, we are \n     all equal and precious in the eyes of the Almighty.\n       In prayer, we are reminded that we are never alone in our \n     personal trials or individual suffering. In prayer, we offer \n     our thanksgiving and praise, recognizing our lives, our \n     talents and all that we own ultimately flow from the Creator. \n     And in these moments of our deepest gratitude, the Almighty \n     reminds us that for those to whom much has been given, much \n     is required.\n       In prayer, we open ourselves to God's priority, especially \n     His charge to feed the hungry, to reach out to the poor, to \n     bring aid to the widow or the orphan. By surrendering our \n     will to God's will, we learn to serve His eternal purposes. \n     Through prayer, our faith is strengthened, our hearts are \n     humbled and our lives are transformed. Prayer encourages us \n     to go out into the world and serve.\n       In our country we recognize our fellow citizens are free to \n     profess any faith they choose, or no faith at all. You are \n     equally American if you are a Jew or a Christian or Muslim. \n     You are equally American if you choose not to have faith. It \n     is important America never forget the great freedom to \n     worship as you so choose. (Applause.)\n       What I have found in our country, that whatever our faith, \n     millions of Americans answer the universal call to love your \n     neighbor just like you would like to be loved yourself. Over \n     the past five years we have been inspired by the ways that \n     millions of Americans have answered that call. In the face of \n     terrorist attacks and devastating natural disasters here and \n     around the world, the American people have shown their faith \n     in action again and again. After Katrina, volunteers from \n     churches and mosques and synagogues and other faith-based and \n     community groups opened up their hearts and their homes to \n     the displaced. We saw an outpouring of compassion after the \n     earthquake in Pakistan and the tsunami that devastated entire \n     communities. We live up to God's calling when we provide help \n     for HIV/AIDS victims on the continent of Africa and around \n     the world. In millions of acts of kindness, we have seen the \n     good heart of America.\n       The true strength of this country is not in our military \n     might or in the size of our wallet, it is in the hearts and \n     souls of the American people. (Applause.)\n       I was struck by the comment of a fellow who was rescued \n     from the Gulf Coast and given shelter. He said, ``I didn't \n     think there was so much love in the world.''\n       This morning we come together to recognize the source of \n     that great love. We come together before the Almighty in \n     prayer, to reflect on God's will, to seek His aid, and to \n     respond to His grace.\n       I want to thank you for the fine tradition you continue \n     here today. I pray that our nation will always have the \n     humility to commend our cares to Providence and trust in the \n     goodness of His plans.\n       May God bless you all. (Applause.)\n       Senator Coleman: Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Pryor \n     said that we all pray for you and we want to reiterate that. \n     We know that prayer changes people and prayer changes \n     history, and we send you and the First Lady off with our love \n     and gratitude for spending time with us this morning. We \n     promise to pray like all depends on our prayers. God bless \n     the President and his wife.\n       We are now going to have a concluding song.\n       (Song.) [``Waiting in the Wings.''] (Applause.)\n       Senator Coleman: Ladies and gentlemen, Point of Grace.\n       Senator Pryor: It has been a great morning, hasn't it? \n     (Applause.)\n       One of the highlights of the year of preparation for this \n     prayer breakfast was for Norm and me to place a phone call to \n     Dr. Billy Graham. And, as most of you know, he was deeply \n     involved, and has been deeply involved, in many prayer \n     breakfasts, especially the early ones. In years past he has \n     been very involved in the National Prayer Breakfast and has \n     helped us develop this model over the last 54 years.\n       Senator Coleman: We were asking if Dr. Graham could be with \n     us this morning to say our closing prayer but he said that \n     his health would not allow him to travel. But he wanted us \n     all to greet you in the name of the Lord and he said that he \n     would be right here with us praying. He is a national \n     treasure, and we know his prayers have been answered today. \n     We ask that God would sustain him and continue to give him \n     voice to bring our nation and our world together.\n       And now we have a very special moment to conclude in \n     prayer. When we began to put this breakfast together \n     beginning almost a year ago, our prayer was that it not just \n     be another annual event, but that it address the deepest \n     needs of the world that are unique to this moment in time and \n     history. In the messages we have heard from Bono and the \n     President, we have touched the heart of the world situation \n     today. In addition, we would like all to welcome to the \n     podium a very distinguished guest, a courageous leader in \n     the pursuit of peace in the Middle East, King Abdullah bin \n     al-Hussein II of Jordan. Your Majesty, please join us up \n     here. (Applause.)\n       King Abdullah bin al-Hussein II: Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-\n     Rahim--In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\n       My friend Bono, Senator Coleman, Senator Pryor, all of you, \n     thank you very much for the honor to stand with you today, as \n     a brother with people of faith, to reaffirm our common values \n     and beliefs. The principles that we gather to recognize today \n     are grounded in the firmest of foundations, our scriptural \n     heritage.\n       For Muslims, the essence of the Koran is its opening \n     chapter, Al-Fatiha, each of whose verses echoes the teachings \n     of the Torah and the Gospels. The Koran begins, ``In the name \n     of God, the Infinitely Good, the All-Merciful.'' This \n     reflects the famous verse of the Psalms, ``We will remember \n     the name of our Lord.'' The next line of the Koran, ``Praise \n     be to God, the Lord of the worlds'' reminds us of the words \n     of the Psalm, ``Let every thing that has breath praise the \n     Lord.'' The following line, ``the Infinitely Good, the All-\n     Merciful,'' reaffirms the Psalm ``gracious is the Lord and \n     righteous.'' Yes, our God is merciful. The Koran then \n     confirms that God is master of the day of judgment, as does \n     the Good Book: ``He has prepared his throne for judgment. He \n     shall judge the world in righteousness.''\n       The last three lines of the Fatiha are supplication. ``Thee \n     we worship and Thee we ask for help. Guide us upon the \n     straight path, the path of those on whom is Thy grace, not \n     those upon whom is anger nor those who are astray.'' This \n     recalls the final words that Jesus--may peace and blessings \n     be upon him--taught us in the Lord's Prayer: ``And lead us \n     not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is \n     the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. \n     Amen.''\n       I now ask you all to join in a special prayer for the \n     Middle East, that not one more generation will grow up \n     knowing conflict and injustice, nor suffer from poverty or \n     oppression; that not one more family will lose a loved one to \n     war and bitterness; and that together, Muslim, Jew and \n     Christian, we can create a new future for the Holy Land, a \n     future of hope, a future of promise, a future of peace.\n       Let us remember the words of Amos, the words that Dr. \n     Martin Luther King urged for all peoples and all time: ``Let \n     justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a \n     mighty stream.'' Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n       Senator Pryor: Let us pray. Lord, we are grateful for your \n     presence among us. You made us and you love us, so to be in \n     your presence is what our lives are all about. We stand as \n     people from all walks of life, many backgrounds and \n     traditions, as a circle of friends. We know your love waits \n     in the wings, and we ask you to bring it onto the world \n     stage. We grieve for our fellow human beings who suffer the \n     pain and hardship and bereavement of war and disease. We pray \n     especially for the children. May they somehow escape the \n     destruction, the mental scars that would lead them to want to \n     make war in their own adulthood. Lord, as your servant the \n     King has asked, we pray for the peace of the Middle East. We \n     pray that you would restrain the forces of evil, and raise up \n     and propel forward the leaders of peace.\n       Senator Coleman: Lord, we pray for the people of Africa. We \n     pray that we would each individually in our roles as leaders \n     allow our hearts to be broken by the things that break the \n     heart of the Lord. May we join together in medical solutions \n     and financial solutions and economic solutions which rescue \n     that continent from the problems that it has. We thank you \n     for the joy and faith of the African people. May their \n     example of grace in the face of suffering inspire us all. And \n     Lord, that which we pray for, give us the strength to work \n     for. And together may we say the ancient benediction from the \n     Torah: The Lord bless you and keep you.\n       Senator Pryor: The Lord make his face shine upon you and be \n     gracious to you.\n       Senators Coleman and Pryor: The Lord turn his face toward \n     you and give you peace. And all of God's people together \n     said: Amen.\n       Senator Coleman: Thank you all for coming and go in peace. \n     (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10916-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10916-S10917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RETIREMENT OF JEROLD L. HARRIS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly \nrecognize Jerold L. Harris, president and CEO of U.S. AgBank, FCB, in \nWichita, KS. Jerold will retire in January 2007 following a 43-year \ncareer in the Farm Credit System.\n  Jerold is a native of South Dakota, growing up near Denby. He \nattended high school in Gordon, NE, just across the State line. After \nreceiving a bachelor's degree in agricultural business from Colorado \nState University in 1963, he went to work for the Farm Credit System, \nwhere he has served agriculture and rural America ever since.\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Jerold has demonstrated a \npositive leadership style based on cooperation, mutual respect, and \ntrust. His focus has always been on working toward solutions that serve \nall of agriculture. He exemplifies a statement he often quotes, ``There \nis no limit to progress when people work together.'' Jerold has \ncertainly demonstrated this throughout his career.\n  One particular achievement stands out during Jerold's 43 years of \nservice. In January 2002, the Western Farm Credit Bank in Sacramento, \nCA, entered into a joint management agreement with the Farm Credit Bank \nof Wichita, KS. The board of directors named Jerold as president and \nchief executive officer. Under this agreement, Jerold combined the \noperations of these two banks while developing and implementing a \nmerger strategy that resulted in the merger of the two banks and the \nformation of U.S. AgBank, FCB, effective October 1, 2003. A milestone \nwas achieved with the unanimous approval of the merger by all voting \nstockholders. Following the merger, Jerold quickly leveraged the \noperational and financial strengths of the previous organizations and \nachieved the cost savings anticipated in the joint management agreement \nand merger. He focused the new organization on supporting associations \nin their objective of service to farmers and ranchers. He capitalized \non the synergies created by the merger, increasing patronage and \nlowering costs to associations affiliated with U.S. AgBank. Significant \ncredit goes to Jerold for establishing a culture within the new \ndistrict that is based on trust and mutual respect between the bank and \nassociations. Today, U.S. AgBank covers all or parts of 11 States and \nhas total assets of almost $20 billion.\n  While leading U.S. AgBank, or one of its predecessor institutions, \nJerold implemented utilization of continuous improvement strategies \nthat resulted in streamlined Bank operations, improved effectiveness of \nservices provided to associations, and reduced costs. He improved \ncompetitive pricing and established effective asset/liability \nmanagement, new loan products, sophisticated profitability measurement, \nand cost accounting systems. A correspondent lending function, focused \non the purchase of large loan participations, was developed under his \nleadership. He also led the formation of AgVantis, Inc., a technology \nservice provider for Farm Credit System institutions. Direct lender \nagricultural credit associations and Federal land credit associations \nwere formed and patronage programs that resulted in payment of \nsignificant amounts of patronage to Associations were implemented on \nhis watch.\n  There is an old saying that a true warrior must be tested under fire. \nMany of you will remember the 1980s as a very difficult time for \nagriculture. From 1986 thru 1990, Jerold was the chief executive \nofficer of the jointly managed Ninth District Federal Land Bank \nAssociation and Ninth District Production Credit Association. These \nentities were formed from the merger of 40 farm credit associations \nduring that difficult agricultural lending climate. Jerold was \nsuccessful in establishing an effective management structure for the \nnew associations and achieved financial stability by significantly \nreducing risk and nonearning assets and focusing the organization on \ncustomer service. As agricultural conditions improved, Jerold developed \nand implemented a reorganization plan for the two associations, \nresulting in the establishment of six new production credit \nassociations and eight new Federal land bank associations. While the \n1980s may not be remembered by many in agriculture as a time of great \nreward, Jerold demonstrated the same ability to work with people and \nachieve great things in the difficult times, as he did when agriculture \nwas more prosperous.\n  During his career, Jerold held numerous leadership positions of \nprogressively increasing responsibility and impact in the Farm Credit \nSystem. Jerold has served as a loan officer, an appraiser, a recruiter \nand a trainer, a supervisor and a manager, a leader and a follower, but \nalways with the same dedication and sense of purpose. He mentored a \nlong list of people who continue to serve Farm Credit and agriculture \ntoday, many of whom are in senior positions all around the Farm Credit \nSystem.\n  But Jerold's service was not only on the local or district level, he \nalso served on numerous national or system-wide boards and leadership \ngroups. Jerold served 15 years as a member of the Farm Credit System \nPresidents Planning Committee, during 3 of which he served as chairman. \nJerold also served 11 years on the board of directors of the Federal \nFarm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, with 3 of those years as \nchairman. He also serves on the board of directors of the National \nCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives, NCFC, and is a member of the NCFC \nExecutive Council.\n  Jerold is a familiar face here in Washington, DC. He has represented \nthe Farm Credit System by testifying before the Senate and House \nAgriculture Committees of the U.S. Congress on numerous occasions. \nJerold has always believed in honoring one's responsibilities locally \nbut has also shown that it is possible to support initiatives that will \nprovide benefits for the ``greater good'' of agriculture as well as \nthose system borrowers and owners he served. His honesty and integrity, \nkeen intelligence, and an understanding of people has earned him the \nrespect of his peers, workers, the boards he has served, and the \nfarmers and ranchers he has represented and served.\n  Jerold's tireless efforts to improve agriculture and rural America \nwill be truly missed. His countless contributions and leadership, \nincluding his steady voice of reason, helped ensure access to credit \nfor both those who were and many who were not Farm Credit System \nborrowers. His accomplishments speak volumes about his dedication to \nagriculture and the people who work in agriculture.\n  Jerold and his wife Janet are looking forward to his retirement as an \nopportunity to see old friends, travel to new places, and do a little \nfishing. It is a great pleasure for me to share his impressive record \nof service with my colleagues in the Senate, and I hope this U.S. \nSenate record will stand as an inspiration to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10917-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10917-S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERTA TILL-RETZ\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I wish to pay tribute to a \nvery special Iowan, Roberta Till-Retz, who is retiring this month after \nmore than two and a half decades as a scholar and leader at the \nUniversity of Iowa Labor Center.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that ``the arc of history is long, \nbut it bends toward justice.'' I would add, however, that it doesn't \nbend all by itself. It does so because of the dedication, passion, and \ntireless strivings of people like Roberta Till-Retz.\n  In addition to her work as an instructor at the University of Iowa \nLabor Center, Roberta has worn many other hats. She has been a prolific \nauthor, a respected scholar, an enormously popular teacher, a mentor to \nup-and-coming union activists, and a valued consultant to the labor \ncommunity, not just in Iowa but nationally.\n  One key to Roberta's success is that she is both a student of \norganized labor and also a deeply experienced veteran of the labor \nmovement. Over the years, she has served as executive director of the \nIowa Federation of Labor's Iowa Labor History Oral Project, as vice \npresident of the United Association for Labor Education, and as book \nreview editor for the Labor Studies Journal.\n  Here in Washington, we are daily witness to the persuasion of power. \nBy contrast, Roberta's trademark is the power of persuasion, the \npassion of her advocacy. She is deeply committed to social and economic \njustice, and that is what drives her dedication to unions and \ncollective bargaining. The lesson she has taught to thousands of \nstudents down through the years is that it was organized labor that \nfought for and won the minimum wage, the 40-hour workweek, safe \nworkplace standards, workman's compensation, decent pensions, and \nhealth insurance. And out of those victories emerged the great middle \nclass in this country.\n  So I salute Roberta Till-Retz for a job brilliantly done. As long as \nI have known her, she has always had a tank full of enthusiasm and a \nheart full of dreams, so I am sure that she will continue to contribute \npowerfully to the family of organized labor in Iowa and nationally.\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\n  Our beloved late colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, said that ``the \nfuture belongs to those with passion.'' By that standard, Roberta has a \nvery bright future. And I wish her the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10918-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT STEPHEN CRAYNER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I congratulate a remarkable \nyoung Hoosier and fellow Eagle Scout, Stephen Crayner.\n  Since becoming an Eagle Scout on April 22, 2004, an extraordinary \nachievement in itself, Stephen has continued to work diligently to \nimprove himself and his community, eventually earning all 121 merit \nbadges offered by the Boy Scouts. This dedication has earned him the \ndistinguished rank of Eagle Scout with Three Silver Palms.\n  During my time in the Scouting program, I learned many important \nlessons about leadership, organization, and community spirit. For the \ntroop to be a successful unit, each member must learn to take \ninitiative and offer ideas and energy. He must also develop the ability \nto work in a team environment, and therefore accept the challenge of \ncompromise and negotiation. Finally, the activities and the efforts of \nthe Scouting program reflect a commitment to community involvement. \nStephen's mastery of these lessons will serve him well in the years \nahead.\n  I also appreciate this opportunity to congratulate the members of \nStephen's family who have played such a large role in his many \naccomplishments. Stephen's father David served as Scoutmaster, and his \nmother Libby has volunteered extensively to support the troop. It is \ntelling that Stephen's two older brothers, William and Benjamin, have \nalso earned their Eagle.\n  I am hopeful that each of you will join me in congratulating Stephen \nfor all of his remarkable accomplishments and in wishing him continuing \nsuccess as he pursues new and exciting challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10918-2", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF MR. STAN MINKINOW\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nMr. Stan Minkinow of Huntsville, AL. Mr. Minkinow is an American \npatriot whose life epitomizes the American dream. He immigrated to this \ncountry under the Lodge Act, which provided a pathway for eastern \nEuropean refugees to earn American citizenship through honorable \nservice in the U.S. military. Today we see the result of that \nlegislation in Mr. Minkinow and his lifetime of service to this Nation \nand a family legacy of selfless service.\n  Mr. Minkinow was born in Lodz, Poland, in 1932. Mr. Minkinow and his \nfamily hid from the Gestapo until betrayed and forced to the Warsaw \nGhetto. Mr. Minkinow and his parents survived the severe deprivations \nof ghetto life and accomplished a daring escape. The family survived \nthe war, only to confront postwar life under the harsh control of a \nSoviet-controlled authoritarian regime.\n  Mr. Minkinow's journey to U.S. citizenship began in a German village \nin 1951 where he saw a U.S. Army recruiting film at a train station. \nReady for adventure, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he became a \nmember of the elite, newly created Special Forces training at Fort \nBragg, NC. After marrying Doris, a local girl, the Army sent Sergeant \nMinkinow back to Germany where he became an American Cold Warrior \nserving on the frontlines. He served with the 10th Special Forces Group \nin Bad Tolz from 1955 to 1958.\n  Ambition and achievement are hallmarks of so many of our immigrant \npopulation and Mr. Kinkinow is no exception. He completed Officer \nCandidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the \nInfantry. After a tour in Korea, he completed Army flight school at \nFort Rucker, AL, and became an Army aviator. Mr. Minkinow settled his \nfamily in Enterprise, AL, while he twice fought for his country in \nVietnam. Cited by the Army for valor in combat and service, Mr. \nMinkinow possesses numerous medals, including the Distinguished Flying \nCross, Bronze Star, and the Air Medal.\n  After completing a distinguished 27-year Army career, Mr. Minkinow \nretired to Huntsville, AL, where he has become a prominent local \nbusinessman known for his generosity for local causes and charities. \nMr. Minkinow frequently shares his Holocaust experiences with children \nat local schools, and gave a presentation on his childhood wartime \nexperiences to a class at the National Defense University in \nWashington, DC.\n  Stan and Doris have three adult children in whom they instilled a \nprofound pride of citizenship and an urgent calling to serve the \nNation. All three children have served in the Armed Forces. Their \noldest daughter and her husband together served for over 28 years in \nthe Army. Their son is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and retired \nas a lieutenant colonel from the Alabama Air National Guard. Their \nyoungest daughter and her husband will soon retire from the Army as \ncolonels in the Judge Advocate General's Corps with a combined service \nof 46 years.\n  I applaud Mr. Minkinow and his fellow veterans for their steadfast \ndevotion to this Nation and his many years of service. From a child, \nwide-eyed with fright in the streets of Nazi ghettos, to his brave \nescape from the Soviet fist and subsequent faithful service as a \nsoldier and later as a businessman, Mr. Minkinow epitomizes how this \ngreat country is made even greater by such talented immigrants. We are \na stronger country today because of men like Stan and the contributions \nof his family. I am pleased, to bring this example of Alabama \npatriotism to the Nation's attention as we continue to celebrate those \nwho have served, our veterans, who have assured our freedom and \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10918-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10918-4", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10918-5", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S.435.

A joint resolution adopted by the California \n     Legislature relative to amending the Federal Railroad Safety \n     Act; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, the transportation of freight and passengers by \n     railroad has been an integral part of California's economic \n     infrastructure for nearly 150 years, and remains central to a \n     vibrant economy that Californians hope to continue to enjoy \n     in the 21st century; and\n       Whereas, the regulation of railroad operations is a major \n     objective of California government in order to ensure and \n     promote the health and safety of California's communities and \n     its residents; and\n       Whereas, there has been a significant increase in the past \n     10 years in the number of derailments and accidents on \n     California railways, resulting in injuries, death, and damage \n     within communities where railways exist, and leading to \n     growing attention and concern throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Railroad Safety Act was intended to \n     promote safety in every area of railroad operations and \n     reduce railroad-related accidents and incidents, and has \n     sharply restricted the authority of California and the other \n     states to address rail safety issues, through a broad \n     preemption of state laws; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Railroad Safety Act nevertheless was \n     intended to provide for cooperative state and federal \n     activity to prevent accidents and reduce their severity when \n     they do occur, including allowing states to act where federal \n     officials have not, providing concurrent state safety \n     jurisdiction over railroads at essentially local safety \n     hazards within states, and authorizing delegations of \n     authority to state officials by the Federal Railway \n     Administration; and\n       Whereas, Federal courts have consistently failed to find \n     local safety hazards that would permit California to \n     effectively regulate railway safety so as to anticipate and \n     prevent accidents; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Railroad Administration has failed to \n     institute the necessary rulemakings to develop safety \n     regulations that fully protect California's communities and \n     their residents from railroad derailments, hazardous \n     materials spills, and highway-rail crossing accidents that \n     result in injuries, death, and damage within communities \n     where railways exist; and where the Federal Railroad \n     Administration has exercised jurisdiction, it has precluded \n     states from providing the public with greater safety \n     protections and from reducing the number and severity of \n     railroad derailments, hazardous materials spills, and \n     highway-rail crossing accidents within their jurisdictions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal government has failed to develop \n     comprehensive plans to protect the public health and safety \n     and to effectively fund railway safety programs; and\n       Whereas, California has a history of working with the \n     Federal Railroad Administration in coordinating inspections, \n     and has established and funded extensive railway safety \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, there now exists a clear need to amend federal law \n     in order to empower California officials to protect the \n     public health and safety and to continue to build on the \n     cooperation between California and federal rail safety \n     officials; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to amend the Federal Railroad Safety Act to increase \n     the authority of state and local governments to enact \n     railroad safety regulations providing greater protection for \n     their residents from railroad derailments, hazardous \n     materials spills, and highway-rail crossing accidents, so \n     long as the state enactments, rules, or regulations do not \n     conflict with federal law and do not impose an unreasonable \n     burden on interstate commerce; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Federal Railroad Administration is urged \n     to work cooperatively with California and the railroad \n     corporations by increasing its staff and funding, and by \n     delegating additional authority to California officials to \n     promulgate and enforce standards relating to railway track, \n     operations, and equipment that will prevent and reduce the \n     severity of accidents, derailments, and hazardous materials \n     spills; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-433. A concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Pennsylvania House of Representatives relative to urging the \n     Pennsylvania\n\n[[Page S10921]]\n\n     Congressional Delegation to support legislation calling for \n     Federal approval of the extension of the Lewis and Clark \n     National Historic Trail; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 676\n\n       Whereas, the Lewis and Clark Expedition was conceptualized \n     by President Thomas Jefferson, who appointed his personal \n     secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead the expedition; and\n       Whereas, Meriwether Lewis spent the early months of 1803 in \n     southeastern Pennsylvania, where he trained with the official \n     Surveyor of the United States, Andrew Ellicott, in Lancaster \n     County and received instruction in celestial navigation; was \n     tutored in botany by Benjamin Smith Barton, professor of \n     natural history and botany at the University of Pennsylvania \n     in Philadelphia; gained know1edge of latitude and longitude, \n     botany and fossils from University of Pennsylvania's vice-\n     provost and professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, \n     Robert Patterson; received advice on health standards to \n     maintain on the trail, diet and internal cleansing from Dr. \n     Benjamin Rush, professor at the University of Pennsylvania's \n     Institute of Medicine and Clinical Practice; and studied \n     paleontology and anatomy with Caspar Wistar, another noted \n     Philadelphian; and\n       Whereas, Meriwether Lewis purchased more than 3,500 pounds \n     of equipment and merchandise from 28 Philadelphia merchants \n     and artisan manufacturers providing life necessities for the \n     28-month venture, including portable shelter, clothing, \n     illumination, Indian trading goods, weapons, powder and ball, \n     health maintenance items, emergency food, navigational and \n     cartographic instruments, construction tools and packing \n     boxes, and all was loaded in a Conestoga wagon along with \n     supplies requisitioned at the United States Arsenal, also \n     known as Schuylkill Arsenal, for shipment to Pittsburgh; \n     and\n       Whereas, renowned Philadelphia clock and gun maker Isaiah \n     Lukens provided Meriwether Lewis with a compressed air rifle \n     he made which became a showpiece of the expedition: the stock \n     of the pneumatic rifle served as an air reservoir to shoot \n     its .31 caliber bullet, producing no smoke and little noise \n     and using no black powder, an astounding innovation during an \n     era when ``keep your powder dry'' was a hallmark admonition \n     to outdoorsmen; and\n       Whereas, after obtaining more equipment, including his iron \n     frame boat, from the United States Army Arsenal in Harpers \n     Ferry, Virginia, and hiring a wagon and horses in \n     Fredericktown, Maryland, Meriwether Lewis traveled with his \n     second wagon through Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and finally \n     reached Redstone Old Fort (now Brownsville, Fayette County); \n     and\n       Whereas, Meriwether Lewis arrived in Pittsburgh on July 15, \n     1803, where he received a letter from President Thomas \n     Jefferson informing him that the United States had acquired \n     the Louisiana Purchase from France; and\n       Whereas, on August 31, 1803, Meriwether Lewis departed \n     Pittsburgh at 10 a.m. in a pirogue and a 55-foot masted \n     keelboat built either by Captain John Walker at the Bayard's \n     boat yard in Elizabeth, or by Eliphalet Beebe at a boatyard \n     operated by John Tarascon and James Berthoud on land owned by \n     William Greenough, near what is now the north end of the \n     Liberty Bridge in Pittsburgh; and\n       Whereas, after launching the crafts with a party of 11 men, \n     Meriwether Lewis traveled three miles down the Ohio River to \n     Brunot Island where he demonstrated his air rifle, and then \n     proceeded downriver to McKees Rock, where the water had \n     fallen so low that the crew was forced to raise the boat for \n     30 yards; and\n       Whereas, Meriwether Lewis and his party continued downriver \n     until the pirogue began to leak, forcing him to purchase a \n     canoe at Georgetown, Beaver County, before continuing to \n     Wheeling, West Virginia, where supplies from Pittsburgh were \n     loaded; and\n       Whereas, on October 15, 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William \n     Clark met in Louisville, Kentucky, and continued their \n     expedition west with their Corps of Discovery on a quest to \n     find and map a transcontinental water route to the Pacific \n     Ocean; and\n       Whereas, the expedition reached the Pacific Ocean in \n     November 1805 and built Fort Clatsop on the south side of the \n     Columbia River in Oregon; and\n       Whereas, Meriwether Lewis returned in April 1807 to \n     Philadelphia where he commissioned John James Barralet to \n     paint a likeness of the Great Falls of the Missouri; arranged \n     for noted horticulturist William Hamilton to propagate seeds \n     gathered in the West at the renowned greenhouses adjacent to \n     Hamilton's residence, The Woodlands; sat for a portrait \n     painted by Charles Willson Peale; worked with preeminent \n     ornithologist Alexander Wilson, who arranged the painting of \n     four birds the Corps of Discovery found in the West--Lewis's \n     woodpecker, Clark's nutcracker, the western tanager and the \n     black-billed magpie; and\n       Whereas, the expedition led by Meriwether Lewis and William \n     Clark ``from sea to shining sea'' mapped a western route and \n     resulted in the discovery of hundreds of species new to \n     science and collection of natural history specimens; and\n       Whereas, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia \n     houses 226 of these original plant specimens, still mounted \n     on the original sheets of linen paper and labeled in the \n     handwriting of Meriwether Lewis; and\n       Whereas, a journal kept by Meriwether Lewis during the \n     expedition, contained in 18 small notebooks, was edited by \n     Philadelphia literary figure Nicholas Biddle, with the final \n     revision completed by Paul Allen before its publication by \n     the Philadelphia firm of Bradford and Inskeep in 1814 as \n     ``History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains \n     Lewis and Clark to the Sources of the Missouri, Thence Across \n     the Rocky Mountains and Down the River Columbia to the \n     Pacific Ocean''; original journals of Meriwether Lewis and \n     William Clark are held by the American Philosophical Society \n     Library in Philadelphia; and\n       Whereas, while the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail \n     currently begins at Camp River Dubois near Hartford, \n     Illinois, and continues through 11 states, ending in Oregon, \n     the significant representation of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and many Pennsylvanians in the planning and \n     preparations which launched the Lewis and Clark search for \n     the Gateway to the West and in the expansion of knowledge \n     from the expedition which is recognized as a foundation of \n     our American heritage is not included in the Lewis and Clark \n     National Historic Trail; and\n       Whereas, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania joins the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage \n     Foundation in supporting the recognition of a continuous \n     Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail which would include \n     nine additional eastern states of Pennsylvania, Delaware, \n     Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana \n     and Tennessee and the District of Columbia and would complete \n     the story of the expedition and expose a broader base of \n     Americans to the educational and cultural aspects of the \n     expedition; Now, therefore be, it\n       Resolved, (the Senate concurring), That the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the \n     Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation to support legislation \n     calling for Federal approval of the extension of the Lewis \n     and Clark National Historic Trail; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     each member of the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-434. A resolution adopted by the Pennsylvania House of \n     Representatives relative to urging the President and Congress \n     of the United States to enact bills that would add denatonium \n     benzoate to antifreeze containing ethylene glycol; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 835\n\n       Whereas, each year a number of adults intentionally ingest \n     antifreeze to commit suicide; and\n       Whereas, each year a number of children are accidentally \n     exposed to antifreeze left unattended or in open containers; \n     and\n       Whereas, pets and other animals can die from ingesting \n     antifreeze that has leaked, spilled or been left in \n     improperly secured containers in a garage or driveway; and\n       Whereas, the National Safety Council, the American Medical \n     Association and the American Association of Poison Control \n     Centers have noted that the addition of a nontoxic bittering \n     agent can make antifreeze so unpalatable that adults, \n     children and animals will reject these products upon tasting \n     them, preventing injury and death; and\n       Whereas, legislation, in the form of S. 1110 and H.R. 2567, \n     has been introduced in the 109th Congress to require the \n     inclusion of denatonium benzoate at a minimum of 30 parts per \n     million as a bittering agent to any engine coolant or \n     antifreeze that contains more than 10% ethylene glycol; and\n       Whereas, the Doris Day Animal League, the Humane Society of \n     the United States, the American Veterinary Medical \n     Association, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation, \n     the Pet Food Institute, the United States Conference of \n     Mayors, the Consumer Specialty Products Association and the \n     retail antifreeze industry have endorsed the proposed \n     legislation with the goal of protecting consumers and animals \n     and\n       Whereas, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania supports protecting the health and safety of \n     adults, children and animals through the inclusion of a \n     bittering agent in ethylene glycol-based antifreeze; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the President and Congress \n     of the United States to protect adults, children and animals \n     by enacting legislation, S. 1110 or H.R. 2567, to require the \n     addition of denatonium benzoate to antifreeze containing \n     ethylene glycol; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urge the \n     Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation to protect adults, \n     children and animals by supporting enactment of this \n     legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urge the \n     President of the United States to advance this legislation to \n     protect adults, children and animals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-435. A joint resolution adopted by the California \n     Legislature relative to urging the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to adopt federal regulations \n     limiting emissions from marine vessels, locomotives, and \n     aircraft; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, California is a global gateway for trade, with \n     more than 40 percent of all of the goods imported to the \n     United States entering through California's ports; and\n       Whereas, growth in the movement of goods through \n     California's ports is projected to double or triple over the \n     next 25 years; and\n       Whereas, toxic diesel air pollution from goods movement \n     sources, such as marine vessels and locomotives, will \n     increase in the face of this growth, unless more protective \n     control actions are undertaken; and\n       Whereas,the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and \n     agency of the United Nations, has established initial smog-\n     forming NOx emissions limitations and fuel sulfur \n     specifications for oceangoing vessels, and the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted emission \n     standards for new locomotives, new trucks, and some vessels; \n     and\n       Whereas, current international and federal standards \n     governing air pollution from port-related sources are not \n     sufficient to support attainment of federal health-based air \n     quality standards in areas with growing emissions from port-\n     related sources; and\n       Whereas, rules adopted by the EPA and the IMO have not \n     adequately reduced emissions from sources associated with the \n     ports; and\n       Whereas, the EPA has not regulated emissions from foreign \n     flag vessels. The vast majority of oceangoing vessels calling \n     on local ports, over 90 percent, are foreign flagged; and\n       Whereas, the EPA stated that it will consider adopting \n     emission standards for foreign flag vessels in 2007; and\n       Whereas, the IMO emissions and fuel standards for foreign \n     flag vessels are particularly weak. IMO smog-forming \n     NOx standards for new ``Category 3'' vessels will \n     achieve only a 6-percent reduction in emissions. IMO fuel \n     rules allow extraordinarily high levels of sulfur content; \n     and\n       Whereas, Federal emission standards for locomotives are \n     relatively lenient. Even the newest locomotives must only \n     achieve a 57-percent reduction in NOx emissions. \n     In contrast, most onroad and stationary sources are \n     controlled to over 90 percent. EPA has stated it intends to \n     adopt more stringent locomotive emission standards in 2006; \n     and\n       Whereas, port-related sources emit substantial and growing \n     quantities of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and other air \n     contaminants; and\n       Whereas, locomotives and marine vessels emit diesel \n     exhaust, a toxic air contaminant; and\n       Whereas, diesel emissions are responsible for 70 percent of \n     the cancer risk from air toxics emissions in California; and\n       Whereas, the EPA has stated that diesel exhaust is likely \n     to be carcinogenic for humans; and\n       Whereas, part or all of 474 counties in 32 states are \n     classified nonattainment for either failing to meet the new \n     eight-hour federal ozone standard or for causing a downwind \n     county to fail to meet that standard; and\n       Whereas, one hundred fifty-nine million people nationwide \n     live in areas that do not meet the new eight-hour federal \n     ozone standard; and\n       Whereas, all areas of the country could benefit from the \n     reduction in emissions of toxic air contaminants from \n     locomotives, and many areas would benefit from reduction in \n     those emissions from marine vessels; and\n       Whereas, emissions from mobile sources, including \n     locomotives, marine vessels, and aircraft, are preventing \n     California from achieving state and federal clean air \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, the EPA has authority to adopt regulations \n     establishing emissions standards for marine vessels, \n     locomotives, and aircraft; and\n       Whereas, Federal law mandates that the state adopt rules to \n     attain national ambient air quality standards, but limits \n     state and local authority to adopt certain regulations \n     establishing emissions standards for aircraft, new \n     locomotives, and new locomotive engines; and\n       Whereas, Federal regulations define new locomotives and new \n     locomotive engines to include remanufactured locomotives and \n     engines so as to restrict state authority to adopt some \n     regulations establishing emissions standards for these older \n     locomotives; and\n       Whereas, locomotives have extremely long useful lives and \n     older locomotives emit air contaminants at relatively high \n     rates; and\n       Whereas, State and local governments seeking to control \n     emissions from marine vessels have faced arguments by vessel \n     operators that state and local governments lack authority to \n     adopt laws establishing emission limits for foreign flag \n     vessels; and\n       Whereas, stringent regulations in California have reduced \n     emissions by over 90 percent from most significant stationary \n     sources and from motor vehicles and other mobile sources \n     under the jurisdiction of state and local authorities in \n     California, but locomotives, marine vessels, and aircraft \n     have been controlled far less stringently by the Federal \n     government, and have not achieved their fair share of \n     emission reductions needed to meet State and Federal clean \n     air standards; and\n       Whereas, until locomotives, marine vessels, and aircraft \n     are required to achieve their fair share of emission \n     reductions, other mobile sources such as passenger cars, \n     buses, and commercial trucks, as well as stationary sources, \n     including large and small businesses in California will have \n     to make up the difference; and\n       Whereas, the ports have developed ambitious programs and \n     plans but, to date, they have not rolled back emissions or \n     even arrested emissions growth. Both the Port of Los Angeles \n     and the Port of Long Beach have developed emission control \n     programs and plans that will help mitigate air quality \n     impacts, but the fact remains that the ports continue to be \n     sources of singularly large and growing quantities of diesel \n     emissions; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully \n     memorializes the Administrator of the EPA urging the \n     administrator to adopt Federal regulations limiting emissions \n     from marine vessels, locomotives, and aircraft in order to \n     achieve healthful air quality in California and other areas \n     with air quality problems; and be it further\n       Resolved, That those Federal regulations mandate use and \n     improvement of state-of-the-art emission control and \n     prevention technologies at the earliest feasible date, be \n     comparably stringent to State and local air pollution control \n     requirements so that operators of locomotives, marine \n     vessels, and aircraft contribute their fair share to support \n     air quality attainment plans, and implement Congress' intent \n     that State and local air quality authorities be allowed to \n     adopt rules establishing emissions standards for \n     remanufactured locomotives; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully encourages the \n     EPA to pursue more protective regulations and incentive \n     programs to reduce substantially the emissions from marine \n     vessels, including domestic and foreign flagged vessels, \n     locomotives, and aircraft, with the level of emissions \n     sufficiently reduced to help regions polluted by trade-\n     related diesel emissions attain Federal health-based \n     standards by the dates required by the Clean Air Act, Federal \n     regulations, and corresponding State implementation plans; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     United States Environmental Protections Agency, to the United \n     States Coast Guard, and to the author for appropriate \n     distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-436. A resolution adopted by the Massachusetts State \n     Senate relative to memorializing the fiftieth anniversary of \n     the 1965 Hungarian Revolution for Freedom and Democracy; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, following World War II, the Soviet Union occupied \n     Hungary and forced an anti-democratic and brutal government \n     upon the people of Hungary; and\n       Whereas, on October 23, 1956, Hungarian freedom fighters, \n     the Time magazine 1956 ``Man of the Year'', took up arms in \n     Hungary to establish a democratic government and free the \n     people of Hungary from oppression by ending the political and \n     economic domination by the communist government and the \n     Soviet Union; and\n       Whereas, the people of Hungary fought valiantly but alone, \n     and in the course of the uprising thousands gave their lives, \n     thousands were imprisoned, and over 150,000 escaped, many to \n     the United States, including Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, in 1956, the brave Hungarians were the first to \n     rebel against the totalitarian and oppressive communist \n     government and their sacrifices exposed the weaknesses of the \n     communist system; and\n       Whereas, the Hungarians in 1989 were again instrumental in \n     the collapse of communism as they dismantled the Iron Curtain \n     and allowed the East Germans to leave Eastern Europe through \n     Hungary, actions that eventually led to the fall of the \n     Berlin Wall; and\n       Whereas, the sacrifices of the Hungarians in 1956 were not \n     in vain, as they ultimately led to the collapse of most of \n     the communist systems of the world and freedom for hundreds \n     of millions of people; and\n       Whereas, the Massachusetts Senate supports the current \n     efforts of people of all nations to assert the right of self-\n     determination and other basic human rights for which the \n     Hungarian people bravely fought in 1956; and\n       Whereas, October 23, 2006, is the 50th anniversary of the \n     ultimately successful uprising of the people of Hungary, \n     which still serves as an example that sacrifices must be made \n     for the freedom and democracy; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Massachusetts Senate commends the people \n     of Hungary for their sacrifices for freedom and democracy, \n     and joins in celebrating October 23, 2006, as ``Hungarian \n     Freedom Fighters' Day'' in the Commonwealth; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to Honorary Consul Gabor \n     Garai, to each member of the Massachusetts Congressional \n     Delegation, the Honorable George H.

A resolution adopted by the Michigan Senate \n     relative to urging Congress\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\n     to support the National Cancer Institute's plan to eliminate \n     suffering and death from cancer by the year 2015; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 152\n\n       Whereas, each year more than 1.4 million Americans are \n     diagnosed with cancer. One out of every two men and one out \n     of every three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their \n     lifetimes. In 1971, Congress began the battle against cancer \n     with enactment of the National Cancer Act and creation of the \n     National Cancer Institute within the National Institutes of \n     Health. The foundation laid by their foresight puts the \n     nation in position to aggressively enter the final stages of \n     the fight against cancer. Sixty designated cancer research \n     centers have been established across the country by the \n     National Cancer Institute. These centers have the capacity to \n     share knowledge with each other and solve problems in real \n     time through advances in computer technology as well as work \n     collaboratively with researchers in other disciplines, such \n     as engineering, to develop the technologies needed to fight \n     cancer; and\n       Whereas, scientific research on the human genome and \n     proteins have led to breakthroughs in our understanding of \n     the molecular changes that cause cancer and differences \n     between the same cancers in different patients. This \n     understanding makes it possible to design therapies that \n     target the cancer and bypass healthy tissues that will \n     eliminate the suffering caused by collateral damage to normal \n     tissues from chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Therapies \n     can also be modified to account for the cancer's response to \n     a given treatment in individual patients. Doctors believe it \n     is within their grasp to cure or manage cancer similar to \n     other chronic diseases that a person can live with and not \n     necessarily die from; and\n       Whereas, concurrent advances in imaging technologies and \n     knowledge networking mean scientists and doctors will be able \n     to see and assess the impact of treatment within days and not \n     have to wait months or years to know the outcome. Imaging \n     technologies now show not only the physical size, shape, and \n     location of cancer tissue, but can also show the function of \n     the tissue. Thus, doctors may apply a treatment targeting the \n     abnormal cells that make up the cancer tissue and be able to \n     see within 24 to 48 hours whether the treatment is altering \n     function in the expected way. Knowledge networking through \n     computers in real time means scientists and doctors working \n     across the country at the 60 centers sponsored by the \n     National Cancer Institute can share what they have learned. \n     This will be particularly valuable with rare forms of cancer \n     as doctors will pool their experience with patients being \n     treated in different centers; and\n       Whereas, tremendous advances in the treatment and cure of \n     cancer have been achievcd in the past 35 years, and this \n     nation has never shied away from bold goals to advance \n     science and technology. The director of the National Cancer \n     Institute has shown great leadership, enthusiasm, and \n     optimism for being able to harness what we know and catapult \n     the scientific and clinical communities forward through the \n     final stage of the battle against cancer; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize Congress to \n     support the National Cancer Institute's plan to eliminate \n     suffering and death from cancer by the year 2015; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-438. A joint resolution adopted by the California \n     Legislature relative to urging Congress and the President to \n     enact the Microbicide Development Act; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, microbicides are a promising new prevention tool \n     that could slow down the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in \n     the United States and around the world; and\n       Whereas, women and girls are the new face of HIV/AIDS and \n     account for almost one-half of the 37 million adults living \n     with HIV and AIDS worldwide as of 2005, and approximately \n     7,000 women are infected with HIV each day; and\n       Whereas, in California, women comprise about 8 percent of \n     all reported AIDS cases, yet are the fastest growing \n     population with AIDS, and sex with an HIV-infected male is \n     the most common route of transmission; and\n       Whereas, AIDS is now the number one cause of death among \n     African-American women between the ages of 25 and 34 years; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States has the highest rates of \n     sexually transmitted diseases of any industrialized nation, \n     with more than 19 million new STD infections every year; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that by age 25 one-half of all \n     sexually active people in the United States can expect to be \n     infected with a STD; and\n       Whereas, HIV and AIDS result in direct medical costs of \n     more than $15 billion per year and the pandemic undermines \n     our economy and security; and\n       Whereas, microbicides may be formulated as gels, creams, or \n     rings to inactivate, block, or otherwise interfere with the \n     transmission of the pathogens that cause AIDS and other STDs, \n     allowing women to protect themselves from disease; and\n       Whereas, unlike current HIV prevention methods, \n     microbicides would allow women to both conceive children and \n     protect themselves from HIV and STDs; and\n       Whereas, the microbicide field has achieved an \n     extraordinary amount of scientific momentum, with several \n     first-generation candidates now in large scale human trials \n     around the world; and\n       Whereas, microbicides are a classic public health good, for \n     which the social benefits are high but the economic incentive \n     to private investment is low and, like other public health \n     goods such as vaccines, public funding must fill the gap; and\n       Whereas, the federal government needs to make a strong \n     commitment to microbicides research and development, and \n     while three agencies--the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \n     and the United States Agency for International Development \n     (USAID)--have played important roles, further strong, well-\n     coordinated, and visible public sector leadership is \n     essential for the promise of microbicides to be fully \n     realized; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, NIH spent less than 2 percent of its HIV/\n     AIDS research budget on microbicides, and that funding level \n     is inadequate; and\n       Whereas, HIV and STD prevention strategies must recognize \n     women's unique needs and vulnerabilities if women are to have \n     a genuine opportunity to protect themselves, and their best \n     opinion is the rapid development of new HIV prevention \n     techniques such as microbicides; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature memorializes the \n     United States Congress and the President and the United \n     States to enact the Microbicide Development Act (S. 550 and \n     H.R. 3854), which would amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to facilitate the development of microbicides for preventing \n     the transmission of HIV and other diseases, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, and each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-439.

He spoke out \n     fervently in favor of the union during the Civil War and is \n     credited with saving California from becoming a separate \n     republic; and\n       Whereas, Thomas Starr King can best be memorialized by \n     locating his statute in a place of honor in the Capitol of \n     California where citizens and visitors can enjoy it and be \n     reminded of his significant historical impact upon our state; \n     and\n       Whereas, California has a citizen, Ronald Wilson Reagan, \n     who is exceptionally worthy of national commemoration. He \n     stands alone in California history as beloved actor, \n     President of the Screen Actors Guild, two-term Governor of \n     California, and two-term President of the United States; and\n       Whereas, affectionately known as the ``Great \n     Communicator,'' Ronald Wilson Reagan served as the 40th \n     President of the United States and was the first Governor of \n     California to be elected President of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the people of California wish to place a statue of \n     Ronald Wilson Reagan in Statuary Hall in the United States \n     Capitol, with the statue being provided by the citizens of \n     California through the efforts of the Ronald Reagan \n     Presidential Foundation; and\n       Whereas, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation shall \n     select a commission to represent the state in selecting the \n     sculptor or sculptors to sculpt the statue and obtain the \n     necessary funds to carry out this resolution; and\n       Whereas, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation shall be \n     responsible for all of the following:\n       (a) Forming a commission to select the sculptor or \n     sculptors.\n       (b) Paying the sculptor or sculptors to carve or cast the \n     statue.\n       (c) Creating a pedestal and desired inscription.\n       (d) Transporting the statue and pedestal to the United \n     States Capitol.\n       (e) Removing and transporting the replaced statue of Thomas \n     Starr King back to the California State Capitol.\n       (f) Temporarily erecting the new statue of Ronald Wilson \n     Reagan in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol for the \n     unveiling ceremony.\n       (g) Paying the expenses related to the unveiling ceremony \n     and any other expenses\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\n     that the commission may find necessary to incur in \n     implementing this resolution; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the Congress of the \n     United States to place a statute of Ronald Wilson Reagan \n     alongside the statute of Father Junipero Serra in the \n     Congressional collection representing the State of \n     California; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-440.

A bill to prohibit Federal funding for the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic \nCooperation and Development, which receives 25 percent of its budget \nfrom the U.S., has used U.S. taxpayer money in turn to encourage and \nsupport higher taxes on the U.S. taxpayer, in addition to its support \nof U.N. global tax schemes.\n  The OECD has endorsed and encouraged higher taxes, new taxes, and \nglobal taxes no fewer than 24 times in reports with titles such as \n``Towards Global Tax Cooperation,'' in which the OECD identifies 35 \nnations guilty of ``harmful tax competition.''\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\n  They have advocated that the U.S. adopt a costly and bureaucratic \nvalue added tax, a 40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a \nfertilizer tax, ending the deductibility of State and local taxes from \nFederal taxes, new taxes at the State level, and a host of other new \nand innovative taxes on U.S. citizens.\n  It is not only the recommending of higher taxes which concerns us; \nthe ultimate concern is the movement towards undermining U.S. \nsovereignty. Ecogroups such as the Friends of the Earth want the OECD \nto declare that dam-building for flood control and electronic power is \nunacceptable as ``sustainable energy.'' In May, 2005 the OECD ministers \nendorsed a proposal at the U.N. to create a system of global taxes.\n  The OECD has stated explicitly that low-tax policies ``unfairly erode \nthe tax bases of other countries and distort the location of capital \nand services.'' What we have here are Paris-based bureaucrats seeking \nto protect high-tax welfare states from the free market.\n  That is why the OECD goes on to say that free-market tax competition \n``may hamper the application of progressive tax rates and the \nachievement of redistributive goals.'' Clearly, free market tax \ncompetition makes it harder to implement socialistic welfare states. \nThe free market evidently hasn't been fair to socialistic welfare \nstates. Well, it's a good thing that they have the OECD and nearly $100 \nmillion in U.S. taxpayer money to protect them.\n  Noted economist Walter Williams clearly sees the direction in which \nthis is headed when he says that ``the bottom line agenda for the OECD \nis to establish a tax cartel where nations get together and collude on \ntaxes.'' Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill seconded that when he said \nthat he was ``troubled by the underlying premise that low tax rates are \nsomehow suspect and by the notion that any country should interfere in \nany other country's'' tax policy. And John Bolton argues that the \nOECD's approach ``represents a kind of worldwide centralization of \ngovernments and interest groups.'' Who do you think bears the costs for \nall this? Mr. Bolton answers and you probably guessed it--the United \nStates.\n  America's proud history of independence was driven in no small part \nby the desire for sovereignty over taxation powers. In this context, it \nmakes no sense to relegate our sovereignty over tax policy, in any way, \nto international bureaucrats.\n  It is very simple. U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund a bunch of \ninternational bureaucrats who write, speak, organize, and advocate in \nsupport of higher taxes, global taxes, and the gradual erosion of \nAmerican sovereignty over its domestic fiscal policies. I think that \nmost Americans would be outraged to learn that they are forced to \nsubsidize these types of activities with their tax dollars. I think \nthat they shouldn't have to any longer. That's why I am introducing \nlegislation today to remove the United State's contributions to the \nOECD.

A bill to provide sufficient resources to permit electronic \nsurveillance of United States persons for foreign intelligence purposes \nto be conducted pursuant to individualized court-based orders for calls \noriginating in the United States, to provide additional resources to \nenhance oversight and streamline the procedures of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to ensure review of the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program by the United States Supreme Court, and \nfor other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which I have captioned as the ``Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Oversight and Resource Enactment Act of 2006.'' This is a \nmodification of legislation which had been introduced by the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Feinstein, and myself and passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  If it is in accordance with the rules, I ask that this bill be held \nat the desk.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to provide for oversight on the \nadministration's electronic surveillance program which has been in \neffect for many years and which was publicly disclosed in mid-December \nlast year. We now are at a state where the provisions of earlier \nlegislation which I introduced, which would call for judicial review by \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, are no longer necessary. \nEvents have overtaken the situation, with litigation having been \nstarted in a number of district courts, and a decision has come out of \nthe U.S. district court in Detroit. The issue is now on appeal to the \nSixth Circuit, and there is no longer any need to provide for a \nreferral to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court because the \nmatter is now in litigation and will be carried through on the \nappellate process.\n  The legislation which I am introducing tracks the Feinstein-Specter \nbill in that it provides additional resources to the administration. It \nexpands the time when the administration can get approval for an \nelectronic surveillance that has already been accomplished. With these \nadditional resources, I am advised that the NSA will be in a position \nto have individual warrants for all calls which originate in the United \nStates and go overseas. The bill does not touch the calls which \noriginate overseas and come through checkpoints or transmission in the \nUnited States and go back overseas, where both the point of origin and \nthe point of conclusion is overseas. And, we do not deal with calls \nwhich originate overseas and come into the United States.\n  The President has contended that notwithstanding the provisions of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that it is the exclusive way \nto get a wiretap warrant, he has article II power. And, there will be a \ntest of that in the court system, which is now underway. That test will \ninvolve what the courts have said is the balancing test: the invasion \nof privacy versus the value for law enforcement and for national \nsecurity. So that as to calls to repeat--when they originate overseas \nand come into the United States, that will be the issue which will \nremain to be tested.\n  This proposal does not deal with the existing language that the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive remedy, nor does \nit deal with any assertion about the article II power of the President.\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\n  It has been my view, expressed on the floor on a number of occasions, \nthat the article II power is what it is, congressional power is what it \nis, and if there is genuine article II power, then it supersedes an act \nof Congress because the Constitution trumps an act of Congress. This \nlegislation does not deal with those issues which had created what I \nthought was a needless controversy.\n  The bill further provides that there will be review by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. I think there doubtless would be review by \nthe Supreme Court as a matter of course, but in order not to take any \nchance on that, Congress has the authority to mandate review with the \nSupreme Court, and this bill does that.\n  In addition, the legislation provides for expedited review so that \nthere will be a judicial determination as to the constitutionality of \nwhat the President has done with respect to the calls originating \noverseas and ending in the United States. I think this bill is a \nsignificant advance in protecting civil liberties by having \nindividualized warrants on calls which originate in the United States \nand which go overseas.\n  We have had this electronic surveillance in existence for a long \ntime. The effort which I have made has been to have it subjected to \njudicial review, and it is my hope that this stripped-down legislation, \nwhich does enhance civil liberties by providing for individual warrants \non calls originating in the United States and expedited review in the \nFederal courts and expedited review by the Supreme Court, would be \nacceptable.\n  We have time yet in this session this year to legislate on this \nimportant subject.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was trying, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania spoke, to figure out exactly what bill it is he is \nspeaking of. I gather this is his bill, not our bill, on which he is \nadding some of our bill's provisions, but he leaves out the critical \npart, which is reinforcing the exclusive authority of FISA; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the exclusive authority of FISA remains. \nThis bill does not touch that. FISA is now the law of the land, and \nFISA says that it is the exclusive remedy for wiretapping. This \nlegislation which I am introducing does not alter that, so it remains \nas provided in FISA that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is \nthe exclusive remedy for wiretapping.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, a second question: Will this bill allow the \nPresident to use his plenary authority to wiretap outside of FISA, \nfirst, and secondly, will it allow for program authority for wiretaps?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It does not deal with program authority at all. That was \nin the original legislation that I introduced as a way of getting the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review the program. But this \ndoes not deal with that, and it does not give the President any \nenhanced authority at all to conduct warrantless wiretaps. The bill \ndoesn't deal with that.\n  Whatever authority the President has under article II, he has. What \nthis bill does is submit for expedited review by the Supreme Court a \ndetermination as to whether the President has article II power to have \na warrantless wiretap with a call that originates overseas and ends in \nthe United States.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Again, through the Chair, if the Senator will put up \nwith this for a moment more, is that to handle the switching issue, or \nwould this apply to all calls coming in from outside the United States \nare exempt?\n  Mr. SPECTER. To repeat, the bill I am introducing does not touch that \npoint. The bill I am introducing leaves the status quo on that point, \nand that is where some contend that it is illegal to have a wiretap \nwhere the call originates outside the United States and comes inside. \nThe contention is made that it's governed by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and is, therefore, illegal. The President has a \ndifferent argument. He is asserting article II power as Commander in \nChief, and he says that his article II power, constitutional power, \nsupersedes or trumps a statute. Whether he is right or wrong depends \nupon a judicial interpretation. Only the court can weigh, as the \nexisting law is in this area, whether the importance of national \nsecurity outweighs the invasion of privacy, and that determination is \nreserved for the Federal courts.\n  We are now having that determination in the Detroit case, ACLU v. \nNSA, where the district judge says it is unconstitutional and the Sixth \nCircuit now has taken the case. They have issued a stay, in effect, but \nthey will take up the case on the merits.\n  Once the litigation is this far advanced, we are not now in the \nsituation we were in last December when the Judiciary Committee, as the \nSenator from California knows, had four hearings and I had a bill to \nsubmit to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That is bypassed \nnow. Events have overtaken it.\n  This will provide for judicial review. It is my thought--and the \nSenator from California and I have talked about this again and again \nand have worked on her bill which I supported, voted out of committee \n10 to 8 with 2 Republicans and 8 Democrats--this will expedite a \ndetermination as to whether all those calls originating overseas and \ncoming in are or are not constitutionally tapped. And, it will help out \nwith what the Senator from California has been the leader on--and that \nis to have individualized warrants for calls originating in the United \nStates. That is a big advance on civil liberties if those calls are not \ntapped without a warrant.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. He has been a very distinguished \nchairman of the committee. This is an issue in which, as a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee and Judiciary Committee, I have had an \nintense interest. The Senator from Pennsylvania recognizes that. I \nappreciate that.\n  I am unsure whether this bill is for the purpose of judicial review \nof the President's article II authority--I think I understand what the \nSenator is doing. He is essentially exempting all those calls which \ncome into the United States, not calls from point A to point B in the \nUnited States. I think that bears further discussion, but I trust no \naction will be taken on this bill in this session but that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is submitting it as a marker for next year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be my hope that we could act on \nit this session. I say that, subject to review by the Senator from \nCalifornia and by other Members and by the House of Representatives. \nThe Senator from California and I and others have thought about this \nissue long and hard. This bill is a real effort to try to accommodate \nall of the concerns the Senator from California has raised. That is to \nmaintain the status of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as the \nexclusive way to wiretap. That stands.\n  There is no statement about the authority of the President under \narticle II, which had been objected to before. As I say, whatever the \nconstitutional authority is, it is, regardless of what the bill says, \nbut this bill says nothing about that. It says nothing.\n\n  The Senator from California and I have wanted to have individualized \nwarrants wherever we could get them, and now the Senator from \nCalifornia took the lead on this. She has had access to this program, \nwhere I have not, because she is on the Intelligence Committee. It is \nanomalous that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee would not know \nthe program, but I respect the division which gives that intelligence \nto the oversight committee. But she and I both wanted to have \nindividualized warrants everywhere if we could get them. And, now we \nknow we can get them on calls originating in the United States if we \nadd the resources that were in the legislation crafted initially by the \nSenator from California, which I joined, which passed out of committee \nand onto the floor. And it does not deal with the ones overseas into \nthe United States. Whatever authority the President has on that, he is \ngoing to have to assert in Federal court and satisfy ultimately the \nSupreme Court that he has that article II power. My view is the sooner \nwe have this determination, the better off we are.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman. I would like to look very \nclosely\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nat this bill. I am very reluctant to move right now. You have mentioned \nthe case percolating up through the courts now. I am really unsure why \npassage of this bill now would achieve anything. It seems to me it \nwould be better to wait and see what the court does. I would appreciate \nyour response to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am glad to respond, and I thank the \nSenator from California for the question. It would achieve \nindividualized review of warrants on calls originating in the United \nStates, and there are a lot of them. How many there are, I don't know, \nbut the NSA officials have told us that if we give them the additional \nresources, which was suggested originally by the Senator from \nCalifornia and which I concur in on the Feinstein-Specter bill, that \nthey could have individualized warrants. And, I think that would be a \nbig step forward on civil rights.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Except what you are doing is effectively exempting, \nthen, a call from outside into the United States because of the change \nin technology.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my bill does not exempt them. My bill \njust doesn't deal with them. Some say that FISA controls them and, \ntherefore, they are illegal. The President says: No, he has article II \npower. And the only way that controversy can be resolved is in a \nFederal court, which will weigh them. And the Federal court in Detroit \nweighed them and said it was unconstitutional. And the Sixth Circuit \nhas said they will review it. In the meantime, the program stands. But \nas the program stands, all of these warrantless wiretaps are going on \nand on and on. And we go one step further. We make sure the Supreme \nCourt will take the case. We also have power in the Congress to \nexpedite the review, set a timetable to get it done faster.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be very interested to look at the bill, and I \nthank you very much for this dialog. And this completes my questions. \nThank you.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from California for the colloquy \nwhich has further explained the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10928-1", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 612--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 5 THROUGH \n  FEBRUARY 9, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND \n                           PREVENTION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Murkowski, \nand Mr. Menendez) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

William \n     Wilberforce . . . and [his] noble co-workers, that finally \n     thawed the British heart into sympathy for the slave, and \n     moved the strong arm of the government in mercy to put an end \n     to his bondage.''; and\n       Whereas March 25, 2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the \n     abolition of the slave trade in Great Britain: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) honors the life and work of William Wilberforce; and\n         (2) commemorates the 200th anniversary of the abolition \n     of the slave trade in Great Britain and its impact on similar \n     efforts in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/11/14/senate-section/article/S10928-3", "month": "11", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10928-S10929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5137.
