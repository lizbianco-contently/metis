Mr. President, yesterday, September 17, marked the 219th \nanniversary of one of the most significant events in U.S. history. On \nSeptember 17, 1787, 219 years ago, 39 brave men signed the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  We are all familiar with the Preamble of the Constitution:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  Today across the nation, children in each and every classroom are \ncelebrating the birthday of our Constitution. Very likely, they are \nreciting this very same Preamble. Many are, no doubt, struggling \nthrough this seemingly archaic syntax to come to distill its purpose. \nThese children are asking themselves the same questions we in the \nSenate face each day on the Senate floor: What does it mean to \nestablish justice? What does it mean to ensure domestic tranquility; to \nprovide for the common defense; to promote the general welfare; to \nsecure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity?\n  In the midst of debate, it is temptingly easy to mire ourselves in \nthe intricacies of legislation, and we spend hours in committees \nnegotiating a phrase or a single word. But let's not forget the purpose \nbehind our debates. Mr. President, 219 years ago, 39 men fulfilled the \npromise, fulfilled the vision of the Declaration of Independence by \nsigning the Constitution. Today, the legacy depends on us. As citizens \nand as Senators, it is our duty to ensure that the values and purposes \nembodied by the Constitution continue to be the values that define our \ndaily life.\n  Over the past few months, we have had many opportunities to do just \nthat: the PATRIOT Act, Defense appropriations, border security, the \nVoting Rights Act, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, pension \nreform, and just last week, port security.\n  But too often my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ninhibited the fulfillment of our duty. They have relied on obstruction \nand thrown up roadblocks at every opportunity. They have let politics \nget in the way of sound policy and purpose. That is unacceptable.\n  We have only a few days left in this session. This week, we will vote \non the nomination of Alice Fisher to be an Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice. But it has \ntaken months and months to get to this point--months and months of \nobstruction. We have other key national security nominees who need to \nbe confirmed. These are positions vital to our continued safety and \nsecurity, but at every turn we find obstruction instead of \nconfirmation.\n  As we move forward, I urge my colleagues to review our Constitution's \nPreamble, to consider anew our purpose here in the Senate, and to let \nthat purpose guide our debate and action here on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9666-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for more than 3 years, this Congress, which \nhas been given the name of the ``do-nothing Congress,'' has turned a \nblind eye to the intractable war in Iraq, ignoring the administration's \nmany mistakes and allowing it to stay on a failed course.\n  Here we are, with 6 days left in the 109th Congress, and the \nRepublicans, who control the House and Senate and the White House, have \nnot held one hearing--not one--into the President's wartime failures. \nDuring the Civil War, President Lincoln was faced continually with \noversight hearings by his Congress. Of course, we know during World War \nII, there were a number of commissions. The most famous was that \nconducted by Senator Harry Truman of Missouri, which led to his \nbecoming Vice President. Some say, but for that he would not have been \nchosen as Vice President. What was the Truman Commission? It was to \ndetermine what was going on with World War II. Was money being wasted? \nWere troop levels right? Korean war hearings were also held, and the \nsame for the Vietnam war. But for this war, none--even though this war \nhas taken longer than it took to settle the differences in the European \ntheater in World War II. Soon it will be the same amount of time that \nwe were able to beat Japan.\n  This Republican Congress has wasted 20 months on horse slaughtering; \nthe Schiavo case, dealing with someone's personal relationship, which \nshould not even have been before this body; gay marriage; the nuclear \noption; flag burning; repealing the estate tax. But they could not find \na day for some time to look at the President's mistakes, missteps, and \nmisconduct, which have hurt American security and plunged Iraq into a \ncivil war--not a day.\n\n  Yesterday's Washington Post newspaper brought the latest indictment \nof the Bush incompetence in Iraq, in a front-page story entitled ``Ties \nto GOP Trumped Know-How Among Staff Sent to Rebuild Iraq.'' Mr. \nPresident, this article says a lot of things, but here is some of it:\n\n        . . . applicants didn't need to be experts in the Middle \n     East or in post-conflict reconstruction. What seemed most \n     important was loyalty to the Bush administration.\n\n  It is interesting to note that the person selected to do this is a \nman by the name of O'Beirne. I saw that name and it flashed because I \nhave been on programs with a woman by the name of Kate O'Beirne. And \nI'll be darned, it happened to be her husband who was chosen to find \nthe people to take care of postwar Iraq.\n  Here are some of the questions that were asked of the applicants: \n``Did you vote for George W. Bush in 2000?'' They even asked questions \nabout how the applicant felt about Roe v. Wade. People being \ninterviewed for purposes of helping rebuild war-damaged Iraq were asked \nquestions on Roe v. Wade. The questions had nothing to do with one's \ncompetence, their educational background, or their experience. The \narticle says that\n\n       . . . from April 2003 to June 2004 [it was clear that \n     O'Beirne] lacked vital skills and experience\n\nto do what he was required to do. It says:\n\n       A 24-year-old who had never worked in finance--but had \n     applied for a White House job--was sent to reopen Baghdad's \n     stock exchange. The daughter of a prominent neoconservative \n     commentator and a recent graduate from an evangelical \n     university for home-schooled children were tapped to manage \n     Iraq's $13 billion budget, even though they didn't have a \n     background in accounting.\n\n  The article also says:\n\n       Interviews with scores of former CPA personnel over the \n     past two years depict an organization that was dominated--and \n     ultimately hobbled--by administration ideologues.\n       ``We didn't tap--and it should have started from the White \n     House on down--just didn't tap the right people to do this \n     job,'' said Frederick Smith, who served as deputy director of \n     the DPA's Washington office. ``It was a tough, tough job. \n     Instead we got people who went out there because of their \n     political leanings.''\n       But many CPA staff members were more interested in other \n     things: in instituting a flat tax--\n\n  People were sent there with no background, no education, no academic \nexperience, and set out to create a flat tax in Iraq.\n  They were interested ``in selling off government assets, in ending \nfood rations and otherwise fashioning a new nation that looked a lot \nlike the United States. Many of them spent their days cloistered in the \nGreen Zone, a walled-off enclave in central Baghdad with towering \npalms, posh villas, well-stocked bars and resort-size swimming pools.''\n  Mr. President, this picture says it all. Here is Paul Bremmer. They \ndumped General Garner after a few weeks and brought Bremmer in. Here he \nis, on his throne--on his throne. He is on a throne surrounded by \nIraqis.\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator refresh my memory? Was Mr. Bremmer the \nrecipient of a gold medal or something from the President? Didn't he \nreceive some high decoration or medal for his performance in Iraq?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is, yes, he received that. I assume one would \nexpect that from somebody who had a throne while he was over there.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Isn't it also true that George Tenet, who was responsible \nfor the intelligence that was so bad that led us into the war in Iraq, \ngot a medal from the President the same day?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Did Michael Brown with FEMA receive a gold medal from the \nWhite House before he was dismissed?\n  Mr. REID. I don't think he did. Even though he was doing a heck of a \njob, I don't think he obtained a medal from the White House.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Apparently, these gold medals were being awarded for \nincompetence. They missed Mr. Brown, but they did give one to Mr. \nBremmer.\n  Mr. REID. The article goes on to say--and I say to my friend and \nanyone within the sound of my voice:\n\n       To recruit the people he wanted, O'Beirne sought resumes \n     from the offices of Republican congressmen, conservative \n     think tanks and GOP activists. He discarded applications from \n     those his staff deemed ideologically suspect, even if the \n     applicants possessed Arab language skills or postwar \n     rebuilding experience.\n       Smith said O'Beirne once pointed to a young man's resume \n     and pronounced him ``an ideal candidate.'' His chief \n     qualification was that had he worked for the Republican Party \n     in Florida during the presidential election recount in 2000.\n\n  I am not making this up. This is hard to comprehend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am trying to recall the exact number--it was in the \nbillions of dollars--that we gave to the President for the \nreconstruction of Iraq; is that not true?\n  Mr. REID. It started out at $18 billion. But as the Senator from \nIllinois will remember, part of that money, stacks of one-hundred-\ndollar bills, was used by some of the contractors who were sent over \nthere to play football games--some of these same people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is also true, is it not, that the Democratic policy \nconference has been holding hearings--in fact, I think it is the only \nagency on the Hill holding hearings--on this waste and abuse, this \nprofiteering and corruption at the expense of American taxpayers and \neven, equally important--more importantly--at the expense of our \ntroops?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this war is approaching 3\\1/2\\ years, \nand there has not been a single congressional oversight hearing on the \nconduct of the war. This war has now cost us, the American taxpayers, \nabout $325 billion. There has not been a single congressional oversight \nhearing on the war.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he might comment on this \nas well: Are we not in a situation where the President has told us that \nhe wants to ``stay the course'' in Iraq, and Vice President Cheney, \nwhen asked a week ago, said he wouldn't change a thing in the way they \nhave done this war in Iraq? Is it very clear that unless there is a \nchange in leadership in this town soon, we are going to continue down \nthis disastrous course, exposing our soldiers to danger every single \nday, their families to the anxiety of separation, and the taxpayers of \nthis country to billions and billions of dollars more being spent that \ndon't make us any safer?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I spent the weekend reading a book. I \ndid other things. I spent a lot of time on an airplane. The book is \ncalled ``Fiasco,'' written by a man named Thomas Ricks who has spent \nhis life covering the military. He has written books on the military. I \ndon't know his political persuasion. This book is on the best seller's \nlist of the New York Times.\n  In this book, he talks in such detail about what has happened as a \nresult of the incompetence of this administration to our valiant \nfighting men and women over there. I recommend the book to anyone. It \nis a searing indictment of this administration. It is in keeping with \nwhat this article is all about.\n  Another paragraph:\n\n       One former CPA employee who had an office near O'Beirne's \n     wrote an e-mail to a friend describing the recruitment \n     process: ``I watched resumes of immensely talented \n     individuals who had sought out CPA to help the country thrown \n     in the trash because their adherence to `the President's \n     vision for Iraq' (a frequently heard phrase at CPA) was \n     `uncertain.' I saw senior civil servants from agencies like \n     Treasury, Energy . . . and Commerce denied advisory positions \n     in Baghdad that were instead handed to prominent RNC \n     (Republican National Committee) contributors.''\n\n  One staffer said:\n\n       I'm not here for the Iraqis, I'm here for George Bush.''\n\n  Mr. President, this is really a sad commentary. Important jobs, such \nas rebuilding the Iraq stock exchange, were given to applicants who \nagreed with the President on Roe v. Wade. Qualified individuals were \nturned down for jobs if they didn't vote for Bush in 2000. The children \nof the President's conservative friends were given authority over the \ncountry's $13 billion budget.\n  Today in Iraq we are witnessing the terrible consequences of Bush \ncronyism, and it is our troops, the Iraqi people, and the American \npeople who are paying the price.\n\n  Reconstruction has been a failure. The economy is a mess. Thousands \nare dying. Whole provinces have been lost. One province, Anbar \nProvince, makes up a third of the country. The military people said it \nis gone. And the political solution necessary to bring Americans home \nis nowhere to be found.\n  The testimony we hear from people such as the people in this \nnewspaper article is unbelievable. We have heard it time and again. The \nonly people who aren't listening are George Bush and this do-nothing \nCongress.\n  If the Iraq war has taught us anything, it is that Congress must take \nseriously its responsibility to hold the executive branch accountable, \nand it has not happened. For 2 years, Democrats have offered \nconstructive solutions to change course in Iraq and give our troops and \nthe Iraqi people the chance for some type of stability and success. We \nhave said there must be a redeployment of forces this year to \ntransition the mission, to change the mission.\n  We have said we must resolve the sectarian differences through a \npolitical settlement. That is called diplomacy. They need to amend \ntheir constitution.\n  We said they must regionalize the conflict with a contact group or \nconference to bring in those countries that said they will help.\n  We need to revitalize, and we can do that as I have indicated: get \nthe countries that said they would help to come in and help. There \nneeds to be a regional solution. We need to rebuild our badly strained \nU.S. military. There is not a single undeployed Army unit today that is \nbattle ready. That says it all.\n  A number of generals have witnessed this administration's flawed Iraq \npolicy firsthand, and they have repeatedly called for new civilian \nleadership at the Pentagon.\n  I say this with all due respect: I bet if those military personnel \nweren't working for Government defense contracts, we would have a few \nmore speaking out. But we have had plenty.\n  In each instance, when the generals speak out, the Republican \nCongress blocks their efforts and puts their political interests ahead \nof America's safety.\n  The war in Iraq has been a diversion from the real war on terror. But \nthis administration and this do-nothing Congress are content to stay \nthe course, even as it makes America less safe and Iraq less stable.\n  We need a new direction. This Congress has failed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden and Mr. Bennett pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3908 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, yesterday, September 17, the Nation \nobserved Constitution and Citizenship Day. Yesterday, on the Sabbath, \nthe Nation observed Constitution and Citizenship Day. The day marked \nthe 219th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. On \nSeptember, 17, 1787, 219 years ago yesterday, an extraordinary \nconvention of American statesmen met in Philadelphia's Independence \nHall to adopt our fledgling Nation's fundamental governing principles, \ncodified in the new Constitution. I am happy to glory in my good \nfortune, the blessing of living in this Nation and under this \nConstitution--this Constitution which I hold in my hand. I have long \nbeen a student of the Constitution, and I do carry it with me, close to \nmy heart. Alexander the Great slept with a copy of the Iliad, written \nby Homer in the 800s before Christ--a copy of the Iliad under his \npillow, they say. I do not sleep with a copy of the Constitution under \nmy pillow, but I carry it close to my heart.\n  Over the years, I have read deeply about our Founding Fathers and the \ngreat national debate that accompanied the development, the adoption, \nand the ratification of this critical document. This history is \nenlightening, revealing the lessons of our Founding Fathers, the great \nlessons of our Founding Fathers and the lessons they learned from \nancient history as well as from their own experience as colonists \nsubject to the British King.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I have many good reasons to want to know \nmore about the Constitution. Yes, I am 89, but I want to know more. The \nConstitution affects all Americans, and I urge all Americans to learn \nmore about the Constitution. Why? Because it remains as vital to our \nlives today as it was 219 years ago. That was a long time ago, 219 \nyears. This Constitution affects the structure and operation of our \ngovernment, a government of laws, not a government of men. Yes, this \nConstitution, this is the roadmap, this is the cornerstone of our \nRepublic. It dictates who is eligible to run for office and hold \noffice. It dictates who may elect government officials and how those \nofficials--like me, like myself--must conduct themselves while in \noffice. It outlines who does what within the Federal Government and \nbetween the Federal Government and these United States. It requires the \nPresident, the Chief Executive in the White House--who is he? He is the \nChief Executive, but it requires that he, the President of the United \nStates, report. To whom? To the people and to Congress.\n  The Constitution decides who may declare war. It says, ``The Congress \nshall have the power to declare war.'' Yes, the Congress. It decides \nwho may appoint Ambassadors, who may levy taxes, who may decide how \nFederal dollars will be spent. If all of that does not affect every \nAmerican, I do not know what does.\n  I firmly believe that our Constitution deserves greater awareness in \nour national life and in our everyday lives. A distressing number of \nstudies have shown a profound ignorance of and, yes, even indifference \nto this fundamental document of government. This is it. I hold it in my \nhands. Of course, more than the Constitution is included in this fine \nlittle document that I have and carry in my pocket, but the title of \nthis little book is the ``United States Constitution.'' That is it. \nThis is the pillar of my liberties, the pillar of your liberties, and \nit is the roadmap by which those who govern shall govern.\n  Too many citizens have little or no knowledge of this Constitution, \nfrom the functions of government to the scope of their own rights and \nliberties. Did you realize that, every one of you who is within the \nsound of my voice throughout this great Nation? You may revere the \nConstitution--and most people do. Yes, they are proud of the \nConstitution. They revere it. But they do not know what is in it; too \nmany do not know what is in it. Many do.\n  I think that may also be true of many Members of Congress, many \nMembers of this body. As you know, there are two bodies of Congress. \nTwo bodies make up the Congress, not one body. It may be true of many \nMembers of these two Houses. It may be true of many Members of this \nHouse, the Senate of the United States. It may be true of the executive \nbranch officials. Did you hear that it may be true of executive \nofficials, many of them? It may be true of military officials, many \nmilitary officials and personnel, and members of the news media. Hear \nme now, yonder on the back benches, those who write, those who \nquestion, those who explain: members of the news media.\n  Few people know why the Constitution was designed the way it was. Few \npeople may understand what the checks and balances contained in our \ngovernmental structure are meant to do.\n  When the Constitutional Convention sent to the States this \nConstitution for ratification, in 1787, it stimulated an active \npolitical debate out there--in the mountains, the hills, and the \nvalleys of this land. It was not a political debate such as we see \ntoday--a cacophony of short sound bites and slogans that do not answer \nthe questions or which are aimed only at attacking a political \nopponent--but a real debate, a real discussion, a real looking at the \nstructure, at the parts of the structure, at the words, at the \nsentences--yes, a real debate and discussion.\n  Supporters and opponents wrote pamphlets and published essays that \nwere widely read. Can you imagine that? They wrote pamphlets, essays \nthat were widely read, widely discussed? The Constitution became a \ntopic of conversation around dinner tables and at public meeting \nplaces. Imagine, just imagine--hear me now, imagine that today.\n  Imagine that happening today. The Federalist Papers--may I say to the \npages--read them. The Federalist Papers--not just the Constitution but \nalso the Federalist Papers. Read them. The Federalist Papers, that \ngreat defense of the Constitution written by James Madison, Alexander \nHamilton, and John Jay--read the Federalist Papers. They were widely \nprinted in newspapers and still more widely read and discussed. The \nFederalist Papers served as the centerpiece for the debate over the \nform of government the Constitution created, the form of government \nthis little Constitution created. Yes. I hold it in my hand. Sadly, \ntoday there are few people outside of college classes and history and \npolitics who have read the Federalist Papers. They should be read by \nall Americans who want to understand the Constitution.\n  Read the Federalist Papers. If you have read them, read them again. \nIt is like reading the Holy Bible. Each time you read it, you will see \nnew things, you will understand new things, new words are being said, \nnew sentences, new thoughts are being expressed, some that you had not \nseen before.\n  Madison, Hamilton, and Jay--those great men, Madison Hamilton, and \nJay--turned to the mass-communication system of their day, the \nnewspapers. Now, in the 21st century, we have the ability to promote \nbetter knowledge and better understanding of the Constitution through \nthe newest form of mass communication--think about that--the Internet. \nAs an excellent resource for Americans on this vital topic, I draw \nattention to the considerable information about the Constitution that \nthe United States is making available--get that--the United States is \nmaking available to the public on the Senate Web site. You hear me. It \nis there.\n  By publishing articles in newspapers, Madison, Hamilton, and Jay \nreached out and touched an audience of thousands. Through the World \nWide Web, the Senate's Web site, material on the Constitution can be \naccessed by an audience of millions, millions of citizens, teachers, \nand students--people from all around, the world.\n  In honor of this year's celebration of Constitution Day, the U.S. \nSenate has included a variety of features on its Web site--at \nwww.senate.gov--to promote a more thorough understanding of our \nConstitution, the blueprint--here it is--for the Federal Government \nthat still defines and guides us today, I say to the President who sits \nin the chair. Visitors to the Senate Web site will find many items \nrelated to the Constitution. The full text of the Constitution can be \nviewed, along with annotations and Senate-specific clauses.\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\nThere is also a feature on the Federalist Papers and a special section \nfeaturing books about the Constitution for children. There is a \nbeautiful color reproduction of the mural unveiled in the Senate wing \nof the Capitol Building just a few days ago. The mural depicts the \nauthors of the Connecticut Compromise of 1787--also known as the Great \nCompromise--that led to creation of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. There is also a Virtual Reference Desk that can guide \nvisitors to further reading and resources to help them learn more about \nour--our, our--Constitution.\n  I commend the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms, and \ntheir staffs, who collected and posted this array of constitutional \nmaterial in such an attractive and easy-to-use format. Their work \nreflects well on the Senate and offers a real service to the Nation. It \nembodies the spirit of Constitution Day, which I am proud to have had a \nhand in establishing. I also commend the many other organizations that \nhave made an abundance of educational material available to all those \nseeking greater knowledge of the Constitution. Notable among these are \nthe Web sites of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, \nJustice Learning, the Center for Civic Education, the Constitutional \nRights Center, the Constitution Project, and the Freedom Forum. They \nhave all done fine work that deserves widespread attention.\n  Our Constitution is what sets the United States--yes, our \nConstitution is what sets the United States, a star, above other \nnations. Our Constitution is what makes the United States such a \nshining beacon, such a shining star for the people of other nations, \nfor those still struggling to establish democratically elected \nrepresentative governments.\n  Our Constitution empowers our leaders but also places limits on our \nleaders to prevent autocratic rule. ``If men were angels, no government \nwould be necessary.'' James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, \n``If men were angels, no government would be necessary.'' ``If angels \nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on \ngovernment would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be \nadministered by men over men, the great difficulty is this: You must \nfirst enable the government to control the governed; and in the next \nplace, oblige it to control itself.''\n  The self-control mechanism in our Constitution and therefore in our \ngovernmental structure comes first from the competition between and \namong the three branches of Government, the famous ``checks and \nbalances.'' Ultimately, the self-control mechanism in our Government \ncomes from the powers and the responsibilities placed by the \nConstitution upon the people of the United States. In order to \neffectively play our safeguarding role as citizens, we each--each of \nus; you, Mr. President, me, each of us--has an obligation to be \ninformed. The system of checks and balances between and among the three \nbranches of Government and the ideals of freedom and of rights and \nliberties set forth and realized in our Constitution are our greatest \ncontributions to the world--our greatest contributions to the world.\n  My hope is that observances of Constitution Day--yesterday, today, \nthis year, and in future years--will encourage all citizens, all \ncitizens high and mighty and low, to learn more about our Constitution \nand Government. Certainly there is no better way for people to start \nthan by clicking on the U.S. Senate's Web site. I hope many people \nlistening today, many people watching today, will be inspired to use \nthe Internet today--yes, today--to visit the Senate's Web site and see \nthe marvelous collection of information about the most marvelous \ndocument, the Constitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9669-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9669-S9671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the \nso-called Oman Free Trade Agreement. There are two primary reasons that \nI oppose this agreement. First, the Oman agreement is a continuation of \nan utterly failed trade policy. I believe we must change direction, and \nwe need to change direction now before our record trade and budget \ndeficits cripple our economy.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows the trend in the U.S. trade deficit. \nThis chart shows the trade deficit per month, and if we go back to \n1992, we can see the trade deficit was running about $3 billion a \nmonth--a little over that. The total trade deficit that year for the \nentire year was $40 billion.\n  Now we fast track to this year. After 10 trade agreements and 14 \nyears, we are now at a trade deficit, as of last year, of $718 billion. \nAnd we are headed for a trade deficit of over $800 billion based on the \nmost recent trade deficit. In July, we saw a trade deficit approaching \n$70 billion for the month.\n  When are we going to conclude that we are on a course that is leading \nnowhere?\n  Mr. President, NAFTA provides one vivid example of how these trade \ndeals have affected our trade deficits. In 1993, the year before NAFTA \ntook effect, we had a small trade surplus with Mexico--as this chart \nshows, about $1.7 billion. Last year, after 12 years of NAFTA, our \ntrade deficit with Mexico exceeded $50 billion. In other words, before \nNAFTA, we had a trade surplus, albeit a small one. Now we have a \nmassive trade deficit, and some say this is a success. I would hate to \nsee a failure. If this is a success, what would be a failure?\n  Agriculture provides another clear example. When this administration \ntook office, we had a trade balance in agriculture of a positive $15 \nbillion. That was in 2001. Every year, this balance has gone down: to \n$13 billion in 2002, $10 billion in 2003, just under $10 billion in \n2004, last year it slipped to under $5 billion, and this year they are \nnow anticipating a trade balance in agriculture of only $2 billion. \nThat is stunning, absolutely stunning. We used to run a trade surplus \nin agriculture of over $25 billion a year. Now we are very close to \nhaving no trade balance in agriculture. Yet we keep going down the same \npath, trumpeting every one of these trade deals as another great \nsuccess.\n  I do not think there is much credibility left in that argument. I \nwould be the first to admit I have voted for some of these trade \nagreements. I voted against NAFTA, and I voted against the CAFTA \nagreement, the most recent agreement entered into here. I voted against \nthe so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement, but I supported the \nagreement with China, I supported WPO, and I believed that it would \nadvance the cause that is so important to the international economy.\n  At some point we have to deal with facts. We have to deal with \nreality. We have to deal with what is really happening, not some \nacademic argument. We have to deal with the reality that our country is \ngoing deeper and deeper into debt. We are now the world's largest \ndebtor nation, and by a large margin.\n  I believe the Oman agreement continues that failed trade policy. We \nare now getting more than we are giving. When you read the fine print \nin the study that was done by the U.S. International Trade Commission, \nthe nonpartisan U.S. agency in charge of analyzing trade agreements, \nyou discover that this agreement will increase our trade deficit with \nOman. So here we go again, one more time of failed negotiations leading \nto more deficit, more debt, and the United States borrowing more money.\n  In the fine print of the analysis that has been done what you find is \nthat imports of apparel from Oman will increase by more than $42 \nmillion a year, but the exports of all products to Oman will increase \nonly between $14 to $41 million. So, once again, we are asked to \napprove a deal that is the product of a failed negotiation. Once again \nthose who negotiated on behalf of the United States have brought back a \nloser, claiming all the while it is a great success.\n  At some point you have to check the record. At some point you look at \nwhat\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nhas actually happened, and you compare the claims to the results. When \nwe do that on the trade agreements, what we find is that they have been \na miserable failure for this country. Perhaps it should not be \nsurprising that this agreement would increase our trade deficit. It is \nproduced by the administration, an administration that has said at \nvarious times that outsourcing is a good thing. It is produced by an \nadministration that does not believe in having other countries improve \ntheir labor standards so that it is fair competition. In fact, this \nadministration has repeatedly rebuffed the efforts of the House of \nRepresentatives to strengthen labor laws in Oman so that they meet the \ncore international standards.\n  I do not believe this is a good agreement on the merits. But in \naddition, this process is horribly flawed. The way this bill has been \nbrought to the Senate floor makes a complete mockery of the fast-track \nprocess.\n  Why do I say that? Well, as every Member of this body knows, the \nConstitution gives the Congress, not the President, the responsibility \nfor regulating foreign trade. Yet in recognition that we cannot have \n535 trade negotiators--435 Members of the House and 100 Members here--\nCongress has agreed to the fast-track process for considering trade \nagreements.\n  In agreeing to fast track, each Senator gives up the most fundamental \nrights of a U.S. Senator. The most fundamental rights of any Senator \nare the right to amend and the right to extended debate. Those are the \ntwo things that distinguish this body from any other parliamentary body \nin the world. And most analysts have said it is a key to the importance \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  In return for our giving up those core rights of any Senator--the \nright to amend, the right to extended debate--there is supposed to be a \ndetailed consultation with the Congress in negotiating trade agreements \nand developing the implementing legislation.\n  In practice, the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, is the \nfocus of this consultation because the Finance Committee has \njurisdiction over trade policy. In theory, the committee has extensive \ninput during the process of negotiating agreements. Theoretically, it \ndoes not then need to amend the implementing bill once it is formally \nintroduced.\n  When it comes to developing the implementing bill, this consultation \noccurs through what is known as the mock markup process. It is like a \nregular legislative markup, only it is a mock markup in that it is not \nproceeding under the regular legislative course. The mock markup is the \nFinance Committee's opportunity to amend the implementing bill before \nit is formally introduced and then cannot be amended under fast-track \nrules. This informal process has a long history. During consideration \nof previous trade agreements, the process has lasted months and \nproduced a host of changes.\n  On the Oman agreement, I offered an amendment to prevent products \nmade with slave labor, or under sweatshop conditions so egregious as to \nbe tantamount to slave labor, from benefiting from the agreement. I did \nso because of a sad history, a sad history with the agreement with \nJordan that failed to prevent horrific sweatshops in that country. I \ndid so because it is not free trade when foreign workers are locked in \nfactories and forced to work 100 hours a week for pennies an hour. Can \nanybody argue that represents free trade? That is not what Members of \nthis body support when they vote in favor of free trade, but a recent \nstudy in Jordan found that is precisely what is happening.\n  Workers from Bangladesh, China, and other parts of Southeast Asia \nwere promised much greater pay than they could earn in their home \ncountries. Not surprising, thousands went to Jordan. They paid hundreds \nof dollars to recruiters to get the jobs in the Jordanian apparel \nindustry, but when they got to Jordan, their passports were taken away \nso they could not leave or change jobs. They were then forced to work \n90 to 120 hours a week. They were paid far less than Jordan's minimum \nwage and were denied what they had been promised. And if they \ncomplained, they were beaten or jailed.\n  Now, these are unpleasant facts, but they are facts, and we can \neither choose to turn away or be condemned by history for allowing this \nto occur when we served in a position of responsibility.\n  Here is what the workers reported, according to the New York Times \nearlier this year:\n\n       We used to start at 8 in the morning, and we'd work until \n     midnight, 1 or [even] 2 a.m., seven days a week. . . . When \n     we were in Bangladesh they promised us we would receive $120 \n     a month, but in the five months I was there I only got one \n     month's salary--and that was $50.''\n\n  These stories are repeated over and over and over.\n\n       Mohammed Saiful Islam, a Bangladeshi, said that several \n     times the workers had to work until 4 a.m., then sleep on the \n     factory's floor for a few hours, before resuming work at 8 \n     a.m. ``The workers got so exhausted they became sick,'' he \n     said. ``They could hardly stay awake at their machines.''\n       Several workers said that when they were sick they did not \n     receive medical care, but were instead punished and had their \n     pay docked.\n       Hazrat Ali said he sometimes worked 48 hours in a row and \n     received no pay for the six months. ``If we asked for money, \n     they hit us,'' he said.\n       Nasima Akhter said that the Western factory gave its \n     workers a half-glass of tea for breakfast and often rice and \n     some rotten chicken for lunch. ``In the four months I was in \n     Jordan, they didn't pay us a single penny,'' she said. ``When \n     we asked management for our money and for better food, they \n     were very angry at us. We were put in some sort of jail for \n     four days without anything to eat. And then they forced us to \n     go back to Bangladesh.''\n\n  These conditions are appalling, but they are all confirmed. This \nhappened. And the question is, Are we going to allow this to continue? \nWe would not ask American workers here at home to compete with these \nsorts of practices. Is it reasonable to expect our workers to compete \nwith work conditions like these abroad? I think not. And we certainly--\nwe certainly--should not be giving special trade benefits to products \nmade under these conditions. That is immoral.\n  In the case of Oman, its labor laws fall far short of the core ILO \nstandards, the International Labor Organization standards. Oman, like \nJordan, relies heavily on guest workers who are often at a serious \ndisadvantage in trying to assert their rights. Oman has been cited by \nour own State Department for human trafficking. And according to the \nInternational Trade Commission, the Oman Free Trade Agreement is \nexpected to greatly increase apparel production and exports to the \nUnited States from Oman.\n  The warning signals are before us. Are we going to act? I hope we do. \nThat is why I offered an amendment in the Finance Committee that \nclarified that goods produced with slave labor or de facto slave labor \nof the sort that occurred in Jordan will not benefit from this \nagreement. The administration raised objections at the time, but the \ncommittee rejected the administration's advice and unanimously adopted \nmy amendment--unanimously adopted my amendment.\n  I believe it adopted my amendment because the members believe that \nproducts manufactured in these sorts of abusive conditions should not \nget special benefits under this free-trade agreement. The Finance \nCommittee spoke loudly and clearly. By an 18-to-0 recorded vote, the \ncommittee disagreed with the administration and said that we need to \nadd protections in this agreement because local labor laws and U.S. \nlaws did not work in the case of Jordan and may well not work in the \ncase of Oman.\n  Yet the bill before us today does not include these protections. It \ndoes not include an amendment passed unanimously in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. This process is now so broken and such a sham that we can \npass an amendment in the so-called mock markup by a unanimous vote and \nit means absolutely nothing. This process has lost its credibility. \nThis process cannot be taken seriously.\n\n  Every Member of this body should know that in giving up their core \nrights--the right to amend, the right to extended debate--in return for \na program that is supposed to include consultation between the Congress \nand the administration--consultation that is supposed to go through the \nFinance Committee, through the mock markup process that is our ability \nto change things, that is our ability to offer amendments to alter the \nfinal outcome--it means nothing--nothing.\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\n  Two years ago, we debated the Australian FTA, and the Finance \nCommittee adopted an amendment I offered then to protect our ranchers. \nIt went through procedural contortions to drop the amendment. I said at \nthe time:\n\n       This precedent strikes me as dangerous. It opens the \n     process to abuse, and it reduces the Committee's role in \n     crafting trade policy and trade legislation. It may have been \n     expedient. . . . But I believe that we will come to regret \n     this precedent. It invites a future President to ignore any \n     recommendations made by the Committee on future trade \n     implementing legislation.\n\n  Unfortunately, that prediction has come true. Here we are with \nanother trade agreement, this time a trade agreement which was amended \nin the Finance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, by a unanimous \nvote, and that amendment appears nowhere in the final product.\n  This process has become a sham. It is a snare and a delusion for \nMembers here to think that Congress has any effect. There is no need \nfor a Congress of the United States if this administration or any \nadministration arrogates to itself the full power of the Government of \nthe United States. That is what has now happened with trade agreements. \nThe Congress may as well not exist. We may as well not be here because \nwe have no ability to alter the outcome.\n  The only ability we have remaining is to reject the agreement \noutright. I have reached the conclusion that is the proper course. I \nbelieve we ought to reject this agreement on two bases: No. 1, it is a \ncontinuation of a failed trade policy that is driving us deeper and \ndeeper into debt; and second, it is the product of a process that has \nbecome a complete sham. The facts speak for themselves.\n  Let me conclude. The Oman Free Trade Agreement promises few, if any, \nbenefits to the U.S. economy and will actually make our trade deficit \nworse. Moreover, the safeguards that were supposed to protect against \nimports made under abusive sweatshop conditions have been summarily \ndropped from the bill, despite a unanimous vote in the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  Finally, the process the Finance Committee followed sets a terrible \nprecedent. No Senator should welcome the precedent that the \nadministration can simply ignore the will of the Finance Committee on a \nparticular trade issue important to the people we represent, secure in \nthe knowledge that the trade implementing bill can be pushed through as \npart of a larger take-it-or-leave-it package.\n  So I hope my colleagues, even those who generally support trade \nagreements, will think long and hard about how they cast this vote. \nThis vote is going to set another precedent--one more precedent--that \nsays the fast-track process is completely broken.\n  If you believe the Senate and the Finance Committee should not have a \nvoice on trade agreements and trade implementing bills and you support \nthe use of slave labor, human trafficking, and egregious, abusive \nsweatshops, you should vote for this bill. But if you believe that \nconsultation under fast track should be meaningful, if you believe the \nmock markup process should not be a mockery, and if you oppose slave \nlabor, you should vote against this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand for a new direction in trade policy, to \nstand for agreements that benefit the American economy, and to vote \nagainst the Oman Free Trade Agreement.\n  As someone who has supported many trade agreements, I come to this \nconclusion reluctantly. I come to this conclusion only after 20 years \nof service in the U.S. Senate, seeing one after another of these trade \nagreements entered into, each one of them heralded as another great \nsuccess, only to find that we are on course to running up the greatest \ntrade deficit in the history of the United States--$700 billion of \ntrade deficit last year, headed for $800 billion this year. Mr. \nPresident, if this doesn't send a message that we are on the wrong \ncourse, I don't know what would.\n\n  Finally, this is a process that is completely bankrupt--absolutely, \ncompletely bankrupt. I entered into the chance as a member of the \nFinance Committee to offer amendments in good faith. I did so \nresponsibly. My amendment passed unanimously. Yet it is summarily \ndropped by the administration for no good reason.\n  Mr. President, this fast-track process is fast track all right; it is \na fast track to decline. It is a fast track to rising deficits and \ndebt. It is a fast track to the centralization of power in this country \nin the hands of a few in the administration, without regard to \ncongressional input.\n  That is not the history of this institution. That is not the \nconstitutional history of our country. We were not designed to be a \ngovernment of only one branch, the executive branch. Our constitutional \nhistory suggests that this is to be a government of shared powers, with \nan executive branch, a legislative branch, and judicial branch, all \nwith their appropriate roles.\n  Increasingly, with respect to trade, the role of the Congress is the \nrole of a rubber stamp. Our Founding Fathers would be spinning in their \ngraves seeing how the fast-track process has been contorted into a \nprocess that allows the administration to make the decisions with \nrespect to the trade policy of this country, without an ability of \nMembers of Congress to alter its course. That is a profound mistake, \nand we will regret it in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It appeared in the Torrington Telegram. It has a very \nimportant message for our country that I wanted to share with the \ncountry. These are the feelings of a young man serving in the military. \nI appreciate his effort in putting this letter in a Wyoming paper. I \nhope it makes several papers in Wyoming. I am going to make sure the \npeople across America hear the message he is delivering to Americans. \nIt is an important message for Americans, but apparently it is one on \nwhich the media is reluctant to report. So I am going to work to help \nhim deliver the message.\n  Here is his letter. It is from Lee Freeburg:\n\n       I am a U.S. Navy Corpsman, having returned home for some \n     relax time. I was reading through the Telegram and came \n     across a letter to the editor titled ``Bush using fear \n     tactics.''\n       I am appalled by the disrespect to the president of the \n     great nation and the U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The president is doing his best to guide our country and \n     keep us free. He is not the only one who makes decisions, \n     (hence we are not a dictatorship.) Have we forgotten that we \n     also have a House of Representatives and a Senate? This \n     collection of Americans is Congress. For the president to \n     send our troops, our sons (me) and daughters to war, it takes \n     an act of Congress.\n\n  Sailor Freeburg continues:\n\n       I am proud to serve my country and my president, defending \n     and bringing freedom to people all around the world.\n       I am outraged by people's attitudes toward this war; have \n     we so soon forgotten 9-11? They attacked us first on our \n     soil. . . .\n       Have you ever seen the look of gratitude in people's faces \n     for the liberation from a dictatorship?\n       Then you do not understand what we (the U.S. troops \n     stationed abroad) are doing.\n       We as Americans take our freedom so lightly and we need to \n     stop and think. How did we come about to have these freedoms? \n     Well, war. War earned our freedom, and war has kept it, from \n     the American War for Independence to Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n     Men have fallen, paid the ultimate price so that we as \n     Americans can enjoy living without dictators like Hitler, \n     Stalin and Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Sailor Freeburg goes on to write:\n\n       While other countries are building fences to keep people \n     in, we have to build fences to keep people out. Now if the \n     president were a dictator, would people be trying to float 90\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\n     miles across rough water on a wooden door, drinking their own \n     urine, just to set one foot on American soil?\n       Where are the iron gates and armed guards? Where are the \n     mass graves of innocent citizens, murdered for disloyalty to \n     the dictator? There are none to be found on our soil. They do \n     not exist. Why? Because we do not live under a dictator. Was \n     President Lincoln a dictator? No, he even had to go to war \n     with the south for freedoms we still enjoy today.\n       In closing, if this was a war for oil, why haven't we just \n     taken over the entire country of Iraq and added it as the \n     51st state? I am proud to say, I am a gun-carrying \n     Republican, and honored to be a part of the greatest nation \n     on earth.\n       America, be thankful for the freedom we enjoy because \n     freedom is never free.\n\n  That is one of many letters that I receive wondering why more things \nare not said about the way the war is going in Iraq from the \nperspective of our troops who are over there, who are talking to the \npeople who are affected by it.\n  Our troops are affected by what they hear and read from over here. \nThey get their local newspapers. They get letters, and they want their \nmessage out, too. This is a perspective from a young man serving in our \nmilitary, one of many.\n  A few years ago, one of the TV stations that goes into schools across \nthis country did a show called ``Young Men Who Saved the World.'' It \nwas about World War II. The reason they ran this show was because there \nwere a lot of reunions happening among soldiers who had been a part of \nWorld War II, and they were all old guys. The people in the schools \nwere getting the impression that the war had been fought by old guys. \nSo this channel that goes into these schools did this special \nbroadcast.\n  What they did was go back and find the pictures of these men when \nthey actually served in the military. They were young men. It made a \ndistinct impression on the kids of this country that there were young \npeople out there recognizing the value of freedom, the value of \ndemocracy, and willing to put their lives on the line to see that it \nwas shared around the world.\n  I thank you, Sailor Freeburg, for your letter and for the message \nthat needs to be delivered to the United States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Friday the Nation's largest grower of \norganic produce announced a recall of fresh spinach products that they \nfeared could be linked to the deadly e-coli outbreak. So far, the Food \nand Drug Administration has reported that a 77-year-old woman from \nWisconsin has died, 14 persons have suffered from kidney failure, and \nat least 94 individuals have fallen ill after eating prepackaged \nspinach suspected of being contaminated with e-coli. That is a total of \n109 people in 19 different States.\n  This is not the first time produce has been contaminated with e-coli. \nAccording to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, between \n1998 and 2004, there were 492 e-coli outbreaks that were linked to \nfruits, vegetables, and fresh produce products such as prepackaged \nsalads. In fact, there were 86 outbreaks in the year 2004 alone.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, estimates \nthat as many as 76 million people suffer from food poisoning in our \ncountry each year. Of those individuals, 325,000 will be hospitalized, \nand more than 5,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially \nvulnerable.\n  Despite these statistics, our food supply is still the safest in the \nworld. However, there are widening gaps in our food safety system due \nto the fact that food safety oversight has evolved over time and has \nspread across so many different governmental agencies. Several Federal \nagencies, all with different and sometimes conflicting missions, work \nto ensure that the food we eat is safe. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates meat, \npoultry, and processed egg products. The Food and Drug Administration \nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and Center for Veterinary \nMedicine regulate produce and other food products. Finally, the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention tracks food-borne illnesses.\n  One stark example of the inconsistencies in our food safety system is \nthe lack of standardization for food inspection. Processed food \nfacilities may be inspected by the FDA once every 5 or 6 years, while \nmeat and poultry operations are inspected every single day by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. This mismatch, piecemeal approach to food \nsafety could spell disaster if we don't act decisively and wisely. That \nis why, since the 105th Congress, I have been pushing for a single food \nsafety program. It is not a new idea. In fact, one of my predecessors \nis U.S. Senator Charles Percy, of Illinois, who raised this same issue \nseveral decades ago--and he wasn't the first.\n  It doesn't take a person with an advanced degree in government to \nlook at so many different agencies of our Federal Government doing some \npart of food safety and wonder why we don't put the whole \nresponsibility under one roof, guided by science and an operation that \nis administered by true professionals. Instead, what we have done is \nwatched as our food safety system has evolved. From Upton Sinclair's \nlandmark novel ``The Jungle,'' which shamed America through the Teddy \nRoosevelt administration into creating the first food safety standards \nfor our country, to the most recent outbreak, we are reminded time and \ntime again of our vulnerability.\n  We assume that the food we are eating and the food we are serving to \nour families and our children and our elderly parents is safe, and by \nand large it is the safest in the world. But we can do better, and this \ne-coli outbreak involving spinach is a reminder.\n  This bill that I push would give that single food agency the \nauthority to protect the food supply based on science. This agency \nwould provide our country with the greatest hope of reducing food-borne \nillness and preventing or minimizing the possible harm from any \nbioterrorist attack involving our food supply.\n  Former HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson told reporters, when he resigned \nin December 2004, that he worries ``every single night'' about a \nmassive attack on the U.S. food supply. Here is what he said. Tommy \nThompson, a member of President Bush's Cabinet, said this:\n\n       I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists \n     have not, you know, attacked our food supply, because it is \n     so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the \n     Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that.\n\n  We recognized the need for a unified Department of Homeland Security, \nbut we have not taken the same step with our food supply.\n  I might say, parenthetically, that it has been my experience in \nWashington that when I raise this issue with people currently serving \nin an administration, either as Secretary of Health and Human Services \nor Secretary of Agriculture, they have real problems with the idea of \nbringing all of these responsibilities under one roof and coordinating \nthis effort and stopping the duplication and mismanagement. It is not \nuntil they leave Government, in their farewell speech, that they all \nsay: And you know, one thing we should have done is we should have \nbrought all that food safety under one roof.\n  This is a problem for those who face the special interests groups \nthat are afraid of change. But this change is a change America needs--\nto have food safety based on science and an agency administered by real \nprofessionals.\n  S. 729, the Safe Food Act of 2005, would create a single, independent \nFederal food safety agency to administer all aspects of Federal food \nsafety, including inspections, enforcement, standards-setting, and \nresearch in order to protect the public.\n  The components of the agencies now charged with protecting the food \nsupply, primarily housed at the Food and Drug Administration and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, would be transferred to this new agency.\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\n  The new Food Safety Administrator would be responsible for the safety \nof the food supply and would fulfill that charge by implementing the \nregistration and recordkeeping requirements of the 2002 bioterrorism \nlaw.\n  We would also ensure that slaughterhouses and food processing plants \nhave procedures in place to prevent and reduce food contamination; \nregularly inspect domestic food facilities, with inspection frequency \nbased on risk; centralize the authority to detain, seize, condemn, and \nrecall food that is adulterated or misbranded; examine the food safety \npractices of foreign countries and work with States to impose various \ncivil and criminal penalties for the serious violations of food safety \nlaws; and, finally, require food producers to code their products so \nthose products can be traced easily in the event of a food-borne \nillness outbreak in order to minimize the health impact of an event \nlike the spinach contamination we presently face.\n  In this most recent outbreak involving spinach, 22 days passed from \nthe time the first illness was reported to the Centers for Disease \nControl to the time the Food and Drug Administration issued its \nwarning. In this area of food safety, time is of the essence. It was 3 \nweeks from the first serious outbreak and illness until there was a \nwarning issued by the FDA. That is too long. Too many people were \nexposed to serious e-coli contamination, which can be deadly.\n  It is time to create a single food safety agency in this country. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has been calling for it for more than \n25 years. In February 2005, a GAO report showed that Government \nofficials in seven other high-income countries who have consolidated \ntheir food safety systems consistently state that the benefits outweigh \nthe costs.\n  In a 1998 study, the National Academies of Sciences concluded that \n``a model food safety system should have a unified mission and a single \nofficial who is responsible for food safety at the Federal level and \nwho has the authority and the resources to implement science-based \npolicy in all Federal activities related to food safety.''\n  While I was speaking, a member of my staff handed me a note informing \nme that we now know there has been an Illinois case which has been \nreported of e-coli contamination, apparently from spinach. Now 20 \nStates across our Nation have been affected. In this Illinois case, an \nelderly woman has been hospitalized with kidney failure related to \ntainted spinach, marking the first confirmed illness in my home State \nof Illinois linking the outbreak of e-coli in the leafy green \nvegetable. Illinois State public officials announced today that this \nwoman lives in north-central Illinois. She became ill late in August \nand is now hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a form of \nkidney failure which can be associated with this strain of e-coli \nlinked to the tainted spinach, according to this report from the \nIllinois Department of Public Health.\n  This is another example, and the numbers continue to grow. We are \ngoing to do our best to contain them and to inform the public to keep \nthe food supply safe for everyone. But we can do better in Washington. \nIt is time to sit down with the special interest groups who have \nstopped this change and to come up with a reasonable bipartisan \napproach. There isn't anything partisan about this issue, not in any \nway whatsoever.\n  One of my closest friends from Chicago went out and bought some \nhamburger at a local grocery store years ago, took it home, and gave it \nto her 5-year-old boy. That poor boy was exposed to e-coli and died a \nfew days later, a gruesome, horrible death. She became an advocate for \nfood safety. She took her grief and turned it into energy to try to \nspare some family in the future from a similar tragedy. I hope it \ndoesn't take the families of those who have been hit by this e-coli to \nform a group and push Congress into action. It is time that we took the \ninitiative.\n  Factors such as emerging pathogens, an aging population at high risk \nfor food-borne illnesses, an increasing volume of food imports, and \npeople eating outside their homes more than ever underscore the need \nfor change.\n  We need to change and shed the old bureaucratic shackles that have \ntied us to the overlapping and inefficient ad hoc food safety system of \nthe past.\n  I urge my colleagues who are undoubtedly going to hear about this e-\ncoli contamination and wonder how they can respond to take a look at S. \n729, the Safe Food Act of 2005. Please join me in cosponsoring this \nlandmark legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, something happened last Thursday in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee that many of us tried to stop, but we \nwere unsuccessful. The weekend is over now. All we have heard from the \nliberal media and from the Democrats is: Republican rebellion, \nRepublican rebellion, Republican rebellion--it has kind of a ring to \nit--a rebellion against President Bush.\n  Well, nothing could be further from the truth. It is not a Republican \nrebellion against the President. It is a Democratic denial to the \nPresident of that which he begged Congress for, and that was the \nability to interrogate terrorists in order to save American lives, to \nuse whatever methods available within the guidelines of the U.S. \nSupreme Court to get this stuff done.\n  I was at the White House when he made his presentation. I was sitting \ncloser to him than I am to the Chair right now. I have never seen him \nwith such an earnest plea in his heart pouring out because he wanted to \nhave that ability to save American lives.\n  What passed the committee Thursday was the Democrats' program of \nleniency for the enemy, to be sure our interrogators don't get too \naggressive with the terrorists, and also to tell the enemy what methods \nwe will use so they can write their own manual.\n  Republican rebellion? Not hardly. It was the Democratic bill, and \nthey got four Republicans to go along with it. But 100 percent of the \nDemocrats voted for it. Nine of us Republicans on the committee spoke \nand voted against it--all Republicans. Clearly, this was a Democratic \nbill to undermine President Bush's plea to get the tools necessary to \nextract information from terrorists.\n  The High Value Terrorist Detainee Program, for all practical \npurposes, will stop, and I don't blame them. What rational interrogator \nwould take a chance of going to prison, or even being executed himself, \nby trying to comply with the vague provisions of the Democratic bill \npassed out of the committee Thursday?\n  President Bush's bill would clearly define our Common article 3 \nobligations. No one is advocating torture. Torture is already illegal. \nThe President never did that. Nobody wants to use cruel, unusual, \ninhumane, or degrading treatment that is against the law. It is already \nillegal. Nobody is advocating inhumane treatment that violates the U.S. \nConstitution. What the President wants is clarification under our \nCommon article 3 obligations. The President's bill defines these \nobligations by equating the definition to last year's detainee \ntreatment. The Democratic bill stays silent on this important topic. \nTheir bill also makes it impossible in some cases to use classified \ninformation against the accused. Imagine that. We cannot use classified \ninformation against the accused when the terrorists are under our \ncontrol.\n  It doesn't go far enough to protect our interrogators who may be \naccused of violating the vague definitions of article 3, especially as \nthey pertain to degrading treatment. How do you define cruel, unusual, \ninhumane, or degrading treatment? Should we leave the definition up to \nthe interpretation of the courts? Do you want to be an interrogator who \nis told not to worry, you will not be prosecuted even though what you \nare doing might be against the law? I don't. We owe it to them to \nclearly define the law by using the Detainee Treatment Act as the \ndefinition.\n  As the President said last week:\n\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n\n\n       The bottom line is . . . the CIA program won't go forward \n     if there are vague standards applied like those in Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.\n\n  Not having this program will put Americans at risk by leaving us \nunable to gather the vital intelligence needed to fight this enemy.\n  And where is the outrage of the American people? Do they have to \n``drag their naked bodies through the streets of Mogadishu'' before \nthere is a wake-up call?\n  I can't blame the American people. All they have heard all weekend is \n``Republican rebellion,'' and the Senate Democrats are celebrating. So \nthey should. They won, we lost. They successfully picked off four \nRepublicans and passed their ``soft on terrorists'' legislation. But \nthe plump lady hasn't sung yet. We can still reject this on the floor \nthis week and pass the President's bill. But to do this, Senators are \ngoing to have to hear from the folks back home--the folks who believe \nwe need to quit worrying so much about the treatment of terrorists and \nget to the business of serious interrogation, even if it hurts \nsomeone's feelings. Wake up, America; she is about to sing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9674-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9674-S9675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE 2006 DAVIDSON FELLOWS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to pay \ntribute to 16 outstanding scholars who have recently been announced as \n2006 Davidson fellows. The Davidson Institute scholarships promote and \nreward students under 18 years old who have undertaken invaluable \nprojects and studies for the greater good of our country and the world. \nThese individuals are more than deserving of this great honor. Allow me \nto introduce each of the scholars and describe a bit about them and \ntheir projects.\n  At the age of 12, Drew Petersen, of Oradell, NJ, is the youngest \nstudent ever accepted into the Manhattan School of Music Conducting \nProgram. He hopes to become a performing pianist, composer, and \nconductor. Drew's project is entitled ``Keeping Classical Music \nAlive.'' He hopes that he can reach audiences through his piano \nperformances and inspire them to become more active and engaged \nlisteners in all areas of their lives.\n  Shivani Sud, a 16-year-old from Durham, NC, discovered a technology \nto deliver chemotherapeutic molecules to cancerous cells with increased \nefficiency. Her project is entitled ``HIV-1 Tat and IGK-Chain Secretion \nBased Protein Transduction: a Novel Strategy for Molecule Delivery.'' \nShivani's research can help combat cancer and infectious diseases \nthrough more effective chemotherapy treatments. A senior at Jordan High \nSchool, Shivani hopes to eventually perform research in the field of \nmedicine as a physician scientist.\n  Heather Engebretson is a 16-year-old from Tuscaloosa, AL, who views \nmusic as a method of communication and a tool for social progress. \nHeather's portfolio, ``Music as a Universal Communication,'' showcases \nher wide range of prestigiously awarded musical talents. Heather will \nattend the University of Alabama this fall majoring in vocal \nperformance, in hopes that the combination of this experience and the \ncourses she has taken through the Johns Hopkins distance learning \nprogram will help her in someday fulfilling her dream of becoming an \nopera singer.\n  The discoveries of 17-year-old Michael Viscardi from San Diego, CA, \ncan potentially aid in next-generation aircraft design, aerodynamics, \nmedical imaging, astronomy, heat flow and fluid dynamics. Michael's \nproject, ``On the Solution of the Dirichlet Problem with Rational \nHolomorphic Boundary Data,'' portrays his solution of the thermal \nequilibrium of a heated metal plate. Michael will attend Harvard and \nthe New England Conservatory in the fall, majoring in mathematics and \nviolin performance respectively, and I have no doubt that he has the \npotential to become both a successful mathematics professor and a \nprofessional violinist.\n  As a 17-year-old woman from Austin, TX, Stephanie Chen has already \nestablished herself as an award-winning musician. Stephanie explores \neach piece in her piano portfolio, ``A Musical Painting,'' by creating \nimages in her mind then, in her performance, conveying this passion to \nthe audience. Stephanie is entering her senior year at Westwood High \nSchool and would like to pursue medical studies in college and play the \npiano professionally.\n  Kyle Dacuyan is a 16-year-old young man from Sterling, VA, with a \npassion for writing. Kyle illustrates that he is able to empathize with \nother viewpoints throughout his portfolio entitled ``What Have You \nBeen, Where Have You Gone.'' Kyle's work examines familial \nrelationships, complexities and oddities, and exhibits his \nunflinchingly honest look at pride, love, and social class. As he \nenters his senior year at Potomac Falls High School, Kyle hopes to \ncontinue his lifelong passion for writing through his pursuit of \ncollege degrees in English and writing. Kyle also hopes to someday \nteach at the college level.\n  Seventeen-year-old Varun Kumar, of Bellaire, TX, is determined to \nimprove diagnostics in the field of medicine through more effective \nmagnetic resonance imaging, MRI. The implications of Varun's research, \nfound in his portfolio entitled ``Novel Properties in Europium DOTA--\ntetramide Complex for use in MRI Contrast Agent,'' could provide a more \ncomprehensive and less invasive form of diagnosis in almost every field \nof medicine. Varun is a recent graduate of Bellaire High School and \nwill be attending Rice University in the fall. He plans to major in \nbiochemistry and pursue a career in medicine or medical research, and I \nwish him the very best of luck.\n  Sheela Krishnan is a 17-year-old young woman from Suffren, NY, who \nanalyzed Paenicbacillus larvae, the bacterium that causes American \nfoulbrood disease, AFB, a fatal disease that attacks honeybee larvae. \nSheela created a safe, non-invasive and inexpensive preventative \nmeasure to protect honeybees in vivo from AFB. Sheela portrays her work \nin her portfolio entitled ``Isolation and Characterization of a \nPotential Probiotic Cocktail for the Control of American Foulbrood in \nDomestic Honeybees.'' Sheela is a recent high school graduate and will \nbe attending Brown University as a member of the 8-year liberal medical \neducation program. She hopes to major in both anthropology and biology \nand then go on to become a doctor.\n  The research of 17-year-old Adam Solomon, of Bellmore, NY, can help \nunlock clues about stellar evolution and formation, the history of our \ngalaxy, and the formation of planetary systems. Displayed in his \nportfolio entitled ``The Effects of Age on Brown Dwarf Spectral \nFeatures in the Near-Infrared'' is Adam's creation of an analytical \ntool for estimating a brown dwarf's age and mass. Adam will attend Yale \nUniversity where he plans to major in astronomy and physics and hopes \nto move on to the University of Cambridge for a master's then on to \nCaltech or Harvard for a doctorate degree.\n  At the age of 17, Yi Sun, of San Jose, CA, applied combinatorial \nmathematics to derive a formula for the expected winding number of a \nrandom walk on a unit lattice. Scientists can use this research to \npredict how many times the polymer will coil around an obstacle, or \nrod, thus, indicating the strength of the polymer. Yi's astounding \nresearch is displayed in his portfolio entitled, ``Combinatorics: On \nthe Expected Winding Number of a Random Walk on the Unit Lattice,'' and \ncan be used in physics, computer science and material science. Yi \nrecently graduated from The Harker School and will be attending Harvard \nin the fall. Yi plans to major in mathematics and physics and hopes to \npursue careers in both fields.\n  Thirteen-year-old Travis Johnson, of Milwaukie, OR, has been studying \nclassical guitar since he was 8. Travis is establishing himself as an \naward-winning musician, and his portfolio is entitled ``Trails of Hope: \nThe Importance of Adding New Music to the Classical Repertoire.'' \nTravis is currently home-\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\nschooled and taught privately by teachers outside of the home. He \nstudies music at Marylhurst University. Master guitar classes have \nplayed a large role in his life the past few years, and likely will \nplay a role in his career ambition to become a classical guitarist.\n  Albert Shieh is a 16-year-old young man from Paradise Valley, AZ, who \ncreated a computational tool used to analyze genetic sequence \nvariability in humans, which will help in developing a better \nunderstanding of gene sequence variations that occur when a single \nnucleotide in the genome sequence is altered. Albert's research \nportfolio, ``A Novel Algorithm for Automated SNP Genotyping,'' holds \nthe promise to find the genetic basis for Alzheimer's disease, autism, \nand bipolar disorder with highly targeted, personalized treatments. \nAlbert recently graduated from Chaparral High School and will attend \nHarvard in the fall and major in mathematics. Albert aspires to have a \ncareer as an intellectual property lawyer.\n  Anna Stalker, a 15-year-old young woman from Birmingham, AL, \naddresses the persistent search for truth through different literary \nexpressions and experiences in her portfolio, ``The Reincarnation \nJournals.'' In imagistic works, Anna explores the search for truth and \nbeauty through depictions of human interaction and the interactions of \nthe larger cosmos. When Anna's individual pieces are gathered, a larger \nmeaning emerges. Entering her junior year at The Alamont School, Anna's \nmain source of academic and social enrichment is the Duke Talent \nIdentification Program, TIP. Although she has no concrete career goals \nyet, she is sure of one thing--she wants her life to be a meaningful \nreflection of her passions.\n  A 17-year-old young woman from Beaverton, OR, Anarghya Vardhana \nworked in the field of number theory to develop new starting values for \nthe Lucas-Lehmer primality test. Her theorem/method, found in her \nportfolio entitled ``Novel Method of Computing Jacobi Symbols for \nMersenne Numbers,'' can directly contribute to the pharmaceutical, \nchemical, materials, financial and information technology industries. \nHer theory also has broad implications in cryptography, specifically \nenhancing encryption systems to protect against identity theft. A \nrecent high school graduate, Anarghya will attend Stanford University \nin the fall, and is leaning towards a major in physics or biology \ncombined with a math major or minor.\n  Xin--Cindy--Wang is a 17-year-old from Geneva, IL, and is a recent \ngraduate of the Illinois Math and Science Academy. Displayed in her \nportfolio, ``nm2608A, A New Naturally Arising Mouse Model for Human \nAutosomal Recessive Achromatopsia 2,'' is Xin's identification of a \ngene responsible for complete colorblindness in mice. Spanning genetics \nand ophthalmology, her results may one day be used to help people with \nachromatopsia 2, the most severe form of colorblindness, in which \npeople can only see in shades of gray. I wish Xin much luck as she \nbegins attending Harvard in the fall, where she will be working towards \na major in a biology-related field and becoming a college professor.\n  At the age of 16, Steven Wu, of Folsom, CA, is contributing to the \nscientific world in a major way. Steven designed a computer simulation \nalgorithm that produces superior results when compared with the current \ncommercial software in terms of better simulation of ion movement due \nto more accurate electrical field data. Steven's project is entitled \n``Optimizing Quadruple Ion Trap Geometry by Computer Simulations.'' \nAdvancements in ion trap geometry can improve all areas of laboratory \nscience through mass spectrometry, as well as better monitoring of \natmospheric pollutants and detecting hazardous chemical substances. \nSteven will be a senior at Mira Loma High School this fall. He plans to \nmajor in biomedical engineering/bioengineering, combining his interests \nin biochemistry and mathematics and eventually become a research \nphysician/scientist.\n  As I said, these young men and women are more than deserving of the \nawards they have earned. Through hard work and determination, these \nindividuals have already made changes in the fields of science, \nwriting, and mathematics, which will no doubt improve the lives of the \nmany others all over the world. As the President indicated in his State \nof the Union address, our country's future competitiveness in the \nglobal economy will depend on bright and promising young people. \nLearning about these 16 remarkable students makes me optimistic about \nour Nation's future. I thank the Davidson Institute for their efforts \nto encourage and nurture our future leaders in a variety of fields and \nI thank these young and talented scholars for all of their innovative \ncontributions to society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9675-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9675-S9676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to share with the Senate an \nimportant analysis of the current crisis of democracy in the Middle \nEast by one of Egypt's wisest and most courageous voices for democracy.\n  We all have an interest in supporting democracy. We also recognize \nthat countries in the Middle East, including Muslim countries with \nwhich we have close relations, are confronting difficult and divisive \nsocial, religious, and political challenges. These challenges have no \nsimple solutions. But we should be concerned with the support that the \nBush administration, like many of its predecessors, gives to autocratic \nand corrupt regimes in this volatile part of the world. It has \ncontributed to anger and disillusionment, particularly among Muslims, \ntoward their own governments and toward the United States, and growing \nsupport for those who promote extremist political and religious \nagendas.\n  Saad Eddin Ibrahim is a respected Egyptian prodemocracy activist and \nsociologist. He founded the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies \nat the American University of Cairo, one of the few independent \nresearch institutions in the Arab world. He has been wrongly \nimprisoned, and then acquitted, for his criticism of the Egyptian \nGovernment and for his relations with international organizations. Saad \nIbrahim is a respected and principled advocate for human rights and \ndemocratic values, and he represents a voice of reason and tolerance in \nan increasingly polarized and antagonistic Muslim society.\n  His recent op-ed in the Washington Post should serve as a wake-up \ncall for proponents of our current policies in support of repressive \nregimes around the world. He has had the courage to speak out against \nMuslim dictatorships, and he not only represents those who oppose \nauthoritarianism but also those who oppose radical Islam and extremism.\n  All Senators should take the time to consider Saad Ibrahim's \nperspective, and I ask unanimous consent that his op-ed be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 23, 2006]\n\n               The ``New Middle East'' Bush Is Resisting\n\n                        (By Saad Eddin Ibrahim)\n\n       President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice may \n     be quite right about a new Middle East being born. In fact, \n     their policies in support of the actions of their closest \n     regional ally, Israel, have helped midwife the newborn. But \n     it will not be exactly the baby they have longed for. For one \n     thing, it will be neither secular nor friendly to the United \n     States. For another, it is going to be a rough birth.\n       What is happening in the broader Middle East and North \n     Africa can be seen as a boomerang effect that has been \n     playing out slowly since the horrific events of Sept. 11, \n     2001. In the immediate aftermath of those attacks, there was \n     worldwide sympathy for the United States and support for its \n     declared ``war on terrorism,'' including the invasion of \n     Afghanistan. Then the cynical exploitation of this universal \n     goodwill by so-called neoconservatives to advance hegemonic \n     designs was confirmed by the war in Iraq. The Bush \n     administration's dishonest statements about ``weapons of mass \n     destruction'' diminished whatever credibility the United \n     States might have had as liberator, while disastrous \n     mismanagement of Iraqi affairs after the invasion led to the \n     squandering of a conventional military victory. The country \n     slid into bloody sectarian violence, while official \n     Washington stonewalled and refused to admit mistakes. No \n     wonder the world has progressively turned against America.\n       Against this declining moral standing, President Bush made \n     something of a comeback in the first year of his second term. \n     He shifted his foreign policy rhetoric from a ``war on \n     terrorism'' to a war of ideas and a struggle for liberty and \n     democracy. Through much of 2005 it looked as if the Middle \n     East\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\n     might finally have its long-overdue spring of freedom. \n     Lebanon forged a Cedar Revolution, triggered by the \n     assassination of its popular former prime minister, Rafiq \n     Hariri. Egypt held its first multi-candidate presidential \n     election in 50 years. So did Palestine and Iraq, despite \n     harsh conditions of occupation. Qatar and Bahrain in the \n     Arabian Gulf continued their steady evolution into \n     constitutional monarchies. Even Saudi Arabia held its first \n     municipal elections.\n       But there was more. Hamas mobilized candidates and popular \n     campaigns to win a plurality in Palestinian legislative \n     elections and form a new government. Hezbollah in Lebanon and \n     the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt achieved similar electoral \n     successes. And with these developments, a sudden chill fell \n     over Washington and other Western capitals.\n       Instead of welcoming these particular elected officials \n     into the newly emerging democratic fold, Washington began a \n     cold war on Muslim democrats. Even the tepid pressure on \n     autocratic allies of the United States to democratize in 2005 \n     had all but disappeared by 2006. In fact, tottering Arab \n     autocrats felt they had a new lease on life with the West \n     conveniently cowed by an emerging Islamist political force.\n       Now the cold war on Islamists has escalated into a shooting \n     war, first against Hamas in Gaza and then against Hezbollah \n     in Lebanon. Israel is perceived in the region, rightly or \n     wrongly, to be an agent acting on behalf of U.S. interests. \n     Some will admit that there was provocation for Israel to \n     strike at Hamas and Hezbollah following the abduction of \n     three soldiers and attacks on military and civilian targets. \n     But destroying Lebanon with an overkill approach born of a \n     desire for vengeance cannot be morally tolerated or \n     politically justified--and it will not work.\n       On July 30 Arab, Muslim and world outrage reached an \n     unprecedented level with the Israeli bombing of a residential \n     building in the Lebanese village of Qana, which killed dozens \n     and wounded hundreds of civilians, most of them children. A \n     similar massacre in Qana in 1996, which Arabs remember \n     painfully well, proved to be the political undoing of \n     then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres. It is too early to \n     predict whether Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will survive \n     Qana II and the recent war. But Hezbollah will survive, \n     just as it has already outlasted five Israeli prime \n     ministers and three American presidents.\n       Born in the thick of an earlier Israeli invasion, in 1982, \n     Hezbollah is at once a resistance movement against foreign \n     occupation, a social service provider for the needy of the \n     rural south and the slum-dwellers of Beirut, and a model \n     actor in Lebanese and Middle Eastern politics. Despite access \n     to millions of dollars in resources from within and from \n     regional allies Syria and Iran, its three successive leaders \n     have projected an image of clean governance and a pious \n     personal lifestyle.\n       In more than four weeks of fighting against the strongest \n     military machine in the region, Hezbollah held its own and \n     won the admiration of millions of Arabs and Muslims. People \n     in the region have compared its steadfastness with the swift \n     defeat of three large Arab armies in the Six-Day War of 1967. \n     Hasan Nasrallah, its current leader, spoke several times to a \n     wide regional audience through his own al-Manar network as \n     well as the more popular al-Jazeera. Nasrallah has become a \n     household name in my own country, Egypt.\n       According to the preliminary results of a recent public \n     opinion survey of 1,700 Egyptians by the Cairo-based Ibn \n     Khaldun Center, Hezbollah's action garnered 75 percent \n     approval, and Nasrallah led a list of 30 regional public \n     figures ranked by perceived importance. He appears on 82 \n     percent of responses, followed by Iranian President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad (73 percent), Khaled Meshal of Hamas (60 \n     percent), Osama bin Laden (52 percent) and Mohammed Mahdi \n     Akef of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood (45 percent).\n       The pattern here is clear, and it is Islamic. And among the \n     few secular public figures who made it into the top 10 are \n     Palestinian Marwan Barghouti (31 percent) and Egypt's Ayman \n     Nour (29 percent), both of whom are prisoners of conscience \n     in Israeli and Egyptian jails, respectively.\n       None of the current heads of Arab states made the list of \n     the 10 most popular public figures. While subject to future \n     fluctuations, these Egyptian findings suggest the direction \n     in which the region is moving. The Arab people do not respect \n     the ruling regimes, perceiving them to be autocratic, corrupt \n     and inept. They are, at best, ambivalent about the fanatical \n     Islamists of the bin Laden variety. More mainstream Islamists \n     with broad support, developed civic dispositions and services \n     to provide are the most likely actors in building a new \n     Middle East. In fact, they are already doing so through the \n     Justice and Development Party in Turkey, the similarly named \n     PJD in Morocco, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in \n     Palestine and, yes, Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n       These groups, parties and movements are not inimical to \n     democracy. They have accepted electoral systems and practiced \n     electoral politics, probably too well for Washington's taste. \n     Whether we like it or not, these are the facts. The rest of \n     the Western world must come to grips with the new reality, \n     even if the U.S. president and his secretary of state \n     continue to reject the new offspring of their own policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9676-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9676-S9677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to discuss the \nsituation in Sri Lanka, which not long ago was one of promise after a \ncease-fire agreement was signed in 2002 between the former government \nand the LTTE ``Tamil Tigers.'' The cease-fire was never perfect, but \nfor several years negotiations on a political settlement offered a ray \nof hope for an end to the conflict. After April 2006, however, there \nwas escalating violence and an increasing pattern of violations of the \ncease-fire agreement by both sides.\n  On July 20, the LTTE closed a reservoir sluice gate in an LTTE-\ncontrolled area near the eastern town of Trincomalee, cutting the water \nsupply to about 60,000 people in Government-controlled territory. In \nresponse, Sri Lankan Government forces conducted airstrikes over \nseveral days against LTTE positions in the area and on July 30 began a \nground offensive to capture the reservoir's control point. This \nincrease in violence contributed to the more than 800 deaths reported \nbetween January and August, including some in which large numbers of \ncivilians were killed in flagrant violations of international law by \nboth sides, and hundreds more combatants and civilians have died since \nthen.\n  Politically motivated killings, the recruitment of child soldiers, \nindiscriminate raids on civilians, targeting of international aid \nworkers, and torture in police custody are only some of the human \nrights abuses that have been recently committed as reported by Amnesty \nInternational and Human Rights Watch. Additionally, a looming \nhumanitarian crisis exists as the number of Sri Lankans displaced \nwithin the country by fighting this year has passed the 200,000 mark, \nand an estimated 8,700 citizens have fled to India. Road, air, and sea \nlinks to the Tamil population in the north have been cut, and food, \nwater, and fuel shortages are severe.\n  We should be deeply concerned with the collapse of the peace process \nand escalating violence in Sri Lanka. Although it is apparent that \nneither the Government nor the LTTE can defeat the other militarily, \nnor have they demonstrated the political will to stop the fighting and \nresolve this conflict peacefully. A report on September 13 that the \nGovernment and the LTTE have proposed new peace talks is welcome. But \nthe Sri Lankan people have been disappointed countless times before. \nSeveral steps should be taken immediately, most importantly to prevent \nfurther harm to civilians who have suffered disproportionately.\n  It is critical that humanitarian aid be allowed to reach those who \nhave been displaced, whether as a result of the conflict or the \nlingering effects of the December 2004 tsunami. Relief agencies need \nunimpeded access to the affected populations, and civilians should be \nallowed to leave contested areas.\n  The LTTE has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. \nGovernment on account of its wanton attacks against civilians and \nforced recruitment of children. These abusive tactics, which flagrantly \nviolate international law, should be universally condemned.\n  There is also the issue of U.S. support to Sri Lankan Government \nsecurity forces, who have been responsible for violations of human \nrights. The Department of State needs to be doubly sure that the Leahy \namendment, which prohibits U.S. assistance to units of foreign security \nforces who violate human rights, is being strictly complied with.\n  In addition, we should reaffirm our support for the Sri Lanka \nMonitoring Mission, which reports on violations of the cease-fire by \nboth sides. A stronger monitoring presence would deter abuses, provide \nsystematic documentation of violations, and help to address the problem \nof impunity that has contributed to the recurrent cycles of violence \nand reprisal in Sri Lanka.\n  Sri Lanka is a divided country, but its people, whether Sinhalese, \nTamil, or Muslim, are as gentle, industrious, and peace loving as any \nin the world. The Tamils have legitimate demands, but the LTTE's \ntactics are deplorable.

Mr. President, today we remember the life and work of \nMunir Said Thalib, Indonesia's foremost human rights defender, who on \nSeptember 7, 2004, was fatally poisoned while on an airplane flight to \nthe Netherlands where he planned to continue his legal studies. This \ndespicable crime, in which the Indonesian Intelligence Service has been \nimplicated, had repercussions throughout Asia and around the world and \nhas particularly serious implications for Indonesia.\n  Munir was an outstanding human rights advocate best known as a \nfounder and director of the highly respected Commission for \n``Disappeared'' Persons and Victims of Violence. He was working as the \ndirector of the Jakarta-based human rights group Imparsial before his \nmurder. In 2000, Munir received the Right Livelihood Award ``for his \ncourage and dedication in fighting for human rights and the civilian \ncontrol of the military in Indonesia.''\n  Two years after his untimely and tragic death, the Indonesian \nGovernment has failed to properly investigate and prosecute those \nresponsible. Despite the conviction of an airline pilot for his role in \nthe murder, the police and Attorney General's office continue to ignore \nthe evidence and recommendations of a Presidential fact-finding team \nthat has implicated senior Indonesian intelligence officers and airline \nofficials in the crime. President Yudhoyono has rightly described this \nmatter as a test case for whether Indonesia has changed from its \nauthoritarian past. At this point, it appears that a culture of \nimpunity remains deeply embedded in Indonesian society.\n  The fiscal year 2007 State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill \nthat was reported by the Appropriations Committee on July 10, 2006, \nincludes my amendment which requires a report on progress on human \nrights in Indonesia, including the investigation of the murder of Munir \nSaid Thaib. If the Indonesia Government aspires to be seen as one that \nrespects human rights and the rule of law, which is fundamental to any \ndemocracy, it is essential that whoever was responsible for ordering \nand carrying out this heinous crime be identified and brought to \njustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9677-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9677-S9678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ANN RICHARDS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Governor Ann Richards, \nwho died last week at the age of 73.\n  Humor is one of the chief democratic virtues. A good joke can wipe \nout differences of rank, bring down the self-exalted, and join audience \nand speaker in a common bond. A sense of humor is an especially \npriceless quality in a political leader because it exposes the \npretensions that always seem to accumulate around the state, and it \nreminds us that we are still a people's government.\n  Governor Richards is being remembered this week as an innovative \nleader, a pioneer for women, and, I might add, one tough cookie. But we \nshould also take a moment, on the occasion of her sad death, to \nremember something else we have lost--her wonderful sense of humor. And \nif we could take a positive thing from her passing, it might be that we \nhave had the opportunity to remind ourselves of all the many times she \nmade us laugh. We all remember Ann's remark that ``Ginger Rogers did \neverything Fred Astaire did--she just did it backwards and in high \nheels.'' And we all treasured her earthiness--for instance, when she \nallowed that she regretted her 1994 election defeat ``Oh, for about \nfive seconds.''\n  Of course, there have always been people who have found a sense of \nhumor threatening, especially when it is in their idea of the wrong \nhands. As Texas columnist Molly Ivins said of the Governor, ``I mean, \nwith Ann it was a real problem. . . . They just did not know what to \nmake of her. . . . If they realize that a woman can be funny, I think \nmen are afraid that tone can be used against them. And they don't like \nit.''\n  The truth is that Ann Richards--the first woman to be elected \nGovernor of Texas in her own right--had to fight against bias her whole \npolitical life. At every stage, she was more than a match. In the early \n1960s, Ann was forced to help found the North Texas Democratic Women \n``basically to allow us to have something substantive to do.'' And \nasked at the end of her long career why she had entered politics, Ann \nreplied: ``I did not want my tombstone to read, `She kept a really \nclean house.''' Instead of accepting others' ideas of what was best for \nher, Governor Richards opened her own path--and everyone who follows \nher, in Texas and in every other State, owes her thanks.\n  But there is another danger to humor. As she wrote in her 1989 \nautobiography, ``I was always worried because there is a general \nfeeling that if you're funny you're not serious.'' That pressure is \nparticularly acute for a politician. But Ann taught us all that \nlaughter draws on great honesty and insight--that depth and humor can \nexist in the same spirit. ``Humor is a powerful tool,'' she continued. \n``It clears the air. Once you laugh, your mind is opened and then you \nare able to hear the other things that are being said to you.''\n  Governor Richards showed her depth in 4 years of successful policies \nin Texas. She presided over the dramatic growth of her State's economy, \nand her audits on the State bureaucracy saved taxpayers $6 billion. She \nreformed Texas's prison system, pursued a truly egalitarian policy for \neducation funding, and saw a dramatic increase in student achievement \nscores on her watch. And through all of her success, Governor Richards \nnever forgot the prejudice she had faced--and so she worked tirelessly \nto include members of marginalized groups in the people's work. Ann \nRichards appointed more women and minorities than any of her \npredecessors. She was responsible for the first crime victim on the \nState Criminal Justice Board, the first disabled member of the human \nservices board, the first teacher to chair the State board of \neducation, the first Black regent at the University of Texas, and the \nfirst Black and female officers in the elite Texas Rangers.\n  And while many ex-politicians have a habit of fading into the sunset, \nAnn remained a dynamo. She worked in international law, taught at Texas \nand Brandeis, continued to write, and campaigned for members of her \nparty across the country, right to the end--in fact, I am sure many of \nus in this Chamber owe Ann thanks for her help on the stump. What Ann \naccomplished after leaving the Governor's mansion could have been a \nfull career for someone less ambitious or full of life. And her 2004 \nbook had an exceedingly apt title--``I'm Not Slowing Down,'' a phrase \nthat embodied the energy and Texas doggedness we loved in her.\n  It took cancer to stop Ann Richards. And though she has gone, we will \nremember her as one of the great political characters of the 20th \ncentury. We will miss her boldness and her silver tongue. But we will \nremember what she taught us over a five-decade life in politics: Jokes \ndon't just make us laugh. They force us to see more clearly and \nsympathize more fully; and they bring us a little closer to the state \nof equality that is the whole reason our Nation is.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to former \nGovernor of Texas Ann Richards. She was a role model, an inspiration, \nand an abiding friend to me and to my husband. On Wednesday, she passed \naway in her home, surrounded by loved ones. I will truly miss her warm \nfriendship, her guidance, and her inimitable sense of humor.\n  Ann Richards blazed a trail for women everywhere, and she did so \nwithout ever losing her spirit, grace, optimism, charm, and sense that \nwe can all build a better world.\n  She was wonderful about giving guidance. She always made sure to take \nthe time to give advice to new women candidates. When I was considering \na run for the Senate, she told me that it would be hard, it would be \ntough, but if you want to make a difference, then you need to put \nyourself out there. And she was right.\n  She was born in 1933 in Lakeview, TX, to Ona and Cecil Willis. The \nfamily\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\nmoved into Waco so that she could attend Waco High School. She taught \npublic school at Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, and she often \nsaid it was the hardest job she ever held. In 1982 she was elected \nState treasurer in Texas, making her the first woman elected statewide \nin almost 50 years. And she won an uphill battle to become the first \nwoman in Texas history to win the race for Governor in her own right.\n  She often spoke about being motivated to enter politics in order to \nhelp others, particularly the women and minorities who traditionally \nhad been shut out of positions of power. She once said, ``I did not \nwant my tombstone to read, `She kept a really clean house.' I think I'd \nlike them to remember me by saying, `She opened government to \neveryone.'''\n  As Governor, she made it a priority to open positions of power to \nwomen and minorities and to advocate for what she called the ``New \nTexas,'' a place where her daughters would never feel that they were \nheld back because of their gender. Under her leadership, Texas student \nachievement scores rose and dropout rates fell. As Governor, she grew \nthe economy, created an ethics commission, pursued insurance reform, \nestablished rehabilitation programs for prison inmates, and fought \ncrime. And she even found the time to earn a motorcycle driver's \nlicense on the occasion of her 60th birthday.\n  Even after she left office, she never stopped working on new ways to \nencourage women to get involved. One of her last projects, the creation \nof the Ann Richards School for Young Woman Leaders, is slated to open \nin Austin in 2007. It will be a tribute to her legacy to see the \nremarkable new generation of leaders the school will nurture.\n  Today, her loving children Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen, and her \neight grandchildren, are testament in themselves to Ann's generosity of \nspirit and enduring influence.\n  Ann Richards had an ability to draw people to her with her warmth and \ngood humor, and her sharp wit and homespun wisdom was legendary. She \nwas never afraid to stick up for what she believed in. She will truly \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9678-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING JEAN SMITH\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard \nwork and amazing results of the Weed and Seed organization of Rapid \nCity, SD.\n  The Rapid City group will cease operations later this month after \nnearly a decade of tireless efforts to rehabilitate a significant \nportion of the residential and business area in the community.\n  In partnership with organizations that included the Rapid City Police \nDepartment, the Center for Restorative Justice, Volunteers of America, \nthe Project Safe Neighborhood/Gunwise Program and Good Housekeeping, \ndozens of individuals came together to address neighborhood crime, \nabuse, housing and aesthetic issues.\n  Primarily focused on the East North and East Boulevard neighborhoods, \nthe Rapid City Weed and Seed organization worked with the Rapid City \nPolice Department on a zero tolerance policy with an aggressive police \npresence in areas that were beset with crime, homelessness and urban \nblight issues.\n  The group worked with Rapid City leaders to aggressively enforce city \ncodes involving housing. Vacated and rundown homes and businesses were \ntorn down and replaced with new and thriving businesses and new homes. \nOther businesses, homes and apartment complexes were expanded and \nrenovated during this time frame. Efforts to revitalize Roosevelt Park \nresulted in the construction of a new ice arena and indoor swimming \npool, as part of the city's 2012 economic development program. A \nbusiness association was formed to bring together local business owners \nto discuss relevant issues of importance. The Weed and Seed \norganization also developed an ``Adopt a Creek'' program with 23 \nsections of Rapid Creek adopted by local companies, organizations and \nfamilies. The first major cleanup of Rapid Creek since the tragic 1972 \nflood resulted in the collection of 18 tons of trash, including debris \nfrom the 1972 flood event.\n  Four townhall meetings were conducted with local residents and annual \npicnics were sponsored to develop a sense of camaraderie and connection \nbetween neighbors.\n  As a result of these efforts, the East North and East Boulevard areas \nhave once again become a source of pride for the community. This sense \nof pride is now reflected in the residents and businesses located in \nthe area. These results are due in large part to the collective work of \nthe Rapid City Weed and Seed organization and the partnerships that \nwere developed with city officials, law enforcement agencies and the \nlocal businesses.\n  Funded through a 5-year Weed and Seed grant of $1.025 million, the \nlocal organization will cease operations later this month. I wish to \nrecognize the vision and hard-working efforts of the dozens of Rapid \nCity citizens and officials who have provided tireless efforts to \nrehabilitate and renovate a key part of the community.\n  I wish to recognize the help of executive director Patricia Pummel \nand board members Wayne Asscherick, Phyllis Boernke, Dave Bussard, Jim \nCastleberry, Patrick Clinch, Cynthia Clinch, Linda M. Colhoff, Richard \nCooper, Lt. Ray Cornford, Darcy Dennison, Lee Dennison, Ken Edel, Fred \nEisenbraun, Lawren Erickson, Dan Island, Adeline Kalmbeck, Jim Kinyon, \nCraig Kirsch, Eileen Leir, Burt Long, Carol Long, State legislator \nAlice McCoy, Jim McCoy, Dave Morgan, Lou Morgan, Sharon Oney, Kenneth \nPalmer, Gloria Pluimer, Alys Ratigan, Kerri Severson, Mickey Snook, \nRoberta Stevens, Betty Strobel, Raymond Summers, Patricia Trumble, \nWilliam Trumble, Holli Vanderbeek, Jerry Walenta, Lt. David Walton, Les \nWermers, Dexter Wittman, Rapid City Mayor Jim Shaw, former mayor Jerry \nMunson and Connie Ewing.\n  Thanks to the efforts of these individuals, other concerned and \ncommitted citizens, and officials in Rapid City, the East North and \nEast Boulevard areas of Rapid City have been effectively rehabilitated. \nThe efforts of this organization may serve as a model for other Weed \nand Seed organizations in the country. Although ceasing operations, the \nvision and tireless efforts of individuals in the Rapid City Weed and\n\n[[Page S9679]]\n\nSeed organization will be maintained. I wish to commend the energetic \nand innovative work of the Rapid City Weed and Seed organization and \nthe individuals involved in their great work over the past several \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9679-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. ESTELLE R. RAMEY\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on September 8, our Nation lost a \ngreat American and my husband and I lost a wonderful friend of over 20 \nyears. Dr. Estelle R. Ramey was a respected endocrinologist, \nphysiologist, and feminist. She was a woman of great wit and wisdom who \nfought gender discrimination in the scientific professions and in the \nconduct of medical research. Dr. Ramey died of Alzheimer's disease at \nthe age of 89.\n  Estelle Rubin Ramey was born in Detroit and raised in New York City. \nHer mother, a wise but impoverished and illiterate immigrant, insisted \nthat her daughter be educated. At the age of 15 in the midst of the \nGreat Depression, Dr. Ramey was able to attend Brooklyn College for the \nprice of a library card. Ignoring the gender restrictions of his time, \none of her professors made it possible for Estelle to have the \nopportunity to teach chemistry at the new Queens College while working \nfor her master's in chemistry at Columbia. While at Columbia she met \nher husband, James Ramey, who was a student at the law school. Their \nlove affair lasted for over 65 years. Estelle, with her trademark wit \nand self-deprecation, would attribute their successful marriage to \nnever once having had a meaningful conversation.\n  Dr. Ramey earned her doctorate in physiology and biophysics at the \nUniversity of Chicago and upon returning to Washington, she became a \nfaculty member at Georgetown Medical School where she taught for over \n35 years. Her decades of research in endocrinology brought her \naccolades and recognition in the world of medicine, while her ability \nto express the cause for gender equity with honesty and a rapier wit \nmade her a popular speaker, and eminently quotable. However, as it was \nstated so well in her September 10 obituary in the Washington Post, \n``Her wit was rooted in statistics, scientific research and personal \nexperience with discrimination.'' In 1971, she was a founder and second \npresident of the Association for Women in Science, an organization \ndedicated to achieving equity and full participation for women in \nscience, mathematics, engineering and technology.\n  Estelle was known to all of us who loved her as Stelle, and at \nGeorgetown Medical School as ``La Belle Estelle.'' These endearing \nnicknames are a testament to her boundless humanity. She and her \nhusband Jim felt very strongly about how little, if anything, it took \nto extend a helping hand to someone else. She wrote in a book entitled \n``Letters to our Grandchildren'': ``If I could leave you with any \nadvice, it would be to speak words of caring not only to those closest \nto you, to all the hungry ears you encounter on your journey through a \ncold world. Stop on the mountain climb to bring along all those less \nlucky, less agile or well endowed. It will make the view even more \nbeautiful when you get to the top. For my own epitaph, I ask that it \nbe: `I loved and was loved and all the rest was background music.'''\n  Dr. Ramey leaves her husband Jim and two children: attorney Drucilla \nStender Ramey of New York and James Ramey of Bethesda, MD, a physician. \nEstelle Ramey will be missed greatly by those of us who had the benefit \nof her warmth and friendship, and she will be remembered for her \ndedication to her family, to science and her profession, and to all \nwomen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9679-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9679-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations including withdrawals which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9679-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILLS PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, September 18, \n2006, she had presented to the President of the United States the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2590.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy of water resources in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, above-average rainfall in New Mexico \nthis summer has led many to turn a blind eye to the grim water \nsituation faced by our State only 2 months ago. New Mexico was fast \napproaching a disaster due to drought. Many of our municipalities' \nwells were running dry and reservoirs were at dangerously low levels. \nProvidence intervened; narrowly averting a crisis resulting from water \nscarcity.\n  The development of the centrifugal pump was an event of great \nsignificance in the history of the West. Windmill driven pumps provided \nenough water for a family and several livestock. The centrifugal pump, \non the other hand, was capable of pumping 800 gallons of water a \nminute, making possible the habitation of what was previously barren \ndesert. To a large extent, this invention provided the water for \ngrowing towns and agricultural industry. However, it also resulted in a \ngreat dependence on groundwater. As such, we need to fully understand \nthe nature and extent of our groundwater resources. This bill will \nprovide us with the information necessary to ensure that the water on \nwhich we have come to rely is available for years to come.\n  During times of drought, when surface water is scarce, we must be \nable to reliably turn to groundwater reserves. Approximately 90 percent \nof New Mexicans depend on groundwater for drinking water and 77 percent \nof New Mexicans obtain water exclusively from groundwater sources. \nWhile groundwater supplies throughout the State are coming under \nincreasing competition, not enough is known about these resources in \norder to make sound decisions regarding their use.\n  Nearly 40 percent of the State's population resides in the Middle Rio \nGrande Basin. Once thought to contain vast quantities of water, we are \nnow faced with the reality the Middle Rio Grande Basin contains far \nless water than originally thought. Between 1995 and 2001, the United \nStates Geological Survey undertook a study of the basin which added \ngreatly to our knowledge regarding the primary source of water for our \nlargest population center. Had we proceeded with our water planning \nwithout the information provided by this study, I have little doubt \nthat we would ultimately find ourselves in a dire situation. However, \nthere is much more to be learned about this basin.\n  Roughly 65 percent of the State's population lives along the Rio \nGrande. Also located along the river are the four largest cities in New \nMexico: Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Rio Rancho and Las Cruces. While the \ncompletion of the San Juan-Chama Diversion by the Albuquerque \nBernalillo County Water Utility Authority will allow the county of \nBernalillo and city of Albuquerque to take advantage of their \nallocation of San Juan-Chama water, the remainder of the cities and \ncounties located along the Rio Grande will continue to receive the \nmajority of their water from aquifers beneath the Rio Grande. Aside \nfrom the Middle Rio Grande Basin, we have limited knowledge of the \namount of water contained in the aquifers below the Rio Grande, the \nrate at which they recharge, aquifer contamination, and the interaction \nbetween surface flows and ground water.\n  Elsewhere in the State, even less is understood regarding groundwater \nresources. While there is limited unallocated surface water in the \nState, there are significant quantities of untapped underground water \nin the Tularosa and Salt Basins. The Tularosa Basin is approximately 60 \nmiles wide and 200 miles long. Making the conservative estimate that 10 \npercent of the water contained in that aquifer is available for use \nthrough desalination, it would provide 100 years of water for a city \nthe size of Albuquerque. With the development of desalination \ntechnology, I anticipate that even a greater amount of the brackish \nwater contained in the Tularosa Basin will be available for human use.\n  Another untapped water supply is the Salt Basin located in southern \nNew Mexico. The basin lies in a geologically complex area and our \nunderstanding of the total resource is incomplete. However, initial \nestimates predict sustainable withdrawals on the order of 100,000 acre-\nfeet per year of potable water from the New Mexico portion of the \naquifer. This is enough water to support a city the size of our largest \nmunicipal area. Additional brackish resources in that basin are highly \nlikely. Because the basin is located near expanding metropolitan areas \nnear the U.S.-Mexico Border, it is a resource of critical importance.\n  The bill I introduce today would direct the United States Geological \nSurvey, in collaboration with the State of New Mexico, to undertake a \ngroundwater resources study in the State of New Mexico. A comprehensive \nstudy of the State's water resources is critical to effective water \nplanning. Absent such a study, I fear that there is a significant \nlikelihood that we may be depleting aquifers at an unsustainable rate.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for being an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation. I also thank Representative Heather Wilson for introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives and I look \nforward to working with them to ensure the bill's passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3707\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit for fuel-efficient motor vehicles and to require major \nintegrated oil companies to amortize intangible drilling and \ndevelopment costs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, after years and years of congressional \ngridlock on the issue of automobile efficiency, I and Senator Bennett \nof Utah are today bringing to the Senate legislation that is market \noriented, bipartisan, and a bill that we believe will bring millions \nand millions of fuel-efficient automobiles, cars, and trucks to the \nstreets of our country.\n  We put our Nation on the road to energy independence by rewarding \ndrivers who buy more fuel-efficient cars, trucks, and SUVs. These \nrewards, under the legislation I have drafted with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, are available on a sliding scale. The \nmore fuel-efficient the vehicle, the greater the reward that the \nconsumer would receive.\n  We also put the brakes on a needless subsidy to the major oil \ncompanies and use the savings that are derived from stopping that \nwindfall to reward consumers in their wallets for helping to end our \ncountry's oil dependence. To his credit, the President of the United \nStates has said: You don't need these incentives when oil is over $55 a \nbarrel, as it is today.\n  I asked the CEOs when the major oil companies came before a joint \nhearing--I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska in the chair. He \nwill recall at our hearing, the joint Commerce and Energy hearing that \nwas held, I asked the oil company executives of the major companies \nwhether they needed the various tax breaks that were currently offered, \nand to a person, they said they did not.\n  I see my good friend from Utah, and I thank him for his efforts to \nmake this legislation bipartisan. What I will do, now that the Senator \nfrom Utah has arrived, is briefly describe how our bipartisan \nlegislation works and why we think this will be a major transformation \nin terms of the cars, trucks, and SUVs on the roads of our country.\n  Under our bipartisan, market-oriented bill, consumers who buy \nvehicles that are at least 25 percent more fuel efficient than the \napplicable standards, called CAFE, would get a rebate of at least $630 \nand as much as $1,860 for the most fuel-efficient cars. We have \nseparate standards for cars and trucks so the consumers can choose the \ntype of vehicle they want and still get the rebate or the credit as \nlong as they choose a fuel-efficient model.\n  In the past, the automobile industry has said that fuel economy \nstandards are hard to achieve because car buyers place little value on \nfuel economy. The new program created by our bill directly addresses \nthat concern by providing rebates to consumers for purchasing fuel-\nefficient vehicles.\n  Many in the automobile industry have also said that car buyers don't \nfully appreciate the value of lifetime fuel savings at the time of \npurchase. I and Senator Bennett believe this will change that by \nproviding the rebates or the credits through focusing consumer \nattention on fuel efficiency at the time of purchase.\n  It will be possible for consumers at the time of purchase to see the \ntype of notice I am holding as a sticker on the window of the \nautomobile. So right at the time of purchase, because of this sticker--\nI am holding a copy of it--it will be possible for purchasers to see \nthe real value of fuel-efficient purchases in the automotive sector.\n  For vehicles that qualify, the rebate or credit amount would be \nprinted on the window sticker, as I have described, and the consumer \ncould claim the rebate as a tax credit on his or her tax \nreturn. Alternatively, I and Senator Bennett conceived that the rebate \ncould be transferred to automobile dealers, allowing dealers to provide \nthe rebates to consumers as cash back at the time of purchase.\n\n  In our view, the legislation also builds on the incentives that were \nprovided in the Energy bill specifically for hybrid gasoline/electric-\npowered cars. We believe the approach that we are advocating will be \nespecially popular because it is simpler and fairer. For example, \nunlike the hybrid credit that is in the energy bill, there is no \nphaseout of the incentives we propose, based on when a hybrid carmaker \nsells its 60,000th car. Because our legislation eliminates the truly \ncomplicated phaseout of the credit that now exists, it is our view that \nconsumers will not be confused as they are today about when they can \nget a credit and how much it will be. Also, unlike the approach taken \nin the energy legislation, our bipartisan bill does not pick winners \nand losers among competitive technology. It takes a technology-neutral \napproach that allows any vehicle that has superior fuel efficiency to \nqualify for a rebate, whether it uses hybrid or conventional \ntechnologies.\n  I also want to emphasize why I think it is important that we take \nbolder action to jumpstart the markets for fuel-efficient vehicles. As \nI mentioned, there is a phaseout for the incentives today based on when \na hybrid carmaker sells its 60,000th car. We have tried to get our arms \naround exactly how many of these alternative-fuel vehicles are going to \nbe purchased this year. Many estimates seem to be just a bit over \n100,000. But compare those 100,000 hybrids to the 1.8 million vehicles \nthat could be purchased with the kind of incentives that I and Senator \nBennett are proposing. We are significantly increasing, through a \nmarketplace approach, the chance to multiply many times over the number \nof fuel-efficient vehicles on the streets of our country. The \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska who is in the chair has sat in on \nmany of the debates with me on the Energy Committee where we have heard \nviews expressed about what could be done through a regulatory approach. \nThose approaches have been fought to gridlock on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  What I and Senator Bennett want to do is something very different. We \nwant to use a marketplace approach to significantly jumpstart the \nmarket for these fuel-efficient vehicles over the next 5 years. Compare \n100,000 hybrid vehicles that are likely to be purchased this year to \nthe 1.8 million vehicles that could be purchased for each of the next 5 \nyears under the legislation we are advocating and we get a sense of the \ndifference in approach and why we think ours is very much needed and \ncan make a break with the policies that have produced gridlock on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Finally, I would wrap up by saying that the legislation I and Senator \nBennett are proposing is fully paid for. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, our bill saves $6.8 billion by limiting just one \nof the tax breaks that the major oil companies have said they no longer \nneed. It is known as the expensing of intangible drilling costs, which \nincludes land acquisition costs, development costs, and the costs of \nleasing equipment. The Congressional Research Service has called this \nspecial break economically inefficient. I looked very carefully at it \nafter the hearing attended by myself and the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska and others, when I asked the major oil executives if they needed \nall of the tax breaks that were currently allowed under the code. They \nsaid they did not. The President, to his credit, said the major oil \ncompanies do not need tax\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\nbreaks when the price of oil is over $55 a barrel.\n  So according to the analysis done by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nthe savings derived by limiting one tax break for major oil companies \nmore than covers the $1.3 billion-per-year cost of the marketplace-\noriented rebate and credit program.\n  To finally sum up, I believe our legislation--we call it OILSAVE--is \na winner for consumers, a winner for energy security, and a winner for \ntaxpayers. It is a win for the consumer because it helps our Nation's \nenergy security by the purchase of what could be millions of fuel-\nefficient cars and trucks and SUVs. It helps us kick our Nation's oil \ndependence by stimulating the purchase of a number of greener vehicles \nat home and by limiting a tax break the Congressional Research Service \ncalls economically inefficient. Finally, it is a win for our taxpayers \nbecause after the major oil company executives said that they didn't \nneed this break, and the President indicated that with oil at these \nprices you didn't need incentives, it is possible for us now to \njumpstart the marketplace for these vehicles without any additional \ncosts to the taxpayers.\n  So I hope my colleagues will reflect on the difference between this \ndiscussion and the ones we have had previously on the floor of the \nSenate. The decibel level got pretty high during those past debates. \nWhen Senator Bennett and I launched our discussion, it was a different \nkind of discussion. It was a discussion about how we can find common \nground in the Senate, how we can be significantly bolder in the area of \nautomobile efficiency. We have zeroed in on this area, an area I know \nhas been of interest to the Presiding Officer over the years, because \nautomobile efficiency is the ball game as it relates to the issue of \nenergy security. That is where our oil is going.\n  So I hope our colleagues will be interested in the legislation that \nwe are bringing to the Senate today. The OILSAVE legislation is a \ndeparture from the polarized debates we have had in this body.\n  I want to say, wrapping up, that I don't think I could have a better \npartner for this particular effort than the distinguished Senator from \nUtah. He is the chair, as our colleagues know, of the Joint Economic \nCommittee. He has been interested in energy legislation as a member of \nthe Republican leadership for quite some time. I would note that today \nis his birthday, and he has decided to use this special day, when his \nfamily is clamoring for his time, to be part of this bipartisan effort \nwith me. I am very grateful for his involvement in this task, and I \nwould like to yield the floor, if I might.\n  I also see our distinguished friend from West Virginia here, and if \nit is acceptable, perhaps Senator Bennett could wrap up for our \nlegislation, and then I know the entire Senate wishes to here the \nremarks of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the OILSAVE bill introduced \ntoday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon for his \noverly kind remarks. I have enjoyed working with him on this particular \nproject. It is very clear he has the initiative on this legislation, \nbut I am happy to respond to his initiative and lend what assistance I \npossibly can.\n  I want to make just a few additional comments about the presentation \nhe has made. I have always been very nervous about CAFE standards. For \nthose who are watching and don't know what CAFE standards mean, it has \nnothing to do with lunch, but it comes from the acronym CAFE, or \ncorporate aggregate fleet emissions, having to do with automobiles.\n  I have always thought that whenever government gets in the way of the \nmarket, government tends to make mistakes with the market. I think we \ncan look back over the years of the CAFE standards, and in an effort to \nget lower emissions and more efficiency out of our automobiles, we have \nhad a situation where manufacturers have had to make cars people don't \nwant to buy, just to make the CAFE standard requirements. I am always \nnervous about that. That is one of the reasons I have been hesitant to \nsupport CAFE standards.\n  Here is a solution that will create incentives for people to buy \nlower emission automobiles, or more efficient automobiles, without \ndictating what those automobiles will be and without dictating a \nFederal target. It simply says: If you buy a car that gets higher \nmileage than the CAFE standard average, to a certain extent, as the \nSenator from Oregon has explained, the Federal Government will give you \na rebate. Now, it is a tax rebate. It is a tax credit. So that is cash \nin your pocket if you pay income taxes, and 50 percent of American wage \nearners do not pay income taxes. This is one of the things we have to \nunderstand. The income tax is so constructed that it applies only to \nthe top 50 percent of Americans, and the majority is paid by the top 5 \npercent of Americans.\n  So you can say: Well, the tax credit isn't really fair because only \nthe people at the top get to take advantage of it. So in the bill that \nthe Senator from Oregon has crafted and what I am cosponsoring, a car \nbuyer can say: Instead of the tax credit, once the whole deal has been \nmade, the price negotiated, I want my $630 or my $1,000 or my $1,800 or \nwhatever it might be on the deal to go against my responsibility for a \ndownpayment.\n  Now, we very carefully have not put it in a situation where it can be \npart of a deal because we think the car dealer will say: Ok. I will \nsimply raise the price by the amount of the rebate and do a little bait \nand switch and not give strong economic incentives for somebody who \nreally understands what is going on to buy this particular car. The \ndealer doesn't know when the buyer comes in whether the buyer is going \nto take the amount as a tax rebate directly to the buyer or whether he \nis going to apply it to the downpayment. So the dealer cannot do any \nbait and switch or smoke and mirrors to try to take advantage of that. \nThat is one of the talking points in favor of this particular approach.\n  But it means, as the Senator from Oregon has said, that the \ngovernment now becomes technology neutral. The government says: We \ndon't really care whether the increased mileage comes as a result of a \nhybrid or, as one auto manufacturer said, improved diesel, or some \nother technology that no one has thought of. This means that someone \nwho is working on additional technology that needs a little bit of a \nnudge to have people buy it doesn't have to put that aside and say: \nWell, I can't compete with the subsidy that is created for hybrid. I \nhave something that will get just as good mileage as a hybrid, but I \ncan't put it on the marketplace because the present law says you get so \nmuch of an advantage for hybrid but not for this new one that I have \ncome up with. So the government stays technology neutral and tax \nneutral in terms of the impact on the people who get the advantage of \nit, and the manufacturer deals directly with the customer in producing \nthe kinds of automobiles people want to buy. And if people say: I \nreally don't want to buy that automobile, if CAFE standards disappear, \nthe manufacturer can say: OK, if you don't want to buy it, we won't \nproduce it. Whereas, now there is pressure; we have to produce it in \norder to meet the CAFE average, whether people want to buy it or not.\n  Economics is all about incentives. This is the right kind of \ngovernment intervention to create incentives that I think ultimately \nwill correct some of the wrong kinds of government intervention, \nhowever well intentioned, that we have seen.\n  So I am delighted with the leadership shown by my friend from Oregon. \nI am happy to work with him on this issue, as I am working with him on \nother issues. I think it is an example of the kind of bipartisan \napproach to solve the Nation's problems that we all need to follow. I \ncongratulate him, salute him for his leadership, and I am happy to be \npart of the team.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 3909. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide assistance for developing countries to promote quality basic \neducation and to establish the achievement of universal basic education \nin all developing countries as an objective of United States foreign \nassistance policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, for several years now, I have been \nworking to raise the profile of the issue of the more than 100 million \nchildren around the world who are out of school.\n  An April 2004 report authored by Barbara Herz and Gene Sperling, in \nconjunction with the Center on Universal Education at the Council on \nForeign Relations, clearly demonstrated in striking fashion the \noverwhelming and incontrovertible evidence on the need to invest in \ngirls' education. It catalogs literally hundreds of rigorous studies on \nthe tangible economic, social, and political gains that come from \ngiving a girl the opportunity to learn. Let me highlight a few of the \nreport's findings: A single year of primary education correlates with a \n10-20\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\npercent increase in women's wages later in life. Academic studies find \nthe return to a year of secondary education is even higher--in the 15 \nto 25 percent range.\n  An extra year of a woman's education has been shown to reduce the \nrisk that her children will die in infancy by 5 to 10 percent.\n  Education offers what the World Bank has referred to as a window of \nhope in helping prevent the spread of AIDS among today's children. A \nrecent study of a school-based AIDS education program in Uganda found a \n75 percent reduction in the likelihood that children would be sexually \nactive in their last year of primary school.\n  Girls' education is the best single policy for reducing fertility and \ntherefore achieving sustainable families, according to a recent survey \nof the academic literature. In Brazil, for example, illiterate mothers \nhave an average of 6 children while literate mothers choose to have \nless than 3 children, and are better able to care for an invest in \ntheir children's well-being.\n  A study of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa found that from 1960 to \n1992, more equal education between men and women could have led to \nnearly 1 percent higher annual per capita GDP growth.\n  The report also documents in extensive detail what I have seen in \nmany countries--that the most effective way to reach the goal of \ngetting all girls in school is by encouraging countries to make a firm \ncommitment to universal basic education for all children. When \ncountries devise and adopt specific targeted strategies to address the \nunique obstacles girls face, they improve the reach and quality of \neducation for all children, both girls and boys.\n  Two years ago, Representative Nita Lowey and I introduced the \nEducation for All Act, legislation that I am proud to reintroduce \ntoday. This bill would enable us to increase our spending on global \neducation initiatives in order to help millions of children around the \nworld have the opportunity to receive an education.\n  At the time we originally introduced this bill, we may have seemed \nlike we were dreamers to expect a G8 nation like ours to take such a \nbold step on education in Africa and the rest of the developing world.\n  Yet earlier this year we saw the UK put forward $15 billion over the \nnext 10 years. This means that the UK, a nation with an economy about \none-sixth our size, will be spending three times more than the U.S. to \nensure that every boy--and particularly every girl--has a chance for a \nfree education.\n  I know that our current commitment does not represent the generous \nheart or the wise minds of the American people. And they know that \neducation--particularly the education of girls--is the best investment \nwe can make to reducing global poverty; they know that education is our \nbest social vaccine against the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  There is no greater proof of such big hearts and wise minds as the \nyoung people from all over the United States, as well as around the \nworld whom I have met, and who have shared with me their commitment to \nadvocate for children thousands of miles away who they still consider \nto be their friends--their brothers and sisters who deserve the \nopportunity to learn.\n  I am proud to stand with these children in support of their friends \naround the world. They understand that in order to make our world more \npeaceful and secure in the long term, girls and boys must be given the \nchance to read, to write, and to get a basic education.\n  Education has to be the foundation of any strategy to secure peace \nand prosperity around the world, because when children can reach their \npotential, we are all better for it, and this bill will help provide a \nstrong foundation for our efforts to help children around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9685-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask that the mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last week we passed the Port Security \nImprovement Act. Indeed, that means we are one step closer to plugging \nthe hole in our port security. We are one step closer to securing \nAmerica's more than 300 maritime ports of entry. That is progress.\n  This port security bill that we passed was about vigilance. We are in \nthe midst of a war with radical ideologues, militant extremists who \nwill stop at nothing to destroy our Nation. They search for our weak \nspots and they seek ways to exploit them. On 9/11 we learned just how \ncreative our enemy can be. Just last month we saw it again with the \nplot in Great Britain among terrorists to carry out what has become \nknown as Gatorade bombing; that is, the destruction of aircraft and \nhuman life by using liquids.\n  We share a 1,951-mile border with Mexico. It doesn't take much \ncreativity to imagine how terrorists might seek to exploit that border. \nIt is time to secure that border with Mexico. That is why just a few \nmoments ago I filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the Secure \nFence Act of 2006.\n  The overwhelming majority of people who violate our borders do so in \nsearch of jobs--but not all of them. Some cross to deal drugs and \ncommit crimes. Intelligence reports show that even al-Qaida considers \nour borders a key vulnerability. Without effective border control, we \ncan't tell those looking for honest work from those bent on mayhem. \nUnder the Secure Fence Act, Customs and Border Protection will take \nresponsibility for securing every inch of our border with Mexico. \nEngineers and construction workers will erect two-layer reinforced \nfencing along the entire border. Hundreds of new cameras and sensors \nwill be installed. Unmanned aircraft will supplement existing air and \nground patrols.\n  The resulting finished network will give us complete operational \ncontrol over our entire border, and it will go a\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\nlong way toward stopping illegal immigration altogether.\n  But border barriers alone won't solve our problems. Congress still \nneeds to address the illegal immigrants already in the country and \nprovide a viable means to meet our Nation's labor needs. While I would \nhave preferred coming to an agreement on a comprehensive solution this \nyear, I have always said we need an enforcement-first approach to \nimmigration reform--not enforcement only but enforcement first. This \nbill is that next step in strengthening our national security and the \nnext step in making America safer and more secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/18/senate-section/article/S9686-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VITIATION OF ACTION--H.R. 503\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
