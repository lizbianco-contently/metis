On Tuesday, the \nJudiciary Committee should report the nomination of Samuel Alito to be \nan Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The \nleader has announced we will proceed to consider the nomination when it \nis available for floor debate and that will be on Wednesday. We will \nremain on the Alito nomination until we are able to vote on the \nconfirmation. We hope to have an organized debate to allow all Members \nto speak. We will try to line up an order next week when we begin.

Senator Frist is right, we will have a dignified \ndebate. It will be organized. We will do whatever is appropriate \naccording to who wants to speak. Most all Democratic Senators will want \nan opportunity to speak in regard to the nomination of Samuel Alito. We \nlook forward to that sometime next week.\n  I also ask that following the swearing in of Congressman Menendez, \nthe only two speakers allowed in the Senate on this day are Senator \nMenendez and Senator Lautenberg, the two Senators from New Jersey.

Mr. President, I thank the leadership for according \nme an opportunity to present my new colleague. All of us are going to \nbe missing Jon Corzine, a dear friend and former colleague who served \nthis body very well but responded to the call of duty when things in \nNew Jersey needed a leading hand. Jon Corzine responded and took up the \nassignment.\n  In Senator Corzine's place, we are fortunate to be able to have a \ncandidate of the skill and knowledge that Senator Robert Menendez has.\n  Bob Menendez is a typical American story. He was born in America of \nparents who had immigrated from Cuba. He has worked his way through the \nsystem very well. As a very young man--high school age--he challenged \nthe mayor and the leadership of the community in which he lived in New \nJersey and fought his way to making certain they were going to be \ncleaning up some of their bad habits in Union City, such that he had to \nat times wear a bulletproof vest when he was 17 years old. He, thusly, \nhad a place in the political mainstream as a very young man.\n  He became mayor of Union City, NJ, and then served in our general \nassembly from 1987 until 1991 and in the New Jersey Senate--he has been \nthrough all of the steps to leadership--from 1991 to 1993. He then came \nto the U.S. Congress\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\nand was soon appointed--he worked hard to get it. I should strike the \nword ``appointed'' and say he worked his way so that he became the \nthird most powerful member on the Democratic side in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I look forward to working with Bob. Bob comes from Hudson County, one \nof our most populated counties in the most densely populated State in \nthe country. He worked on the issues of transportation, and education \nis a particular interest of his. It can be reflected in the fact that \nhis daughter, Alicia Menendez, was the commencement speaker at her \ngraduation from Harvard.\n  I was very impressed at the leadership provided by her family, by her \nfather's interest in public speaking, and in Government. She had to \nprepare her address in a competition to see who would be the student \ncommencement speaker. Alicia won that competition with a very lengthy \nspeech. She then, contrary to our habits here, was told to put aside \nher notes, take a microphone, and make the speech verbally to the \ngraduating class of Harvard, I think it was 2 years ago. And she did it \nwonderfully--again, a reflection of the leadership that Bob Menendez \nprovided to the family.\n  His son Robert is at a university in North Carolina and is also a \nvery accomplished young man.\n  Mr. Menendez and I will be working together on lots of issues that we \nworked on in the past, I as a Senator and he as a Congressman, \nparticularly, again, focused on transportation, environment, and \nsecurity.\n  Bob Menendez's county had the biggest loss of those who perished on \n9/11--over 700 people from New Jersey. Bob Menendez was there to help \nprovide some warmth, friendship, and leadership to the problems that \nfollowed the loss of those loved ones and the impairment that it \nbrought to those families.\n  I am so pleased to have someone who understands New Jersey fully, who \nhas lived the traditional dream from very modest working class parents \nwho escaped Cuba in those very dark days and lifted himself up by his \nbootstraps. We are going to be working together on issues such as \ntransportation, education, security, and some of the problems we now \nsee with Medicare.\n  My State of New Jersey now has spent $15 million in the last couple \nof weeks trying to help people get their prescription drugs as a result \nof the enormous change that took place starting in 2006. They could not \nget the product, and the State of New Jersey jumped in, as I would \ngather almost every State in this country has done, and that is to fill \nin where Medicare dropped off.\n  I look forward to working with Bob Menendez on that issue, and I hope \nit will be high on the list--on an urgent list--of matters to which we \nhave to attend.\n\n  Meanwhile, I once again say that Bob Menendez represents not only New \nJersey, but he represents the contribution that Latino Americans make \nto this country. Bob Menendez will be the third person to join this \nSenate with a Hispanic background--Senator Martinez, Senator Salazar, \nand now Senator Menendez. It is so appropriate when such a large \nportion of our population has that cultural background. They are \nwonderful contributing citizens in our State. We have a very large \nLatino population, and they are all very proud of Senator Menendez.\n  It is a historic day for the State of New Jersey and for the country \nthat one of our terrific colleagues is now the Governor of the State of \nNew Jersey. I predict he will be looking in the mirror one of these \ndays and questioning the change he decided to make. He has a tough job. \nThere is a lot of debt. We had some unfortunate mistakes in governance \nover the past few years. We are desperately in need of support for \ntransportation and other programs. I think Jon Corzine, with his \nleadership training, having been the chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, \nwill make a difference. He left here to take on what he considered a \nmore important, immediate test. We are so pleased that he is replaced \nby someone such as Robert Menendez, Senator Menendez, who just walked \nin.\n  I remember the days--my colleague from Virginia is on the floor. We \nhave been around here a long time. So very often the issues of \nwonderment disappear. We are into the nitty-gritty of issues and we \nforget sometimes about the excitement of being able to serve in this \nbody. The Presiding Officer knows exactly what I am talking about, \nhaving been here only a short time, but also having come from the House \nof Representatives, and note that change.\n  When I spoke to Bob Menendez and described to him the seat that he \nwould have, which is the furthest away that one can get, he said to me \nthat he is happy to have a seat anywhere in this Chamber. Sometimes we \nforget that in our daily toil.\n  I wound up sitting right near where the Senator from Virginia is, and \nI was talking to Scoop Jackson. I said: Nice seat. He said: Don't get \nused to it, you're not going to keep it. In the next couple of days, I \nwound up over in the freshman seats.\n  Bob Menendez is a freshman, skilled, able, knowledgeable. We are very \nexcited about him being here. He is going to be a wonderful Member of \nthe Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the leadership for granting me the \nopportunity to speak today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I commend my good friend, the good \nSenator from the State of New Jersey, for his remarks this morning on \nbehalf of his colleague. I was privileged to attend what is known here \nas a reenactment in the Old Chamber just now and had the chance to wish \nhim well.

Mr. President, today, I would like to address a troubling \nseries of events that has recently transpired in Cambodia. In the past \nyear, the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has engaged in a \nwidespread campaign to silence his critics, stifle dissent, and \nenfeeble his political opposition.\n  The result of these actions has been a very disturbing erosion of \nCambodia's commitment to democratic principles, the rule of law, and \nthe protection of human rights.\n  Nearly a year ago, in February 2005, Cambodia's National Assembly \nvoted to revoke the parliamentary immunity from prosecution of \nopposition leader Mr. Sam Rainsy and two of his colleagues. The alleged \noffense was defaming the Prime Minister.\n  Just after this vote, Mr. Rainsy and one of his colleagues, Chea \nPoch, managed to escape Cambodia to avoid arrest. However, the other \nopposition parliamentarian and an ally of Mr. Rainsy, Cheam Channy, was \narrested.\n  Several months later, in August 2005, Cheam Channy was sentenced to 7 \nyears in prison for allegedly forming ``a secret army to overthrow the \ngovernment.'' And, in December 2005, Sam Rainsy was sentenced in \nabsentia to 18 months in prison for defaming the Prime Minister and the \nPresident of the National Assembly.\n  The Cambodian Government's assault on its political opposition is \nonly the tip of the iceberg. The Prime Minister has also carried out a \ncampaign against human rights activists in Cambodia.\n  In a period of 5 days, just before and after the new year, three of \nCambodia's top human rights activists were arrested. These included Mr. \nKern Sokha, president of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights; Mr. \nYeng Virak, director of the Community Legal Education Center; and Pa \nNguon Teang, a journalist and the acting leader of Mr. Kern Sokha's \nhuman rights organization.\n  Again, these activists and critics of the Government were detained on \ntrumped-up defamation charges.\n  These arrests and detentions are just the latest in a series of \nactions aimed at silencing the critics of the Cambodian Government. In \naddition to members of the political opposition, Cambodia's Government \nhas also targeted prominent individuals in the media, trade unions, and \ncivil society.\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\n  The United States has rightly condemned these actions, and I applaud \nAmbassador Mussomeli and his staff at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh \nfor raising this troubling issue with senior officials in the Cambodian \nGovernment.\n  I am also encouraged that the international community is responding \nto Cambodia's recent transgressions. In particular, the World Bank has \nissued a stark warning that Cambodia's actions are jeopardizing the \nmillions of dollars in international financial assistance that it \nreceives each year.\n  I call upon Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government to \nend this troubling series of events. Although the Cambodian Government \nhas released Mr. Kern Sokha, Mr. Yeng Virak, Pa Nguon Teang, and other \nhigh-profile political prisoners on bail, the charges have not been \ndropped and other dissidents remain in custody. The Cambodian \nGovernment needs to release all political prisoners and drop the \nspurious charges being levied against them. These actions point to the \nobvious conclusion that democracy, the rule of law, and the protection \nof human rights are no longer priorities or principles of the Cambodian \nGovernment.\n  I also urge the international community to increase pressure on \nCambodia to reverse its recent actions and to demonstrate to the world \nits commitment to freedom and to allowing its citizens to express their \npolitical opinions without fear and intimidation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S6-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                WELCOMING ROBERT MENENDEZ TO THE SENATE\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in welcoming \nour newest colleague, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.\n  I also want to welcome Senator Menendez's family, who I know are \njustifiably proud of his great achievements.\n  And I want to thank our former colleague, New Jersey Governor Jon \nCorzine, for appointing an outstanding successor to finish his term. \nThe people of New Jersey elected a top-notch Governor in Jon Corzine, \nand they will have another top-notch Senator in the bargain.\n  With Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez in the Senate, the people of \nNew Jersey can be assured that they have two outstanding Senators in \ntheir corner, protecting their interests in Washington.\n  I have known Bob Menendez for more than a decade. We served together \nfor 4 years in the House of Representatives. It was during those years \nthat Congress passed the historic 1993 budget agreement. That \nagreement--which passed by the thinnest of margins, just one vote in \nboth the House and the Senate, without a single Republican vote--put \nthe Federal budget back on the course of fiscal responsibility after 12 \nstraight years of ever larger deficits. It also made smart, targeted \ninvestments in America's greatest resource: our people--to enable more \nAmericans to realize the American dream.\n  That dream is no slogan to Bob Menendez; it is the story of his life.\n  Like my mother, Senator Menendez's parents came to America from a \nnation that had lost its freedom. In my mother's case, it was \nLithuania. In his parents' case, the land was Cuba.\n  Like so many first-generation Americans throughout our history, \nSenator Menendez inherited from his parents a deep appreciation for \nAmerican freedom and opportunity, as well as a deep sense of personal \nresponsibility to help preserve and expand those blessings for all \nAmericans.\n  Senator Menendez entered public service at the age of 19, when he \nlaunched a successful petition drive to reform his local school board, \nand he has been fighting for education and opportunities for working \nfamilies ever since. He has been a mayor, State legislator, House \nMember, and now, U.S. Senator.\n  He has never backed away from a fight--even to the point of wearing a \nbullet-proof vest when he challenged the political establishment in his \nhometown of Union City and led a coalition of reformers in cleaning it \nup.\n  He is the highest ranking Hispanic in the history of the House, and a \nproven leader. And I am proud today to call him ``my fellow Senator.''\n  Welcome to the U.S. Senate, Senator Menendez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S6-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MASS EVACUATION EXERCISE ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have introduced the Mass \nEvacuation Exercise Assistance Act, S. 2043. As we witnessed in the \nwake of recent natural disasters, our cities face special challenges \nand vulnerabilities when disaster strikes.\n  Part of disaster preparation at any level of government includes \nhaving well prepared and practiced evacuation plans. Otherwise, \ncitizens can easily become trapped without food or water in a \ndevastated area or along an escape route. To help cities prepare for \nfuture emergencies and evacuations, this bill will authorize a new 5-\nyear grant program that will endow local governments with the funds to \ndevelop comprehensive evacuation plans, stage drills and exercises to \nperfect evacuation procedures, and stockpile materials to supply \nevacuation staging areas and evacuation routes. This legislation will \nserve to supplement existing grant programs rather than compete for \nalready scarce homeland security grant funding.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort that will \nsimply provide cities and States with the proper planning, preparation, \nand resources to ensure that their citizens will be evacuated quickly \nand safely should a natural disaster or terrorist attack occur. Our \ncitizens deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S6-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      CORPORAL BRETT LEE LUNDSTROM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Brett, who was also the proud son of a marine who served \nhis country for 20 years, chose to follow in his father Ed Lundstrom's \nfootsteps. By enlisting in the Marine Corps following the September \n11th terrorist attacks, Brett firmly believed he could make a \ndifference.\n  Doyla Lundstrom, Brett's mother, remembers her son as someone who \n``loved people, and people loved Brett.'' Brett's friendly personality \nwas infectious and ``he lit up a room when he walked in.'' A true \nsoldier, Ed recalled that Brett believed in his mission. Without \nquestion, he was an exemplary soldier and an example for all those with \nwhom he served.\n  Brett's goodwill and service touched the lives of many people. \nAlthough his life was cut short, he continues to inspire all those who \nknew him. Our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to \nhonor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country.\n  Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my \ndeepest sympathy to the family of CPL Brett Lundstrom.

PFENDER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and \ndeep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nEvansville. Jonathan Pfender, 22 years old, died on December 30 when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle during a patrol \nin Bayji, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Jonathan risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2001 graduate of North Posey High School, Jonathan decided to leave \nhis job at the Evansville Pizza Hut to pursue a career in the Army. \nAccording to his mother, Jonathan was not satisfied with the direction \nhis life was taking and decided to change course by joining the \nmilitary, an idea he had contemplated since junior high school. \nRemembered as a likeable, fun-loving and passionate young man who loved \nserving in the Army, Jonathan was the\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\npride of his family and headed to Iraq with their full support. His \nmother recounted to a local newspaper, ``[His co-workers] were crazy \nabout him. Everyone was, you couldn't not fall in love with him.''\n  Jonathan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, \n3rd Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, \nKY. This brave young soldier leaves behind his mother and stepfather, \nPeggy Jo and Jeff Hammond; his father and stepmother, Randy and Jackie \nPfender; a 26-year-old brother; a 1-year-old half brother; stepsiblings \nand other relatives.\n  Today, I join Jonathan's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jonathan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jonathan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jonathan will be remembered by family \nmembers, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we \nhonor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jonathan's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Jonathan's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jonathan Pfender in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Jonathan's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jonathan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE CONFIRMATION OF GREG VAN TATENHOVE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Although he is \nnot originally from Kentucky, he made a smart decision by making a \npermanent move to our Commonwealth. Greg also received a great \neducation from both Kentucky's Asbury College and the University of \nKentucky College of Law. I am proud to call Greg a fellow Kentuckian.\n  Greg has worked two stints for members of Kentucky's Federal \ncongressional delegation Senator McConnell and Representative Ron \nLewis. Greg also served as a judicial law clerk in U.S. District Court, \nand he served in the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Division as a \ntrial attorney. Over the last 4 years Greg has served admirably as a \nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky.\n  His time on Capitol Hill, in the Department of Justice, and within \nour judicial system has given Greg a wealth of knowledge and experience \nwhich can only make him a better judge. Clearly, Greg possesses the \nwisdom, temperament, and character to be a Federal judge. President \nGeorge W. Bush and the U.S. Senate have done well working together to \nensure Greg's nomination and confirmation for service as a Federal \njudge.\n  I am proud to support Greg's elevation for this Federal judgeship, \nand I am thankful to Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, too, \nfor their leadership on the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee to ensure \nthe swift approval of Greg's confirmation.

He and I have been \nfriends for decades.\n  I was pleased to see an article about Bill in the December 27, 2005, \nBurlington Free Press. I ask that a copy of the article be printed in \nthe Record. I know that once they read it, my colleagues will look \nforward to traveling through the Burlington airport as much as I do.\n  The article follows.\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 27, 2005]\n\nSecurity With a Smile, Airport Screener Bill O'Neill Helps Take Stress \n                             Out of Flying\n\n                           (By Emily Guziak)\n\n       South Burlington.--Bill O'Neill's job does not require that \n     he fawn over babies.\n       Nor does it require that he greet everyone he meets by name \n     with a heartfelt good morning, put their various airline \n     receipts in order, hold cups of coffee, or provide tips on \n     how to switch planes at the next destination.\n       O'Neill, a document checker for PrimeFlight Aviation \n     Services at Burlington International Airport, is simply \n     required to check departing passengers' identification, \n     boarding passes and number and size of carry-on items.\n       For frequent travelers, the document checker is often the \n     nameless, faceless, overly efficient person hurrying \n     passengers into inevitable security lines. For bleary-eyed, \n     often-harried early morning travelers in Burlington, \n     O'Neill's station at Gate One is an oasis in the rush of \n     processing passengers through ticket check-in and \n     Transportation Security Administration security clearance.\n       ``He's brilliant; he's great,'' said business traveler J.P. \n     Tardy, of Charlotte, N.C., queuing up in the security line \n     for United Airline's 7:48 a.m. flight to Chicago on a recent \n     weekday morning. ``He absolutely makes this airport.''\n       O'Neill, 72, is the document checker for United Airlines \n     and US Airways passengers, from 4:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. \n     Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. His upbeat, helpful manner \n     never wavers, those working around him say.\n       ``He's very people-oriented; people like him,'' said Mark \n     Salisbury, supervisor, transportation security officer, for \n     TSA at Burlington International Airport. Salisbury supervises \n     the security checkpoint near\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n     O'Neill's station. ``He's worked in the business for a long \n     time, so I'm sure he's seen it all. He's just a very nice \n     guy. And he's very helpful, especially for older folks.''\n       ``You feel like you're being greeted, rather than just \n     being moved into the line by a security person,'' said Deedee \n     O'Brien of Shelburne, en route to Los Angeles on the Chicago \n     flight. ``I think he was here when we traveled six months \n     ago. He's such a nice person.''\n       O'Neill's performance should be catching the attention of \n     all those marketing gurus out there trying to sell the \n     quintessential New England hometown atmosphere. At 6:30 a.m., \n     as passengers went through O'Neill's station, the mood of \n     some travelers changed from tense to relaxed.\n       ``He provides the best service I've ever had,'' said Dan \n     Grant, of Seattle, a weekly business traveler. ``If you fly a \n     lot and go through the larger airports, you can get kind of \n     beaten down. You're lucky if you can get a word out of people \n     in his job.''\n       He is in command at his post. ``You can put that ID away; \n     you won't need it anymore today and your boarding pass to \n     Philly is right here,'' O'Neill quietly and calmly told one \n     of the people in the steady stream of departing passengers. \n     ``I thank you, and you have a good day.''\n       ``He takes the hassle out of what travel has become,'' said \n     Andy Tomlinson of South Burlington, on her way ``to go home \n     and do the Santa thing'' with family in California. ``He's \n     great.''\n       A United Airlines employee for 32 years, O'Neill retired in \n     1998 and returned to work in March for extra income. He is \n     employed by PrimeFlight Aviation of Nashville, Tenn. The \n     company has 4,000 employees in 50 airports in the United \n     States providing a variety of services. In Burlington, United \n     Airlines and US Airways contract with PrimeFlight to provide \n     five document checkers.\n       O'Neill also has the task of informing passengers when they \n     have been randomly selected by the airlines for an additional \n     search, and must proceed to the line to their right, rather \n     than left. ``People can resent it, especially if they're in a \n     hurry,'' O'Neill said.\n       ``I tell them, I `fly free because I have a golden pass, \n     and every time I fly the computer randomly selects me because \n     it reads my ticket as cash, one-way and automatically makes \n     me a selectee. I tell them their special search is no \n     different than mine and it often makes them feel better.;''\n       ``He is just fantastic,'' said Thane Butt, of Shelburne, \n     flying to Chicago with her husband, Peter. Butt jokingly \n     asked the bushy-eyebrowed O'Neill if he was Andy Rooney.\n       ``I've been asked that a few times,'' said the unflappable \n     O'Neill.\n       ``He makes you feel like you're not just another person,'' \n     said Dr. Alan Segal of South Burlington. ``And he's got one \n     of those faces; he looks like everyone's \n     grandfather.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S8-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PILOT KNOB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, EAGAN, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Pilot Knob \nElementary School in Eagan, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Pilot Knob Elementary School, which serves a diverse population of \n375 children in kindergarten through grade four, is truly a model of \neducational success. The school boasts a 96 percent attendance rate; \ntest scores are well above average for most students; and many of the \nteachers are leaders in their fields. Pilot Knob Elementary has also \ndevised an innovative approach to address bullying in school. Through \nits ``Take Time To Be Kind'' program, nine fourth graders donate their \nrecess time to spread goodwill in the hallways, creating a safe and \nkind learning environment for all students.\n  In addition to its students, Pilot Knob Elementary is also committed \nto its community. Recently, students raised $1,700 for UNICEF, to help \nvictims of the tsunami in South Asia, and a similarly successful \nfundraising effort benefited a local shelter for homeless families. The \nschool regularly opens its doors to the citizens of Eagan, welcoming \nnot only staff and students but also parents, siblings, and neighbors \nto special school activities. Pilot Knob hosts a wide range of \ncommunity events: from musical concerts to art and book fairs, to \nscience experiment demonstrations, to ice cream socials.\n  Much of the credit for Pilot Knob's success belongs to its principal, \nByron Schwab, who was Minnesota's Principal of the Year in 2001. \nPrincipal Schwab and the dedicated faculty at Pilot Knob Elementary \nunderstand that, in order to be successful, a school must go beyond \nachieving academic success; it must also create a nurturing \nenvironment, where students learn the importance of respecting one \nanother and the value of their community. All of the faculty, staff, \nand students at Pilot Knob Elementary should be very proud of their \naccomplishments.\n  I congratulate Pilot Knob Elementary School in Eagan for winning the \nAward for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional contributions \nto education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S8-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION PRESENTED TO EDINA PUBLIC SCHOOLS, \n                            EDINA, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

To achieve these goals, Edina \nPublic Schools offer a wide array of educational opportunities tailored \nto the diverse needs of its students. Students with limited English \nproficiency benefit from an exceptionally fine English as a Second \nLanguage program; more advanced learners are given new challenges \nthrough the district's Gifted Education Program; and students with \nspecial needs receive additional help through an outstanding Special \nEducation program.\n  Edina Public Schools also challenge students outside of the \nclassroom. The district's top-notch athletic programs and team sports \nhelp students learn the value of both cooperation and competition. \nStudent musicians, actors, and artists benefit from highly acclaimed \nmusical, theatrical, and artistic cocurricular programs. Over 90 \npercent of Edina Public Schools' student body participate in \ncocurricular activities.\n  The Edina Public School District recognizes that it must constantly \nadapt and improve its curricula to meet the ever-changing needs of its \nstudents. The district's superintendent, Dr. Kenneth Dragseth, and the \ndedicated faculty are always willing to incorporate new techniques and \napproaches to teaching. As a result, 95 percent of Edina High School's \ngraduates who attend college report being well prepared for their \ncollege experience.\n  All of the faculty, staff, and students at Edina Public Schools \nshould be very proud of their accomplishments.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nLinton Police Department and their Chief of Police, Keith McDonald. I \nalso want to take a moment to recognize Linton's Drug Task Force \nOfficer Joshua Goodman.\n  Under the leadership of Chief McDonald, the Linton Police Department \nhas increased its drug arrests by nearly 500 percent over the past 5 \nyears. Most recently, the department executed a drug bust that resulted \nin the seizure of approximately $250,000 worth of methamphetamine--one \nof the largest drug busts in the western part of the State.\n  Methamphetamine is currently one of the fastest-growing drug threats \nin the Nation, and the problem is particularly acute in the Midwest and \nIndiana. In Indiana, the number of meth labs has increased 750 percent \nover the last 5 years and the meth industry costs the State at least \n$100 million a year.\n  Indiana's epidemic of meth use destroys families, places undue \nburdens on taxpayers, and exhausts child service resources. Hoosier \nfamilies depend on local law enforcement officers to protect their \nchildren and keep their communities strong. In the face of the growing \nmeth epidemic and despite an increasing number of homeland security \nresponsibilities, the Linton Police Department and other police \ndepartments across the State have risen to the challenge. With the help \nof tougher State meth laws, these local police forces have succeeded in \nreducing the number of meth labs across Indiana.\n  But they need more support from the Federal Government. Local police \nforces, like Linton's, are already stretched thin as they respond to a \ngrowing number of homeland security challenges. Nothing short of a \nnational commitment with tough, innovative laws will stop the spread of \nthis terrible drug that is threatening our communities. For this \nreason, I coponsored the Combat Meth Act in 2004 to provide a \nnationwide approach that gives police officers the tools they need to \nfend off the creation of new meth labs and helps families rebuild their \nlives. I am hopeful that this legislation will help Linton and other \ntowns continue to succeed in their fight against the meth scourge.\n  I wanted to take the time to recognize the Linton Police Department \ntoday, because as our Nation faces increasingly uncertain times, \nincluding the escalation of the meth epidemic, it is our first \nresponders who are our primary line of defense. In all areas, but \nespecially the fight against meth, Linton's Police Department has gone \nwell beyond the call of duty.\n  On behalf of the State of Indiana, I thank the Linton Police \nDepartment for helping keep Greene County's streets safe and its \ncommunity strong and meth-free. It is my honor to enter this tribute in \nthe official record of the United States Senate in recognition of the \nLinton Police Department's extraordinary commitment to the citizens of \nGreene County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S9-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TOURETTE SYNDROME OUTREACH AND RESEARCH\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I applaud Congress for including \n$1.8 million for Tourette Syndrome research in H.R. 3010, the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006.\n  Tourette Syndrome is an inherited neurobiological disorder that \nmanifests itself in rapid, repeated, and involuntary movements and \nsounds. The disorder affects approximately 200,000 adults and children \nacross America. While there is no cure for Tourette Syndrome, some \nindividuals benefit from education and other clinical treatment.\n  To further develop educational outreach and research programs, \nCongress established the Tourette Syndrome Education and Research \nProgram within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2000. \nToday, this program provides education about Tourette Syndrome for the \npublic, physicians, allied healthcare workers and teachers. \nAdditionally, the program's intensive training initiatives aim to \nincrease recognition and diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome and to decrease \nthe associated stigma.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Tourette Syndrome Association, the only \nnational nonprofit membership organization dedicated to finding the \ncause, finding a cure, and controlling the effects of Tourette \nSyndrome, has acted in partnership with the CDC to expand educational \noutreach. In its first year working with the CDC, the Tourette Syndrome \nAssociation offered 25 expert medical education programs, as well as \nfive major education allied professional programs. In 2006, the \nassociation plans to expand upon these efforts and to offer training \nfor neurologists in both English and Spanish.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the CDC to continue its partnership with \nthe Tourette Syndrome Association as the agency plans its research and \neducation strategy for fiscal year 2006. By building and expanding on \npast collaborative efforts, the CDC and the Tourette Syndrome \nAssociation can bring hope to families affected by the \ndisorder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S9-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DAY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Dr. King was a light for America. At \ntimes, he was a searching, probing light in the dark, seeking to find \nthe truth and expose it to all humanity. He spoke plainly and \neloquently of the great injustices that were occurring during his time. \nHe focused his spotlight on places like Selma, Atlanta, Birmingham, and \nLittle Rock, places that were in such need of healing at that time. And \nhe was often a stark, blinding light for many in this country who were \nunwilling to come to terms with the great evil represented in \nsegregation, discrimination, and humiliation, all of which were fueled \nby hatred and ignorance.\n  For so many people of his generation, Dr. King was the first light of \nthe morning, awakening them from their naive slumber to confront great \nmoral questions. He and all the champions of the civil rights movement \nare responsible for forcing America to look inward and recognize the \nsickness that plagued our Nation's soul. Supreme Court Justice Louis \nBrandeis once said that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' Dr. King \nfully recognized the meaning of these words as he exposed our culture's \nillness to the light of day, eventually helping America begin to heal.\n  He was also a guiding light, navigating the civil rights movement \nthrough largely uncharted waters, and helping a great many minority \nAmericans come to the realization that they were all in the same boat. \nThey were no longer alone in their struggle against oppression. Indeed, \nthere were many at the time who cautioned against ``rocking the boat'' \ntoo much. But King's leadership proved to a weary and discouraged \npeople that there was a great Promised Land at the end of their \njourney. The path he illuminated required the strongest of wills, and \nfor that guiding light, we are all thankful.\n  Since Dr. King's time, the American people have made great strides \ntoward racial equality and the elimination of poverty, yet there still \nremains much to be accomplished. And in the spirit of Dr. King's life, \nour Nation must continue to turn the light inward and expose injustice. \nDr. King's purpose in life did not end in his death, nor did it end in \nthe court cases and legislation that have further expanded freedom and \nopportunity in America since that time. Dr. Martin Luther King's legacy \nis an undying light that serves as a constant reminder of the noblest \ncause to protect and promote liberty that our Nation began with its \nfounding. His undying light also calls on us never to forget our \nhumanity. Even a country founded on the highest moral principles can \nretreat into oppression and injustice in periods of darkness. For \nhelping lead us out of the darkness, we honor Dr. King on this day, and \nwe pledge to always remember the struggle that marches on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S9-4", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9-S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REFOCUSING ON GUN SAFETY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, nearly 100,000 children and \nteenagers have been killed by firearms since 1979. This figure \nunderscores the inadequacy of Congress' efforts to address the issue of \ngun violence over this period and the continuing need for common sense \ngun safety legislation.\n  An analysis of firearm violence data by the Children's Defense Fund \nfound\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nthat guns kill more children between the ages of 10 and 19 than any \nother cause except car accidents. In 2002, the most recent data \navailable, guns killed 2,867 children under 19 years old. Tragically, \nthat means an average of nearly 8 children are killed by guns each day. \nAdditionally, the CDF estimates that at least four times as many \nchildren are injured in non-fatal shootings.\n  The number of firearms deaths among American children is greater than \nany other nation in the world. In fact, the Children's Defense Fund \nstates in its 2005 annual report that the rate of deaths among children \nunder 15 years old is higher in the United States than in 25 other \nindustrialized nations combined. While the gun violence epidemic in \nthis country cannot simply be legislated away, Congress must do more to \naddress the problem.\n  The Children's Defense Fund makes a number of recommendations to \nprotect children from gun violence. Among other things, the CDF \nsuggests removing guns from homes, providing nonviolent conflict \nresolution courses for all students, and creating positive community \nactivities for children to reduce the influence of gangs and drugs on \nchildren and teenagers. Congress can take an active role in these \nefforts by taking up and passing common sense gun safety legislation, \nsupporting federal funding for law enforcement and community programs, \nand focusing the media and public attention on the causes and \nconsequences of gun violence.\n  During recent sessions of Congress, very little has been done to \nreduce the prevalence of gun violence. In 2004, inaction by President \nBush and the Republican leadership in Congress led to the expiration of \nthe 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. In 2005, Congress passed, and the \nPresident signed, National Rifle Association-sponsored legislation that \nprovided blanket immunity from liability to reckless and negligent gun \ndealers and manufacturers. While doing so, Congress repeatedly cut \nFederal funding for proven local law enforcement programs and failed to \nclose the gun show loophole.\n  As we begin the second session of the 109th Congress, I am hopeful \ngreater attention will be paid to finding solutions to the gun violence \nproblems that plague our communities. We owe it to the thousands of \nfamilies who have already been impacted by firearms tragedies to help \nprevent such things from happening to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S10-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S10-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on December 28, 2005, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Davis, of Virginia) has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2167.

A bill to make the sale or fraudulent transfer of telephone \nrecords a criminal offense; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing The Phone Records \nProtection Act of 2006. This important legislation would prohibit the \nsale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone records and provide \ntough criminal penalties for violating phone users' privacy.\n  The Chicago Sun Times and other news sources have recently reported \nthat online brokers are illegally obtaining cell phone records and \nselling them without customers' knowledge. Telephone companies receive \nmany legitimate requests from consumers and law enforcement officials \nfor access to personal records and the requests are handled \nexpeditiously. However, online brokers have taken advantage of the \nsystem and begun selling cell phone records to anyone who requests \nthem.\n  Although current law addresses fraud and identity theft using the \nInternet, the law does not specifically prohibit the sale of personal \ninformation obtained illegally or without the consent of cell phone \ncustomers. Consumer and privacy groups have expressed concerns about \nthe access and availability of personal information. Regardless of how \na bad actor obtains the telephone records of innocent and unsuspecting \ncustomers, the sale of such information should be prohibited.\n  The Phone Records Protection Act of 2006 would deter online brokers \nby prohibiting the sale or fraudulent transfer or use of telephone \nrecords. The sale of this information is a violation of individual \nprivacy and also creates the possibility of identity theft. Moreover, \nthe sale of telephone records of law enforcement personnel and public \nofficials could endanger public safety, as criminals and terrorists \nwould be eager to have such information.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislative \neffort and cosponsor this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Phone Records Protection Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, we had a historic moment in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia this past weekend. I was privileged, along \nwith Senator Allen, to attend the inauguration of our new Governor. We \nhave an unusual situation in the Commonwealth of Virginia where our \nGovernors are elected in what we call the off year for elections in \nAmerica, but it was a very significant occasion for the people of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  An interesting footnote in history: our capitol building in Richmond \nis under renovation at this time. Consequently, very wisely, Governor \nKaine selected Williamsburg, VA, for the purposes of his inauguration. \nAs I said, it was a rainy day, but we all enjoyed it.\n  On behalf of the Congressional delegation and the people of Virginia, \nI am privileged to place into the Congressional Record the inaugural \naddress given by Governor Timothy Kaine, Virginia's 70th Governor on \nJanuary 14, 2006. Due to the extensive renovation of Virginia's Capitol \nin Richmond, Saturday's inauguration was held at the Colonial Capital \nof Williamsburg for only the third time in the Commonwealth's history \nand the first since that of Thomas Jefferson in 1779.\n  Williamsburg, Virginia was home to the first Capitol building in \nAmerica and served as the home of the House of Burgesses. It is fitting \nthat this inauguration took place in Williamsburg as Virginia and \nNation prepares to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of \nthe Jamestown settlement in 2007.\n  We in Virginia are proud of our longstanding spirit of cooperation \nand bipartisanship among the various branches of government in the \nCommonwealth and with the members of our congressional delegation \nserving in Washington. I look forward to working with Governor Kaine as \nhe is the eighth Governor to serve Virginia during my service in the \nUnited States Senate. It is in this spirit of bipartisanship that I ask \nunanimous consent that Governor Kaine's inaugural address to the \nCommonwealth of Virginia be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From Colonial Capitol, Williamsburg, Virginia, Jan. 14, 2006]\n\n Inaugural Address of Tim Kaine--70th Governor of the Commonwealth of \n                                Virginia\n\n       Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. President Pro Tem, Members \n     of the General Assembly, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the \n     Supreme Court, Mr. Attorney General, ladies and gentlemen:\n       I am humbled by the trust you have placed in me. With the \n     support of God and my family, I pledge my energy and \n     enthusiasm to the mission of serving this Commonwealth.\n       I salute with great respect our dear friend Governor Mark \n     Warner, and I ask that all Virginians join me in showing \n     their public appreciation for his outstanding leadership.\n       I congratulate Lieutenant Governor Bolling, Attorney \n     General McDonnell and all the members of the General Assembly \n     who have stepped forward to offer their talents to advance \n     our common good.\n       This is a glorious day--the weather is to remind us not to \n     take ourselves too seriously. And how far Virginia has come \n     since we last gathered for an inauguration in Williamsburg!\n       Patrick Henry was sworn in here as the newly-formed \n     Commonwealth's first Governor in 1776 and, three years later, \n     Thomas Jefferson followed in his footsteps. Henry and \n     Jefferson stood here in the midst of a war raging on our \n     country's soil, a war that threatened the very existence of \n     Virginia and our young nation.\n       They stood here at a time, just as today, when Virginians \n     serving freedom's cause sacrificed their lives so that \n     democracy could prevail over tyranny. They stood here \n     proclaiming the Promise of Virginia, when the world around \n     them doubted that the land of their vision would survive.\n       Could Henry or Jefferson have imagined the powerful success \n     of their democratic experiment, their beloved Virginia, as it \n     appears today? As a people, we have come through storm after \n     storm, working out the meaning of our own destiny and coming \n     closer and closer to the Virginia ideal of equality that \n     Jefferson articulated in America's Declaration of \n     Independence.\n       As we stand here now, our hearts should be filled with the \n     magnitude of the debt we owe to the generations of leaders--\n     the celebrated and the unknown--who fought and worked to \n     create our Commonwealth. The Promise of Virginia is bright \n     today because of their efforts, and it is up to us to carry \n     the work forward for future generations.\n       Today's ceremony honors and renews that experiment, and \n     continues the promise that Virginia--which has so often led \n     our nation through the past four centuries--will continue to \n     lead our nation in the 21st century. And we will lead, we \n     will keep the Promise of Virginia bright, if we stay true to \n     the best values that have guided our first 400 years.\n       First, we reaffirm the necessity of courage. This is the \n     defining trait of those who came to Virginia aboard the \n     Discovery, Godspeed and Susan Constant, landing just a few \n     miles from this place at Jamestown Island in 1607. They knew \n     that earlier efforts, by the Spanish and English, to \n     establish settlements in this region had ended in disaster. \n     But they crossed treacherous seas to arrive at a new world \n     because they understood the need to do and to dare. Their \n     survival and success depended upon bold leadership. We must \n     be equally bold to tackle the challenges of our day.\n       Second, we acknowledge that individual opportunity is the \n     most powerful engine of progress. The first English settlers \n     came as part of a commercial venture, the Virginia Company, \n     seeking economic riches in the New World. Others came seeking \n     the opportunity to worship as they pleased or to trade away \n     an aristocracy of birth for an aristocracy of merit. When \n     individuals have the opportunity to set their own purpose, \n     and determine the bar for their own achievements, they are \n     able to harness their God-given talents and ensure our \n     economic and social success.\n       And third, we recognize that our destiny is a shared \n     destiny and that our commitment to community is a condition \n     of our advancement. Our Virginia might not exist today were \n     it not for the generosity extended to those first settlers by \n     the native Virginia tribes living in this region. Without the \n     hospitality of Chief Powhatan or the compassion of \n     Pocahontas, those in Jamestown would have perished. \n     Throughout Virginia's history, we have succeeded only when we \n     have welcomed all to the table of Thanksgiving.\n       That same sense of community is required of us today. We \n     must include all Virginians in our efforts. We should \n     continue to welcome newcomers to this Commonwealth and \n     nation, just as Chief Powhatan did 400 years ago.\n       Hemos venido hoy dia, a este lugar para recordar la promesa \n     de nuestros antepasados. Como gobernador, sere justo e \n     incluyente de todas las comunidades, con la certeza que \n     juntos lograremos construir un mejor futuro para Virginia. \n     [We have come here today to remember the promise made by our \n     forefathers. As Governor, I will be fair and inclusive of all \n     communities with the certainty that together we can achieve a \n     better future in Virginia.]\n       And, we should use this historic time to help those who \n     first helped us by working with the federal government to see \n     that Virginia's native Indian tribes are finally recognized.\n       Our challenges today are different than those faced by the \n     Jamestown settlers, or the first Virginia governors. But they \n     require fidelity to the same values. We may not have new \n     geographic worlds to discover, but there are still worlds of \n     research and knowledge, of information and creativity, of \n     commerce and service, of reconciliation and brotherhood, that \n     await our exploration.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n       To keep the Promise of Virginia, to succeed, we will \n     embrace our best, historic values and we will work together. \n     Ours will be a non-partisan, Virginia agenda that includes \n     all. At the heart of what I pledge to you today is the desire \n     to keep Virginia moving forward.\n       To the people of Virginia: I pledge an administration that \n     will keep the Promise of Virginia strong. An administration \n     guided by the Virginia values of courage, opportunity and \n     community. We will lead boldly and manage wisely; we will \n     protect the liberties endowed by our Creator; we will affirm \n     that family and faith is our bedrock, hard work our way and \n     education our path to progress. When we are true to that \n     promise, we will succeed and truly honor the legacy we \n     inherit.\n       To the parents of Virginia: I pledge that our top priority \n     will be raising the focus of our public education system from \n     competence to excellence.\n       Thomas Jefferson wrote that progress depends on the \n     broadest possible diffusion of knowledge among the entire \n     population. More than ever, we are now in a position to \n     provide all children with the opportunity to learn and \n     fulfill their God-given potential. And we acknowledge that \n     lifelong learning--from the expansion of early childhood \n     education to world-class higher education, and beyond--is our \n     Commonwealth's top priority.\n       To the taxpayers of Virginia: I pledge that we will always \n     remember that what government spends is not its money. It's \n     your money. We will place a premium on accountability; \n     ensuring that your dollars are used responsibly in meeting \n     the priorities that we share.\n       To those who commute and travel in Virginia: I pledge that \n     my administration will begin immediately and work urgently to \n     address the transportation dilemma that complicates our lives \n     and threatens our prosperity. Together, let us find answers \n     through a dialogue that is shaped not simply in terms of \n     dollars and cents, but also by new solutions and common \n     sense. A lack of coordination and planning has us stuck where \n     we are today. Let it not be fear and politics that leaves us \n     stranded here.\n       To the working families of Virginia and those that employ \n     them: I pledge an administration focused on fostering \n     opportunity and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit; an \n     administration focused on ensuring that every hard-working \n     Virginian--no matter where they live--has access to a good \n     paying job to provide for their family.\n       We will also work with you to find solutions to the problem \n     of accessible, affordable health care; a burden that is \n     overwhelming working families, small businesses and \n     government budgets.\n       To those who protect us, our guardsmen, law enforcement \n     officers, firefighters and EMTs: I pledge an administration \n     that will work to ensure you have the resources and the \n     support you need to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. \n     The work you do is dangerous and essential. And we salute \n     your dedication.\n       To those who serve in local governments: I pledge an \n     administration that is a good partner with a focus on \n     cooperation and collaboration. The people we serve are the \n     same people you serve. When we work together, we serve them \n     better.\n       To those who love Virginia's natural beauty: I pledge an \n     administration that will be a good steward of Virginia's \n     blessings of natural beauty. Our natural resources are \n     essential to both our way of life and our ability to make a \n     living. The streams we fish, the trails we hike, the fields \n     that we harvest and the hills that we hunt with our children \n     today must be protected for them and their children tomorrow.\n       And to the children of Virginia: I pledge an administration \n     that will do its all to leave you with a Commonwealth greater \n     than the one we found; filled with opportunities, greater \n     than those of our dreams; a Commonwealth where the Promise of \n     Virginia rings true for every son and daughter.\n       I seek the help of all Virginians--regardless of party or \n     region, race or religion--in keeping the promise of Virginia.\n       Let us rise to the leadership example of Virginia's first \n     four hundred years. Let us affirm and carry forward our \n     values of courage, opportunity and community.\n       Let us remember that civility is not a sign of weakness--\n     that cooperation and compromise are necessary for progress \n     and for the sensible solutions we can all embrace to keep the \n     promise of Virginia strong. Under God's hand, we have \n     thrived. If we stay faithful to our history, we will succeed.\n       Let us work together.\n       Let us begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/18/senate-section/article/S17-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2006, AT 10 A.M.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
