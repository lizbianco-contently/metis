Members will be \nalerted when those votes are locked in with certainty, but that is the \ncurrent expectation.\n  Senator Frist has reminded everyone that this is the final week of \nlegislative work prior to the Easter recess. We expect busy days with \nlate sessions in order to complete the work on the pending legislation \nbefore the end of the week. Senator Frist has made the explicit comment \nthat Senators should plan for a full week of business with votes \nthroughout the week.\n  We have already had quite a number of amendments filed. We know that \nthe tempo of the Senate is to finish legislation, such as that which is \npending now, when it is backed up to a recess. I have been authorized \nto say that we will be holding the votes to 20 minutes--15 minutes as \nprescribed by the rules of the Senate and 5 minutes over. We all have \nseen the votes run very late and take up a great deal of floor time. We \nwill be voting with a 20-minute cutoff.\n  Senator Leahy has asked me to express his view as well as mine that \nall Senators come forward with amendments so that we can evaluate them, \nmake a determination as to which ones can be accepted and as to which \nones will have to be debated and voted upon. We will be looking for \ntime agreements. But we have a prodigious job ahead of us to finish the \nbill by the end of the week. We solicit the cooperation of all Members.\n  I will have more to say, but I yield at this point to the Democratic \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/03/senate-section/article/S2699-7", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am advised that consent has been worked \nout so that at 5:30 today, the Senate will proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Bingaman amendment No. 3210, to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Alexander amendment No. 3193; provided further that \nno second degrees be in order to either amendment prior to those votes; \nand further that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to \neach vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is that a unanimous consent request? That \nhas not been agreed to.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had yielded to the Democratic leader \nexpecting to have an opportunity to comment before the quorum call was \nput in order which I was unable to terminate. Now that I have the \nfloor, I would like to report to my colleagues that we had a very \nproductive hearing this morning on issues relating to immigration \njudicial review. The original draft of the chairman's mark had provided \nfor cases to be consolidated in the Federal circuit. Since there was \nconsiderable controversy about that, it was decided that we ought to \nhave a hearing.\n  We had five judges in today: the chief judge of the Federal circuit, \nthe chief judge of the Second Circuit, a judge from the Ninth Circuit, \na former chief judge of the Second Circuit, and a fifth judge from the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.\n  We heard a number of opinions on the desirability of having \nconsolidation but perhaps an alternative to being in the Federal \ncircuit. We are now considering those matters. We will be discussing \nthem with other members of the committee. It may be that we will choose \nto revise the chairman's mark to provide that the cases will be evened \nout among the various circuits.\n  With the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit now having a \ndisproportionate number, the suggestion was made by Judge Newman, \nformer chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that \nthere be a court created, perhaps to sit in Washington, although not \nindispensably so, where the judges would be selected from circuit \njudges and selected by the chief justice to maintain that judges review \nthese matters as generalists as opposed to specialists. We will \nconsider that.\n  We heard discussion about the chairman's mark on increasing the \nnumber of active judges on the Board of Immigration Appeal so that the \nfull 23 would sit and the provision that they sit in panels so that \nthey write opinions, not just a one-sentence decision, which is now the \ncase and which puts a considerable burden on the courts of appeal. We \nalso discussed the possibility of having greater independence of the \nimmigration judges and the members of the Board of Immigration Appeal. \nIn due course, we will be drafting a revised title and will be \nsubmitting that for consideration by the full body.\n  That is a very brief statement of the hearing that we held today. \nAgain, I urge our colleagues who have amendments--Senator Leahy joins \nme in that request--to come to the floor and debate them. We have a big \njob ahead of us to complete action on this bill before the end of the \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes from my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I--and I know \nthe time is being divided--be recognized as the next Democratic speaker \nfollowing Senator Kennedy's presentation, intermingled with Republican \nspeakers as well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator wishes to follow Senator \nKennedy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wish to follow the next Republican speaker.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, immigration is the story of American \nhistory. From the earliest days of our Nation, generation upon \ngeneration of immigrants have come to be part of a land that offers \nfreedom and opportunity to those willing to do their part. Immigrants \nbuilt our great cities. They cultivated our rich farmlands. They built \nthe railroads and highways that bind America from sea to shining sea. \nThey erected houses of worship to practice their faiths. They fought \nunder America's colors in our wars. In fact, 60,000 immigrants are \nfighting in the U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan today. \nImmigrants worked hard so that their children could embrace the ever-\nwidening possibilities in our land. And over the centuries, immigrants \ncame to America from every part of the globe and made the American \ndream. They created a Nation that is the envy of the world.\n  That is our history. But it is also our present and our future.\n  We heard the moving immigration story anew here in the Senate just \nlast week as Senator Domenici eloquently described his family's \nimmigrant roots. He told how his parents came from Italy with nothing. \nHis father earned his citizenship through his service in the U.S. Army \nin the First World War. His mother remained an undocumented immigrant \nuntil much later in life. In fact, she was arrested by the immigration \nauthorities many years after coming to America, but she was able to \ngain legal status, remain in the country and later become a citizen. \nThe Domenicis worked hard, learned English, built a successful grocery \nbusiness, and their children went on to have successful professional \ncareers. And, as we know, one became a distinguished and respected \nUnited States Senator.\n  Last week, we also heard from Senator Martinez of Florida of his \nfamily's flight from Cuba to begin new lives in America. Young Mel \nMartinez was 15 years old when his family escaped from Cuba to seek a \nnew life of freedom. Like millions before him, his family worked hard, \nlearned English, and earned their success in Florida. And today, Mel \nMartinez not only was a Cabinet Secretary in the administration but was \nelected by the people of Florida to serve as their United States \nSenator.\n  There are some in the Senate who seem to believe that immigrants are \njust criminals. In fact, the Frist bill that's before the Senate \ndeclares that all undocumented immigrants are criminals. The Frist bill \nwould have declared Senator Domenici's mother to be a criminal and the \nKyl amendment would disqualify her from earning American citizenship.\n  The facts tell a different story. Immigrants--including undocumented \nimmigrants--continue to strengthen the fabric of America in thousands \nof different ways. As David Brooks observed in his column last week in \nthe New York Times, Hispanic Americans and Hispanic immigrants in \nparticular are less likely to divorce. Husbands and wives stay together \nand raise their children. Even though they may have less money than \nother Americans, they spend almost twice as much on music for their \nchildren, they spend more on gifts and family get-togethers, and they \nare more likely to support their elderly parents.\n  The path of progress that we witnessed with the Martinez and Domenici \nfamilies is familiar even today. By the second generation, most \nimmigrant families have reached the middle class and they pay more than \nenough taxes to make up for the costs of their parents' generation. By \nthe third generation, 90 percent of the grandchildren of Hispanic \nimmigrants speak English fluently, and 50 percent of them marry non-\nHispanics. These patterns of assimilation are identical to those that \ncharacterized the children and grandchildren of Southern and Eastern \nEuropean immigrants who came to the United States 100 years ago, and to \nthe assimilation of German and Irish immigrants who came here 50 years \nbefore that.\n  In many ways, our economy is more dependent on immigration than ever \nbefore. The arrival of new and young immigrant workers helps explain \nwhy America's economy grows faster than most of the aging European \nnations. According to the Aspen Institute, immigration will be the only \nsource of growth in the prime age labor force in\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nAmerica in the next two decades. So America's choice really is between \nimmigration and economic stagnation.\n  However, even though immigration brings many benefits, there is no \ndoubt that our current system is broken and fails to protect us and \nmeet our Nation's needs. Our borders are out of control at a time of \nheightened concern about terrorism. Millions cross our borders and \nremain illegally, creating an underground society that is subject to \nabuse and that harms American wages and working conditions. Millions \nmore enter through our airports and seaports as visitors but remain \nlong after their visas expire. They come and remain because they wish \nto work and contribute, and our employers continue to offer them jobs. \nAs a result, more than 11 million undocumented immigrants are living \nand working in America today.\n  Many in Congress suggest that the answer is simply more enforcement. \nJust build more fences and hire more patrols and it will solve the \nproblem.\n  But we have tried that before and failed. We have spent more than $20 \nbillion over the past decade to build fences and triple our border \npatrols, but illegal immigration went up, not down. In the 1980s, the \nrate of illegal immigration was 40,000 people a year. Today, it is more \nthan half a million. And the probability that a border crosser will be \napprehend has plummeted from 20 percent a decade ago to just 5 percent \ntoday.\n  An enforcement-only approach to solving our immigration problems may \nmake a good campaign slogan. But in reality it is a failed strategy \nthat threatens our security and threatens American wages.\n  That's why Senator McCain and I have proposed a comprehensive, common \nsense plan to make a real difference.\n  An effective immigration strategy must have three parts.\n  First, we must enhance and modernize our immigration enforcement \ncapabilities, both at our borders and at worksites. To accomplish this, \nour bill enhances our capacity to monitor immigration flows and stop \nillegal entry. To do this, it doubles the number of Border Patrol \nagents over the next 5 years. And it builds roads, fences, and vehicle \nbarriers in specific high-flow areas; adds significant new technology \nat the border to create a robust ``virtual fence''; develops new land \nand water surveillance plans; authorizes new permanent highway \ncheckpoints near the border; and expands the exit-entry security system \nto all land borders and airports.\n  Our bill increases our capacity to crack down on criminal syndicates \nthat smuggle immigrants into the country and place them at great risk. \nTo aid in this mission, it creates new Federal penalties for \nconstructing border tunnels; new criminal penalties for evading or \nrefusing to obey commands of immigration officers; and new criminal \npenalties for financial transactions related to money laundering or \nsmuggling. And it creates new fraud-proof biometric immigration \ndocuments; increases access to anti-fraud detection resources; and \nimproves coordination among Federal, State, local, and tribal efforts \nto combat alien smuggling.\n  Our bill increases cooperation with Mexico to strengthen migration \ncontrol at Mexico's southern border to deter migration from Central \nAmerica through Mexico and into the United States. And it requires \ncooperation with other governments in the region to deter international \ngang activity.\n  And our bill would reduce the job magnet in America by creating a \nuniversal electronic eligibility verification system which will allow \nemployers to tell which individuals are authorized to work in the \nUnited States. It will substantially increase penalties against \nemployers who fail to comply with eligibility verification rules and \nadd 5,000 new enforcement agents to back up these provisions.\n  Second, we must address the presence of the 11 million undocumented \nworkers who are here now.\n  It is clear that we are not going to send them back. Many have \nAmerican citizen children and even grandchildren, and deporting them \nwould rip families apart. The massive roundup of 11 million people \nwould create havoc in our communities and cost $240 billion. It would \nrequire 200,000 buses in a convoy that would stretch from Alaska to San \nDiego.\n  These families want to continue working and contributing to our \ncommunities, and we should give them that opportunity not by offering \nan amnesty, but by allowing them to earn the right to remain.\n  So under our plan, to earn their legal status and eventually apply \nfor citizenship, they must pay a $2000 fine, work for six years, pay \ntheir taxes, learn English and civics, pass rigorous criminal and \nsecurity background checks, and get in the back of the line behind \nthose who have been waiting patiently to qualify for green cards.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday on television Senator Frist mischaracterized \nour commonsense proposal. He called it an amnesty, when in fact nothing \nis forgiven, nothing is pardoned. Undocumented workers must earn the \nprivilege of legal status and a path to American citizenship.\n  And he said that our plan allows undocumented immigrants to jump to \nthe front of the line, when our bill says plainly in black and white \nthat they must wait in the back.\n  We should conduct this debate based on fact, not fiction--thoughtful \npolicy and not bumper sticker slogans.\n  Earned legalization should not be available to criminal aliens and \nothers who would undermine U.S. security, but we must not be fooled by \nthe amendment offered last week by Senators Kyl and Cornyn. Our bill \nalready excludes from earned legalization criminal aliens and any \nimmigrant representing a security risk to the United States. The Kyl-\nCornyn amendment would also exclude literally millions of undocumented \nimmigrants already living and working in this country because they \npreviously failed to depart following an order to do so. Our analysis \nof DHS and INS statistics suggests that fully 95 percent of immigrants \naffected by the Kyl-Cornyn amendment would not be criminal aliens, but \nrather exactly the hardworking immigrants and families this program is \ndesigned to bring out of the shadows.\n  The third and final element of a successful immigration strategy is \nto address future immigration. We must provide a path to earned \nlegalization for those already here. But we must also address the \ncontinuing needs of our employers for workers and the reality that \npeople will continue to come here to improve their lives and contribute \nto America.\n  In the past, we have largely ignored these realities. We have turned \nour heads as people have come here to work and required them to remain \nin an underground economy.\n  The head-in-the-sand policy cannot be allowed to continue. It is \nharmful to these workers who are subject to abuse by employers. It is \nharmful to employers who never know if their workers may be sent home \ntomorrow, and most of all it is harmful to American workers whose wages \nare cut because employers can get away with hiring undocumented workers \nat lower pay.\n  Therefore, the plan that Senator McCain and I propose and that was \nadopted by the Judiciary Committee provides a strong and effective \nguest worker program for the future. It is far better for American \nworkers if future immigrants come here legally with rights to fair \nwages and working conditions, rather than having to compete with \nillegal workers who are paid substandard wages. Isn't it better if an \nemployer must pay an immigrant carpenter a standard wage like American \nworkers than a substandard wage that drives down wages for everyone \nelse? That is what our guest worker program would do.\n  It is estimated that the American economy demands about 400,000 new \nlow-skilled immigrants each year, but our current immigration system \ngrants only 5,000 visas to these workers. That is why we have more than \n11 million undocumented workers today. There simply are not enough \nvisas to go around.\n  To meet future needs, our guest worker program takes the commonsense \nstep of starting with a 400,000 annual quota and allows the quota to be \nadjusted up or down in future years based on the needs of the economy.\n  Taking this realistic step would free up our enforcement efforts to \nfocus not on those who yearn to breathe free--they should be welcomed \nas guest workers who contribute to America. We should concentrate our \nenforcement resources on those who would\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\ntruly harm us--the criminals, the drug smugglers, and especially the \nterrorists. That should be the priority for our time, and that is the \npriority of the McCain-Kennedy legislation.\n  Enhanced enforcement, earned legalization for those who are here, and \na realistic guest worker program for the future--that is a plan for \nsuccess, and the American people know it. It is a plan that Time \nmagazine reports is supported by more than three-quarters of the \nAmerican people, and they support it because they know our three-part \nplan increases our security, respects our values, and strengthens our \nprogress. In fact, poll after poll finds that between two-thirds and \nthree-quarters of all Americans favor a new program to allow temporary \nvisas for future essential workers, and an even higher proportion favor \nallowing undocumented immigrants into the United States to earn \ncitizenship if they learn English, have a job, and pay taxes.\n  In contrast, in a Time magazine poll conducted last week, just one in \nfour Americans favor making illegal immigration a crime and preventing \nanyone entering the country illegally from remaining in the country and \nworking here. The American people want real comprehensive reform, not \njust more immigration enforcement.\n  All three of these changes are necessary if we are to address the \nroot causes of undocumented immigration and break the cycle of \nillegality which now corrodes our immigration system. All three of \nthese changes are necessary if we are to ensure that immigrant families \ntoday, as in the past, continue to live the American dream and \ncontribute to our prosperity, our security, and our values. All three \nof these changes are necessary if we are to be true to our heritage as \na nation of immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe we are going back and forth, but \nsince there is no one on the other side of the aisle seeking to claim \ntime, let me claim time on our side. I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 25 minutes against our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, at a time when our country sees so much of \nthe outsourcing of good jobs and now the proposal to continue importing \ncheap labor, I think it is a strange set of circumstances that has a \nproposal on the floor of the Senate saying let's deal with immigration \nand the immigration problem in this country by adding to the \nimmigration bill a so-called guest worker program that would allow \n400,000 additional people who now live outside our country to come into \nour country's labor force. They would do that with an escalator of \npotential 20 percent more than the 400,000 each year or, over 6 years, \nif they use the maximum, another 4.7 million immigrant workers into \nthis country.\n  Open the newspaper these days and take a look at the news: \noutsourcing of American jobs; good American jobs that pay well, with \nbenefits, retirement, and health care, going to China, Indonesia, Sri \nLanka, Bangladesh--outsourcing American jobs. In addition to \noutsourcing good American jobs, we are also insourcing, importing cheap \nlabor.\n  We now have 11 million immigrants in this country who are here \nillegally. This Chamber is full of talk these days about immigrants \nbecause we are on an immigration bill and will be until the end of this \nweek. The question is, Where is the talk about American workers as we \ndiscuss the issue of immigrants and immigration reform? Where is the \ndescription of the plight of the American worker? Who is here \ndescribing the circumstances faced by American workers? There are many \nhere speaking for immigrants, and I don't ever want to diminish the \ndignity or the worth of the immigrants who have come here over the life \nof this country and helped us build something very unusual on the face \nof this Earth.\n  This country is a country made up of immigrants. I think everyone who \nstands on this floor would likely describe their great-grandparents or \ntheir grandparents or great-great-grandparents who came here from \nsomewhere--mine from Norway, for example, and Sweden. But what we have \nbuilt on this Earth is a country that is unique and unusual. It is a \ncountry that has created a standard of living which is almost \nunparalleled in the world: good jobs that pay well, the creation of a \nmiddle class, an expanded middle class where people had good incomes \nand those good incomes allowed them to increase their standard of \nliving.\n  Now we see a different kind of circumstance in our country. We see \nthe largest corporations that have become the preeminent economic \nentities, very large corporations that have described a different set \nof circumstances for themselves. What they like to do is produce \nsomewhere else--send their jobs to China, for example--and then send \nthe product back to this country to sell and then send their income \nthrough a Grand Cayman Island bank so they don't have to pay taxes. \nThey ship the jobs overseas, ship the products here, and run the money \nthrough the Cayman Islands.\n  In addition to all of that--and there is plenty of evidence that is \ngoing on wholesale; 3 million jobs lost to that sort of activity just \nin the last several years--in addition to that, at the same time these \njobs are moving overseas and hurting the middle class in this country \nand shrinking opportunities for the people at the lowest rung of the \neconomic ladder, we have people trying to get into this country.\n  Why? Our country is an attraction to them because this is a place \nthey want to come to get a job and make some money. In much of the \nworld, they pay various substandard wages--different economies, less \ndeveloped countries, undeveloped countries--and so this country has \nbecome a magnet for people who want to come here.\n  I have described the circumstance some years ago when I was on a \nhelicopter that ran out of gas somewhere between Honduras, Nicaragua, \nand El Salvador, up in the mountains in the jungles. After we ran out \nof power, after the fuel tank was empty, we landed, and the compesinos \ncame to our helicopter to see who came through. I, through an \ninterpreter, talked with some of them.\n  I talked with a woman who had three children. After describing who we \nwere and asking about her life, I said: What is it you would like to do \nwith your life?\n  She said: Oh, I would like to come to America; I would like to come \nto the United States.\n  Why would you like to do that, I asked?\n  Because that is where opportunity is, she said. Get a job, make some \nmoney, have opportunities for me and my children.\n  That is not unusual. It wasn't unusual to hear that in Nicaragua or \nEl Salvador, and it wouldn't be unusual to hear that in most parts of \nthe world. If we had no immigration laws at all and we said tomorrow to \nany one else of this world's population of roughly 6.3 billion who want \nto come here: Come on along, you are welcome in this country. Come and \nstay. Come and grab a job, if you like--why don't we do that? Why do we \nhave immigration laws? Why do we have quotas of the number of people we \ncan allow in each year--and we do allow people in--why do we have those \nnumbers? Simply because we can't absorb a massive inflow of immigration \nfrom around the world willing to work at substandard wages. We can't \nabsorb that. The social services that are required to attend to it, the \njobs they take, we can't do that. So we have a process called \nimmigration by which people legally come into this country.\n\n  People have come to this country illegally. It is estimated we now \nhave 11 million people here illegally. I heard an actor--well, actually \nhe is not much of an actor--but I heard this fellow on television \nyesterday on CBS, I believe it was, and he was doing his commentary \nabout immigration. This is a fellow who has been wrong about most \nthings, so it didn't surprise me what he said about immigration. He \nsaid: No one should call this illegal immigration.\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nWell, I am sorry, but if people come here illegally, it is illegal \nimmigration. We have 11 million people here illegally.\n  In addition, 1.1 million people tried to come across our southern \nborder last year, but were stopped--1.1 million were stopped at our \nsouthern border trying to come into this country. In addition to that, \nsomewhere between 400,000 and 700,000 people we estimate came into this \ncountry across the southern border illegally last year. Finally, above \nthat number, 175,000 immigrated from Mexico last year legally. That is \nin addition to the other quotas from the other countries. So the fact \nis, we have a very significant number who come into this country, and \nmany of them come in illegally.\n  So my colleagues bring an immigration bill to the floor and the \nPresident describes the need for an immigration bill, as well as the \nPresident of Mexico. What they say is: We can't arrest and detain and \ndeport 11 million people. I understand that. I am not sure I know the \nsolution to all of this, but I understand there is not going to be a \nsweep in this country to detain or deport or arrest 11 million people \nwho are here illegally. We will have discussions about that portion of \nthe bill and we will have amendments about that portion of the \nlegislation. We will also have amendments about employer sanctions.\n  I was here when the previous immigration bill was passed. The \npresumption was that if you make it illegal for employers to hire \nillegal aliens then, in that circumstance, they will have to pay a \nsignificant fine--the employer will--and they won't be hiring them. If \nthe job is not the magnet to come here, it will shut down immigration \nat the border. That was all nonsense. It didn't work. I think last year \nthree immigration cases were brought by this administration against \nemployers who hired illegal immigrants. There has been no enforcement \nat all. So we are going to have discussions and amendments about that \nportion of the legislation.\n  Let me talk about the other piece, if I might, and that other piece \nis a guest worker program attached to this, saying, In addition to all \nof the other things that will be done in this legislation, including \nmaking legal 11 million people who came here illegally or giving them \nlegal status, we have an addition called a guest worker program. The \nguest worker program is the proposition that 400,000 additional workers \nwill be allowed in. These are people who are now living outside of our \ncountry. They will be allowed into our country with a 20-percent \nescalator per year and, by the way, at the end of 6 the escalator works \nand they let these folks come in years, if, we will have 4.6 million \nadditional guest workers who have come into this program in the 6-year \nperiod--4.6 million.\n  Why are people saying this is necessary? They are saying it is \nnecessary because Americans won't take these jobs. We can't find \nAmericans who will take these jobs. Well, why do you suppose that might \nbe the case, if it is the case? I dispute that, but let's assume it is \nthe case. One of the reasons is those jobs don't pay enough. Since the \nbig businesses don't want to raise salaries at the bottom, they say the \nsolution to not having to raise salaries is to bring in immigrant \nworkers who will work for less. Let's not worry about the Americans. If \nwe can't find Americans to take the jobs at the minimum wage and, by \nthe way, this Congress has decided for 8 years it will not increase the \nminimum wage--those folks, the working poor and others who work at the \nbottom of the economic ladder, have not had an increase in the minimum \nwage in 8 years. So the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, big business, and \nothers say, What we need to do is to have a separate and additional \nguest worker program. In addition to the 11 million people, we need to \nhave a guest worker program that could reach 4.6 million people in the \nnext 6 years.\n  Let me respond to this question of jobs that Americans won't do. This \nis what the research says. Construction jobs: 86 percent of the workers \nare American workers and other legal workers. Food preparation: 12 \npercent are illegal immigrants; 88 percent of the food preparation \nworkers are American workers and other legal workers. Manufacturing: 91 \npercent American workers. Transport: 93 percent. These are the jobs \nthat corporations and others say Americans won't take and, therefore, \nthey have to bring in immigrant labor, new guest workers, 4.6 million \nadditional people.\n  While we are doing that, let's take a look at this issue of change in \nincome for the American people. This happens to measure 1979 to 2003. \nYou can see the top 1 percent of the American income earners are doing \nvery well--lots of extra income, massive growth in their income. The \nbottom fifth: almost no growth in 25 years. In fact, some studies show \nthey have actually lost ground. This shows that they have been stagnant \nfor 25 years. So at the same time we have people saying, We need to \nbring in more immigrant workers to take these low-income jobs, we have \npeople at the lower end of the economic scale in this country--and we \nhave the middle-income workers as well--struggling, trying to figure \nout, What do they do next? How do they find a good job?\n\n  About 30 years ago, the largest corporation in this country was \nGeneral Motors. General Motors paid well, had good benefits, good \nretirement, good health care. Most people not only got good pay when \nthey went to work there, they worked there for a lifetime. Now, the \nlargest corporation is Wal-Mart--Wal-Mart. In the first year of \nemployment, turnover I understand is about 70 to 80 percent. Wal-Mart \npays very low wages. I believe the average income at Wal-Mart is \n$18,000 a year, and they pay very little benefits. Very few have health \ncare. I think a third to just over a third have health care benefits, \nand those who do pay substantially more than is the employee's share in \nmost other companies. That is what we have come to. So the middle-\nincome workers are looking for a replacement for those jobs that have \nbeen shipped overseas.\n  I have spoken at length about the issue of outsourcing of jobs, and I \nwon't do that today, but whether it is Huffy bicycles or Little Red \nWagon Radio Flyer, Fig Newton cookies, Fruit of the Loom, or Levis or \nTony Lama boots--I could go on forever--these are jobs Americans used \nto have, good jobs that paid well, almost always jobs with benefits--\ngone, gone to China for somebody who will earn 33 cents an hour, \nprobably working in Shenzhen, China, 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek, to produce the product and ship it back to Wal-Mart, Kmart, and \nSears to be sold to the American public, and then have the same \ncompanies run their income through the Cayman Islands to avoid paying \ntaxes. That is interesting but not very good for this country, and \nexactly the wrong strategy for the long-term economic health of \nAmerica.\n  Employment rates for individuals lacking a high school diploma, you \nwill see that nearly one-half of U.S.-born workers without a high \nschool diploma are without a job. Immigrant workers, on the other hand, \nmany of whom come here without a high school diploma, find work in high \nnumbers. I have a picture of some immigrant workers that was given to \nme recently. These, by the way, were workers who came in by a \ncontractor who hired them to help do work after Hurricane Katrina, \nundocumented workers who came into this country, and--by the way, at \nthe hearing I held on this, one of the people who testified was a \nfellow who ran a Louisiana construction firm. His firm was hired by a \nHalliburton subcontractor to do electrical repair work in Louisiana \nafter Hurricane Katrina. But the Halliburton subcontractor changed its \nmind, and they hired a good number of people to come in who were \nundocumented workers and who didn't have adequate training to do \nelectrical work at this particular base. It is the sort of thing that \nis going on all the time, and I think it is hurting this country.\n  So the question is for this Congress, Who is going to talk about \nAmerican workers? I know the subject is about immigration, but it has a \nprofound impact on American workers. So who is going to come here today \nto talk about American workers?\n  We are told that the corporate strategy here is that they can't find \nadditional American workers without paying higher wages and they don't \nwant to pay higher wages because they want to keep costs down, so they \nare going to import additional workers. They are now called guest \nworkers. By the way, these are nonagricultural, these guest workers. \nThis is in addition to H-2A and H-2B workers, agricultural and \nnonagricultural, who will still exist\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nunder law. I haven't even described the people coming in under those \ntwo provisions. Yet we have people saying we must have this additional \nguest worker program.\n  I understand people listening and those who feel very strongly that \nwe have to have this immigration bill, including the guest workers, who \nwill say: What you are talking about is anti-immigrant. That couldn't \nbe further from the truth. I indicated that I think immigrants \ncontribute a great deal to this country. Most of us come as a result of \nsome immigration back a generation or several generations in our \nfamily. But the question is: What are we going to do to fix this issue, \nand what are we going to do to balance the immigration legislation and \nthe proposal for guest workers against the needs of American workers? I \nthink what is going on here is going to pull the rug out from under \nAmerican workers. I don't understand this at all.\n  Let me put up a chart that shows the average wages--perhaps I should \nshow you the New York Times story of March 17, a couple of weeks ago, \nabout a businesswoman in New York. Sister Ping is her nickname. She was \nsentenced to 35 years for running one of New York City's most lucrative \nimmigrant smuggling rings and for financing the infamous Voyage of \nGolden Venture, the rusty freighter that ran aground with 300 starving \nimmigrants in its hold. Sister Ping said she would be happier in prison \nin the United States than free in her rural village in China.\n  Let me describe what persuades Sister Ping and others to attempt to \nbring low-wage income earners to this country. A typical unskilled \nlabor wage in Russia is 51 cents an hour. In Nicaragua, 37 cents an \nhour. In China, 33 cents an hour; in Bangladesh, 33 cents an hour; in \nIndia, 11 cents an hour; and in Haiti, 30 cents an hour. We are \nsuggesting that we are short of workers here. We want another 400,000 \nplus 20 percent every year for 6 years, or 4.7 million additional \nworkers because we don't have enough workers in this country.\n  What we don't have is enough courage and enough common sense to, \nfirst, increase the minimum wage and second, to tell those who are \ntrying to employ immigrant labor at below standard wages, which they \nhave done for years now, that you have to pay a decent wage at the \nbottom to get people to work, and that includes Americans. That \nincludes our country's workers. If this Congress has some common sense, \nwe don't need guest workers. That is the other side of this immigration \ndebate, the extra guest workers. We don't need them. What we need \nemployers to do is to pay a decent wage. What we need the Congress to \ndo is to increase the minimum wage.\n\n  We need to understand that American workers have worth. They want \njobs. What is happening to them is good jobs are being exported \noverseas for these kinds of wages overseas, and then low-income jobs in \nthis country are now going to be filled and have been filled by \nimmigrant labor. So we are importing low-wage workers for jobs here and \nexporting high-wage, good jobs for jobs there. I am telling you I think \nthat is a strategy to injure this country's economy. It is a strategy \nto hurt low-income American workers. It has been going on for some \nwhile now. But this memorializes it in an immigration bill.\n  I don't understand at all why this is being seriously proposed. In \nfact, the President's proposal would have no limit. I talked about the \n400,000 plus a 20-percent escalator per year for so-called guest \nworkers who now live outside of our country who will be told to come on \nin legally. The Congress has a 400,000-person plus a 20-percent \nescalator which, as I indicated, would relate to about 4.7 million \nworkers over 6 years. But the fact is, the President's proposal has no \nlimit at all; the sky is the limit. I am telling you, this is a U.S. \nChamber-big business strategy. It is probably good for them. It allows \nthem to import cheap labor. It probably keeps their costs low. But I \nwill tell you what else it does: It pulls the rug out from American \nworkers in a way that is very unfair.\n  Having said all of that, it is not my intention to suggest that we \ndon't have to deal with immigration issues. We do. I understand that. \nIt is not my intention to suggest that anybody can round up or should \neven seriously consider rounding up 11 million people and deporting \nthem. That is not going to happen. I was in the Congress when the \nSimpson-Mazzoli bill was passed dealing with immigration. It was going \nto fix immigration. Immigration problems have become much worse.\n  This proposal, the Simpson-Mazzoli proposal, was described as a \nproposal that would say that the attraction--the magnet--for immigrants \ncoming into this country is a job. Take away the job, you take away the \nattraction or the magnet. How do you take away the job? You tell \nemployers in this country, if you hire people who are here illegally, \nyou are going to pay a real price for it. You are going to be slapped \nwith a big fine. You are going to have a big problem.\n\n  Guess what--they didn't even get hit with a feather duster. Not a \nthing. As I said, last year there were three enforcement cases against \nAmerican businesses that hired illegal labor. I just heard of one the \nother day in our part of the country. An employer from one of the big \ncities up near our area hired some illegal immigrants to come in and do \na construction project. They were caught. The question was, for the \nlocal State's attorney, the question for the attorney general's office \nand others, is anything going to happen? No, nothing is going to \nhappen. No action is going to be taken. It has been that way for years. \nThe result is that the so-called Simpson-Mazzoli bill meant nothing.\n  My colleagues say now we are going to really enforce things at the \nborder. If we have a guest worker provision, somehow we will not have \nadditional people coming across the border because we will allow about \n4.7 million of them in illegally in addition to the 11 million who are \nhere. I don't understand why they believe allowing 450,000-plus a year, \nor 4.7 million in 6 years, potentially--how that is going to stop \nothers who want to come in. We have an inexhaustible number of people \nworking around the world at dirt-cheap wages. We have an inexhaustible \nappetite in this country, for businesses, apparently, to hire people at \nsubstandard wages. So how is it you are going to plug this border? I \ndon't see it in this bill.\n  We are told we don't really plug the border. What you really do is \ninvite up to 4.7 million additional people in, and therefore that cuts \nthe appetite for people to come in. It is total nonsense. That is not \ngoing to do it at all. It just isn't. All it is going to do is \nundermine American workers at the bottom of the economic ladder. That \nis what it does. I don't understand why this issue is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate with guest workers.\n  I mentioned the other day a story about FDR. Let me close with that.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral was being held. Before his \nfuneral, his body lay in State here in the Capitol Building, and there \nwere long lines to view the casket of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The \njournalists were trying to get color pieces for their stories. A \njournalist walked up to a man who was holding his cap in his hands, a \nworking man. He had been standing for some long while in line to file \npast the casket of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  The journalist asked him: Did you know President Roosevelt?\n  The working guy said: No, but President Roosevelt knew me.\n  The question is, Who knows American workers now? Yes, President \nRoosevelt did know American workers. He is the person who got us the \nFair Labor Standards Act. He stood up for American workers. Who knows \nAmerican workers now? Is there any discussion about American workers as \nwe talk about immigration on the floor of the Senate, a subject that \nwill have such a profound impact on jobs in this country? Is there any \ndiscussion about American workers? I don't hear it, regrettably.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3223 to Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am also today going to offer an amendment numbered \n3223, which I believe is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask that we call up amendment No. 3223.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Jeffords, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3223 to amendment No. 3192.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To allow United States citizens under 18 years of age to \n  travel to Canada without a passport, to develop a system to enable \n United States citizens to take 24-hour excursions to Canada without a \n     passport, and to limit the cost of passport cards or similar \n                   alternatives to passports to $20)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TRAVEL TO CANADA.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Common \n     Sense Cross-Border Travel and Security Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Travel to Canada Without Passport.--Section 7209(b) of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-458) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary'';\n       (B) by striking ``This plan'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(B) Day passes.--The plan developed under this paragraph \n     shall include a system that would enable United States \n     citizens to travel to Canada for a 24-hour period without a \n     passport by completing an application for a `day pass' at any \n     port of entry along the land border between the United States \n     and Canada, and certifying that there was not sufficient time \n     to apply for a passport before the excursion. The traveler \n     shall not be charged a fee to acquire or use the day pass.\n       ``(C) Implementation.--The plan developed under this \n     paragraph''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Minors.--United States citizens who are less than 18 \n     years of age, when accompanied by a parent or guardian, shall \n     not be required to present a passport when returning to the \n     United States from Canada at any port of entry along the land \n     border.''.\n       (c) Limit on Fees for Travel Documents.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law or cost recovery requirement \n     established by the Office of Management and Budget, the \n     Secretary and the Secretary of State may not charge a fee in \n     an amount greater than $20 for any passport card or similar \n     document other than a passport that is created to satisfy the \n     requirements of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458).\n       (d) Acceptance of Passport Cards and Day Passes by \n     Canada.--The Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     Secretary, shall negotiate with the Government of Canada to \n     ensure that passport cards and day passes issued by the \n     Government of the United States for travel to Canada are \n     accepted for such purpose by the Government of Canada.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nSnowe, Schumer, Burns, and Jeffords. I will just briefly describe the \namendment that I hope we will consider this week. It deals with cross-\nborder traffic between the United States and Canada and the issue of \nthe card that is being considered by the State Department in lieu of a \npassport that would be required for United States-Canada cross-border \ntraffic.\n  The amendment is quite simple. It would provide, for children under \n18--that is, 17 and under--who are accompanied by parents moving cross-\nborder, they would not need one of these new cross-border cards. It \nwould provide that there be an opportunity for the State Department to \noffer 3-day passes for those who are simply on a 1-day cross-border \ntrip and would also provide that these new cards which would be \nrequired in lieu of passports cost no more than $20.\n  As you know, it takes over $90 to purchase a passport. That is not an \ninconsiderable sum. It takes some while to get a passport. If you have \na family of four or five going up to Winnipeg or Regina, the northern \npart of our State--we have a 4000-plus mile border--for a family of \nfour or five going to see a relative, if we have a passport \nrequirement, that is pretty dramatic. We have always been able to use \nour driver's license, and the Department of Homeland Security says that \nis going to be replaced by a passport. We complained about that. They \nsaid: All right, what we will require is a passport card. We don't know \nthe specifics of that card, but what we want to make sure of is that \ncard not be prohibitive for families. I don't have any problem with \nrequiring a standardized card, but I don't believe it should cost more \nthan $20. I don't believe it should be required for children under 17 \ntraveling with their parents. There also ought to be exceptional \ncircumstances, with proper identification, for those who make day \ntrips.\n  As I said, I am joined in this amendment by many of my colleagues \nfrom the border States, including Senator Snowe from Maine, Senator \nSchumer from New York, Senator Burns from Montana, and Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont. I hope we can have some discussion and debate and hope in \nthe conduct of the debate on this immigration bill that we may include \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I sat here with interest, listening to \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I think we agree on an awful lot. I may \nnot agree with everything he said, but he made some very salient points \nwith respect to the earlier laws we have passed on this issue of \nimmigration and the amnesty--that is what it amounted to--that was \ngiven to certain folks who were included in the previous immigration \nbill the Senator addressed. He is exactly right. It didn't work back \nthen. While there are provisions in this bill, some of which I may \nagree with--they may be good--there are certain other points in this \nwhich simply are not very good pieces of legislation\n  I would like to take a moment to speak on the amnesties that exist in \nthe immigration bill passed by the Judiciary Committee that is now \nunder discussion on the floor. Some in the Senate like to call it \nsomething else--earned adjustment or earned citizenship--to try to \ndistinguish it from what Congress has done in the past. However, I \nbelieve that the legislation adopted by the Judiciary Committee is so \nsimilar to the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act passed by \nCongress, which everyone agrees is amnesty, that in fairness, what the \nSenate is being asked to consider today should likewise be called \namnesty.\n  One reason why I am opposed to amnesty, or earned legalization, is \nbecause the last time Congress addressed what to do about the illegal \npopulation in our country, a similar approach was agreed upon, and it \ndid not work. In the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, increased \nenforcement, both at the border and in the interior of the U.S., and \nespecially with regards to employer sanctions was mandated to eliminate \nthe jobs magnet for so many illegal immigrants. In addition, the theory \nwas that our increased border security would stem the tide of illegal \nimmigrants coming into the country.\n  Coupled with this enforcement was an amnesty offered to illegal \naliens who met specified requirements in order to bring them out of the \nshadows and allow them to acquire legal status. There were actually two \namnesties included in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986--\nthe Legally Authorized Workers--LAW--program and the Special \nAgricultural Worker Program--SAW.\n  Similarly in the bill put forth by the Judiciary Committee, there are \nmandates for increased border security and interior enforcement as well \nas a strong emphasis on employer sanctions. Coupled with this also \nexists two amnesties: one for the estimated 11 million illegal aliens \ncurrently in the U.S. and another for illegal aliens working in \nagriculture.\n  The 1986 SAW Program required that illegal aliens work a certain \nnumber of hours in agriculture in order to obtain a temporary legal \nstatus. Then 1 to 2 years after obtaining a temporary legal status, \nthose agricultural workers were given permanent residency status. Now, \nevery Senator I have seen come to the floor has called this 1986 SAW \nprogram an amnesty, yet many maintain that the current Judiciary \nCommittee proposal is not an amnesty.\n  However, the current agricultural program in the Judiciary Committee \nbill is constructed in much the same way: Illegal aliens who worked 150 \nhours in agriculture in the 2-year period ending on December 31, 2005, \ncan obtain a temporary legal status, here called a blue card. Then by \nworking 100 hours per year in agriculture for 5 years or by working 150 \nhours per year in agriculture for 3 years, that illegal alien will be \ngiven permanent resident status. So the only difference between a \nprogram that is unanimously agreed upon to be amnesty and one that is \nargued not to be is the requirement that\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nthe illegal aliens work in agriculture for 100 to 150 hours per year. \nThe waiting time instead of 1 to 2 years is now 3 or 5, but that is it. \nThe rest is the same.\n  These illegal aliens are not required to work in any other industry \nor for any greater amount of time than 100 hours per year or 150 hours \nper year. Not only that but they do not have to wait in line behind \neveryone outside the country trying to legally enter the U.S. in order \nto get their permanent resident status. Not only is this unfair, but it \nis a repeat of the 1986 approach, which is widely recognized as \nseriously flawed.\n  We should not repeat the mistakes we made before. I am not the only \none who feels this way. I recently attended a naturalization ceremony \nin Atlanta, GA, and was moved to see a room full of people from all \nover the world raise their right hand and take an oath of allegiance to \nthe U.S. It was clearly a proud day for these people and their loved \nones. They had gone through the legal process and truly earned their \ncitizenship. I was surprised at the number of new citizens who came up \nto me after the ceremony and asked me to reject the amnesty the Senate \nis now being asked to consider. These folks told me they felt it \ndemeans the efforts they made to obey the law and wait in line to \nbecome a U.S. citizen. They realize what a valuable accomplishment they \nmade.\n  The people I saw at that naturalization ceremony truly earned their \ncitizenship. It does not seem fair to me to call the process those \nnewly naturalized citizens followed ``earned citizenship'' and also to \ncall what the Judiciary Committee is asking the Senate to consider \n``earned citizenship.'' There is a fundamental difference between the \ntwo and that should be recognized in the rhetoric of the Senate.\n  Another problem I have with the agricultural amnesty endorsed by the \nJudiciary Committee is that it does not seem to remedy the problem with \nfraud that was prevalent with the 1986 SAW program. Under the 1986 SAW \nprogram, illegal farm workers who did at least 90 days of farm work \nduring a 12-month period could earn a legal status.\n  The illegal immigrants had to present evidence that they did at least \n90 days of farm work, such as pay stubs or a letter from an employer or \neven fellow workers. Because it was assumed that many unauthorized farm \nworkers were employed by labor contractors who did not keep accurate \nrecords, after a farm worker presented evidence that he had done \nqualifying farm work, the burden of proof shifted to the Government to \ndisprove the claimed work.\n  The Government was not prepared for the flood of SAW applicants and \nhad little expertise on typical harvesting seasons. Therefore an \napplicant who told a story like ``I climbed a ladder to pick \nstrawberries'' had that application denied while those who said ``I \npicked tomatoes for 92 days'' in an area with a picking season of only \n70 days, was able to adjust.\n  Careful analysis of a sample of SAW applications in California, where \nmost applications were filed, suggests that most applicants had not \ndone the qualifying farmwork, but over 90 percent were nonetheless \napproved.\n  The propensity for fraud is not remedied in the Judiciary Committee's \nbill and compounds bad policy with the ability for unscrupulous actors \nto take advantage of it.\n  I think the most important lesson to learn from the 1986 SAW program \nis that providing illegal immigrants who work on the farms in this \ncountry does not benefit the agricultural workforce for long. History \nshows that the vast majority of illegal workers who gain a legal status \nleave agriculture within a 5-year period. This means that under the \nJudiciary Committee's proposed agricultural amnesty, those who \nquestionably performed agricultural work in the past will work at least \n100 or 150 hours in agriculture per year for the next 3 to 5 years. But \nafter that, particularly in light of the changes made to the H-2A \nprogram, I expect us to be in the same situation in agriculture that we \nare in today.\n  It is worth noting that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986 created a Commission on Agricultural Workers--an 11 member bi-\npartisan panel comprised of growers, union representatives, academics, \ncivil servants, and clergy--and tasked it with examining the impact the \namnesty for Special Agricultural Workers had on the domestic farm labor \nsupply, working conditions, and wages.\n  Six years after the Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed, \nthe Commission found that the same problems in the agricultural \nindustry persist: the living and working conditions of farm workers had \nnot improved; wages remained stagnant; increasing numbers of new \nillegal aliens are arriving to compete for the same small number of \njobs, thus reducing the work hours available to each worker and \ncontributing to lower annual earnings; and virtually all workers who \nhold seasonal agricultural jobs are unemployed at some point during the \nyear.\n  I think the experience of the SAW program should serve as a lesson to \nthe Senate as we grapple with how to handle our current illegal \npopulation. I believe the amnesty approach endorsed by the Judiciary \nCommittee is far too similar to the SAW Program in 1986 and will likely \nhave the same result. That is why I have introduced an amendment that \nwill take away the amnesty from the agricultural portion of the \nJudiciary Committee bill.\n  My amendment will allow illegal aliens to get blue cards in the same \nway that the Judiciary Committee prescribed. However, it requires that \nat the end of a 2-year period, those blue card workers must return to \ntheir home countries and enter the U.S. in a legal manner.\n  This 2-year period provides sufficient time for agricultural \nemployers to organize their workforce so that they can send workers \nhome in an orderly manner and not have a complete work stoppage. These \nworkers can then enter the U.S. on a legal temporary worker program \njust like anybody else in the world.\n  They can stay here for a specified period of time and then when that \ntime is up they will have to return to their homeland.\n  We know from past experience that agricultural workers do not stay in \ntheir agricultural jobs for long, especially when they gain a legal \nstatus and have the option to work in less back-breaking occupations. \nTherefore, the focus on agricultural immigration should be on the H-2A \nprogram. This is the program that regardless of what the Senate does \nwith amnesty, will be relied upon by our agricultural employers across \nthe country in the near future.\n  My amendment provides for a reasonable and responsible transition to \nthe H-2A program, and I believe is an approach that will not repeat the \nmistakes of the past and is more in line with the way the vast majority \nof Americans believe we should deal with our large illegal population.\n  I send my amendment to the desk, and I will have more to say about \nthat amendment in the future as we continue the debate on this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a time allocation. How much time \nremains under the time of Senator Leahy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 48 minutes 55 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have probably 15 pages of names of \ndifferent groups that support and now embrace the McCain-Kennedy \nlegislation, now called our border security legislation. There are 430 \ndifferent groups that have supported this legislation representing the \nfaith community.\n  This chart is entitled ``Evangelical Support Comprehensive \nImmigration Reform.''\n\n       We support comprehensive immigration reform, based on the \n     biblical mandates, our Christian faith and values, and our \n     commitment to civil and human rights.\n\n  These are 41 national, local, and individual evangelical leaders and \ngroups. This is reflected also in other religious groups that have \nsupported it, including a number of groups representing\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nlabor, business communities, men and women of faith who are supporting \nthe comprehensive approach.\n  I will review very quickly, once again, the kind of worker \nprotections we have put in this legislation. One of the principal \nreasons the church leaders have been so supportive is because they have \nfollowed and witnessed this program for so many years.\n  In the 1950s we had the Bracero Program which was a program that saw \nenormous human abuses of workers who were basically brought in here, \ndoing sweat labor, without any rights at all, and then shipped back, \nfor the most part, to Mexico. There was an extraordinary exploitation \nof individuals. That ended in the early 1960s. I was in the Senate when \nthat program ended.\n  We still have enormous tensions between the workers and the farmers, \nparticularly in California and a number of other Western States. We \nalso have seen it on the east coast as a number of migrant workers have \ncome up from Florida, through Georgia, through the Carolinas, even \nended up coming into New York State and my own State in the form of \napple pickers and other fruit pickers. They have followed the seasons.\n  But primarily this issue about agricultural workers has been focused, \nas has been spoken to eloquently by the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein. She has played an indispensable role, along with Senator \nCraig, who has been a longtime sponsor of what we call the AgJOBS bill. \nWe have votes on that legislation. A bipartisan majority of the members \nsupported that legislation. That particular legislation has been \naltered to a very small extent and incorporated in the broader \nlegislation. It is one of the important reasons to commend this \nlegislation.\n  As I have mentioned in an earlier statement, we have a comprehensive \napproach toward our immigration challenge that we are facing in this \ncountry, but there is a very important AgJOBS issue. We had not \naddressed it in the McCain-Kennedy legislation because it appears to \nhave a separate constituency, but we were able to get that incorporated \nthrough the leadership of Senator Feinstein. It strengthened our \npackage.\n  I mention, first of all, the protections that have been put in the \nagriculture comprehensive. Anyone who has followed the relationship \nbetween the farmers and the workers would understand it has been an \nextraordinarily strained relationship, to say the least. Caesar Chavez \nwas the great leader of the farm workers. I had the opportunity to \nknow, respect, and hold him in high regard. He was the leader for the \nfarm workers for a great number of years. He is regarded almost as a \nsaint among the farm workers.\n  There was enormous tension during a prolonged period of time, and in \nrecent years there has been an accommodation between the two groups. \nBoth of the groups--the farmers and agricultural workers--got together \nand made a proposal. This obviously has enormous implications. From my \npoint of view, it has enormous implications because of what it will do. \nIt will mean that men and women who work in that extraordinarily \nchallenging and difficult agricultural area, which is back-breaking \nwork, will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. And, \nsecond, it provides assurance to the farmers of a definite labor \nsupply. Third, it gives the assurance that States such as California, \nthe leading agricultural State, is going to have dependability and \nreliability in terms of the work force. That is going to mean better \nservice to the consumers of agricultural products all across this \ncountry.\n  It is enormously valuable and very worthwhile and one of the \ncompelling reasons for this legislation. Included in this legislation \nare very important protections that are not in there under the current \nH-2A program. Some people have talked about what is happening in \nagribusiness today in the H-2A program, and too much of that is true, \nbut that will be altered and changed under the agricultural worker \ncompromise.\n\n  There are specific provisions; again, in order to be eligible for \nthis program individuals are going to have to demonstrate, they must \nalready have a work record of more than 2 years. They will be able to \nwork over a period of 3 years in the business after that period of \ntime, 3 to 5 years, and after that, they can get on a glidepath toward \ncitizenship. So total time for them would be a total of 10 to 12 years \nin order to earn the opportunity to be a citizen. That means they will \nhave to pay the penalties, they will have to demonstrate they paid \ntheir taxes, that they have had no trouble with the law, and they have \ncomplied with the other provisions of the legislation. So there are \nvery important protections.\n  If there were no other reasons for the support for this legislation, \nthat particular provision, the AgJOBS legislation, is overwhelming in \nits importance and consequence in advancing the cause of justice for \nagricultural workers and also the assurance to farmers of a dependable \nand reliable workforce.\n  It has been stated a number of times by some Members perhaps who are \nnot as familiar with the legislation as they might be, about the kind \nof protections that exist in the underlying legislation with regard to \nthe guest worker program and how it would work. First of all, there has \nto be an advertisement in the United States to try and recruit American \nworkers first. There has to be a certification of the effort under \npenalty of violating the law. They have to advertise to recruit \nAmerican workers first. It is only after they have been unable to \nrecruit American workers that they will be able to recruit workers, \nprimarily in Mexico, but there is an allocation of workers, depending \non the workforce in terms of other countries, and in limited numbers \nfor other countries in Central America. There are even provisions in \nterms of the Asian nations. Those will be worked out through the \nembassies and through the department.\n  When this individual comes to the United States as a guest worker, \nthey will have a tamper-proof identification card. The employer will \nknow that individual has had his criminal record reviewed, that the \nperson is found to be the individual as portrayed, and where there is \nemployment that will be available to that individual in the United \nStates. There are provisions included in the legislation that they are \ngoing to be covered by the prevailing wage, they will be covered by the \nDavis-Bacon provisions, they will be protected if they are going to \nwork as what they call ``service contract'' employees, and their wages \nwill be protected in those areas, as well.\n  Instead of having what we have at the present time--an undocumented \nalien worker recruited by an employer who can say: Look, you will work \nfor me for $1, and if you do not like it I will turn you over to the \nimmigration authority--this individual will be able to have the card \nand existing protections for wages which will have the corresponding \neffect. It will mean that all the wages are going to at least be \nenhanced because we will no longer have the downward drive in wages \nwith the undocumented. And if that individual is feeling exploited in \nsome way or being denied that or lied to, that individual will be able \nto take that same card and go to another job. That individual has to \nfind that job within a period of time, some 45 days. In other words, we \nhave drafted this legislation to take into account the exploitation \nwhich has existed in the past.\n  Under this particular provision, we will be avoiding that kind of \nexploitation. Under this provision we will be guaranteeing the \nprotection of wages for that worker and permitting those who are \nundocumented to be able to acquire a card, as well.\n  Regarding the enforcement against employers who are interested in \nexploiting those workers, we have the mechanism to make sure those \nindividuals are held accountable and prosecuted, which has never been \ndone previously. It is important.\n  Our leader is here, and I will withhold my comments. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notifies the Senator from \nMassachusetts the time is expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary status of the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 5:30 is equally divided. Your \nside has 36 minutes 19 seconds and the other side has 70 minutes 47 \nseconds.\n  At 4 o'clock the Senator from Maryland will be recognized to offer \nher amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Last summer, the Governors of Arizona and New Mexico \ndeclared states of emergency at their\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nsouthern borders. I don't think anyone in this Chamber would disagree \nthere is a crisis on our borders. There are, as indicated by the \nGovernors of the two States of Arizona and New Mexico, an emergency.\n  We would all agree we should do something about this. We all agree we \nneed to gain control of the chaos and restore order.\n  As do many Members of the Senate, I believe the approach endorsed by \na bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee represents the best \nway to address our border crisis. It combines tough, effective \nenforcement with smart reforms to the immigration laws. It strengthens \nour borders, cracks down on employers who hire illegally, and brings \nundocumented immigrants out of the shadows of America.\n  It also requires these same people who are now living in the shadows \nto learn English, to have jobs, pay taxes, make sure they are not in \ntrouble with the law. And even if they do that, they still go to the \nback of the line.\n  I strongly believe in tough and effective enforcement of our \nimmigration laws. I also believe you cannot enforce laws that are \nunenforceable. Our current laws are unenforceable. I was at the borders \njust a few days ago, the California-Mexico border. It was very close to \nthe Arizona border. There is chaos.\n  When I came into the port at San Ysidro, I had a tour of the \nfacility, and just from a few hours' work the Border Patrol agents \nshowed me what they had found that day. There was a little compact car. \nSomebody had scooped out the back of the car and built a canvas \napparatus there. It was a small area, much smaller than the trunk of a \ncar. It was very small. It was as though they had built a canvas \nbasket, and five people had piled on top of one another and were hidden \nunder that.\n  Another thing they showed us that happened just that day, within a \nmatter of hours: in a truck, which was ostensibly a contracting truck--\nin fact, it was not--they had had a storage compartment hidden under \ncement bags with people in it.\n  The narcotics they find are, of course, another situation. We are \ntalking about cargo being human beings. They showed me, as I have said, \nin a matter of hours, how difficult it is to stop people from coming. A \nmillion people come over that border every day. It is hard to \ncomprehend. There are 24 lanes of traffic coming one way from Mexico \ninto the United States--24 lanes of traffic.\n  The easy thing for all of us to say is: Get tougher, throw more money \nand more Border Patrol agents at the problem, and it will get better. \nThat is not the answer. It seems appealing, but it is simply not true.\n  As I said, I support the strong enforcement measures included in the \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee bill, which are, by the way, close to \nidentical to those included in the border security bill offered by the \nmajority leader. I strongly believe we need to have additional Border \nPatrol agents. We have to modernize our computer system. We have to do \nmany other things, most of which are included in this bill, to secure \nour border and enforce our immigration laws with respect to employers.\n  But I also believe that enforcement alone will not fix our broken \nimmigration system. To those who say we should secure our borders first \nand then consider ways to reform our immigration laws, I say the only \nway to secure our borders is to reform our immigration laws. If we want \nto create laws that are enforceable, first we have to make them \nrealistic.\n  There is widespread support for the approach the Judiciary Committee \nhas established, including the support of most labor unions, the vast \nmajority of businesses, religious groups, and immigrant community \nleaders.\n  Months ago, I held an event at the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce \nbuilding. I was stunned by the people appearing at that forum I held, \nbut it did illustrate the broad support comprehensive immigration \nreform has from different sectors of the Las Vegas community. I think \nthis is the same all over the country.\n  In addition to representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, there were \npeople there from the Nevada Restaurant Association, the Culinary \nUnion, which is a union of some 60,000 people in Las Vegas which prides \nitself in giving people who do the dirty work--people who park the \ncars, who do the janitorial work, make the beds--they pride themselves \nin these being good jobs, high-paying jobs. They have 60,000 union \nmembers.\n  In addition to that, we had representatives from hotels, including \nthe MGM/Mirage Corporation, which, by the way, has the largest hotel in \nthe world, the MGM Hotel, with 5,005 rooms in that one facility alone. \nWe also had the bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Las Vegas. They were \nall there standing with me to confirm their support for realistic \nimmigration reforms, the kinds we are now discussing in the Senate.\n  D. Taylor, the leader of the Culinary Union, the one I just spoke \nabout, local 226, said at the time it had to be an important issue to \nget representatives of the Culinary Union and the Chamber of Commerce \nin the same room talking about the same subject.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, I attended a similar event held at the \nMandalay Bay Hotel/Convention Center in Las Vegas, where leaders of the \nCulinary Union and MGM/Mirage representatives stood together again with \ndozens of immigrants who are hotel workers to highlight the importance \nof immigrants to the Las Vegas economy. The representative of the \nChamber of Commerce was an immigrant.\n  In the State of Nevada, the Culinary Union has been a strong \nsupporter of the reforms we have in this legislation before the Senate. \nThe Culinary Union, like all other unions in this country, understands \nthat when there are people working illegally in our economy, it \nundercuts the wages and working conditions of everyone else.\n  The Las Vegas business community has been supportive of our efforts \nhere in Washington to reform our immigration laws. That is an \nunderstatement. They depend on the hard work of immigrants in our \ncommunity to get the work done. In Las Vegas, we have a very low \nunemployment level. It is estimated that Las Vegas will add almost \n50,000 new hotel rooms, requiring 100,000 new workers.\n  Mr. President, the Culinary Union, like other unions in this country, \nas I said, understands the importance of people working legally. If we \nhave illegal workers in our economy, it undercuts the wages of everyone \nelse.\n  As I indicated, in Las Vegas, where we have very low unemployment, we \nexpect to add in the next 5 or 6 years another approximately 50,000 new \nhotel rooms, requiring 100,000 new workers there alone. Nevada's \nrestaurant industry is expecting an almost 4-percent gain in jobs this \nyear alone.\n  I know that businesses I have been working with on this issue comply \nwith their duties under the law and do everything they can to ensure \nthat the workers they hire are legal. But they acknowledge we need \nlegal immigrants to keep the economy expanding. I have worked closely \nwith many of the resorts in Las Vegas, the Nevada Hotel and Lodging \nAssociation, the Nevada Restaurant Association, and others, and they \nwill all tell you that reform of our laws is essential to our expanding \neconomy.\n  Immigrants help create more jobs for American workers. They help \nexpand our economy and provide labor for new businesses that will also \nemploy Americans. Immigrant consumers spend money that keeps American \nbusinesses going. Immigrants employed at companies that also employ \nAmericans help to make sure that American jobs stay in America more \nthan being outsourced to other countries where there is cheaper labor.\n  It was probably 15, 18 years ago that a book was written by a \njournalist whom I have the greatest respect for. He has been the editor \nof US News & World Report. He has had many high-level jobs in the \njournalism field. But he wrote a book called ``More Like Us.'' This was \nat the height of the Japanese economy, some saying taking over the \nworld. People were saying then in America, we have to be more like the \nJapanese if we are going to succeed economically. James Fallows is the \nman about whom I just spoke who wrote this book. And he said, no, that \nis not true. We need to be more like us. We need to continue doing what \nAmerica does best. One of the things America does that is far better \nthan Japan and most any other country is we are a nation of immigrants.\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nThese immigrants, James Fallows has pointed out in this book, come to \nthis Nation in limited numbers, and when they come here, they are \nstriving to achieve.\n  We saw, all of us who are Members of the Senate, with the people \ncoming here from Southeast Asia, from Vietnam, and other nations that \nwere torn by war--the so-called boat people--we saw the kids graduating \nfrom high school who were the valedictorians, the salutatorians, the \npeople who were doing so well in high school, and then were going into \ncollege with these grades that were better than anyone else. These were \nthe kids from Southeast Asia who were here to prove to their parents \nand their family that they could succeed in America.\n  They even considered at UCLA, one time--I read this in an article in \na weekly magazine--limiting the number of Asian students who could go \nto UCLA because people get in that school simply on the merits and \nAsians were, some thought at the time, getting more than their fair \nshare of spots. It is because immigrants do well. And James Fallows \npointed that out. We see it today more than at any other time.\n  For example, UNLV's Center for Business and Economic Research \npublished a report in 2003, concluding that non-native Hispanic \nimmigrants helped drive the Las Vegas economy, generating $15.5 billion \nin spending, contributing $829 million in State and local taxes and \nhelping to create more than 200,000 jobs.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the support of the religious community \nfor the reforms in this legislation we are discussing today. As I \nmentioned, one of the people who joined me last fall to emphasize his \nsupport for comprehensive immigration reform was the bishop of the \nDiocese of Las Vegas, Bishop Pepe. He and others in the religious \ncommunity are supporting this effort because they know that reforming \nour immigration laws is the right thing to do. It is the American thing \nto do. It is the moral thing to do.\n  We have U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are separated from \ntheir family members for years, sometimes decades, because of long \nprocessing backlogs and legal limits on family immigration. That is why \none of the things we need to do in this legislation--and we are doing \nit--is to make sure Immigration and Naturalization and the Border \nPatrol have the resources they need so people do not have to wait in \nline. Even after becoming qualified to become a citizen, in Las Vegas \nyou have to wait for years, sometimes up to 5 or 6 years, for the \npapers to be processed because they are so understaffed.\n  We have 11 million people living in the shadows of our society. Many \nof these immigrants have been here for years, have children and spouses \nwho are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. They pay taxes. They own \nproperty and are active, valuable members of our community. Virtually \nall of them came here to work. Our immigration laws, in many instances, \nforce them to go into hiding. They live in fear every day that they \nwill be deported and separated from their families and communities, \nseparated from their children who are American citizens.\n  For those people who are already here, I believe we have to provide \nan opportunity for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, \ncommit no crimes, learn English, and contribute to our economic growth, \nto earn the right to stay here--to earn the right to stay here.\n  We should encourage people to work here, and under the legislation \nthat is pending before this body, there is a time when they have to go \nback to the country from which they came. Many people want to do this, \nand used to do this before we made it so dangerous for them to go back \nand forth across the border.\n  But for people who decide they want to stay here, they should not be \nallowed to jump to the front of the line but should be allowed to earn \ntheir legal status here, I repeat, if they pay fines and penalties, \nwork steadily for years, learn English, and pass the necessary \nbackground checks.\n  As Americans, I do not think we want to forcibly uproot so many \npeople who have put down their roots in communities for the same reason \nour parents and grandparents came: to make better lives for themselves \nand their families. We need to continue, as James Fallows said, to be \n``more like us,'' what has made America great.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3217 To Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3217 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] for herself and \n     Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 3217.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To extend the termination date for the exemption of returning \n     workers from the numerical limitations for temporary workers)\n\n       On page 174, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2__. EXTENSION OF RETURNING WORKER EXEMPTION.\n\n       Section 402(b)(1) of the Save Our Small and Seasonal \n     Businesses Act of 2005 (title IV of division B of Public Law \n     109-13; 8 U.S.C. 1184 note) is amended by striking ``2006'' \n     and inserting ``2009''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I do rise, along with my very \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner--we are \nbipartisan cosponsors--to offer an amendment that is much needed by \nsmall and seasonal businesses across the Nation.\n  Our amendment is needed.\n  We believe that it is supported by the Judiciary Committee. But most \nof all, the American people will agree that this amendment is much \nneeded.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. What does it do? First, it protects \nour borders by rewarding immigrants and employers who play by the \nrules, workers who come here on a seasonal basis but return to their \nfamilies when they are finished with their job and go back home. These \nworkers honor their legal commitment to come to work under legally \nsupervised jobs and then they return home. No. 2, it does protect \nAmerican workers by requiring that all employers recruit American \nworkers before they hire these immigrants, and it makes sure that small \nbusiness will be able to pay their U.S. workers 12 months out of the \nyear. No. 3, it protects American jobs by keeping small and seasonal \nbusiness open for business. It guarantees the labor supply that small \nbusinesses need during peak seasons is available, when they can't find \nAmericans to take their jobs.\n  So No. 1, it protects our borders by allowing only those in this \ncountry who intend to go back home. It supports legal immigration. It \nis consistent with supporting a legal framework; it only allows workers \nto come into this country if they have played by the rules. And you can \nonly come in if you can prove you are going to work for a good-guy \nAmerican employer who has tried to recruit American workers. Also it \ndoes not raise the cap on seasonal workers. My amendment would allow \nemployers to hire the workers who have played by the rules and returned \nhome after the work is done, it allows these workers to be hired for \nanother 3 years and not count against the annual cap of 66,000. It does \nnot raise the annual cap of 66,000.\n  My amendment provides a helping hand to business by letting them \napply for workers they have already trained and know will come back \nagain year after year but return home year after year. It only applies \nto those who have already successfully participated in the H-2B visa \nprogram. They have received a visa and returned home to their families \nafter their employment with a U.S. company.\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\n  This is not a new H-2B. It is essentially a 3-year exemption to allow \nthose who have come back in and returned home to come back again, most \noften to the same employer like employers in my State of Maryland who \nwork in the seafood industry. The H-2B program has kept small and \nseasonal business doors open when they face seasonal worker shortages \nthat many coastal and resort States have been dealing with over years.\n  Small businesses across this country count on the H-2B program to \nkeep their business afloat. When they cannot find local American \nworkers to fill their seasonal needs, they then turn to the H-2B. \nWithout being able to get the seasonal workers they need, these \nbusinesses would often go under. These businesses do try to hire \nAmerican workers. Under the law, they must try to hire American \nworkers. They would love to hire American workers. They have to \ndemonstrate that they vigorously tried to recruit Americans. They have \nto advertise, give American workers a chance to apply. Their businesses \nhave to prove to the Department of Labor that there are no Americans \navailable for this work. Only then are they allowed to fill their \nvacancies with seasonal workers.\n  The workers these businesses bring in participate in the H-2B year \nafter year, often working at the same companies--that has been the \nexperience of the Maryland seafood industry about which I will talk \nlater. Yet they cannot and do not stay in the United States. They \nreturn to their home countries and to their families. Then what \nhappens? The U.S. employer must go through the whole process again the \nnext year to get them back. It means an employer again has to prove \nthey can't get U.S. workers and that they are willing to pay the \nprevailing wage for that industry.\n  Yet, this is not just a Maryland issue. It is not even a coastal \nissue, though we coastal Senators are hit pretty big time. But it is an \nissue that affects everyone--ski resorts out West and in the Northeast, \nquarries in Colorado, shrimpers in Texas and Louisiana, landscapers \nwhose businesses are the busiest in spring and summer. Why is it \nimportant to Maryland? Being able to hire seasonal workers for our crab \nindustry has been a way of life down on the eastern shore for more than \n100 years. We have a lot of summer seasonal businesses in Maryland, on \nthe eastern shore, in Ocean City and working on the Chesapeake Bay. \nMany of our businesses use the program year after year. First they hire \nall of the American workers they can, but they need additional help to \nmeet seasonal demands. Without this help, they would be forced to limit \nservices, lay off permanent U.S. workers or even worse close their \ndoors.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. One is a business called J. M. \nClayton. What they do is a way of life. It was started over 100 years \nago. It is now run by the great-grandson of the founder J. M. Clayton. \nThey work the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. They supply crabs, \ncrabmeat, and other seafood to restaurants and markets and wholesalers \nall over this country. It is the oldest working crab processing plant \nin the world. By employing 65 H-2B workers, they can retain 30 full-\ntime American workers all year long.\n  It is not just the seafood companies that have a long history. It is \nalso the S.E.W. Friel cannery which began its business over 100 years \nago. It is the last corn cannery left out of 300 on the shore. Ten \nyears ago they couldn't find local workers. They turned to the H-2B. \nSince then, many workers come each season and then go home year after \nyear. They have helped this country maintain its American workforce and \npaved the way for local workers to return to the cannery. There are now \n190 seasonal workers, but there are 75 people working in the cannery \nfull time, and an additional 70 farmers and additional suppliers.\n\n  This summer I went over to the shore, after we had a successful \nvictory last year giving this legislation a temporary exemption, to \nmeet with the Latino women. When I met with these women, I asked them: \nWhy do you come and what does this program mean to you? They told me \nthat by coming year after year--they know it is hard work--they can \nprovide for their families. They know that when they come in April, \nthey will be here until late September when our crab pots are put away \nand we pack up for another year. During the summer, they can earn \nmoney. They earn more money in one summer here than they can earn in 5 \nyears in Mexico. And the money they take back year after year has \nenabled them to build a home, often dig wells in their own native \nvillage, even pool some of their money to build a community center. \nThey come often as a family and often as a village to say: Are we going \nto the shore? We know Clayton. We know Phillips. They know where they \nare going to live. There are buses that take them to church every \nSunday. They know where they are going to shop. They have access to \ntranslators. And in some places, they are actually being trained by the \nseafood industry to learn English so they can move up to some other \npositions.\n  Then they take this money, anywhere from 15, 20, $30,000--mostly 20--\nand they go back to primarily Mexico. They go back where their husbands \nand children have been waiting. It is what often keeps the family \ngoing. What they earn will pay to build that school, build those homes, \nclean up that village and is putting the men to work so the men have \njobs, the men have dignity. They are not crossing the border illegally. \nThey are building a life in their village. They want to be Mexican \ncitizens, but they know they are here to help. First it is one sister \nand then the following sister who come to the Eastern Shore for a few \nmonths a year to make money so they can take care of their families and \ncommunities back home.\n  This is why this program works. The people who come are part of a \nfamily, part of a community in Mexico. They want to build a life in \nMexico, but they can do it by helping us here.\n  Some might ask: Why do we need this extension? The chairman has \nincluded a temporary guest worker program in his bill. We need to make \nsure we do not forget the needs of small and seasonal businesses in \nthis immigrant debate. I welcome the guest worker program that is \nbefore the Senate. Once the program is up and running, it will help the \nH-2B program. But right now we need to make sure there is no \ninterruption so that companies can meet their hiring needs when \nAmerican workers don't apply for these jobs, when the cap has already \nbeen reached. The first half of the cap of 33,000 was reached less than \n3 months after employers could begin applying.\n  What we want to do, again, is protect our borders, look out for \nAmerican jobs. And for those who want to come to this country and \nreturn home, follow the rules and follow the law, this amendment will \nprovide the opportunity to do so. My amendment does all of this. Each \nMember of the Senate who has heard from their constituents will know \nwhat I am talking about. This will extend the H-2B waiver for 3 years.\n  It is a sound amendment. This is why it is strongly bipartisan. I \nurge at the appropriate time that the Senate adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to start my participation here by \ncongratulating my distinguished colleague from Maryland and her senior \nSenator, Mr. Sarbanes. It has been a great pleasure to work with both \nof them on this program through the years. I wonder if I might ask the \nprincipal sponsor of this amendment, Senator Mikulski, a question.\n  In this turbulent era of immigration and the search for solutions, \nthis program could be described as a model program, one that has worked \nas it was intended, one that serves the small business community as it \nwas intended, and welcomes within our borders these individuals, as my \ncolleague says, largely from south of the border, Mexico, in a way that \ndoesn't conjure up any fear or suspicion or any resentment in the \ncommunities when they come to do their work.\n  Would my colleague concur in my observation that this is a model \nprogram?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My good friend and cosponsor from Virginia is \nabsolutely right. This is a model program. It does not stir up \nresentment because of three reasons. No. 1, it does protect our \nborders. No. 2, the local communities are enthusiastic about it because \nit has kept businesses open on our mutual\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\neastern shore, the Chesapeake Bay, that have been running for over 100 \nyears. The ladies go back home and then return again under appropriate \nlegal authority.\n  It is a model program. If all immigration policy worked this well, we \nwouldn't be in such turbulent times.\n  Mr. WARNER. A further point of colloquy: Last time you and I joined \nwith Senator Sarbanes and others, Senator Allen on my side of the \naisle, and just in the nick of time, we were able to get through that \nextension. It received a modest amount of publicity\n  I read the articles and trade interests. But I cannot recall anyone \ncontacting my office who was out right opposed to the program. Does the \nSenator know of anyone who has stood up and said it has taken away work \nand any of that sort of confusion and criticism we are experiencing \ntoday in the larger measures of the immigration problems?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia, when \nI was contacted, people didn't understand the program. When I clarified \nfor them that this was not an amnesty program, that this was a guest \nworker program--and guest was the way they were treated; and like a \nguest, they went home when they were supposed to--and that it actually \nkept American jobs in this country, particularly the doors of business \nopen, like the J.M. Clayton Company, they were relieved to hear about \nit. They were glad we had a Government program on immigration that \nactually worked. They saluted the ladies for their hard work and said: \nWe are glad they obeyed the law, and all turbulence was settled.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted that my colleague had \nexperiences similar to mine.\n  I bring up one single aspect. I happen to be one who really enjoys \ncrabmeat. I know that when so many of our crab houses came to us, they \nexplained that if we lose what little market we have today, we are \ngone, because Venezuela has entered the market--I even saw crabmeat in \nthe market this week, and I have been constantly studying it ever since \nI have been involved in this issue. But all of the crabmeat is coming \nfrom way beyond our shores. That is understandable now because the bay, \nwhich is the principal source of our crabmeat, is not quite ready for \nthe harvesting. I would hate to see the famous blue crab disappear from \nour tables. It was about to disappear had we not gotten this program \nthrough last time; am I not correct on that?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is right. We have to fight for our market \nshare because the competition is abroad and, quite frankly, they don't \nmeet the quality standard. This program is not only for the crabs, but \njust think, for the people who are actually picking the crabs, they are \nputting people to work--the canning company, marketing, sales, the \ntrucking industry, watermen, the people who run the marinas. This \ncovers so many jobs on the Eastern Shore. This handful of seasonal \nworkers helps leverage hundreds and hundreds of jobs on our shore.\n  We could talk to Senator Stevens of Alaska. They have a business that \nharvests salmon roe, and their principal market is to the Japanese. The \nJapanese have to come in to inspect that roe to see if it can be \nexported. Nineteen Japanese come in every year under this program and \nthen return home, primarily as inspectors. Because those 19 come, \nAlaska has a booming industry in exporting salmon roe. That is how this \nprogram works. Just a handful of guest workers leverages all this.\n  Mr. President, I support Amendment No. 3217, the Save Our Small and \nSeasonal Businesses Act of 2006, which would ensure that certain \nemployers would continue to legally obtain the seasonal workers they \ndesperately need. I am pleased to work with Senator Mikulski as a \ncosponsor on the amendment, and I am joined by Senator Allen.\n  Late in 2005, the Senate voted overwhelmingly, 94 to 6, to include \nour Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2005 as an amendment \nto the defense supplemental bill. This legislation, which was \neventually signed into law by President Bush, helped to temporarily \nsolve a serious problem facing small businesses, especially seafood \noperations in Virginia, as well as others across the Nation.\n  For each of the 2 years prior to our measure being signed into law, \nthe statutory cap on H-2B visas was reached soon after the fiscal years \nbegan. In 2004, the cap was reached on March 20, and in 2005 the cap \nwas reached on January 3.\n  As a result, many businesses, mostly summer employers, were unable to \nobtain the temporary workers they needed because the cap was filled \nprior to the day they could even apply for the visas. Consequently, \nthese businesses sustained significant economic losses.\n  The fix that Congress provided in 2005 exempted from the 66,000 \nstatutory cap workers who had worked under the H-2B visa program in \nprior years and who had adhered to the rules by returning to their home \ncountry when their visas expired. However, this legislation was only \nfor 2 years.\n  As a result, on October 1, 2006, when the law expires, these \nemployers and workers will face the same problem unless we adopt the \namendment before us today.\n  In order to avoid this problem, our amendment simply extends the \nsuccessful H-2B visa exemption to ensure the program will not revert to \nits troubled, original form while work continues on a permanent \nsolution. This will allow our small and seasonal companies an \nopportunity to remain open for business until a new permanent fix \nwithin comprehensive immigration reform can be passed into law and \nfully implemented. Without these modifications, these employers will \nstruggle to find the necessary employees to keep their businesses \nrunning.\n  Before I close, I want to be clear about the purpose of this \namendment. There has been much said about Senator Specter's amendment \nand what it will or will not do. Regardless, his amendment will create \na new H-2C temporary worker visa. In the long run, this new work visa \nwill help ease the pressure on the H-2B visa program that exists today.\n  However, it is now April, and the current H-2B exemption expires in \nOctober, only a few months from now. Even if Congress were to pass an \nimmigration bill and have it signed into law before then, it will take \nmany, many months if not years before any new visa programs can be \nready to accept applications. This is an uncertainty that small \nbusinesses cannot afford.\n  Many employers across America, such as seafood processors, \nlandscapers, resorts, pool companies, carnivals, and timber companies, \nrely upon the H-2B program. The seafood industry in Virginia, in \nparticular, is dependent on this program to keep their business \nrunning. This industry has been built on decades of earned respect for \ntheir incomparable products. They represent traditions that have been \nin place for hundreds of years. These traditions have proven more \nsuccessful than attempts to modernize or automate the process. Without \naccess to the H-2B visa program, this traditional respect across the \nworld will be lost, never to be regained.\n  The current system in place since 2005 has allowed these small and \nseasonal businesses opportunity to hire a legal workforce to supplement \nand maintain the full-time domestic workers they already employ. If we \nwant these employers to stay in business, the current H-2B exemption \nmust be extended until a permanent solution or a new visa program can \nbe implemented. I strongly support this amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join 5 with me to help these small and \nseasonal businesses by passing this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Sarbanes, an original \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nminority side.\n  The senior Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Mikulski, and I commend her \nonce again for undertaking this initiative. In fact, as indicated in \nthe colloquy with Senator Warner, this amendment is met with general \napprobation, and I believe it is a tribute to my colleague that she \nworked out a very skillful legislative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\n  This is a very measured and sensible solution to a real problem \nconfronting small businesses struggling to find enough employees to \noperate during seasonal spikes in their workload. Many small businesses \nin Maryland and, indeed, around the country have seasonal increases in \nwork. They often need a large number of workers for a portion of the \nyear but do not retain these workers throughout the year. Therefore, \ntemporary workers become essential to the vitality of these businesses.\n  In Maryland, the seasonal issue affects numerous industries, \nincluding, first and foremost, the seafood industry but also the \nhospitality, pool and construction industries. Seafood processors, for \nexample, are busy in the summer and early fall but have little or no \nwork in the winter. All of these businesses start out by trying to hire \ncollege students and local residents as extra workers to cover this \nneed, but they often find themselves shortstaffed. That has been the \nstandard experience, and this program is designed to address that--the \ntemporary employees come from abroad to work for a few months and then \nreturn home.\n  As an essential part of this program, the H-2B program, this \namendment my colleague offers today would simply extend for 3 years one \nof the very successful modifications to the H-2B program that was \nadopted by the Senate by a vote of 94 to 6 a year ago this month. Those \nmodifications left the H-2B framework intact. They provided a fair and \nequitable means of distributing a scarce number of visas.\n  It is important--and I wish to underscore this to my colleagues--to \nnote that employers must demonstrate that they have tried and failed to \nfind available, qualified U.S. citizens to fill seasonal jobs before \nthey can file an H-2B application.\n  The amendment approved last year, which is carried forward by this \nextension, had three important aspects:\n  First, it ensured that summer employers were not disadvantaged by \nallowing no more than 33,000--or no more than half--of the 66,000 H-\n2B--visas to be allocated in the first half of the year.\n  Second, temporary workers who have lawfully participated in the H-2B \nprogram in the previous 3 years were exempted from the annual numerical \ncap.\n  Third, the modification required the employer to pay a fraud \nprevention and detection fee and increased sanctions for fraud.\n  Senator Mikulski is seeking to carry these provisions forward. These \nvisas are really for people who respect our laws and who work hard to \nprovide services that benefit our economy and then return home to their \nfamilies at the end of the season. All of that is an essential part of \nthe program.\n  This extension is a necessary adjustment for small and seasonal \nbusinesses that rely on temporary workers. We must recognize that the \nsuccess of one small business impacts another. It has a ripple effect \nthrough the economy and helps to maintain the vitality not only of our \nState's economy but of the Nation's economy.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the larger issues involved in immigration \nreform, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I again commend \nmy colleague, Senator Mikulski, for coming forward with this amendment \nto address an important issue on which the Senate has already indicated \nits approval in past considerations. This is a very important amendment \nfor our small businesses that require temporary seasonal workers. This \nis a very skillful legislative solution to a problem. I commend my \ncolleague for bringing it forth, and I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I note that Senator Alexander is here.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How many minutes would the Senator like--2 or 3 \nminutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, is the Senator from Tennessee going to \nspeak on this issue?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Not on this but on another matter. If the Senator \nneeds more than a minute, I am glad to yield some of our time to the \nSenator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wish 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Maryland \nis recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to add as cosponsors Senators \nWarner, Gregg, Allen, Sarbanes, Sununu, Thomas, Stevens, Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Levin, Snowe, Jeffords, Thune, Collins, Kennedy, and Leahy.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if there will be any more who wish to \nspeak on the minority side. Every now and then, we conform in a \nbipartisan amendment. I think the amendment speaks of its merits. It \nmeets a need for our jobs in this country. It solves a problem in a \npractical way. It doesn't exacerbate any of the dark side of \nimmigration. I hope at the appropriate time my colleagues will adopt \nthis amendment.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter, and the committee for the excellent bill they brought out. \nThis in no way dilutes, diverts, or detours any aspect of their bill. \nThree cheers to the Senate for having an immigration bill that is in no \nway as punitive and tart and prickly as the House bill.\n  I think the Senate will proceed in a rational way. We need to protect \nour borders, protect American jobs. I believe there are sensible \nsolutions for doing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will answer a \nquestion. We put in this bill--and Senator Mikulski offered a sense of \nthis amendment last year and it won--to extend for 1 year these \nprovisions. I thought in the bill that came out of committee we were \ndealing with it when we added 400,000 per year--more than doubling the \nnumber who would come in to work--who could be covered, I think, by \nthis category. My question is, has the Senator been able to ascertain \nwhether this would be in addition to the 400,000 who would be approved \nunder the Judiciary Committee mark?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, the answer is that this amendment will be \nthe bridge until the Judiciary Committee legislation is actually up and \nrunning. The H-2B employers will use the H-2C visas you all created \nonce the program is up and running. But it will not be up and running \nfor October of this year, if, in fact, we get a bill. We don't know if \nwe will get a bill. If we do get a bill--you know how sluggish that \nbureaucracy is in writing rules and regulations--this is a safety net.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In effect, it would not continue as an addition on top \nof the expanded immigration provisions in the committee mark?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Mikulski-Warner framework goes away when this bill \nis put into effect.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kyl and Senator \nCornyn are coming to the Chamber to talk. I believe they have just \narrived. I defer to Senator Cornyn and to Senator Kyl. We will be \nvoting tonight on an amendment about helping prospective citizens \nbecome Americans, those who are legally here. I would like to talk a \nfew minutes about that before 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 60 minutes remaining on the majority \nside for debate prior to two votes under the previous order at 5:30 \np.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--as far as I am \nfloor manager on this side and a cosponsor of this amendment--that I \nmay proceed for 3 minutes with the additional time not taken from the \nmajority side.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont 3 of our minutes so he can make his \nremarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will do that, that will work.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If it is all right with the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I certainly don't begrudge the Senator \nfrom Vermont the time. I just hope it won't cut into our time and that \nwe will add time to both sides so it will be even, if I understood the \nrequest.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have all the time remaining between now and 5:30 \np.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 59 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Tennessee and Texas \nfor their courtesy.\n  I commend the Senator from Maryland. I enthusiastically--\nenthusiastically--cosponsor this amendment. It is going to bring relief \nto employers by easing the shortfall of seasonal workers. I know it is \ndesperately needed in Vermont.\n  Last May we passed, and the President signed into law, assistance for \nsmall and seasonal businesses by enacting a special exemption. The \namendment passed last May, offered by Senator Mikulski, cosponsored by \nmyself, Senator Jeffords, and others, created an exemption to the cap \nfor seasonal workers.\n  The Vermont ski, hotel, and conference industries rely on hiring \nforeign workers when they cannot find Americans to fill seasonal jobs. \nOver the past several years, the demand for these workers across the \ncountry has far exceeded the caps and has led to a severe shortage of \nworkers which threatened the hospitality industry which is such an \nimportant part of Vermont's economy.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment will simply extend the sunset date and \ngive businesses in Vermont, Maryland, and other States the resources \nthey need to compete and succeed. We need this relief in Vermont. The \nbroad range of bipartisan support for this amendment shows how badly it \nis needed.\n  I thank the Senator for her persistent efforts. I thank my good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle for the courtesy they showed a \nlate arrival.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the majority has the remaining time \nuntil 5:30, at which time there will be two votes, one on Senator \nBingaman's amendment and one on the Alexander amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be allowed \nthe next 15 minutes, followed by Senator Kyl, after which I be allowed \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was on the floor last Friday describing \nwhat I believed to be a remarkable resemblance between the provisions \nthat deal with the 12 million individuals who are currently in the \nUnited States in violation of our immigration laws and the amnesty that \nwas granted in 1986 which was supposed to be the amnesty to end all \namnesties. In other words, if we would just agree that the 3 million or \nso people who entered our country without legal authorization would be \ngiven amnesty, we would then have worksite verification and sanctions \nagainst employers who hired people in violation of the law, and this \nproblem would go away.\n  As I pointed out then, the amnesty that was granted in 1986--everyone \nnow acknowledges it was an amnesty. And the second thing I think \neveryone will nearly universally acknowledge is that amnesty was a \ncomplete and total failure. I, for one--and I believe there are others \nin this body--want to make sure we don't make the same mistake twice, \nand when we ask the American people to have confidence in us, in what \nwe are trying to do to solve a very real problem, they don't take the \nattitude ``fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.'' \nThey don't want to believe, nor should they be asked to believe, that \nwe are engaged in a sleight of hand or a trick.\n  So I believe it is very important that our colleagues focus not only \non the amnesty of 1986, but to compare it with the proposal in the \ncommittee product which bears remarkable resemblance.\n  One of the areas where it does not resemble the 1986 amnesty is that \nthe 1986 amnesty would bar felons and people who have committed at \nleast three misdemeanors. As Senator Kyl and I pointed out by way of \nour amendment, we seek to add that requirement back in so that felons \nand people who committed at least three misdemeanors would not be given \nan amnesty under the committee proposal.\n  But in this bill--this enormously complex and important bill--details \nmatter. Another example is I reviewed the committee bill over the \nweekend, and I have some concern that the bill text does not reflect \nhow the bill is actually being described by its proponents.\n  For example, section 602 of the bill states that illegal aliens must \ncomply with the employment requirements. Yet there are no specific \nrequirements for them to meet. Future temporary workers must be \ncontinuously employed, but no such requirement exists for illegal \naliens. The alien could potentially be employed for one day and still \nend up qualifying for a green card and then put on a path to \ncitizenship.\n  I urge my colleagues to look very carefully at this bill and to study \nit because here we found at least two examples of where the bill does \nnot meet the description offered by its proponents; and, No. 2, that \nthose who say that what this bill does for those who are currently here \nin violation of our immigration laws is not an amnesty, we find that it \nbears remarkable resemblance to what everyone acknowledged to be an \namnesty in 1986 and what everyone pretty much universally acknowledges \nwas a complete and total failure.\n  Illegal immigration has had a dramatic effect on many aspects of our \nsociety. It affects our schools, hospitals, and prisons. Dr. Donald \nHuddle, a Rice University economics professor, published a systematic \nanalysis of those costs as of 1996 and concluded the estimated net cost \nto the American taxpayer was about $20 billion each year.\n  The population in our country that has stayed here in violation of \nour immigration laws has doubled since that study was done. So the \nfinancial impact picked up not by the Federal Government but by local \nschool districts and local hospital districts and State and other local \ngovernments may be as high as $40 billion to $50 billion.\n  Last week, we heard a lot of debate about whether immigration reform \nneeds to address the 12 million aliens already here who have come here \nor stayed here in violation of our laws and to create a new visa \ncategory that would allow future workers to enter our country legally.\n  As I said then, and I will say again now, I support comprehensive \nimmigration reform and I believe our national security requires us to \nknow who is in our country and what their intentions are once here. But \nI fear that a critical distinction in the debate is being glossed over, \nand that is whether work visas should be truly temporary or whether we \nshould allow all migrant workers to remain here permanently.\n  First, let me say that there is obviously an important role for \npermanent immigrants, and I support legal immigration. I noted, as so \nmany others have, that we are a nation of immigrants, and we are the \nbetter for it. I support, for example, moderate increases in legal \npermanent immigration, but I don't support a so-called temporary worker \nprogram which is neither temporary nor is it a worker program, but it \nis rather an alternative path to legal permanent residency and \ncitizenship.\n  More than 23 million immigrants have been issued green cards since \n1973, an average of about three-quarters of a million new green card \nholders each year. But there is also a role for temporary workers in \naddition to those people who want to immigrate here permanently. I feel \nstrongly that we ought to distinguish between legal immigration, \nillegal immigration, and we ought to distinguish between people who \nwant to come here temporarily and work but not give up their identity \nor their citizenship with their country of origin and those who want to \nbe Americans.\n\n  For those who are permanently going to be immigrating to the United \nStates, I sincerely want all of them to become Americans, and I joined \nin cosponsoring the amendment with the\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nSenator from Tennessee to help them do that, so they can be \nassimilated, they can learn English, they can gain access to the kind \nof education that will allow them to become not only legal immigrants, \nbut to become permanently assimilated into our society and productive \ncitizens. I think we owe that to them and we owe that to ourselves.\n  But there is also a role for those who want to come here for a time \nand work and then return to their country of origin, people who have no \nintention of giving up their ties with their country or their culture \nor their family but who want to come and work for a time and then \nreturn with the savings and skills they acquired working in the United \nStates.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about that from sectors in the \neconomy saying they depend on the workers who come from other countries \nbut that they could work with a temporary worker program to satisfy \nthose needs.\n  There are some who criticize saying that a true temporary worker \nprogram is futile and unworkable. They argue that temporary workers \nwill never leave and so we must allow all of them to remain here \npermanently.\n  I strongly reject what I would interpret as an open borders argument. \nFirst, I think it is ridiculous for anyone to argue that the United \nStates neither has the ability nor the will to enforce its immigration \nlaws. Should we not put any limit on how long a visitor can stay in the \nUnited States, how long a student can remain in the United States? That \nargument is a disservice to the hundreds of millions of tourists, \nexecutives, workers, and students who do comply with our immigration \nlaws.\n  The United States admits 500 million visitors a year, and only a \nfraction of a percentage makes the affirmative decision to violate our \nlaws and to stay here.\n  I also believe that effective worksite enforcement will allow workers \nto work during the term of their visa but then to return once their \nvisa expires. The 1986 amnesty promised that illegal workers would not \nbe able to find work, but here we are today with 5 percent of our \nworkforce using false documents. I will, therefore, not support any \nreform proposal unless I am confident that illegal workers will not be \nable to find employment in the United States but for legal channels.\n  If we actually believe we cannot enforce the law, if temporary \ndoesn't mean temporary, if there is no distinction between legal and \nillegal, we are essentially raising a white flag and saying we will not \nenforce our own laws. I cannot imagine this great institution taking \nthat position either affirmatively, expressly, or tacitly.\n  I also reject the argument that a true temporary worker visa is \ninconsistent with the natural migration patterns of workers. The \nAmerican Lawyers Association states that before 1986, the average \nlength of stay in the United States was only 1.7 years. Since 1986, the \namnesty that was created in that year, the length of stay has increased \nto 3.5 years, up from 1.7 The bottom line is most workers do not want \nto stay for 6 years, much less permanently.\n\n  Douglas Massey, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, argues \nthat the 1986 amnesty:\n\n       Succeeded in transforming a seasonal flow of temporary \n     workers into a more permanent population of settled legal \n     immigrants.\n\n  He wrote that, prior to 1986:\n\n       Most immigrants sought to work abroad temporarily in order \n     to mitigate and manage risks and acquire capital for a \n     specific goal or purpose. By sending one family member abroad \n     for a limited period of foreign labor, households could \n     diversify their sources of income and accumulate savings from \n     the United States earnings. In both cases, the fundamental \n     objective was to return to their country of origin--in this \n     case, he says: ``Mexico.''\n\n  He argues--and I agree--that the 1986 amnesty actually resulted in a \ndecrease in circular migration.\n  The committee amendment on the floor would do exactly the same thing. \nIt would destroy the incentive for circular migration and the benefits \nthat would accrue--not just to the United States but to the country of \norigin, to whence the immigrant would return with the savings and \nskills they have acquired here.\n  In a survey by the Pew Hispanic Center of Mexicans Abroad, they \nsupport the argument that migrant workers would participate in a true \ntemporary worker program. Indeed, 71 percent of those surveyed, which \nwere 5,000 applicants for the matriculator consular card in the United \nStates, 71 percent said they would participate in a temporary worker \nprogram, even if they knew that at the end of the period of their \nvisas, they would have to return to their country of origin.\n  Finally, our country is enjoying a strong period of economic growth. \nThe economy created almost a quarter of a million jobs in February and \nhas created 2.1 million jobs over the past 12 months--almost 5 million \nnew jobs since August 2003. The unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, lower \nthan the average of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. We may not \nalways enjoy a strong economy, and a true temporary worker program \nallows our visa policy to adapt to the peaks and valleys of our \neconomic needs.\n  I supported Senator Kyl's amendment in the committee that would limit \nthe number of temporary worker visas if unemployment reaches certain \nlevels. But that amendment means nothing if all workers are on green \ncards or on a path to legal permanent residency or citizenship.\n  Everyone, it seems, describes their proposal as a guest worker or \ntemporary worker program. But not all temporary worker programs--or at \nleast those sold under the guise of a temporary worker program--are, in \nfact, temporary. It is important, both to our economy and to American \nnative-born workers who compete with this new workforce, that we \nmodulate and moderate the flow of workers into our country at a time \nwhen our economy can sustain them and not take jobs away from people \nwho are born here or who are legal immigrants. It is also critical that \nwe recognize the importance of the restoration of these circular \nmigration patterns which, in fact, benefit countries such as Mexico and \nin Central America because they are literally being hollowed out: \nPeople permanently leaving those countries, making it difficult for \nthem to generate jobs and grow their economy, so that people can stay \nhome if they wish and not have to leave their family and their culture \nand their country in order to come to the United States to sustain \nthemselves and their families.\n  My point is our colleagues and those in the news media and the \nAmerican people listening should listen carefully to not only what \npeople call their different sort of worker programs or visas but \nactually how they function, and insist that if colleagues are going to \ncall a guest worker program a temporary worker program, that it is, in \nfact, temporary; and that if it is a guest program, that it not be \nsomeone who is going to permanently move in with us. Guests, in fact, \nultimately are supposed to return and not stay.\n  I realize time is short for this portion of the debate, but I did \nwant to make those points. I know there are other colleagues on the \nfloor who wish to speak, and I will return and make additional comments \non other aspects of this bill at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona, who has the \nnext 15 minutes, has generously agreed to allow the Senator from \nAlabama to have up to 3 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the \nagreement be modified so the Senator from Alabama has 3 minutes, \nSenator Kyl has 15 minutes, and then I have 15 minutes after Senator \nKyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a very fine hearing this morning. \nI think five Federal judges, and the Department of Justice represented, \nand a professor, to deal with a problem in our immigration system. \nSenator Cornyn has rightly said a bill is a bill is a bill, but what \ndoes it say? In Chairman Specter's mark, he dealt with a crisis in \nappeals in immigration. During the course of our committee markup, an \namendment was offered that said that wasn't good and whatever, and we \nstruck that reform. So the bill that would be the Judiciary markup bill \non the floor does not have any action whatsoever to deal with this \nproblem.\n\n  Since 2001, we have had a 601-percent increase in appeals, Bureau of \nAppeals, immigration appeals cases. Six times they have increased since \nthe year 2000.\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nIt now takes, on average, 27 months for one of those cases to be \nhandled because of the backlog.\n  Judge Bea of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who has one of the \nbiggest backlogs in that circuit, said this this morning:\n\n       Second, as petitioners and attorneys see appeals piling up \n     in the circuit courts, they realize their appeals will be \n     delayed. During the period of delay, events may change the \n     alien's chances of staying in the country. Those changes may \n     be personal, such as a marriage to a U.S. citizen or the \n     birth of a child, or any number of other conditions that \n     might affect their removability. Or those changes may be \n     political, such as change in country conditions in the \n     alien's home country, or legislative and administrative, such \n     as immigration reform in the country, giving the alien new \n     hopes to remain here. Even if the appeal lacks all merit, the \n     backlog of cases in the circuit court provides an incentive \n     to appeal by almost guaranteeing a delay in deportation, now \n     on an average of 27 months.\n\n  What I would say to my colleagues is, If we are going to do \nsomething--and we should--we have to confront the problem of those who \nare here illegally and handle that in a humane and fair and decent way. \nBut if the promise at the same time is we are going to fix the system \nthat is broken today--Senator Harry Reid said he was down on the border \nand he said it was chaos and the laws are unenforceable. These are some \nof the examples of it. Senator Specter had language in to fix it. The \nlanguage was stripped out. There is nothing in this bill before us that \nwould deal with this problem. It is an example of some of the gaping \nholes that remain in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn and I have introduced \nlegislation that is comprehensive in nature, and I wish to briefly \ndescribe some of the key provisions of that legislation because I \nbelieve we will have an opportunity to vote on it as an amendment to \nthe pending bill at some point during our procedure.\n  In significant part, the bill before us embodies many of the \nprovisions of our legislation that deal with border security. I want to \nemphasize at the beginning that almost all of us agree the first step \nwe have to take in dealing with comprehensive immigration reform is \nsecuring the border. It is going to take time to get that done. It is \ngoing to take money and it is going to take will. The provisions of our \nbill provide a significant sum of money for more Border Patrol agents, \nmore fencing--it is not a wall, but it does provide some additional \nfencing--and it provides for high technology to help with the border \nsecurity, including unmanned aerial vehicles, sensors, cameras, and \nthings of that sort.\n  It also requires that the Department of Homeland Security acquire \nmore detention spaces so that people who come here from countries other \nthan Mexico and, therefore, can't just be returned to the border, will \nactually be detained pending their removal to their own country. Today, \nif you are an illegal immigrant from China, for example, we can't take \nyou down to the border with Mexico and drop you off there; we have to \nsend you back to China. This costs a lot of money. It takes a long \ntime. In fact, the Chinese Government is very slow to take Chinese \ncitizens back. There are now some 39,000 Chinese citizens whom we \napprehended who came here illegally, but who have not been returned to \nChina. We don't have the detention space for all of them, so they are \nreleased on their own recognizance. Do you have any idea how many of \nthem show up when it is time for them to go? The smart ones don't show \nup, obviously. So we need more detention space, and that is part of our \nlegislation. The key point is that we provide the funding and the \nauthorization necessary to get a handle on controlling the border and \nto deal with the apprehensions that occur as a result of that.\n  The next thing we do is to provide for more internal enforcement, and \nfor all of the different parts of the Department of Homeland Security \nthat have a responsibility for enforcing the law in the interior. \nToday, an illegal immigrant knows if you get about 60 miles north of \nthe border, you are literally home free in your new home because we \ndon't have the law enforcement officials to do anything about it. That \nis especially difficult at the employment site. As you know, we have \nlaws against hiring illegal immigrants, but they are not enforced. I \nthink there were something like three actions brought last year against \nhowever many million employers we have in this country. The bottom line \nis we need an enforcement mechanism to ensure that whoever is entitled \nto be employed here, the employer can verify their eligibility, that it \nis easy to do, and that it is foolproof.\n\n  So another part of our legislation is to provide a mechanism whereby \nit is the Government, not the employer, that decides who is eligible to \nbe employed. Anybody with forged documents today can walk in to an \nemployer and be hired, and the employer can't look behind those \ndocuments and see whether it is a forgery. That burden should be on the \nGovernment, particularly since the simplest way to verify eligibility \nis with a good Social Security number, which our bill provides for. The \nSocial Security database today is, frankly, a mess. It needs to be \ncleaned up. It can be cleaned up so you don't have 10 different people \nall using the same phony number. In fact, we have over 100,000 people \ntoday using the number 000-00-0000. It doesn't take a real bright \nperson to figure out there is something wrong with that situation.\n  So the database can be cleaned up and then the employer can simply by \nlaw--and this is what the Cornyn-Kyl bill requires--type in the number \nthat has been given to the respective employee and determine \nelectronically whether that is a valid number. If the electronic \nmessage comes back that it is not a valid number, then don't hire the \nperson or you are going to be in big trouble under our bill. But if it \ncomes back and says it is a valid number, then you only have one thing \nto do, and that is match the number with the individual standing before \nyou. That can be done by a couple of mechanisms: with a driver's \nlicense, and--depending upon what gets written into the bill--with the \ndate of birth and place-of-birth verification information as well. So \nyou are verifying the employee's eligibility under the law and that the \nindividual applying for the job is the person with that number. Those \nare key components to the legislation we have introduced.\n  We also think it is important to do two other key things. We should \nprovide for work requirements in the future, with a temporary worker \nprogram. Let us forget for a moment the illegal immigrants who are \nalready here. What the Cornyn-Kyl bill says is we are going to create a \nnew temporary program for unskilled labor such as we have for skilled \nlabor today. Today if you are a computer company and you need some more \nsoftware designers and you can't get any from American universities, \nyou can apply under a special American program for temporary workers to \ncome from China or India or wherever they may come from. But they are \nonly here for a temporary period of time. When you need those workers, \nyou can apply for the visas, but when there are no jobs for those kinds \nof temporary workers, then visas are not issued. So it depends upon \nwhether there is a job available that you can't find an American to do.\n  We should do no more than that with regard to unskilled laborers \nbecause they present more potential problems in our society if times go \nbad and they don't have a job. So for unskilled, less educated workers, \nwe need the same kind of temporary status, not permanent status. If, \nfor example, in the construction industry--and I have a statistic here \nwhich I will cite in a moment--but we have a lot of illegal immigrants \nworking in construction today. In my State of Arizona, we can't find \nenough people to build homes, there is such a housing boom right now. \nUnder our program, we would be issuing more temporary work visas for \npeople to come in and help us build homes. But I also know there have \nbeen many times when I have lived in Arizona that a good American \ncitizen with good carpentry skills can't find a job. There are no jobs \nto be had. The housing market has fallen through the floor because we \nare in a recession and people are looking for work and they can't find \nit. In that situation it doesn't make sense to issue more temporary \nwork visas for foreign workers, foreign construction workers In that \ncase you wouldn't issue those permits\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nbecause there is no job here. Under the notion that you should have a \nwilling worker and willing employer, clearly if you don't have a job, \nyou don't want to be issuing work permits.\n\n  Our program is designed to be flexible enough to issue permits when \nyou need the workers and not to issue the visas when you don't need the \nworkers.\n  Contrast it with the bill that is before us. There is no such \nflexibility. The number of visas is set, and it doesn't matter whether \nthere is a job for the individual. People can still come into the \ncountry, and they are entitled to stay here forever, permanently. They \nare even put on a path to citizenship, even if there is no job here for \nthem. That is not right. Our bill, as distinguished from that, is for \ntemporary periods of time only.\n  Then, finally we deal with the illegal immigrants who are here \nalready who could, by the way, join up for that temporary worker \nprogram. We don't penalize them to prevent them from doing that. All of \nthe bills or proposals I have looked at, including the Cornyn-Kyl \nproposal, provide that on an effective date, the illegal immigrants who \nare here go check in someplace. There are different places where they \ncan check in, but the bottom line is they turn in their bad documents \nand get a new document that would enable them to stay in the United \nStates for a period of time. In our bill it is 5 years. The President \nhas proposed a total of 3 plus 3, 6 years. The Kennedy and McCain bill \nthat is part of the bill before us has another period of time. But all \nof them have them check in and get a temporary visa. Here, that is good \nfor a period of time. You get to travel back and forth during that \nperiod of time with no restriction. That is fine. We allow the person \nto stay here for up to 5 years.\n  We do one other thing. There is a background check that is also \nprovided in every bill. Under the bill that is before us, the \nbackground check is not followed up. That is to say, if you are a \ncriminal, it doesn't matter. You can still participate in the program. \nUnder the Cornyn-Kyl program, you would not be able to participate in \nthe program if you are a criminal. We have an amendment pending that \nwould make that the case for the bill that is on the Senate floor as \nwell, so people who are so-called absconders--they have violated the \njudge's order to leave the country or who have committed a felony or \nthree misdemeanors--would not be entitled to participate in the \nprogram.\n  In any event, under the Cornyn-Kyl bill you are allowed to stay in \nthe country up to 5 years. You can return to your home country at any \ntime and start participating in the temporary worker program. If you \nstay here for the full 5 years, you also have to be working. But, if \nyou want to go home, for example, to Mexico and get a laser visa, which \nis what would be required, that is a matter of days, less than a week. \nIf you have a job with an American employer, you take with you a \ncertificate of employment. So you leave the United States, you go to a \nconsular office in Mexico, obtain your laser visa, and then present \nthat at the border to come back into the United States and resume your \nwork. The whole thing should take no more than a week, probably less \nthan that.\n  There are those who say: Why would people voluntarily participate in \nthis program? I think it is fairly evident. We provide incentives for \npeople to participate in it. The sooner you leave the United States and \nget your laser visa so that you can come in and work temporarily, the \nlonger you could work in the temporary work program. We provide visas \nfor up 2 years at a time. You can have a total of 6 years' worth of \ntemporary work in the United States. So the sooner you start that \nprocess, obviously, the sooner you can start working under the \ntemporary worker program.\n  What is hard about that? In addition, you would be able to take with \nyou, after you have finished your temporary worker status, the money \nthat has accumulated in a savings account that is paid through a system \nwhich is parallel to the Social Security system today. You pay into the \nsystem, it is like your own personal account, and you take that money \nwith you when you voluntarily depart the United States when your \ntemporary visa expires--or before that if you want to. So there are \nincentives for people to comply with the law.\n  Finally, there is this question of why people would report to be \ndeported? I make it crystal clear that in our bill there is no \ndeportation. I don't know what legislation they are talking about. I am \nnot even sure there is any such thing in the House bill. In any event, \nthe Cornyn-Kyl bill has no provision for deportation. It doesn't \nrequire people to report to be deported--nothing of the kind. It is the \nsame kind of check-in that is present in all the other bills. You check \nin, you get your temporary document that enables you to stay in the \ncountry, and, again, it is for up to 5 years.\n  There is a Pew Hispanic research poll of Mexican immigrants here, who \nare illegal, who say that if they had an opportunity to continue to \nwork here for up to 5 years--7 percent say they would then be willing \nto return home.\n\n  I think it is a myth to say that someone who came here simply to work \nand earn money for their family, let's say from Mexico or El Salvador \nor whatever country you want to make it, that they would be unwilling \nto return home under the relatively generous provisions that we have \nestablished in our legislation.\n  There are disincentives to stay beyond the time and there are \nincentives to leave within that period of time. You are entitled to \nbecome a temporary worker and, therefore, it seems to me, we are \nascribing a pretty bad motive to people who would not voluntarily \nreturn to their home. In fact, to the extent that people say these are \nhard-working folks who just came here to work and make money, I am \nwilling to accept that and therefore I think you don't all of a sudden \nchange your mind after you get here and say: But I am not leaving no \nmatter what you make the law to be.\n  If these folks are otherwise law-abiding folks, I think they would \nwant to comply with the law as we have set it out.\n  The bottom line is, the Cornyn-Kyl bill provides a way for temporary \nworkers to work in the United States. It provides a way for people who \ncame here illegally to become legal, to stay here for up to 5 years, if \nthey want, to continue to participate in the worker program after that, \nand, finally, if they decide they want to become legal permanent \nresidents and therefore citizens of the United States, there is nothing \nthat prohibits them from applying to do that as well. They would do it \nin the same way as you apply for it today. They wouldn't be given any \nadvantage, nor would they be given any disadvantage under the Cornyn-\nKyl legislation.\n  Might I inquire, under the unanimous consent agreement there is 15 \nminutes for my time. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Then I will be happy to summarize. The bottom line is we are \ngoing to have the opportunity to vote on several different alternative \nproposals. The Cornyn-Kyl proposal is one we will be able to vote for. \nI believe it provides a reasonable alternative to the proposal on the \nfloor. It treats people humanely and fairly but doesn't provide that \npeople stay here permanently when there is no job for them, and \ncertainly in our history we know there have been times when our economy \nis not as good as it is now, and there will not be a job for everyone.\n  Temporary work status, treating people humanely and fairly, providing \nfor enforcement at the workplace, and, importantly, enforcement at the \nborder, we think that is a good proposition. I hope when the time comes \nfor us to consider our alternatives, my colleagues will give that a \ngood opportunity, will discuss it thoroughly, and agree it is a good \nalternative to be discussing.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the agreement \nbe modified to permit the Senator from Alaska to speak for 3 minutes \nbefore my 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3217 to amendment no. 3192\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski in cosponsoring \nher amendment because it is of great importance to the State of Alaska.\n  Seasonal workers are vital to our Nation's economy. Without the \nservices\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nthese workers provide, many of our businesses would cease to operate. \nThese visas are particularly important to the seafood and hospitality \nindustries.\n  Currently, the United States caps H-2B visas at 66,000 per year. Last \nyear, Congress adopted the ``Save Our Small Businesses Act,'' which \nallocates the seasonal visas more equitably between the winter and \nsummer months. It also exempts certain returning Seasonal Workers from \nthe cap, making more visas available to new workers.\n  Prior to the act's adoption, the H-2B visa cap was often met during \nthe winter months, well before the summer season, resulting in a lack \nof available visas for much needed summer workers in the seafood and \nhospitality industry.\n  Alaska's salmon industry is especially vulnerable when there are not \nenough temporary seasonal visas for the summer months.\n  Salmon roe is a product that must be overseen by Japanese \n``Supervisor Technicians'' who grade the salmon roe prior to sale to \nJapanese consumers. Due to the particular grading and processing \ndemands of the roe, without the technicians and the special \ncertification, the Japanese will not buy the Alaskan roe.\n  In some cases the value of the roe is greater than the flesh of the \nfish, so you can imagine how important it is to the salmon industry to \nget these technicians and certifications each year.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment simply extends to 2009 the ``Save Our \nSmall Businesses Act.'' Securing a reasonable number of visas for \nseasonal industries is absolutely necessary.\n  I urge the Senate to vote in favor of this amendment.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3193, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 3193, the amendment we will be voting on later \nthis afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have a modification of my amendment which I send to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3193), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 644.

\n     and\n       (B) other activities approved by the Secretary to promote \n     the patriotic integration of prospective citizens and the \n     implementation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), including grants--\n       (i) to promote an understanding of the form of government \n     and history of the United States; and\n       (ii) to promote an attachment to the principles of the \n     Constitution of the United States and the well being and \n     happiness of the people of the United States.\n       (2) Acceptance of gifts.--The Secretary may accept and use \n     gifts from the United States Citizenship Foundation, if the \n     foundation is established under subsection (e), for grants \n     under this subsection.\n       (3) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this subsection.\n       (e) Funding for the Office of Citizenship.--\n       (1) Authorization.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services, is authorized to establish the United States \n     Citizenship Foundation (referred to in this subsection as the \n     ``Foundation''), an organization duly incorporated in the \n     District of Columbia, exclusively for charitable and \n     educational purposes to support the functions of the Office \n     of Citizenship.\n       (2) Dedicated funding.--\n       (A) In general.--Not less than 1.5 percent of the funds \n     made available to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services from fees shall be dedicated to the functions of the \n     Office of Citizenship, which shall include the patriotic \n     integration of prospective citizens into--\n       (i) American common values and traditions, including an \n     understanding of American history and the principles of the \n     Constitution of the United States;

and\n       (ii) American history and government, including the heroes \n     of American history, the meaning of the Oath of Allegiance, \n     and an\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n     attachment to the principles of the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       (C) information about the number of legal residents who \n     were able to achieve the knowledge described under paragraph \n     (2) as a result of the grants provided under this section.\n       (h) Oath or Affirmation of Renunciation and Allegiance.--\n       (1) Revision of oath.--Section 337 (8 U.S.C. 1448) is \n     amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``under section 310(b) \n     an oath'' and all that follows through ``personal moral \n     code.'' and inserting ``under section 310(b), the oath (or \n     affirmation) of allegiance prescribed in subsection (e).''; \n     and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the oath (or \n     affirmation) of allegiance prescribed in this subsection is \n     as follows: `I take this oath solemnly, freely, and without \n     any mental reservation.

My fidelity and allegiance from \n     this day forward are to the United States of America. I will \n     bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and laws \n     of the United States, and will support and defend them \n     against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

This I do \n     solemnly swear, so help me God.'.\n       ``(2) If a person, by reason of religious training and \n     belief (or individual interpretation thereof) or for other \n     reasons of good conscience, cannot take the oath prescribed \n     in paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) with the term `oath' included, the term `affirmation' \n     shall be substituted for the term `oath'; and\n       ``(B) with the phrase `so help me God' included, the phrase \n     `so help me God' shall be omitted.\n       ``(3) If a person shows by clear and convincing evidence to \n     the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such person, by \n     reason of religious training and belief, cannot take the oath \n     prescribed in paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) because such person is opposed to the bearing of arms \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States, the words `bear \n     arms, or' shall be omitted; and\n       ``(B) because such person is opposed to any type of service \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States, the words `bear \n     arms, or' and `noncombatant military or' shall be omitted.\n       ``(4) As used in this subsection, the term `religious \n     training and belief'--\n       ``(A) means a belief of an individual in relation to a \n     Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from \n     any human relation; and\n       ``(B) does not include essentially political, sociological, \n     or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\n       ``(5) Any reference in this title to `oath' or `oath of \n     allegiance' under this section shall be deemed to refer to \n     the oath (or affirmation) of allegiance prescribed under this \n     subsection.''.\n       (2) History and government test.--The Secretary shall \n     incorporate a knowledge and understanding of the meaning of \n     the Oath of Allegiance into the history and government test \n     given to applicants for citizenship.\n       (3) Notice to foreign embassies.--Upon the naturalization \n     of a new citizen, the Secretary, in cooperation with the \n     Secretary of State, shall notify the embassy of the country \n     of which the new citizen was a citizen or subject that such \n     citizen has--\n       (A) renounced allegiance to that foreign country; and\n       (B) sworn allegiance to the United States.\n       (4) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect on the date that is 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (i) Establishment of New Citizens Award Program.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established a new citizens \n     award program to recognize citizens who--\n       (A) have made an outstanding contribution to the United \n     States; and\n       (B) were naturalized during the 10-year period ending on \n     the date of such recognition.\n       (2) Presentation authorized.--\n       (A) In general.--The President is authorized to present a \n     medal, in recognition of outstanding contributions to the \n     United States, to citizens described in paragraph (1).\n       (B) Maximum number of awards.--Not more than 10 citizens \n     may receive a medal under this subsection in any calendar \n     year.\n       (3) Design and striking.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike a medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the President.\n       (4) National medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     subsection are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n       (j) Naturalization Ceremonies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n     Director of the National Park Service, the Archivist of the \n     United States, and other appropriate Federal officials, shall \n     develop and implement a strategy to enhance the public \n     awareness of naturalization ceremonies.\n       (2) Venues.--In developing the strategy under this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall consider the use of \n     outstanding and historic locations as venues for select \n     naturalization ceremonies.\n       (3) Reporting requirement.--The Secretary shall submit an \n     annual report to Congress that includes--\n       (A) the content of the strategy developed under this \n     subsection; and\n       (B) the progress made towards the implementation of such \n     strategy.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this afternoon at 5:30 we will be \ncasting two votes: one on Senator Bingaman's amendment which has to do \nwith border security, the second is a different kind of amendment. It \nis an amendment about what I call the rest of the immigration story, \nhelping prospective citizens become Americans.\n  I know border security is extremely important. We are starting with \nthat because the principle of the rule of law is at stake. I know it is \nextremely important for us to create a temporary legal status, as has \nbeen discussed this afternoon by Senators Cornyn and Kyl and Sessions, \nfor students we welcome here to study and workers we welcome here to \nwork. We are going to be talking today and this week about that.\n  But I submit the most important thing we will be discussing this \nweek, and the most important part of any story on immigration, has to \ndo with a different principle, and that is the three words right up \nhere above the Presiding Officer's chair, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' one from \nmany, the motto of our country, the greatest achievement of the United \nStates of America.\n  We have taken all this magnificent diversity from all over the world \nand we have turned it into one nation, a nation with a common heritage, \na common history, a common language--something no other country in the \nworld has been able to do nearly as well.\n  This amendment is about redoubling our efforts to help prospective \ncitizens who are here legally to become Americans. The amendment \nreflects the work of several Senators in this Chamber. Senators Cornyn \nand Isakson and Cochran and Santorum and I, earlier, along with Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Frist, had offered legislation we called the \nStrengthening American Citizenship Act, which I will describe in a \nminute.\n  In the last two Congresses, Senator Schumer and I introduced \nlegislation that would take the oath of allegiance that a half million \nto a million new citizens take every year and put it into the law, give \nit the same sort of status extended to other important national \nsymbols, such as the Star-Spangled Banner, our national anthem. Several \nof us here--Senator Reid, Senator Kennedy, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nBurns--have been working to try to put the teaching of American history \nback in its rightful place in our schools so our children can grow up \nlearning what it means to be American.\n  This is about helping prospective citizens become Americans. Becoming \nAmerican is no small thing. We don't think about becoming French, or \nbecoming English, or becoming Japanese, or becoming German because in \nmost countries in the world you become a citizen, if you can at all, \nbased upon your race, your ancestry, your background.\n  We are just the opposite here. You cannot become a citizen of the \nUnited States based upon your race, your ancestry, or your background. \nIn fact, you only may become a citizen of the United States if you move \nhere from another country by going through a series of steps, which \nincludes pledging allegiance to the founding documents that embody the \nprinciples that unite us as Americans. We are united by ideals.\n  This debate this week is a good debate because it brings up many of \nthose principles and ideals that unite us, and it is typical of most of \nour debates on this floor. Those ideals often conflict. We have the \nidea of a nation of immigrants conflicting with the rule of law here. \nThat is why we are having a difficult time figuring out what to do \nabout the 10 million or 11 million people who are here illegally.\n  We have to weigh the facts as we talk about how many temporary \nworkers we want, and that we have the principle of laissez faire in our \ncharacter. We have a free enterprise system. We want people to work. We \nwant to attract them here. As a part of that principle of laissez \nfaire, we have in the bill that Senator Specter reported two important \nprovisions that make it easier for some of the brightest people outside \nof our country to come to our country and help create a higher standard \nof living for us.\n  We have some very outdated and nonsensical provisions in our \nimmigration\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nlaws. If Werner von Braun showed up wanting to come to a university \ntoday, or a Werner von Braun of this generation, he would have to swear \nhe was going to go home. We wouldn't want him to go home. We want the \nbrightest people here in our universities and in our research \ninstitutes so they can help us create better jobs and a higher standard \nof living here. Otherwise, those jobs go to India, to China, and other \nparts of the world.\n  We have many principles at stake. Here is exactly what the amendment \ndoes we will be voting on this afternoon after Senator Bingaman's \namendment. First, it would help legal immigrants who are embarked on a \npath toward citizenship to learn our common language--English--our \nhistory, and our way of Government by these provisions.\n  One, providing them with a $500 grant for an English course. There \nare a great many people here who want to learn English. I think it is a \nmyth that those people who come to this country don't want to learn \nEnglish. For older people who come here, it is harder. But in 2004, \n1.142 million individuals participated in English literacy programs \ndesigned to help improve English language for immigrants. Seventy-one \npercent of those participants are Hispanics. Twenty-eight percent of \nall English literacy adult education programs reported having waiting \nlists. Thirty-five percent of those reported lists of 50 or more people \non the waiting lists. We have a lot of people here who want to learn \nour common language, and we should want them to learn our common \nlanguage. It is important to unite us as a country to do that.\n  Second, we would allow those who become fluent in English--not just \nbasic in English but fluent and proficient in English--to apply for \ncitizenship 1 year early; that is, after 4 years instead of 5. That is \na major change. In order to become a citizen, one must be here 5 years \nunder the present rules. One should have good character and pass a test \nabout our Constitution and principles. None of that changes. Today, one \nmust learn English--a basic level of understanding.\n\n  In addition to helping people learn English with grants which may be \nused in any accredited educational institution, why not give those who \nbecome proficient in English the incentive of becoming a citizen in 4 \nyears? That is what this amendment would do. It would provide grants to \norganizations to offer courses in American history and civics so that \nnew citizens could learn the principles that unite us as a country. It \nauthorizes a new foundation to assist in these efforts. This is an area \nripe for public-private opportunity. I think there are a great many \npeople--many of whom may be immigrants themselves--who would want to \ncontribute to a new foundation that would help new citizens learn more \nabout our country.\n  We codify the oath of allegiance which new citizens swear when they \nare naturalized. This is a remarkable law. One-half million to a \nmillion new Americans this year will take the oath. They renounce where \nthey come from, and they pledge allegiance to where they are coming. Of \ncourse, we are all proud of where we came from, but we are prouder \nstill to be Americans. This provision puts this into law. It is \nessentially the same oath George Washington himself took in 1778 at \nValley Forge and administered to his own officers. It is the same oath \nthat millions upon millions of new citizens of this country have taken \nfor 200 years. This would dignify it and make it a part of our law.\n  In addition, this amendment asks the Department of Homeland Security \nto work with the National Archives, the National Park Service, and \nothers to carry out a strategy to highlight the ceremonies in which \nimmigrants become American citizens.\n  I have been to many of those ceremonies. There is not a more moving \nexperience anywhere in America--and these events happen virtually every \nday in some Federal courthouse, where 30, 45, or 70 prospective \ncitizens will arrive in the courthouse. The judge will say something \nabout our country and what this means, and then these men and women \nfrom all across the country, neatly dressed, many of them with tears in \ntheir eyes, raise their hands, having been here 5 years, shown good \ncharacter, learned English, and passed the test about our Constitution \nand they renounce allegiance to where they have come from and they \npledge allegiance to this country. Those ceremonies will be \nhighlighted.\n  Finally, it establishes an award to recognize the contributions of \noutstanding new American citizens.\n  I would suspect that this new award would one day, perhaps very \nquickly, become as important as the Presidential Medal of Freedom \nbecause it will not be hard to find outstanding contributions by new \nimmigrants to our country.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico on the floor. He and I have heard \nit often said that of the 100 Americans who have won the Nobel Prize in \nphysics, 60 are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Each of us \nknows of such a list, and for the President to be able to identify up \nto 10 such immigrants who have made great contributions to our country \nand to recognize them every year will make a difference.\n  How much will this cost? It won't cost the taxpayers a penny because \nthese grants to help people learn English, which is the major cost, \nwill be paid for by the visa fees that are paid each year.\n  This is an important amendment. I believe it is the most important \nsubject we have before us: helping prospective citizens learn English, \ngiving them an incentive to become a citizen in 4 years instead of 5, \nas they become proficient in English, providing grants to encourage the \nteaching of American history and civics, creating a new foundation to \nassist in that, codifying the oath of allegiance, highlighting the \nceremonies in which citizens become new Americans, and then allowing \nthe President to designate a handful of new Americans every year who \ncontributed so much to our country.\n  During these next few weeks, we should enact legislation to secure \nour borders. Then we should create a legal status for workers and \nstudents. We welcome them to increase our standard of living, as well \nas export our values. But we should not complete our work on a \ncomprehensive immigration law without remembering why we have placed \nthat three-word motto above the Presiding Officer's Chair, without \nremembering that our unity did not come without a lot of effort, \nwithout noticing lessons from overseas in France and Great Britain that \nremind us it is more important today than ever to help prospective \ncitizens become Americans.\n  I notice the Senator from New Mexico on the floor. The majority has \nall the time remaining, if the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to \ndiscuss it. I would be glad to yield some of that time to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico if wants to discuss his amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on two amendments at \n5:30. I believe both of these are good amendments. Senator Alexander \nhas proposed an amendment which will facilitate immigrants learning \nEnglish. I think that is a very sound approach. Senator Bingaman has \npromoted an amendment which would enhance border control and funding. I \nbelieve both are good amendments.\n  I yield the floor for additional comment--I see Senator Bingaman \nrising--and give him an opportunity to speak. We are going to be voting \nin another 3 or 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy. When the time comes, I will call up my amendment No. 3210. I \ngather there is a modification of that amendment at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be modified, if that is appropriate at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3210), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n              TITLE __--BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. _03.

ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a competitive \ngrant program in the Department of Homeland Security to help local law \nenforcement that is situated along our borders.\n  We see the situation in my State of New Mexico all the time--and have \nfor many years--where local law enforcement agencies very much need \nassistance in combating border-related criminal activity. That is the \nsmuggling of drugs into the country, the stealing of automobiles, a \nvariety of criminal activity that occurs by virtue of the Federal \nGovernment's inability to properly secure our international borders. \nThis is a responsibility that should not be dumped on local law \nenforcement.\n  The amendment I am offering, along with Senators Domenici and Kyl, \nwould provide for a $50-million-a-year grant program to local law \nenforcement to assist them with this very substantial burden they have \nand that should be the responsibility of the Federal Government.\n  I will speak, I gather, for another 60 seconds on this amendment once \nwe get to it, but at this point I see the time for voting is about upon \nus. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are scheduled to vote in 3 minutes. We \nhave a good many amendments which have been filed so far. We are going \nto be looking to start the debate early tomorrow morning. I urge my \ncolleagues who have amendments and who would like to debate them \nearly--a good time to find time to debate is on Tuesday morning, which \nis a lot better than Thursday afternoon. I urge our colleagues to come \nforward and state their willingness to debate.\n  As I stated earlier, we are going to be holding the votes to 15 \nminutes plus the 5-minute grace period. We are going to be cutting them \noff at 20 minutes. We are going to establish that pattern on this bill, \nwith the majority leader's authorization. We know the practice on some \noccasions has been to have the votes run 30 minutes or 35 minutes, a \nlong time, which eats into the floor time. We have a big job ahead of \nus on this bill this week. I urge my colleagues to come within the 20-\nminute timeframe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the second vote be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allen be \nadded as a cosponsor to amendment No. 3206.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 3210, as Modified\n\n  The pending amendment is the Bingaman amendment. Two minutes is \nequally divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I gather my amendment has been modified.\n  I call up amendment No. 3210, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as I stated a few \nminutes ago, is an amendment to provide additional resources to local \nlaw enforcement agencies along our borders, both with Mexico and with \nCanada. The truth is, because of the increased activity there, because \nof the inability, the failure of the Federal Government to properly \nenforce our border and secure our borders, local law enforcement \nagencies, sheriffs, and city police agencies have a very substantial \nadditional responsibility to deal with criminal activity. This \namendment tries to help them with that by setting up a grant program. \nIt is $50 million a year, which is probably not adequate, but it is a \nsubstantial improvement over what we currently have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a good amendment. I urge \nagreement of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Mexico on \nhis amendment. It improves the bill being considered by the Senate. The \nBingaman amendment enhances our efforts to be tough and smart in \nimmigration reform by providing State and local law enforcement \nagencies with additional assistance.\n  The Judiciary Committee sent a bill approved by a bipartisan vote of \n12-6 to the Senate. It is a bill that is strong on enforcement. It is \nstronger than the bill introduced by the senior Senator from Tennessee, \nwho started from the same place as the committee bill but did not \ninclude some of the enforcement measures added by amendment during \nCommittee consideration and neglected some of the bipartisan \nimprovements that we made. For example, the Frist bill does not include \na provision added by the Committee at the urging of Senator Feinstein \nto make tunneling under our borders a federal crime. The committee bill \nadds new criminal penalties for evading immigration officers and the \ncommittee bill includes a Feinstein amendment to add 12,000 new border \npatrol agents, at 2,400 each year for the next 5 years.\n  The committee bill is enforcement ``plus.'' It starts with strong \nenforcement provisions and border security to be sure, but it is also \ncomprehensive and balanced. It confronts the problem of 12 million \nundocumented immigrants who live in the shadows. It values work. It \nrespects human dignity. It includes guest worker provisions supported \nby business and labor. It includes a way to pay fines and earn \ncitizenship that has the support of religious and leading Hispanic \norganizations.\n  I continue to work with Chairman Specter in a bipartisan way to enact \nthe committee bill. Our bill provides a realistic and reasonable system \nfor immigration. Our bill protects America's borders, strengthens \nenforcement and remains true to American values.\n  The committee bill wisely dropped controversial provisions that would \nhave exposed those who provide humanitarian relief, medical care, \nshelter, counseling and other basic services that help undocumented \naliens to possible prosecution under felony alien smuggling provisions \nof the criminal law. I thank so many in the relief and religious \ncommunities for speaking out on this matter. Those criminal provisions \nshould be focused on the smugglers, and under the committee bill, that \nis what we did.\n  The Committee also voted down a measure that would have criminalized \nmere presence in an undocumented status in the United States. Illegal \nstatus is currently a civil offense with very serious consequences, \nincluding deportation, but criminalizing that status was punitive and \nwrong. It would have led to further harsh consequences and trapped \npeople in permanent underclass status. These criminalization measures, \nwhich were included in the House-passed bill supported by congressional \nRepublicans and are reflected in the Frist bill, have understandable \nsparked nationwide protests. They are viewed by many as anti-immigrant \nand inconsistent with American values and history. The committee bill, \nwhile tough on enforcement and on the smugglers, is smarter and fairer.\n  The Bingaman amendment adds to our product. It is a constructive \namendment. I hope that it will be supported by all Senators, whether \nRepublican, Democratic or Independent. Border law enforcement agencies \ndeserve our support as they are confronted with border-related criminal \nactivity. I thank the Senator for including both the northern and \nsouthern borders in his concerns and within the coverage of his \namendment.\n  The amendment recognizes the failures of the Federal Government over \nthe last few years and its failure to provide adequate security along \nour borders. As the Senator from New Mexico has said, when such \nfailures impose costs on local communities, the Federal Government \nshould help.\n  The peaceful demonstrations around the country over the last few \nweeks call on the Congress to recognize the human dignity of all and to \ndo the right thing, in keeping with longstanding American values. We \nneed a comprehensive solution to a national problem. We need a fair, \nrealistic and reasonable system that includes both tough enforcement \nand immigration reform provisions. All Senators should be able to agree \nwith these principles.\n  I was glad to hear that President Bush was speaking recently about \nthe need for a path to citizenship and the need for a comprehensive \nbill. Of course, as we proceed through their sixth year in office, the \nBush-Cheney administration has still not sent a legislative proposal to \nthe Congress on these matters. Instead of waiting, we have done the \nhard work and are writing a tough, smart, comprehensive bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 1 minute on his \namendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is an amendment about the motto \nabove the Presiding Officer's desk. It helps legal immigrants who are \nembarked on a path toward citizenship to learn our common language, \nEnglish, to learn our history and our way of government, by providing \nthem with grants. It allows legal residents to earn their citizenship \nin 4 years instead of 5 if they become fluent in English. It provides \ngrants to organizations to offer courses in American history and \ncivics, sets up a foundation to assist with that, codifies the oath of \nallegiance that immigrants take and dignifies the ceremonies in which \nimmigrants become American citizens, and establishes an award to \nrecognize the contributions of outstanding new American citizens.\n  The amendment reflects the work of a number of Senators. Senator \nSchumer and I have worked on the oath. Senator Byrd, Senator Reid, \nSenator Burns, and I have worked on American history. Senators Cornyn \nand Cochran and others have cosponsored the Strengthening American \nCitizenship Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment, along with Senators Frist, McConnell, \nIsakson, Cochran, Santorum, and McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to enter the \ndebate on comprehensive immigration reform. It is a debate that will \ntouch on the basic questions of morality, the law, and what it means to \nbe an American.\n  I know that this debate evokes strong passions on all sides. The \nrecent peaceful but passionate protests that we saw all across the \ncountry--500,000 in Los Angeles and 100,000 in my hometown of Chicago--\nare a testament to this fact, as are the concerns of millions of \nAmericans about the security of our borders.\n  But I believe we can work together to pass immigration reform in a \nway that unites the people in this country, not in a way that divides \nus by playing on our worst instincts and fears.\n  Like millions of Americans, the immigrant story is also my story. My \nfather came here from Kenya, and I represent a State where vibrant \nimmigrant communities ranging from Mexican to Polish to Irish enrich \nour cities and neighborhoods. So I understand the allure of freedom and \nopportunity that fuels the dream of a life in the United States. But I \nalso understand the need to fix a broken system.\n  When Congress last addressed this issue comprehensively in 1986, \nthere were approximately 4 million illegal immigrants living in the \nUnited States. That number had grown substantially when Congress again \naddressed the issue in 1996. Today, it is estimated that there are more \nthan 11 million undocumented aliens living in our country.\n  The American people are a welcoming and generous people. But those \nwho enter our country illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect \nthe rule of law. And because we live in an age where terrorists are \nchallenging our borders, we simply cannot allow people to pour into the \nUnited States undetected, undocumented, and unchecked. Americans are \nright to demand better border security and better enforcement of the \nimmigration laws.\n  The bill the Judiciary Committee has passed would clearly strengthen \nenforcement. I will repeat that, because those arguing against the \nJudiciary Committee bill contrast that bill with a strong enforcement \nbill. The bill the Judiciary Committee passed clearly strengthens \nenforcement. To begin with, the agencies charged with border\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nsecurity would receive new technology, new facilities, and more people \nto stop, process, and deport illegal immigrants.\n\n  But while security might start at our borders, it doesn't end there. \nMillions of undocumented immigrants live and work here without our \nknowing their identity or their background. We need to strike a \nworkable bargain with them. They have to acknowledge that breaking our \nimmigration laws was wrong. They must pay a penalty, and abide by all \nof our laws going forward. They must earn the right to stay over a 6-\nyear period, and then they must wait another 5 years as legal permanent \nresidents before they become citizens.\n  But in exchange for accepting those penalties, we must allow \nundocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows and step on a path \ntoward full participation in our society. In fact, I will not support \nany bill that does not provide this earned path to citizenship for the \nundocumented population--not just for humanitarian reasons; not just \nbecause these people, having broken the law, did so for the best of \nmotives, to try and provide a better life for their children and their \ngrandchildren; but also because this is the only practical way we can \nget a handle on the population that is within our borders right now.\n  To keep from having to go through this difficult process again in the \nfuture, we must also replace the flow of undocumented immigrants coming \nto work here with a new flow of guestworkers. Illegal immigration is \nbad for illegal immigrants and bad for the workers against whom they \ncompete.\n  Replacing the flood of illegals with a regulated stream of legal \nimmigrants who enter the United States after background checks and who \nare provided labor rights would enhance our security, raise wages, and \nimprove working conditions for all Americans.\n  But I fully appreciate that we cannot create a new guestworker \nprogram without making it as close to impossible as we can for illegal \nworkers to find employment. We do not need new guestworkers plus future \nundocumented immigrants. We need guestworkers instead of undocumented \nimmigrants.\n  Toward that end, American employers need to take responsibility. Too \noften illegal immigrants are lured here with a promise of a job, only \nto receive unconscionably low wages. In the interest of cheap labor, \nunscrupulous employers look the other way when employees provide \nfraudulent U.S. citizenship documents. Some actually call and place \norders for undocumented workers because they don't want to pay minimum \nwages to American workers in surrounding communities. These acts hurt \nboth American workers and immigrants whose sole aim is to work hard and \nget ahead. That is why we need a simple, foolproof, and mandatory \nmechanism for all employers to check the legal status of new hires. \nSuch a mechanism is in the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  And before any guestworker is hired, the job must be made available \nto Americans at a decent wage with benefits. Employers then need to \nshow that there are no Americans to take these jobs. I am not willing \nto take it on faith that there are jobs that Americans will not take. \nThere has to be a showing. If this guestworker program is to succeed, \nit must be properly calibrated to make certain that these are jobs that \ncannot be filled by Americans, or that the guestworkers provide \nparticular skills we can't find in this country.\n  I know that dealing with the undocumented population is difficult, \nfor practical and political reasons. But we simply cannot claim to have \ndealt with the problems of illegal immigration if we ignore the illegal \nresident population or pretend they will leave voluntarily. Some of the \nproposed ideas in Congress provide a temporary legal status and call \nfor deportation, but fail to answer how the government would deport 11 \nmillion people. I don't know how it would be done. I don't know how we \nwould line up all the buses and trains and airplanes and send 11 \nmillion people back to their countries of origin. I don't know why it \nis that we expect they would voluntarily leave after having taken the \nrisk of coming to this country without proper documentation.\n  I don't know many police officers across the country who would go \nalong with the bill that came out of the House, a bill that would, if \nenacted, charge undocumented immigrants with felonies, and arrest \npriests who are providing meals to hungry immigrants, or people who are \nrunning shelters for women who have been subject to domestic abuse. I \ncannot imagine that we would be serious about making illegal immigrants \ninto felons, and going after those who would aid such persons.\n  That approach is not serious. That is symbolism, that is demagoguery. \nIt is important that if we are going to deal with this problem, we deal \nwith it in a practical, commonsense way. If temporary legal status is \ngranted but the policy says these immigrants are never good enough to \nbecome Americans, then the policy that makes little sense.\n  I believe successful, comprehensive immigration reform can be \nachieved by building on the work of the Judiciary Committee. The \nJudiciary Committee bill combines some of the strongest elements of \nSenator Hagel's border security proposals with the realistic workplace \nand earned-citizenship program proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, I will come to the floor over the next week to offer \nsome amendments of my own, and to support amendments my colleagues will \noffer. I will also come to the floor to argue against amendments that \ncontradict our tradition as a nation of immigrants and as a nation of \nlaws.\n  As FDR reminded the Nation at the 50th anniversary of the dedication \nof the Statue of Liberty, those who landed at Ellis Island ``were the \nmen and women who had the supreme courage to strike out for themselves, \nto abandon language and relatives, to start at the bottom without \ninfluence, without money, and without knowledge of life in a very young \ncivilization.''\n\n  It behooves us to remember that not every single immigrant who came \ninto the United States through Ellis Island had proper documentation. \nNot every one of our grandparents or great-grandparents would have \nnecessarily qualified for legal immigration. But they came here in \nsearch of a dream, in search of hope. Americans understand that, and \nthey are willing to give an opportunity to those who are already here, \nas long as we get serious about making sure that our borders actually \nmean something.\n  Today's immigrants seek to follow in the same tradition of \nimmigration that has built this country. We do ourselves and them a \ndisservice if we do not recognize the contributions of these \nindividuals. And we fail to protect our Nation if we do not regain \ncontrol over our immigration system immediately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have been talking about the \nimmigration challenge that is facing this country. It is one that needs \nto be faced and dealt with, and I believe it is possible for us to \nachieve comprehensive reform. Unfortunately, the legislation before us \ntoday will not do the job. It will not be consistent with what I have \nheard from my Alabama voters or with what we have been telling our \nvoters all over the country that we would do in immigration \nlegislation.\n  Let me make a couple of points about this issue.\n  There are two aspects, I guess one can say. One aspect is what to do \nabout those people who are here illegally and how should they be \ntreated, which ones should be allowed to stay and which ones should not \nbe allowed to stay and under what conditions.\n  Those are all very important matters for us to discuss in some depth \nand, frankly, we have not done that, not in any effective way. We \npassed that portion of the immigration bill last Monday after about 3 \nhours of debate, at 6 o'clock, and the bill was on the floor the next \nday or Wednesday, and what we actually passed out of committee was \nprinted Wednesday night. So there was very little serious discussion \nabout the bill.\n  It is a tremendous problem. We are dealing with 1.1 million people \nentering\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nthe country illegally being arrested each year by our Border Patrol \nagency--1.1 million. This is huge. We have a system, I heard the \nDemocratic leader say earlier today, that is lawless and it is chaos. \nIf we are going to deal comprehensively with the human situation we are \nfacing, ought we not also deal with the challenges of the legal system \nand try to make our borders a lawful place instead of chaos?\n  First, I want to say, we can do this. It is not that difficult. We \nsimply have to take down the ``come on in'' sign that is there, that \n``come on in illegally and sooner or later we are going to make you \nlegal'' sign. We need to create enforcement on the border and create \ngood enforcement at the workplace, and then we can reach that tipping \npoint where people find that it is better to get that biometric card \nand come to the right border crossing and go there and present it and \ngo right in. And you can go right back home when you want to go home. \nIt would work. It can be made to work.\n  Let me tell you the challenges that are in existence and why I think \nwe haven't met those challenges. We have 1.1 million arrests. I think \nit is possible that if we get serious and send that clear message to \nthe world that you have to come lawfully, we might see a lot fewer \npeople attempt to come illegally. As a matter of fact, I am confident \nof that.\n  Another problem we have is those who are ``other than Mexicans.'' It \nhas been referred to now consistently as the catch-and-release policy. \nThis is the deal: If you apprehend someone who is a Mexican, they can \neasily be taken back across the border, maybe that day or within a day \nor two. But what if someone is caught coming across the border from \nBrazil or the islands or China or someplace like that? It is a much \nmore difficult problem. We have not done a good job of confronting it, \nand what has happened is, those people have been arrested at the border \nand many times they just turn themselves in to the agents. They take \nthem 100 or so miles further inside the border, and they are released \non bail and they are asked to come back to this hearing to explain why \nthey are here illegally. Well, they don't come back. In fact, in one \ndistrict, in one area, 95 percent of the people released after being \ncaught didn't show up for their hearing.\n  Does that not make a mockery of the law? And they are not even \nputting their names into the National Crime Information Center--they \nhaven't been. They say they are, but still only a small number are \ngetting in the system so that if they are apprehended somewhere else in \nthe country, they will be picked up. If you skip on a DUI charge, they \nput your name in the NCIC, and if you are stopped in Maryland or \nVirginia or New York or California, you will get a hit that you are \nwanted for a DUI somewhere. We are not doing that. That indicates a \nlack of interest in seeing that the law works. So that has to be fixed. \nThey say they are going to fix it, but it hasn't been fixed.\n  In the appellate process--we had a hearing this morning--and Senator \nSpecter had language in the bill that is before us today that would \ntake a good step toward fixing the problem with appeals. In the \ncommittee, however, somebody offered an amendment to take it out, and \nit was taken out. This is the problem: In 4 years, there has been a \n600-percent increase in the number of appeals in immigration cases. As \na result, we have created a large backlog. This backlog has resulted in \nthe unbelievable situation by which it takes 27 months now to get a \ndecision. So we have a 600-percent increase and 27 months before you \nget an appeal decision out of the courts. Some of that is getting the \ntranscript ready; some of that has been delays in the court system. So \nwe had a proposal to fix that. It obviously has to be fixed if we are \ngoing to transition from a chaotic system to a lawful system. Wouldn't \neverybody agree with that? But that was taken out.\n  We are going to have to have jails and we are going to have to have \nincreased Border Patrol agents and we are going to have to have \nincreased barriers. This is so simple as to be without dispute, it \nseems to me. Good fences make good neighbors. Good fences make good \nneighbors, they say. When you have large numbers of people, in the \nmillions, coming across--many of them coming across a specific area--a \nfence can make a huge difference. It made a huge difference in San \nDiego. I don't think anybody has breached that fence. Both sides of the \nfence now are growing and prospering terrifically. The property values \nhave gone up, crime and violence and smuggling have all gone down, and \nit is so much better there. Nobody would want to take that fence down.\n  So I don't understand this idea in opposition to the fencing or any \nbarriers whatsoever. It is something you can't talk about. The reason \nthat is so is because people want to make those who believe fencing and \nbarriers are legitimate are against any immigration. They want you to \nsay that there shouldn't be any immigration. But the amendment I have \noffered that would deal with expanding fences similar to what the House \nof Representatives passed by a large vote would increase substantially \nthe number of legal entry points. I am not trying to keep people from \ncoming lawfully or to put up a barrier that says: America doesn't allow \nimmigration anymore. That is not what we are doing. We are trying to \ntilt it from an unlawful to a lawful system.\n  Another thing that is very important is our local law enforcement \nofficers. We have 600,000--750,000 State and local law enforcement \nofficers in America. They have basically been told they should not \ncontribute to the effort to deal with those who are here illegally. If \nthey capture someone who is speeding or DUI or committing some other \nminor offense and they find out they are here illegally, nobody wants \nto come and get them and won't authorize the officers or encourage them \neven to participate and help. I do not believe we should mandate State \nand local officers to do anything they don't desire to do. They have \nplenty of choices to make in how they apply their resources. But if an \nofficer is out doing his daily duties and he apprehends someone who is \nin this country illegally, why shouldn't the Federal Government come \nand get them? Why shouldn't they be thanked for it?\n  The opposition to that indicates to me--and the nature of it and the \nkind of resistance and pushback we are getting for that--indicates to \nme that there are a large number of people who say they want law \nenforcement in America but really don't. They don't have the will to \nsee this thing through and make sure the system works.\n  Finally, let me tell you, it is very easy indeed for this Nation to \nget control of the workplace. This can be done and can be done very \neasily. American corporations obey the law, in general. There are some \nwho don't, but most of them obey the law. What they have been told is \nthey can't ask for people's identification today, they can't ask to \nfind out whether they are legal or illegal, or they will be sued for \nsome sort of civil rights violation, and they quit doing it. In fact, \nthey are not required to do it, apparently, because they have never \nbeen punished for that.\n\n  In 2004, we had only four companies that were assessed a fine for \nhiring illegal workers in this country. Only four. Isn't that amazing? \nIt indicates that there has been zero enforcement, zero will to make \nsure there is a lawful process occurring at the workplace.\n  What we need is clear language in our legislation and a clear \ncommitment by this administration and the Department of Justice to take \nthe law that we pass that clarifies all of this confusion that is out \nthere and make sure there is a clear message to our businesses and, if \nthey violate the law, to prosecute them or fine them. That can be done, \nand as soon as it starts being done, other businesses will clean up \ntheir act. They will not do it. You are not going to have to prosecute \nevery company that is today hiring illegal workers because as soon as \nthey know that it is not acceptable, that they will be prosecuted for \nit and fined for it, they will quit. That matter can be ended.\n  T.J. Bonner, the head of the Border Patrol employees group, says you \nneed two things to make this system work, and he believes it absolutely \ncan work. One is increased enforcement at the border, and two is to \neliminate what he called the ``magnet of the job.'' It is the job \nmagnet that draws people across the border. Both of those can be \neliminated very easily.\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\n  So what do we have in our bill, the bill that is on the floor today? \nWe have legislation that will place each one of the 11 million people \nhere, virtually every one of them, on a direct path to citizenship. \nThey say: Well, it is not automatic; they have to earn their way. They \nare supposed to work. How many hours? Well, 150 days. How much work do \nyou have to do each day? Well, 1 hour. So you work 150 hours a year, \nand that qualifies you as a working person. But either way, that is \nwhat people come here for, to work. So what kind of earning is that? \nThat is the benefit. That is why people come. That is the magnet.\n  So they say that because they work, they earned the right to gain \ntheir complete citizenship by violating the American law, by coming \nhere illegally, and then they are rewarded with every benefit this \nNation can give them. They are rewarded with every social benefit, \nevery welfare benefit, every medical care benefit, every legal \nbenefit--even citizenship--rewarding them for coming in ahead of the \nline, ahead of those who stayed and waited their turn.\n  So my point about that is this: Let's keep focusing on that. Let's \nfigure out what the right thing to do is for these people. I am just \nsaying that those who come illegally should not get every single \nbenefit that those who come legally do.\n  It is a myth that somehow a person here who is not a citizen is \nsomehow mistreated and not appropriately treated. I had the great \nhonor--and I have the great honor--to know Professor Harald Rohlig at \nthe college I attended. He is in his eighties. He came here from \nGermany right after World War II. He is a great organ master. He has \nperformed and recorded the entire work of Bach. He is one of the most \ndelightful people I have ever had the pleasure to know, and a decent \nperson. His wife died, and before that, she had decided she didn't want \nto become a citizen. But he decided--he always wanted to be a citizen. \nHe wanted to be a citizen. He was in his eighties. Now, here he was, \nthe head of the music department, recorded the entire works of Bach, \nand had done so many other wonderful things and was loved throughout \nthe whole area, but he wasn't a citizen. He came in legally and was \nqualified and he, in his eighties, decided to become a citizen. The \npoint of that story is you can be a great participant in America and \nhave many wonderful things available to you, even if you are not a \ncitizen.\n  My next point is this: We are moving toward one of the most historic \nand generous proimmigration pieces of legislation this Nation has ever \nhad. As we study the numbers, assuming that those who qualify are only \n11 million to 12 million, we are looking at the numbers that come in \nlegally on top of that--on top of the ones who come now, we are going \nto have 400,000 per year. And they are supposedly guest workers. So we \nare told there are 400,000 guest workers, but they come in for 3 years \nwith the automatic ability to apply for another 3 years. It is my \nunderstanding that if an employer desires an alien to get a green card, \nthe employer can apply on behalf of the alien almost as soon as the \nalien begins work. And for the first time we have made it so that the \nguest workers, after 4 years, can apply for a green card themselves.\n  So within 4 years, anybody who comes in under this 400,000 per year, \nthey will be allowed to get a green card, and a green card, of course, \nis an automatic step toward citizenship. It is just a matter of time \nafter that--additionally, being able to speak English and not having \nbeen convicted of a felony or a serious crime--a felony.\n  We need to make sure. When we go through this tremendous move to \nregularize, it is what we calculate to be 30 million people in the next \n10 years. Counting the ones who are not here now, counting the ones who \nare coming in, plus the 10 or 12 million who are here, we are talking \nabout 30 million people. Are we certain? Will anyone come on this floor \nto explain and say with confidence: ``Jeff, after we do all that, don't \nworry about illegal immigration, we have the border system under \ncontrol now; we are not going to have any''? I don't think they can. I \ndon't think they will. Because it is not secure under the legislation \nthat is before us.\n  Second, many of the things in the legislation that are good, that \ncall for increased Border Patrol officers or increased detention space, \nare not funded. We have not appropriated the money. When this \nlegislation passes, which gives legal status to millions, we have no \nguarantee that any Congress will ever fund border control and security \nadequately. They have not yet. We have had that opportunity since \n1986--20 years--and we haven't done it. I believe the American people \nhave a right to be concerned about the bait and switch. It is like Lucy \nholding the football for Charlie Brown: Fool me once, shame on you; \nfool me twice, shame on me.\n  In 1986, I think that is basically what happened. We did the amnesty. \nWe didn't mind calling it amnesty then. We acknowledged it was amnesty. \nThis bill does exactly the same thing we did in 1986 in all significant \nand important respects, but they didn't get the enforcement at the \nborder. Now, instead of 3 million people as we had in 1986, here \nillegally, we have 11 million.\n  By the way, I would note that in 1986, they estimated this would be 1 \nmillion to 1.5 million people claiming amnesty. When they opened it up \nand let people qualify, 3 million qualified, twice the number that was \nexpected.\n  Some think we have 20 million people in our country illegally, and we \ncould see quite a large number there move up.\n  I would say to my colleagues, we do not need to move forward with \nthis legislation. A few tinkering amendments is not going to do the \ntrick. What we need to do is decide what we are going to do about the \npeople who are here, how we are going to handle them in a fair and just \nway that is consistent with our law. Second, we need to assure the \nAmerican people in a confident and effective way that our borders will \nbe fixed; we will have the computers, the aerial vehicles, the fencing, \nthe barriers, the ability to deport people who do not live on our \nborders--so-called ``other than Mexicans,'' OTMs--to China and Brazil \nand Ecuador and Haiti and El Salvador, that we are going to deal with \nthose criminal gangs which are here.\n  Once we can do that with confidence, I think maybe we can reach an \nagreement and accord. It is within our grasp to do so. But I have not \nsensed the will to see it done.\n  We hear a lot of talk. I urge my colleagues, my citizens, to listen \nto the remarks that are made on the floor by those who want to justify \nhow we have allowed this system to get out of control. Listen carefully \nto their promises to fix it. If you examine them carefully, I think you \nwill find that they are not substantial enough and we are going to end \nup, again, as we did in 1986, getting the legalization without getting \nthe enforcement.\n  I hope a lot of talk will continue in the days ahead. We will have a \nlot of debate on amendments on the floor, and as we move forward, I \nhope we get to the point where a bill could be passed such that we \ncould go home to our constituents and with integrity say we have done \nsomething worthwhile--we have improved the situation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I end tonight saying a few words about the \ndevastating storms that occurred last night in my home State of \nTennessee. First and foremost, I offer my deepest condolences to the \nfamilies who lost loved ones last night. My heart goes out to those \nfamilies who are reeling in the aftermath of this sudden and totally \nunexpected tragedy. The people of Tennessee grieve with you and our \nprayers are with you through this painful ordeal.\n  I let my fellow Tennesseans know I requested that the President have \na quick review and approval of the State's request for assistance. I \nhave also taken the opportunity to talk directly with acting FEMA \nDirector David Paulison to expect my clear support for the State's \nrequest. Director Paulison is looking into the matter, of course. We \nhad a good exchange. I appreciate FEMA's strong support.\n  Senator Alexander and I stand ready to assist the State and local \nofficials in any way possible to ensure our communities have the \nresources they need. We will pull together as Tennesseans and neighbors \nand together we will get through this awful crisis. Our thoughts and \nour hearts and prayers go out to others who have been affected by the \nstorms in other States.\n  When I talked to Director Paulison today, he was describing that \nthose storms were northwest of Tennessee, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last night, severe tornadoes and strong \nstorms swept through west Tennessee. Dyer and Gibson Counties were the \nhardest hit. According to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, at \nleast 23 individuals lost their lives in just those two counties. One \nof those killed was Jane King of Newbern, TN. She was a relative of \nCongressman John Tanner, and our thoughts are with John and Betty Ann \nTanner and all of Jane King's family.\n  At least 70 people have been injured as a result of the storms. TEMA \nexpects that number to rise. There is damage to at least 11 other \ncounties in west Tennessee. Thousands of Tennesseans have lost their \nhomes and their livelihoods. TEMA reports that 1,200 buildings were \ndamaged or destroyed in the town of Bradford alone.\n  Tennessee Emergency Management Agency officials are on the ground in \nthe counties affected. They are helping to survey damage. They are \noffering assistance. A state of emergency is in effect. The biggest \nneed thus far is to get the roads clear. GEN Gus Hargett has assigned \n30 members of the 230th Engineer Battalion of the Tennessee National \nGuard to assist with debris removal. The Dyersburg Armory is being used \nas a Red Cross processing site.\n  This afternoon, Senator Frist and I sent a letter to President Bush \nasking for speedy review and approval of the State's request for \nFederal disaster assistance. I ask unanimous consent that letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2006.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Last night devastating tornados swept \n     through several West Tennessee communities. In Dyer and \n     Gibson counties at least 23 individuals lost their lives. \n     Many others lost their homes and livelihoods. State and local \n     officials currently are assessing the damage.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about this \nimportant amendment on the Western Hemisphere travel initiative.\n  The Western Hemisphere travel initiative was authorized in the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 based on the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  It mandates that the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, implement \na new documentation program validating citizenship by January 1, 2008. \nOnce executed, all U.S. citizens crossing the Canadian or Mexican \nBorder into the United States will be required to carry a passport or \nother accepted documentation, such as a passcard, in order to verify \ntheir citizenship.\n  The DHS and the State Department are in the process of promulgating \nrules to implement this initiative and are considering executing the \nair and sea portion of this initiative by next January.\n  While the need to tighten security at our borders is an important \nundertaking, I am concerned that in their haste to accomplish this \nmission pursuant to a congressionally mandated timeline, DHS and the \nState Department may be overlooking serious concerns about the \nimplementation of this initiative raised by border States and Canada.\n  They are evaluating two options in order to identify citizenship. The \nfirst would require a person entering the United States to present a \npassport. However, passports are expensive and require weeks to \nacquire. The second alternative is the issuance of a passcard, which \nwould be slightly cheaper but would still require a background check \nand could only be used for travel between Canada, the United States, \nand Mexico.\n  Each of these options assumes that DHS and the State Department are \nable to process the flood of requests for passports and passcards. \nThere is no reasonable way they could get all of these requests \nprocessed by the deadline, thereby adversely affecting travel and \nbusiness for millions.\n  Take for example a military family reassigned from the lower 48 to \nEielson Air Force Base, Alaska, who has to drive from the lower 48 \nthrough Canada with all of their belongings. This family may not have \nthe opportunity or funds to acquire passport before traveling.\n  Alaska is the only State in the Nation that you have to pass through \na foreign country to get to by land. I have a lot of concerns about how \nthis initiative will affect travel.\n  Each year, a large number of people travel to Alaska from the lower \n48 on the Alaska-Canada Highway, also known as the Al-Can. Each summer, \nwe routinely see large numbers of RV's on the road with license plates \nfrom New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, California, everywhere. They are \nnow going\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nto need this card or a passport to get to another State. I worry about \nhow that will affect our tourism, as well as the opportunity for \nAmericans to visit one of the most beautiful places in this country.\n  These are just some of the situations which need to be considered \nbefore implementing this plan. I believe that DHS and the State \nDepartment are operating under an unrealistic time frame imposed by the \nact. We need to ensure that they have enough time to properly test and \nimplement the system, which includes biometrics and new equipment for \nthe borders, to ensure its effectiveness.\n  We share a special relationship with our friends in Canada, and I \nwould hate to see a hastily imposed initiative negatively affect \nmovement in and out of Canada, or negatively affect our relationship \nwith our neighbors.\n  The deadline Congress gave DHS is fast approaching, and with little \nprogress made so far. I think we need to pass this amendment to give \nDHS more time.\n  There is just too much at stake to rush this, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/03/senate-section/article/S2727-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    RECOGNIZING THE RETAIL MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION OF GREATER RICHMOND\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

What began \nas a small advocacy group founded by 12 merchants in 1906 has grown \ninto a thriving organization that serves 4 cities and 10 counties in \ncentral Virginia.\n  The Retail Merchants Association of Greater Richmond has worked \ntirelessly to ensure that its companies grow and prosper.

His keen insight into American and global political \nsystems did much to give his students an idea of how people are \ngoverned.\n  Dr. Chi is a gifted academic.

Because of this \nexpertise, he was selected to serve on advisory panels and commissions \non privatization for both the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Chi \nfor his dedication and commitment to teaching and academics. In order \nfor our society to continue to advance in the right direction, we must \nhave professors like Keon Chi in our institutions of higher learning, \nin our communities, and in our lives.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Central High \nSchool in Norwood Young America, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Central High School is truly a model of educational success. The \nschool earned its Award for Excellence in Education for its \ninterdisciplinary Holocaust Unit, which is required of all seniors for \ngraduation.\n  The Holocaust Unit has been a hallmark of Central High School for \nover 10 years. Mr. Mark Lagergren, a social studies teacher at Central, \ndeveloped the unit and has coordinated with several English teachers to \nteach it to all students.\n  Guest speakers, including Holocaust survivors, are invited to talk \nwith the students; students are assigned to read and discuss several \npertinent books; and students are required to produce a final, senior \nHolocaust project.\n  Ms. Kelly Street, an English teacher at Central High School and a \nCentral High graduate, shared with me the impact the unit has had on \nher life, saying, ``Before Mr. L's class we had heard references to the \nHolocaust, concentration camps and Hitler, but after his class we were \nmini-experts on the subject. I remember Mr. Lagergren's lectures and \nhow powerful they were; I could actually feel his passion for such a \nharrowing part of history. How can any human being not feel something \nafter seeing pictures and watching videos on the era, and then have \nthose pictures and videos followed by the passionate clarification of a \nteacher who has dedicated his career to the study of the Holocaust? It \nwas a blessing to be a part of it.''\n  Ms. Street was very appreciative of survivors' personal accounts, and \nshe credits Mr. Lagergren for having brought these survivors to share \ntheir profoundly personal stories.\n  Much of the credit for Central High School's success belongs to its \nprincipal, Ron Brand, and all the dedicated teachers. The students and \nstaff at Central High School understand that, in order to be \nsuccessful, a school must go beyond achieving academic success; it must \nalso provide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Central High School should be very \nproud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Central High School in Norwood Young America for \nwinning the Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/03/senate-section/article/S2727-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2727-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CENTURY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PARK RAPIDS, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Century \nElementary School, in Park Rapids, MN, which recently earned an Award \nfor Excellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative \nachievements in educating children.\n  Century Elementary School is truly a model of educational success. \nThe school, which enrols a large percentage of children from low-income \nfamilies, has achieved significant academic success.\n  Test scores in 2005 qualified the school for four stars in reading \nand five stars in mathematics from the Minnesota Department of \nEducation. In addition to receiving three stars in both reading and \nmathematics for having made adequate yearly progress, the school \nreceived an additional star in reading and math for outstanding \nperformance compared to schools with similar percentages of low-income \npupils. It received another star in math for having more than 30 \npercent of its students scoring at Level 5 on their Minnesota \nComprehensive Assessments, the highest possible level on these \nstatewide tests.\n  The year 2005 was the second successive year in which Century School \nreceived four or five stars. Last year, the school received five-star \nstatus in reading and four-star status in mathematics.\n  The Park Rapids School District has also recognized the advantages of \na full-day kindergarten program, and although the State funds a half-\nday program, the local school board has allocated sufficient funds to \nmake possible the full-day program.\n  Century Elementary's success is even more remarkable considering the \nlimited amount of funding available for the school district. The \ndistrict has attempted to pass an operating levy referendum four times \nto make up for lack of adequate funding from the State of Minnesota, \nbut these referenda failed to be approved. The district has been forced \nto lay off 42 teachers over the past 4 years accounting for a 30-\npercent reduction in total teachers.\n  Much of the credit for Century Elementary School's success belongs to \nits\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nprincipal, Mitch Peterson, and the dedicated teachers.

Advanced math and science courses \ninclude advanced placement calculus I and II, advanced placement \nphysics, chemistry, and advanced biology, ecology, and meteorology. \nExcellent vocational programs include industrial technical education, \nfamily and consumer science, business education, work experience, and \nagriculture/horticulture education.\n  As part of their academic program, highly motivated seniors can \nenroll in a comprehensive professional mentorship program, which offers \nreal-life experiences, including mentorships with surgeons, physicians, \nnurses, business professionals, theater professionals, undercover law \nenforcement personnel, and teachers. These opportunities have helped \nmany students explore their professional goals.\n  This year, carpentry students from Watertown-Mayer are building a \nmodel house, intended for sale at a public auction this spring. \nProceeds of the sale will be used to buy tools and supplies to help \ncontinue these opportunities for future students.\n  The academic successes of Watertown-Mayer are reflected in students' \ntest scores. Last year, Watertown-Mayer High School received five star \nratings in both math and reading. Fewer than 7 percent of all Minnesota \nschools have rated so well in both math and reading.\n  Watertown-Mayer High School's goal is to ``invest in the life of each \nand every student and to make a difference one child at a time.'' It is \nnot the curriculum that resonates for graduates of Watertown-Mayer but, \nrather, their personal experiences with the dedicated people who guided \ntheir learning and who truly make the school one of Minnesota's finest.\n  Much of the credit for Watertown-Mayer High School's success belongs \nto its principal, Scott Gengler, and the dedicated teachers.

At the same time, the school has taken the initiative to find \nnew, creative ways to improve children's reading academically. For ``I \nLove To Read Month'' in February, every classroom at Churchill \nElementary established a goal for the amount of reading the students \nwould collectively complete during the month. The children met every \ngoal.\n  At Churchill Elementary, many planned activities help motivate pupils \nto read. On Valentine's Day, the school hosted a ``Books for \nBreakfast.'' Families came to school to share a breakfast and reading \ntime together. Earlier in the month, Churchill hosted a family reading \nnight, for which families congregated in the media center to read books \ntogether.\n  These and other activities emphasize the importance of reading for \neach child's life. This year, during one week of the month, different \nmystery readers, including the police chief, the superintendent, and \nthe Cloquet mayor, were invited to read a story over the school \nintercom. All events culminated with a celebration on March 2nd, Dr. \nSeuss' birthday.\n  The success of these initiatives is reflected in the reading test \nscores at Churchill Elementary.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the payment of premiums for high deductible health plans, \nto allow a credit for certain employment taxes paid with respect to \npremiums for high deductible health plans and contributions to health \nsavings accounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp provide more affordable health coverage to millions of Americans. \nThis legislation makes commonsense changes that will create tax parity \nbetween employer-sponsored insurance and insurance purchased in the \nindividual market.\n  As we are well aware, the Federal tax code's treatment of medical \ncare has shaped the development of the private third-party system of \nfinancing health care in the United States. The tax code treats the \nself-employed, unemployed, and workers at companies that do not offer \nhealth insurance, most of which are small businesses, less generously \nthan it treats workers at companies that do offer health insurance. \nEmployer-sponsored insurance receives a tax subsidy that individually-\npurchased insurance does not, and as a result two-thirds of non-elderly \nAmericans receive health insurance through their own or a family \nmember's employer.\n  Of equal concern, the percent of employer-sponsored insurance has \ndropped from 69 percent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2005 due mainly to the \nrapid rise in health insurance premiums, which have increased more than \n60 percent in real terms over the past 5 years alone. The percent of \nthe non-elderly population with employer-sponsored insurance has \ncorrespondingly dropped, from 68 percent in 2000 to 63 percent in 2004. \nConsequently, more Americans must look to the non-group market for \ntheir health insurance needs.\n  To help rectify this disparity, the legislation I am introducing \ntoday would permit premiums for high-deductible plans purchased in \nconjunction with a qualifying health savings accounts (HAS) on the \nindividual market to be deductible from income taxes. In addition, an \nincome tax credit would offset payroll taxes paid on these premiums. As \nsuch, people who purchase their health benefits in the individual \nmarket would receive the same tax treatment as those who receive \nemployer-sponsored insurance.\n  Perhaps one of the most widespread criticisms of HSA plans is that \nthey are only helpful to those who are young, healthy, and wealthy. \nHowever, a recent survey conducted by America's Health Insurance Plans \nreveals this not to be the case. In that survey, it was shown that 50 \npercent of all people covered by HSA plans in the individual market are \n40 years of age or older. Moreover, 31 percent of new enrollees in HSA \nplans were previously uninsured.\n  My legislation would provide substantial savings to middle and low \nincome families. For example, a family in the 15 percent income tax \nbracket, and 15.3 percent payroll tax bracket, would receive a tax \nsubsidy of over $1,500 towards the purchase of a $5,000 family \ninsurance HSA-qualified policy.\n  Moreover, the income tax credit to offset payroll taxes is designed \nto help lower income workers. These hard-working Americans are more \nlikely to work for firms that do not offer health insurance, and many \nhave low enough incomes that they are paying no income taxes, but still \nmust pay payroll taxes. My bill helps to give them the affordable and \nquality health benefits they deserve.\n  Since being enacted in the Medicare Modernization Act, health savings \naccounts have helped to provide millions of Americans with an \nadditional option in meeting their health care needs. It is simply not \nfair that the law does not provide these plans with the same tax \ntreatment provided to employer-sponsored insurance. If we are to \nseriously begin addressing the rapidly rising cost of health care, it \nis imperative that we take steps now to ensure that available health \ncare plans are as affordable as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the definition of immediate relative for \npurposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kennedy to \nintroduce the Family Reunification Act, a\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nmeasure designed to remedy a regrettable injustice in our immigration \nlaws. A minor oversight in the law has led to an unfortunate, and \nlikely unintended, consequence. Parents of U.S. citizens are currently \nable to enter the country as legal permanent residents, but our laws do \nnot permit their minor children to join them. Simply put, the Family \nReunification Act will close this loophole by including the minor \nsiblings of U.S. citizens in the legal definition of ``immediate \nrelative.'' This legislation will ensure that our immigration laws can \nbetter accomplish one of the most important policy goals behind them--\nthe goal of strengthening the family unit.\n  Congress took an important first step in promoting family \nreunification when it enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act. By \nqualifying as ``immediate relatives,'' this law currently offers \nparents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens the ability to obtain \nimmigrant visas to enter the country legally.\n  We can all agree that this is good immigration policy. Unfortunately, \na ``glitch'' in this law has undermined the effectiveness of the \nimportant principle of family reunification. Each year, a number of \nfamilies--in Wisconsin and across the country--are finding that they \ncannot take full advantage of this family reunification provision.\n  Today, U.S. citizens often petition for their parents to be admitted \nto the United States as ``immediate relatives.'' As I have said, that \nis clearly allowed under current law. It is not always quite that \nsimple, though. In a small number of cases, a problem arises because \nminor siblings of U.S. citizens do not qualify as an ``immediate \nrelative'' under current law. So, a young man or woman can bring his \nparents into the country, but not his or her 5-year-old brother or \nsister. Because the parents are unable to leave a young child behind, \nthe child is not the only family member who does not come to the United \nStates. The parents--forced to choose between their children--are \neffectively prevented from coming as well. The result, then, is that we \nare unnecessarily keeping families apart by excluding minor siblings \nfrom the definition of immediate relative.\n  For example, one family in my home State of Wisconsin is truly a \ntextbook example of what is wrong with this law. Effiong and Ekon Okon, \nboth U.S. citizens by birth, requested that their parents, who were \nliving in Nigeria, be admitted as ``immediate relatives.'' The law \nclearly allows for this. Their father, Leo, had already joined them in \nWisconsin, and their mother, Grace, was in possession of a visa, ready \nto join the rest of her family. However, Grace was unable to join her \nhusband and sons in the United States because their 6-year-old \ndaughter, Daramfon, did not qualify as an ``immediate relative.'' \nBecause it would be unthinkable for her to abandon her small child, \nGrace was forced to stay behind in Nigeria, separated from the rest of \nher family. That is not what this law was intended to accomplish.\n  It is difficult to determine the exact scope of this problem. Because \nminor siblings do not qualify for visas, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, does not keep track of how many families have been \nadversely affected. What we do know, however, is that the cases in my \nhome State are not unique. Though the number is admittedly not large, \nDHS has notified us that they run into this problem regularly, with the \nnumber reaching into the hundreds each year.\n  If only one family suffers because of this loophole, I would suggest \nthat changes should be made. The fact that there have been numerous \ncases, probably in the hundreds, demands that we address this issue \nnow, so we can avoid tearing even more families apart.\n  Many parts of our immigration laws are outdated and in need of \nrepair. The definition of ``immediate relative'' is no different. \nCongress's intent when it granted ``immediate relatives'' the right to \nobtain immigrant visas was to promote family reunification, but the \nunfortunate oversight which Senator Kennedy and I have highlighted has \ninterfered with many families' opportunity to do just that. The \nlegislation introduced today would expand the definition of ``immediate \nrelatives'' to include the minor siblings of U.S. citizens. By doing \nso, we can truly provide our fellow citizens with the ability to \nreunite with their family members. This is a simple and modest solution \nto an unthinkable problem that too many families have already had to \nface, so I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF IMMEDIATE RELATIVE.\n\n       Section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)) is amended by inserting ``For \n     purposes of this subsection, a child of a parent of a citizen \n     of the United States shall be considered an immediate \n     relative if the child is accompanying or following to join \n     the parent.'' after ``at least 21 years of age.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2497. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nState courts to develop and implement State courts interpreter \nprograms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Durbin, to introduce the State Court Interpreter Grant Program \nAct of 2006. This legislation would create a modest grant program to \nprovide much needed financial assistance to States for developing and \nimplementing effective State court interpreter programs, helping to \nensure fair trials for individuals with limited English proficiency.\n  States are legally required, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to court \nproceedings for individuals with limited English proficiency. \nCurrently, however, court interpreting services vary greatly by State. \nSome States have highly developed programs. Others are trying to get \nprograms up and running, but lack adequate funds. Still others have no \ncertification program at all. It is critical that we protect the \nconstitutional right to a fair trial by adequately funding State court \ninterpreter programs.\n  Our States are finding themselves in an impossible position. \nQualified interpreters are in short supply because it is difficult to \nfind individuals who are both bilingual and well-versed in legal \nterminology. The skills required of a court interpreter differ \nsignificantly from those required of other interpreters or translators. \nLegal English is a highly particularized area of the language, and \nrequires special training. Although anyone with fluency in a foreign \nlanguage could attempt to translate a court proceeding, the best \ninterpreters are those that have been tested and certified as official \ncourt interpreters.\n  Making the problem worse, States continue to fall further behind as \nthe number of Americans with limited English proficiency--and therefore \nthe demand for court interpreter services--continues to grow. According \nto the most recent Census data, 18 percent of the population over age \nfive speaks a language other than English at home. In 2000, the number \nof people in this country who spoke English less than ``very well'' was \nmore than 21 million, approaching twice what the number was 10 years \nearlier. Illinois had more than 1 million. Texas had nearly 2.7 \nmillion. California had more than 6.2 million.\n  The shortage of qualified interpreters has become a national problem, \nand it has serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, a Committee \nestablished by the Supreme Court called the State's interpreter program \n``backward'' and said that the lack of qualified interpreters \n``undermines the ability of the . . . court system to determine facts \naccurately and to dispense justice fairly.'' When interpreters are \nunqualified, or untrained, mistakes are made. The result is that the \nfundamental right to due process is too often lost in translation. And, \nbecause the lawyers and judges are not interpreters, these mistakes \noften go unnoticed.\n  Some of the stories associated with this problem are simply \nunbelievable. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a husband accused of \nabusing his wife was asked to translate as his wife testified in court.\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\n  This legislation addresses this problem by authorizing $15 million \nper year, for the next five years, for a State Court Interpreter Grant \nProgram. Those States that apply would be eligible for a $100,000 base \ngrant allotment. In addition, $5 million would be set aside for States \nthat demonstrate extraordinary need. The remainder of the money would \nbe distributed on a formula basis, determined by the percentage of \npersons in that State over the age of five who speak a language other \nthan English at home.\n  Some will undoubtedly question whether this modest amount can make a \ndifference. It can, and my home State of Wisconsin is a testament to \nthat. When Wisconsin's program got off the ground in 2004, using State \nmoney along with a $250,000 Federal grant, certified interpreters were \nscarce. Now, just two years later, it has 43 certified interpreters. \nMost of those are Spanish, where the greatest need exists. However, the \nState also has interpreters certified in sign language and Russian. The \nlist of provisional interpreters--those who have received training and \npassed written tests--is much longer, including individuals trained in \nArabic, Hmong, Korean, and other languages. All of this progress in \nonly two years, and with only $250,000 of Federal assistance.\n  This legislation has the strong support of State court administrators \nand State supreme court justices around the country.\n  Our States face this difficult challenge, and Federal law requires \nthem to meet it. Despite their noble efforts, many of them are failing. \nIt is time we lend them a helping hand. This is an access issue, and no \none should be denied justice or access to our courts merely because of \na language barrier.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Court Interpreter \n     Grant Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fair administration of justice depends on the \n     ability of all participants in a courtroom proceeding to \n     understand that proceeding, regardless of their English \n     proficiency;\n       (2) 19 percent of the population of the United States over \n     5 years of age speaks a language other than English at home;\n       (3) only qualified court interpreters can ensure that \n     persons with limited English proficiency comprehend judicial \n     proceedings in which they are a party;\n       (4) the knowledge and skills required of a qualified court \n     interpreter differ substantially from those required in other \n     interpretation settings, such as social service, medical, \n     diplomatic, and conference interpreting;\n       (5) the Federal Government has demonstrated its commitment \n     to equal administration of justice regardless of English \n     proficiency;\n       (6) regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, as well as the guidance issued by the Department \n     of Justice pursuant to Executive Order 13166, issued August \n     11, 2000, clarify that all recipients of Federal financial \n     assistance, including State courts, are required to take \n     reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their \n     proceedings for persons with limited English proficiency;\n       (7) 34 States have developed, or are developing, court \n     interpreting programs;\n       (8) robust, effective court interpreter programs--\n       (A) actively recruit skilled individuals to be court \n     interpreters;\n       (B) train those individuals in the interpretation of court \n     proceedings;\n       (C) develop and use a thorough, systematic certification \n     process for court interpreters; and\n       (D) have sufficient funding to ensure that a qualified \n     interpreter will be available to the court whenever \n     necessary; and\n       (9) Federal funding is necessary to--\n       (A) encourage State courts that do not have court \n     interpreter programs to develop them;\n       (B) assist State courts with nascent court interpreter \n     programs to implement them;\n       (C) assist State courts with limited court interpreter \n     programs to enhance them; and\n       (D) assist State courts with robust court interpreter \n     programs to make further improvements and share successful \n     programs with other States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 420\n\n       Whereas psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are serious, \n     chronic, inflammatory, disfiguring, and life-altering \n     diseases that require sophisticated medical intervention and \n     care;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, \n     between 5,800,000 citizens and 7,500,000 citizens of the \n     United States are affected by psoriasis;\n       Whereas psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are--\n       (1) painful and disabling diseases with no cure; and\n       (2) diseases that have a significant and adverse impact on \n     the quality of life of individuals diagnosed with them;\n       Whereas studies have indicated that psoriasis may cause as \n     much physical and mental disability as other major diseases, \n     including--\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\n       (1) cancer;\n       (2) arthritis;\n       (3) hypertension;\n       (4) heart disease;\n       (5) diabetes; and\n       (6) depression;\n       Whereas studies have shown that psoriasis is associated \n     with elevated rates of depression and suicidal ideation;\n       Whereas citizens of the United States spend between \n     $2,000,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 to treat psoriasis each \n     year;\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic \n     arthritis may help prevent irreversible joint damage;\n       Whereas treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents \n     a challenge for patients and health care providers because--\n       (1) no single treatment works for every patient diagnosed \n     with the disease;\n       (2) some treatments lose effectiveness over time; and\n       (3) all treatments have the potential to cause a unique set \n     of side effects;\n       Whereas, although safer and more effective treatments are \n     now more readily available, many people do not have access to \n     them; and\n       Whereas Congress as an institution, and the members of \n     Congress as individuals, are in a unique position to help \n     raise public awareness about the need for increased access to \n     effective treatment options for psoriasis and psoriatic \n     arthritis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes--\n       (A) the need for enhanced public awareness of psoriasis;\n       (B) the adverse impact that psoriasis can have on people \n     living with the disease; and\n       (C) the importance of an early diagnosis and proper \n     treatment of psoriasis;\n       (2) supports the continuing leadership provided by the \n     Director of the National Institutes of Health and the \n     Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for identifying a cure and \n     developing safer, more effective treatments for psoriasis and \n     psoriatic arthritis; and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) researchers to examine the negative psychological and \n     physical effects of psoriasis to better understand its impact \n     on those who have been diagnosed with the disease; and\n       (B) efforts to increase access to treatments and care that \n     individuals living with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis \n     need and deserve.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the junior \nSenator from Oregon in submitting this resolution to raise public \nawareness about and encourage medical research on psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis. This resolution also promotes greater access to \ncare for those suffering from these disorders. It is my hope that \nCongress will continue to aid efforts in the medical community to \ndiagnose, treat, and eventually cure this disease.\n  Psoriasis is a non-contagious, immune-mediated, lifelong skin \ndisorder that has been diagnosed in more than 5 million men, women, and \nchildren in the United States. The source of psoriasis is believed to \nhave a genetic component which triggers a faster growth cycle of skin \ncells that result in build-up; however, the exact cause is unknown.\n  Psoriatic arthritis is a condition associated with psoriasis. This \ndisease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints and connective \ntissue, which causes stiffness, pain, swelling, and tenderness of the \njoints and the tissue around them. Without treatment, psoriatic \narthritis can be potentially disabling and crippling. Approximately 10 \nto 30 percent of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis.\n  The National Institutes of Health, NIH, estimates that 5.8-7.5 \nmillion people are living with psoriasis. Each year, the United States \nspends $4.0 billion to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. \nFurthermore, about 56 million hours of work are lost each year by \npeople who suffer from psoriasis. The National Institute of Mental \nHealth has found that psoriasis can cause as much physical and mental \ndisability as other major diseases. Researchers are still searching for \na cure for psoriasis. In the meantime, we must continue to raise \nawareness, to support research efforts to cure this disease, and to \ntreat those living with it.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/03/senate-section/article/S2736-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2736-S2737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3220.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 703.

Ms. LANDRIEU submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nto amendment SA 3192 submitted by Mr. Specter (for himself, Mr. Leahy, \nand Mr. Hagel) to the bill S. 2454, to amend the Immigration and \nNationality Act to provide for comprehensive reform and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n                 TITLE __--INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION REFORM\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Intercountry Adoption \n     Reform Act of 2006'' or the ``ICARE Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2004, they adopted 23,460 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of children without a permanent family \n     and the United States citizens who are waiting to bring them \n     into their families, reforms are needed in the intercountry \n     adoption process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) Before adoption, each child should have the benefit of \n     measures taken to ensure that intercountry adoption is in his \n     or her best interest and that prevents the abduction, \n     selling, or trafficking of children.\n       (8) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign-born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (9) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (10) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n       (11) Therefore, foreign-born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (12) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign-born child immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (13) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted \n     foreign-born child, except through the naturalization \n     process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure the any adoption of a foreign-born child by \n     parents in the United States is carried out in the manner \n     that is in the best interest of the child;\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n       (2) to ensure that foreign-born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent; and\n       (3) to improve the intercountry adoption process to make it \n     more citizen friendly and focused on the protection of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Adoptable child.--The term ``adoptable child'' has the \n     same meaning given such term in section 101(c)(3) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(c)(3)), as \n     added by section __24(a) of this Act.\n       (2) Ambassador at large.--The term ``Ambassador at Large'' \n     means the Ambassador at Large for Intercountry Adoptions \n     appointed to head the Office pursuant to section __11(b).\n       (3) Competent authority.--The term ``competent authority'' \n     means the entity or entities authorized by the law of the \n     child's country of residence to engage in permanent placement \n     of children who are no longer in the legal or physical \n     custody of their biological parents.\n       (4) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n     Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption, done at The Hague on May \n     29, 1993.\n       (5) Full and final adoption.--The term ``full and final \n     adoption'' means an adoption--\n       (A) that is completed according to the laws of the child's \n     country of residence or the State law of the parent's \n     residence;\n       (B) under which a person is granted full and legal custody \n     of the adopted child;\n       (C) that has the force and effect of severing the child's \n     legal ties to the child's biological parents;\n       (D) under which the adoptive parents meet the requirements \n     of section __25; and\n       (E) under which the child has been adjudicated to be an \n     adoptable child in accordance with section __26.\n       (6) Office.--The term ``Office'' means the Office of \n     Intercountry Adoptions established under section __11(a).\n       (7) Readily approvable.--A petition or certification is \n     ``readily approvable'' if the documentary support provided \n     along with such petition or certification demonstrates that \n     the petitioner satisfies the eligibility requirements and no \n     additional information or investigation is necessary.\n\n          Subtitle A--ADMINISTRATION OF INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS\n\n     SEC. __11.

\n     and\n       (iii) promote or facilitate travel of such individuals \n     between their country of origin and the United States; and\n       (C) any other matters that the Secretary of State and the \n     appropriate officials of the foreign government consider \n     appropriate to enable nationals of the foreign country who \n     are participating in the temporary work program to maintain \n     strong ties to their country of origin.\n       (b) Bilateral Efforts With Mexico to Reduce Migration \n     Pressures and Costs.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Migration from Mexico to the United States is directly \n     linked to the degree of economic opportunity and the standard \n     of living in Mexico.\n       (B) Mexico comprises a prime source of migration to the \n     United States.\n       (C) Remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United \n     States reached a record high of nearly $17,000,000,000 in \n     2004.\n       (D) Migration patterns may be reduced from Mexico to the \n     United States by addressing the degree of economic \n     opportunity available to Mexican citizens.\n       (E) Many Mexican assets are held extra-legally and cannot \n     be readily used as collateral for loans.\n       (F) A majority of Mexican businesses are small- or medium-\n     sized with limited access to financial capital.\n       (G) These factors constitute a major impediment to broad-\n     based economic growth in Mexico.\n       (H) Approximately 20 percent of the population of Mexico \n     works in agriculture, with the majority of this population \n     working on small farms rather than large commercial \n     enterprises.\n       (I) The Partnership for Prosperity is a bilateral \n     initiative launched jointly by the President of the United \n     States and the President of Mexico in 2001, which aims to \n     boost the social and economic standards of Mexican citizens, \n     particularly in regions where economic growth has lagged and \n     emigration has increased.\n       (J) The Presidents of Mexico and of the United States and \n     the Prime Minister of Canada, at their trilateral summit on \n     March 23, 2005, established the Security and Prosperity \n     Partnership of North America to promote economic growth, \n     competitiveness, and quality of life throughout North \n     America.\n       (2) Sense of congress regarding partnership for \n     prosperity.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States and Mexico should accelerate the implementation of the \n     Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America to help \n     generate economic growth and improve the standard of living \n     in Mexico, which will lead to reduced migration, by--\n       (A) increasing access for poor and under served populations \n     in Mexico to the financial services sector, including credit \n     unions;\n       (B) assisting Mexican efforts to formalize its extra-legal \n     sector, including the issuance of formal land titles, to \n     enable Mexican citizens to use their assets to procure \n     capital;\n       (C) facilitating Mexican efforts to establish an effective \n     rural lending system for small- and medium-sized farmers that \n     will--\n       (i) provide long term credit to borrowers;\n       (ii) develop a viable network of regional and local \n     intermediary lending institutions; and\n       (iii) extend financing for alternative rural economic \n     activities beyond direct agricultural production;\n       (D) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of \n     remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings \n     available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;\n       (E) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt \n     internationally recognized corporate governance practices, \n     including anti-corruption and transparency principles;\n       (F) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at \n     all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and \n     accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the \n     single biggest obstacle to development;\n       (G) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all \n     provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging \n     the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the \n     Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;\n       (H) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen \n     education and training opportunities throughout the country, \n     with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and\n       (I) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (3) Sense of congress regarding bilateral partnership on \n     health care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (A) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n       (B) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the region along the international \n     border between the United States and Mexico;\n       (C) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (D) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector to cover the health care needs of \n     Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3248.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Secure and Safe Detention \n     and Asylum Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The origin of the United States is that of a land of \n     refuge. Many of our Nation's founders fled here to escape \n     persecution for their political opinion, their ethnicity, and \n     their religion. Since that time, the United States has \n     honored its history and founding values by standing against \n     persecution around the world, offering refuge to those who \n     flee from oppression, and welcoming them as contributors to a \n     democratic society.\n       (2) The right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution is \n     a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated \n     in numerous international instruments ratified by the United \n     States, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     as well as the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of \n     Refugees and the Convention Against Torture. United States \n     law also guarantees the right to seek asylum and protection \n     from return to territories where one would have a well-\n     founded fear of persecution on account of one's race, \n     religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \n     group, or political opinion.\n       (3) The United States has long recognized that asylum \n     seekers often must flee their persecutors with false \n     documents, or no documents at all. The second person in \n     United States history to receive honorary citizenship by Act \n     of Congress was Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, in \n     gratitude for his issuance of more than 20,000 false Swedish \n     passports to Hungarian Jews to assist them flee the \n     Holocaust.\n       (4) In 1996, Congress amended section 235(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, to authorize immigration \n     officers to detain and expeditiously remove aliens without \n     proper documents, if that alien does not have a credible fear \n     of persecution.\n       (5) Section 605 of the International Religious Freedom Act \n     of 1998 subsequently authorized the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom to appoint experts to \n     study the treatment of asylum seekers subject to expedited \n     removal.\n       (6) The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security fully \n     cooperated with the Commission, which reviewed thousands of \n     previously unreleased statistics, approximately 1,000 files \n     and records of proceeding related to expedited removal \n     proceedings, observed more than 400 inspections, interviewed \n     200 aliens in expedited removal proceedings at seven ports of \n     entry, and surveyed 19 detention facilities and all eight \n     asylum offices. The Commission released its findings on \n     February 8, 2005.\n       (7) Among its major findings, the Commission found that, \n     while the Congress, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service, and the Department of Homeland Security developed a \n     number of processes to prevent bona fide asylum seekers from \n     being expeditiously removed, these procedures were routinely \n     disregarded by many immigration officers, placing the asylum \n     seekers at risk, and undermining the reliability of evidence \n     created for immigration enforcement purposes. The specific \n     findings include the following:\n       (A) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the immigration officer read a script to the alien that the \n     alien should ask for protection--without delay--if the alien \n     has any reason to fear of being returned home. Yet in more \n     than 50 percent of the expedited removal interviews observed \n     by the Commission, this information was not conveyed to the \n     applicant.\n       (B) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the alien review the sworn statement taken by the immigration \n     officer, make any necessary corrections for errors in \n     interpretation, and then sign the statement. The Commission \n     found, however, that 72 percent of the time, the alien signs \n     his sworn statement without the opportunity to review it.\n       (C) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken by \n     the officer are not verbatim, are not verifiable, often \n     attribute that information was conveyed to the alien which \n     was never, in fact, conveyed, and sometimes contain questions \n     which were never asked. These sworn statements look like \n     verbatim transcripts but are not. Yet the Commission also \n     found that, in 32 percent of the cases where the immigration \n     judges found the asylum applicant were not credible, they \n     specifically relied on these sworn statements.\n       (D) Department of Homeland Security regulations also \n     require that, when an alien expresses a fear of return, he \n     must be referred to an asylum officer to determine whether \n     his fear is ``credible.'' Yet, in nearly 15 percent of the \n     cases which we observed, aliens who expressed a fear of \n     return were nevertheless removed without a referral to an \n     asylum officer.\n       (8) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken \n     during expedited removal proceedings were reliable for \n     neither enforcement nor protection purposes because \n     Department of Homeland Security management reviewed only the \n     paperwork created by the interviewing officer. The agency had \n     no national quality assurance procedures to ensure that paper \n     files are an accurate representation of the actual interview. \n     The Commission recommended recording all interviews between \n     Department of Homeland Security officers and aliens subject \n     to expedited removal, and that procedures be established to \n     ensure that these recordings are reviewed to ensure \n     compliance.\n       (9) The Commission found that the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) issued policy guidance on \n     December 30, 1997, defining criteria for decisions to \n     releasing asylum seekers from detention. Neither the INS nor \n     the Department of Homeland Security, however, had been \n     following this, or any other discernible criteria, for \n     detaining or releasing asylum seekers. The Study's review of \n     Department of Homeland Security statistics revealed that \n     release rates varied widely, between 5 percent and 95 \n     percent, in different regions.\n       (10) In order to promote the most efficient use of \n     detention resources and a humane yet secure approach to \n     detention of aliens with a credible fear of persecution, the \n     Commission urged that the Department of Homeland Security \n     develop procedures to ensure that a release decision is taken \n     at the time of the credible fear determination or as soon as \n     or as soon as feasible thereafter. Upon a determination that \n     the alien has established credible fear, identity and \n     community ties, and that the alien is not subject to any \n     possible bar to asylum involving violence, misconduct, or \n     threat to national security, the alien should be released \n     from detention pending an asylum determination. The \n     Commission also urged that the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     establish procedures to ensure consistent implementation of \n     release criteria, as well as the consideration of requests to \n     consider new evidence relevant to the determination.\n       (11) In 1986, the United States, as a member of the \n     Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees, noted that in view of the hardship which it \n     involves, detention of asylum-seekers should normally be \n     avoided; that detention measures taken in respect of refugees \n     and asylum-seekers should be subject to judicial or \n     administrative review; that conditions of detention of \n     refugees and asylum seekers must be humane; and that refugees \n     and asylum-seekers shall, whenever possible, not be \n     accommodated with persons detained as criminals.\n       (12) The USCIRF Study found that the Department of Homeland \n     Security detains the vast majority of noncriminal asylum \n     seekers, as well as other noncriminal aliens, under \n     inappropriate and potentially harmful conditions in jails and \n     jail-like facilities. This occurs in spite of the development \n     of a small number of successful nonpunitive detention \n     facilities, such as those in Broward County Florida and Berks \n     County, Pennsylvania.\n       (13) The Commission found that nearly all of the detention \n     centers where asylum seekers are detained resemble, in every \n     essential respect, conventional jails. Often, aliens with no \n     criminal record are detained alongside criminals and criminal \n     aliens. The standards applied by Bureau of Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement for all of their detention facilities are \n     identical to, and modeled after, correctional standards for \n     criminal populations. In some facilities with ``correctional \n     dormitory'' set-ups, there are large numbers of detainees \n     sleeping, eating, going to the bathroom, and showering out in \n     the open in one brightly lit, windowless, and locked room. \n     Recreation in Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     facilities often consists of unstructured activity of no more \n     than one hour per day in a small outdoor space surrounded by \n     high concrete walls.\n       (14) A study conducted by Physicians for Human Rights and \n     the Bellevue/New York University Program for Survivors of \n     Torture found that the mental health of asylum seekers was \n     extremely poor, and worsened the longer individuals were in \n     detention. This included high levels of anxiety, depression, \n     and post-traumatic stress disorder. The study also raised \n     concerns about inadequate access to health services, \n     particularly mental health services. Asylum seekers \n     interviewed consistently reported being treated like \n     criminals, in violation of international human rights norms, \n     which contributed to worsening of their mental health. \n     Additionally, asylum seekers reported verbal abuse and \n     inappropriate threats and use of solitary confinement.\n       (15) The Commission recommended that the secure but \n     nonpunitive detention facility in Broward County Florida \n     Broward provided a more appropriate framework for those \n     asylum seekers who are not appropriate candidates for \n     release.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To ensure that personnel within the Department of \n     Homeland Security follow procedures designed to protect bona \n     fide asylum seekers from being returned to places where they \n     may face persecution.\n       (2) To ensure that persons who affirmatively apply for \n     asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection and \n     noncriminal detainees are not subject to arbitrary detention.\n       (3) To ensure that asylum seekers, families with children, \n     noncriminal aliens, and other vulnerable populations, who are \n     not eligible for release, are detained under appropriate and \n     humane conditions.\n\n     SEC. __03.
