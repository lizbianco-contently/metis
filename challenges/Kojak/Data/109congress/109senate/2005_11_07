Mr. President, later this afternoon, I have the honor of \nhosting Sudan's First Vice President, Salva Kiir, in the U.S. Capitol. \nI have come to the floor many times to speak on Sudan, having gone to \nthat country just about every year for the last 7 or 8 years, having \nspent most of that time in southern Sudan. I look forward to being with \nand hosting Salva Kiir, who is a founding member of the SPLM, the Sudan \nPeople's Liberation Movement.\n  In January of this year, the SPLM and the Sudanese Government in \nKhartoum signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, bringing an end to \n21 years of a brutal civil war, a civil war that has destroyed much of \nthat country, especially in the south.\n  When I first started going to Sudan, literally there was no hospital \nin southern Sudan, and the one hospital that was eventually reopened \nwas a hospital that had been closed about 18 years previously, with \nlandmines placed all around that hospital. It destroyed health care \nthere, obviously, but it had destroyed commerce, any touch of humanity, \nand had driven the entire southern population out of villages, \ndispersing them, with 5 million people displaced and about 2 million \npeople who died in that civil war.\n  In June of this year, longtime SPLM chairman and a very close friend \nof mine, Dr. John Garang, went back to Khartoum for the first time in \n21 years. It was a momentous time. At that time, he was sworn in as \nFirst Vice President of Sudan. Up until that time,\n\n[[Page S12416]]\n\nhe had always been in southern Sudan. It was a historic moment not that \nlong ago, cheered by millions and millions of Sudanese.\n  Tragically, 1 month later, on July 30, the helicopter that was \ncarrying Dr. Garang and his passengers crashed, a sudden crash. Why it \ncrashed nobody knows.\n\n  Salva Kiir replaced Dr. Garang as First Vice President, and he \npromises to carry forward this peace process, which is challenging, but \nit can be accomplished.\n  His predecessor had worked very hard over many years to take that \ncountry to the point of peace. Under that peace agreement, Sudan enters \na 6-year interim period, and 4 years into that, at the 4-year mark, \nnationwide elections will be held at the provincial and national \nlevels. The interim period will culminate with a vote by the people in \nsouthern Sudan to decide their political future.\n  It is a fragile moment for Sudan, but it is one for great hope.\n  I had gotten involved and worked very hard with Dr. Garang and other \nleaders of the SPLA and SPLM. I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. \nGarang many times. I was hosted last August at his home in a place \ncalled New Site in southern Sudan, where I spent several days with Dr. \nGarang and his wife.\n  This June, not that long ago, I had the opportunity to host Dr. \nGarang in my Capitol office. During that meeting, he emphasized to me, \nlooking me directly in the eye, that for the peace to hold, both \nparties must fulfill their obligations. He stressed that continued \npressure from the United States is absolutely critical to ensure that \nthese obligations are met.\n  The civil war and its aftermath have created a staggering \nhumanitarian crisis. I mentioned 5 million people displaced from their \nhomes and over 2 million people have died. That subjects the country to \na famine and deterioration and destruction of health care systems and \neducation infrastructure. International assistance in education, in \nbuilding of roads, in the infrastructure of health care can help show a \ntraumatized nation, after 21 years of civil war, that peace is the only \nway forward.\n  As I mentioned, this is a critical moment for Sudan. Many southerners \nhave expressed concern about the unfair distribution and domination of \nkey Cabinet posts by the ruling party. Soldiers from southern Sudan are \nstill waiting for a decision regarding the formation of what are called \nJoint Integrated Units, with troops from the north and the south \nparticipating together, side by side. And violence against civilians in \nsouthern Sudan is slowing down, hindering humanitarian and \nreconstruction efforts in this war-ravaged region of the country.\n  The road forward is not going to be easy. In the best of worlds, it \nis not going to be easy. Millions have lost their lives in this 21 \nyears of struggle. But the days, weeks, and months ahead do hold great \npromise not only for the north and the south but for the entire \ncountry.\n  During our meeting this afternoon, I hope to hear Salva Kiir's \nassessment of the peace process and his suggestions, his counsel, his \nrecommendations on how we in this body and the United States can help.\n  I also hope to discuss the deteriorating situation in Sudan's western \nregion, Darfur. Last week on the floor, I summarized again the \ndeterioration of what is happening in that Darfur region. I also had \nthe opportunity to visit, a little over a year ago, the country west of \nDarfur, Chad, where there are so many refugees today.\n  In the past few weeks, we have witnessed a serious escalation in \nviolence among the Jingaweit militias who are supported by government \nforces. They are ravaging villages, they are ravaging these refugee \ncamps and attacking--and these are the descriptions we continue to \nget--attacking civilians, attacking humanitarian groups, and attacking \nthe African Union peacekeeping forces.\n  The recent split among the leadership of Darfur's main rebel group \nfurther threatens to undermine the peace talks that are scheduled to \nresume in the Nigerian capital on November 21, a couple of weeks from \nnow.\n  It is imperative that all parties bring the violence to a halt. Only \npeaceful negotiations and dialog ultimately are going to bring true \nresolution. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement shows that it can be \ndone.\n  Before his death, Dr. Garang told a hopeful country that the peace \nagreement between the north and the south--and these are his words--\nwill change Sudan forever and engulf the country in a democratic and \nfundamental transformation.'' And he is right.\n  It is now First Vice President Kiir's great challenge and opportunity \nto carry forward that torch and lead his country toward that permanent \nand lasting peace.\n  I look forward to our discussion this afternoon. On behalf of the \nAmerican people, I offer our hope and our optimism to the First Vice \nPresident and to the people of Sudan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12416-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nLevin's amendment to create an independent commission to investigate \nthe policies and practices relating to the treatment of what we have \ncome to call detainees but what are, in fact, prisoners being held by \nthe Government.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of that important amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  Let me say a word, initially, about the use of language. We sometimes \nuse language without focusing on the implications of that language. \nUnfortunately, in the case of this discussion, we have fallen into the \npractice of referring to these individuals at Guantanamo and elsewhere \nas ``detainees.'' Of course, the suggestion that someone is being \ndetained is a lot less onerous or implies a lot less of a taking of \nthat person's freedom than the phrase ``being imprisoned.'' The truth \nis, these individuals are being imprisoned.\n  The amendment that Senator Levin has offered would have an \nindependent commission evaluate the current practice of indefinitely \nimprisoning individuals at Guantanamo without ever charging them with a \ncrime in either Federal court or under a competent military tribunal.\n  This commission would then report back to Congress and give us \nrecommendations on whether we should change existing law or change \npolicy on this set of important issues. The current practice of holding \ndetainees or prisoners indefinitely, without affording them basic due \nprocess rights, has been widely criticized in this country and \nthroughout the world. For a country such as ours that has consistently \nadvocated for the rule of law, the policies of the current \nadministration are nothing short of a major embarrassment.\n  Since September 11 of 2001, the administration has asserted \nextraordinary new powers with respect to the imprisoning of individuals \nsuspected of being involved in terrorism. The President has argued that \nthe Government has the authority to indefinitely imprison any person \nthat he, the President, determines to be an ``enemy combatant.'' They \nhave that authority whether or not the person is a U.S. citizen. Of \ncourse, our Government has also forcefully opposed any judicial review \nof the President's determination in that regard.\n  There are over 500 people who are currently being imprisoned in \nGuantanamo. Many of these individuals have been held for over 3 years \nwithout being afforded the ability to challenge the basis for their \ndetention. The administration has developed a new category of detainee, \nthe ``unlawful enemy combatant,'' and they have argued that neither the \nlaws of war nor traditional criminal laws apply to these individuals. \nIn essence, we have created a new type of prisoner who is unable to \nseek the protections of the Geneva Conventions or to take advantage of \nthe rights afforded to individuals in this country under our criminal \njustice system or\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\nunder the criminal justice system that applies in our military. Under \nthe current procedures, every Guantanamo prisoner is reviewed by a \ncombatant status review tribunal to determine whether the Department of \nDefense believes that individual is an ``enemy combatant.'' If a person \nis found to be an enemy combatant, they may be held indefinitely, \nalthough they are entitled to go before an administrative review board \nonce a year to prove that they are no longer a threat. Of the \napproximately 500 prisoners at Guantanamo, 4 individuals have been \ncharged to date. The remaining 496 or so have not been charged.\n  Serious concerns have been raised with regard to the rights we are \naffording these prisoners under the current procedures for processing \nthe prisoners. I have repeatedly raised concerns regarding this \napproach. I believe that it challenges our historic commitment to the \nrule of law. I have never advocated that the Department of Defense \nrelease these prisoners but, rather, have said that they should be \ntried in the criminal justice system or they should be tried in the \nmilitary justice system, but they should be tried somewhere and be \ngiven an opportunity to challenge the basis for their detention. I \nbelieve it is appropriate to ensure that they do not indefinitely \nremain in a state of legal limbo and are afforded basic due process \nrights that allow them to assert their innocence.\n  Last week, on November 1, there was an article in The Washington Post \nthat highlighted some of the problems that occur when people are \nimprisoned indefinitely without recourse to any viable legal process. \nAccording to the article, there have been 36 attempted suicides at \nGuantanamo. Clearly, when people are desperate and have no hope, they \nturn to drastic measures. I ask unanimous consent that article be \nprinted in the Record following my comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I strongly believe that due process rights of some sort \nare at the bedrock of American values and they should not be discarded \nlightly, due process rights that apply even to individuals who are not \ncitizens of this country. It is disappointing that in the eyes of the \nworld, the United States has drifted from its longstanding adherence to \nthe rule of law. In my view, we have an obligation to the American \npeople to confront these difficult issues, and I believe Congress needs \nto act in that regard.\n  Establishing this independent commission to look into these prisoner \nissues is an important first step. There have been multiple abuse \nscandals over the last couple of years that have hurt our image abroad \nand tainted the image of a vast majority of our soldiers who serve with \nhonor and distinction. Now the European Union is investigating news \nreports that the CIA is holding suspected terrorists in Soviet-era \ndetention facilities in eastern European countries. This is a \ntroublesome development considering the widespread reports that our own \nVice President continues to urge that bipartisan legislation passed in \nthis Senate that would prohibit the CIA from using interrogation \ntechniques that amount to cruel and inhuman treatment in these types of \nfacilities be deleted from legislation on its way to the President.\n  Our own President is in the very awkward position. During his current \ntrip to Latin America, I saw him on television this morning trying to \nassure our allies in that region that the U.S. policy does not \ncontemplate torture of prisoners. That is a sad day when we are having \nto publicly reassure our allies of something as basic as that.\n  It is time that we seriously investigated these issues and came up \nwith policies that the American people feel comfortable with, policies \nthat are consistent with our Constitution and with the values of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            Guantanamo Desperation Seen in Suicide Attempts\n\n                            (By Josh White)\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 1, 2005]\n\n       Jumah Dossari had to visit the restroom, so the detainee \n     made a quick joke with his American lawyer before military \n     police guards escorted him to a nearby cell with a toilet. \n     The U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had taken \n     quite a toll on Dossari over the past four years, but his \n     attorney, who was there to discuss Dossari's federal court \n     case, noted his good spirits and thought nothing of his \n     bathroom break.\n       Minutes later, when Dossari did not return, Joshua \n     Colangelo-Bryan knocked on the cell door, calling out his \n     client's name. When he did not hear a response, Colangelo-\n     Bryan stepped inside and saw a three-foot pool of blood on \n     the floor. Numb, the lawyer looked up to see Dossari hanging \n     unconscious from a noose tied to the ceiling, his eyes rolled \n     back, his tongue and lips bulging, blood pouring from a gash \n     in his right arm.\n       Dossari's suicide attempt two weeks ago is believed to be \n     the first such event witnessed by an outsider at the prison, \n     and one of several signs that lawyers and human rights \n     advocates contend point to growing desperation among the more \n     than 500 detainees there. Lawyers believe Dossari, who has \n     been in solitary confinement for nearly two years, timed his \n     suicide attempt so that someone other than his guards would \n     witness it, a cry for help meant to reach beyond the base's \n     walls.\n       Two dozen Guantanamo Bay detainees are currently being \n     force-fed in response to a lengthy hunger strike, and the \n     detainees' lawyers estimate there are dozens more who have \n     not eaten since August. Military officials say there are 27 \n     hunger strikers at Guantanamo Bay, all of whom are clinically \n     stable, closely monitored by medical personnel and receiving \n     proper nutrition.\n       The hunger strikers are protesting their lengthy \n     confinements in the island prison, where some have been kept \n     for nearly four years and most have never been charged with a \n     crime. The most recent hunger strike came after detention \n     officials allegedly failed to honor promises made during a \n     previous hunger strike.\n       Military authorities do not publicly discuss individual \n     detainees and declined to comment on Dossari. Lt. Col. Jeremy \n     Martin, spokesman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo, said \n     yesterday that there have been a total of 36 suicide attempts \n     by 22 different detainees, including three in the past 20 \n     months. Martin said all detainees are treated humanely and \n     ``any threat of injury or suicide'' is taken seriously.\n       He added that rapid intervention in suicide attempts has \n     prevented deaths. No detainee has died at the military \n     prison, he said.\n       The protests come amid rising international concern about \n     the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Human rights \n     organizations and the United Nations have complained about \n     the lack of access to the detainees and voiced concern about \n     allegations of physical and psychological abuse, including \n     prolonged solitary confinement.\n       U.S. officials are trying to return many of the detainees \n     to their home countries, but the process has been fraught \n     with delays and diplomatic wrangling.\n       Three U.N. experts said yesterday that they would not \n     accept a U.S. government invitation to tour Guantanamo unless \n     they are granted private access to detainees, a concession \n     the U.S. has not been willing to make, citing the ongoing war \n     on terror and security concerns. Last week, the United States \n     invited the U.N. representatives on torture and arbitrary \n     detention to the facility, and the experts said yesterday \n     that they hope to visit in early December. But they described \n     their demand for access to the detainees as ``non-\n     negotiable.''\n       ``They said they have nothing to hide,'' Manfred Nowak, \n     U.N. special rapporteur on torture, said yesterday at a news \n     conference in New York. ``If they have nothing to hide, why \n     should we not be able to talk to detainees in private?''\n       Colangelo-Bryan said he fears that many detainees would \n     rather die than be held indefinitely. He said he was shocked \n     but not surprised by Dossari's Oct. 15 suicide attempt, given \n     his ``horrible ordeal.''\n       He said he knows only that medical personnel apparently \n     were able to revive Dossari, he had surgery and is in stable \n     condition.\n       Detainees ``see it as the only means they have of \n     exercising control over their lives,'' Colangelo-Bryan said \n     in publicly describing the incident for the first time. \n     ``Their only means of effective protest are to harm \n     themselves, either by hunger strike or doing something like \n     this.''\n       Martin said claims that hunger strikers are near death are \n     ``absolutely false.'' He said the latest protest began on \n     Aug. 8 and at one point had 131 participants but is now much \n     smaller.\n       ``This technique, hunger striking, is consistent with the \n     al Qaeda training, and reflects the detainees' attempts to \n     elicit media attention and bring pressure on the United \n     States government,'' Martin said. The military also has long \n     argued that terrorist groups have instructed fighters to \n     invent claims of abuse if incarcerated.\n       Dossari has told Colangelo-Bryan that he has endured abuse \n     and mistreatment on par with some of the worst offenses \n     discovered at any U.S. detention facility over the past four \n     years. In declassified notes recording the meetings, Dossari \n     describes abuse and torture that stretches back to his arrest \n     in Pakistan in December 2001, through the time he was turned \n     over to U.S. forces in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and ultimately \n     to his stay in Guantanamo Bay.\n       Dossari, 26, said U.S. troops have put out cigarettes on \n     his skin, threatened to kill him\n\n[[Page S12418]]\n\n     and severely beat him. He told his lawyer that he saw U.S. \n     Marines at Kandahar ``using pages of the Koran to shine their \n     boots,'' and was brutalized at Guantanamo Bay by Immediate \n     Response Force guards who videotaped themselves attacking \n     him.\n       The military says the IRF squads are sent into cells to \n     quell disturbances.\n       Dossari told his lawyers that he had been wrapped in \n     Israeli and U.S. flags during interrogations--a tactic \n     recounted in FBI allegations of abuse at Guantanamo--and said \n     interrogators threatened to send him to countries where he \n     would be tortured.\n       Dossari maintains that he is not connected to terrorism and \n     does not hate the United States. A fellow detainee said that \n     he saw Dossari at an al Qaeda training camp, his lawyer said.\n       Colangelo-Bryan is a private New York lawyer with the \n     Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents some of \n     the detainees. The group plans a ``Fast for Justice'' rally \n     today in Washington to bring attention to the Guantanamo Bay \n     hunger strike.\n       Colangelo-Bryan said Dossari has tried to commit suicide \n     before. Prolonged solitary confinement has given him almost \n     no contact with others and access to only a Koran and his \n     legal papers.\n       ``In March, he looked at me in the eye and said, 'How can I \n     keep myself from going crazy?'''

Madam President, I believe we have a very fine Armed \nServices Committee. I have now been honored to serve on that committee \nfor a number of years. With regard to this year's authorization bill, \nwe have had 35 hearings in the committee or subcommittee. We have \nundertaken to deal with complex issues facing our military. The \nchairman and our committee have responded repeatedly to the requests of \nDemocratic Senators to conduct a plethora of hearings dealing with any \nproblems they can find, such as prisoner issues and that kind of thing. \nWe have also conducted those in the Judiciary Committee, in the \nIntelligence Committee, in the House committees also. We have done \nquite a lot, frankly, as we have gone forward.\n  I think it is time for us to give the highest priority, however, to \nassisting our men and women in uniform, men and women we have sent in \nharm's way to execute the policy of the United States of America--a \npolicy that was adopted by the House of Representatives, a policy that \nwas adopted by more than a three-fourths vote of this body. A majority \nof both parties voted to adopt these policies to execute force, to \nremove Saddam Hussein unless he complied with the U.N. resolutions, and \nto otherwise carry out our roles and responsibilities.\n  We have done that, but we need to focus on how to help those soldiers \nwe have sent be successful in creating a good and stable and democratic \ngovernment in Iraq. It is important for us, it is important for the \nworld, and, most of all, it is important for the people there who have \nsuffered the greatest oppression for so many years.\n  I think our committees have served well. I think we have worked at \nthese issues well. We have now prepared a bill, a legislation piece, \nthat will empower our military to be able to do their job better. I \ncould not be more pleased than to serve under Chairman Warner and his \nleadership in the committee. He works collegially with all members of \nthe Senate in our committee to move legislation along effectively. He \nhas worked hard to get this bill where it is today. Without strong \nleadership, frankly, I am not sure we would be here today.\n  We have passed the Defense appropriations bill, but we have not \npassed the Defense authorization bill. It would be unfortunate if we \nwere not able to do so this year. Hopefully, if our colleagues will \ncooperate, if they have an amendment and bring it down and present it, \nthey will be able to have all the amendments that have been promised, \nand we can get something done. We certainly do not need to delay or \ndrag these matters out.\n  I think this issue of our involvement in Iraq needs to be recalled a \nbit--how we came to vote. They say--some do--there were lies that led \nus into this war. But all of us talked about this possible conflict for \nmonths--months. We knew it was coming. The President talked about it. \nWe talked about it openly on the floor.\n  In fact, in the 1990s, when President Clinton was President, we voted \nand established a policy for the United States of America. That policy \nwas that we would effect a regime change in Iraq. And up until these \nhostilities occurred--for years--American and British planes, enforcing \nthe no-fly zones to keep Saddam Hussein from oppressing the Kurds and \nthe Shiites, flew missions over Iraq, and were fired upon, sometimes on \na daily if not weekly basis.\n  We dropped bombs and missiles on them in retaliation, regularly, for \nyears. In fact, we were in a state of hostility because Saddam Hussein \nhad failed to comply with the agreements he made with the United \nNations in 1991 when he was kicked out of Kuwait after he had invaded \nhis neighbor--a peaceful, decent member of the world community.\n  He attacked them to seize their oil and to increase his power. We had \nto create a world coalition to give him a demand to remove himself from \nKuwait. He refused to do so, and GEN Norman Schwarzkopf led the \ncoalition forces that defeated his army and removed him from Kuwait. He \nmade agreements so we would not continue marching on to Baghdad to get \nour hands around his neck. He made these commitments to the U.N. and \nagreements were reached. He did not comply with them. He was in \nviolation of 16 different resolutions of the United Nations.\n  So all that was there. Also, 9/11 had occurred. And we knew he was \nviolating the Oil-for-Food Program--a program that was set up to allow \nhim to sell oil, which was being embargoed because of his violation of \nthe rules and regulations of the U.N., and it allowed him to do that if \nthe money would be utilized to take care of food and medicines for the \npeople of Iraq because we wanted to help them.\n  I have been to Iraq three times. I know the chairman has been there \nnumerous times. You can see the palaces he built with that money that \nwas supposed to feed his people. We know he was reconstituting his \nmilitary. He declared he had been the victor in that war, not the \nloser. It was clear he was reconstituting his military power because he \ndesired and had not given up his fantasy ambition to dominate the \nMiddle East.\n  These were the forces that were at work. These were strategic \nrealities that occurred at that time. The Economist magazine wrote an \neditorial not long before we voted, and it talked about how the embargo \nwas failing, how, in fact, the embargo was really hurting the people of \nIraq more than it was hurting Saddam Hussein, but that it was falling \napart; that Saddam Hussein had a systematic plan to break the embargo, \nand nations, such as France and others, were working behind the scenes \nto undermine the effect of that embargo, and that if we did not do \nsomething pretty soon, he would be unleashed again. They said the \nquestion simply is, Do we turn him loose or do\n\n[[Page S12419]]\n\nwe go to war? Our vote is to go to war, said the London-based Economist \nmagazine.\n  So those are the decisions we were dealing with. Every intelligence \nagency in the world concluded that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass \ndestruction. I am not aware of any that did not believe he had some. \nCertainly, that is what the President of the United States was told. \nCertainly, that is what the Members of the Senate were told.\n  But the more troubling, deeper, strategic imperative, to deal with \nSaddam Hussein, was what galvanized the attention of the President and, \nI think, of the Senate. When I looked at my remarks from the time I had \ndiscussed my decision to support a war in Iraq, I hardly mentioned \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  It was this idea--that Saddam Hussein had not been faithful to his \nagreements, that he was determined to get out of those agreements, that \nhe was determined to reconstitute his military, that he could be a \nthreat to the region and that he could easily, and we thought he did, \nhave weapons of mass destruction that he would use. We know he used a \nweapon of mass destruction, poison gas, against his own people, the \nKurds. We know he used it. So it would have been unthinkable to think \nhe had none at the time. Whatever happened to it, I don't know.\n  We made a commitment in this Nation to remove Saddam Hussein, and \nthat has been done. We have had two elections in Iraq toward \nestablishing a democratic government. For that, I am most proud and \nhopeful that this new election in December, which will create a new \npermanent government, will help further to demonstrate the confidence \nthe Iraqi people have in that government and make attacks upon it even \nmore difficult to sustain and defend.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember this one thing--it is still a \ndangerous place there. Our soldiers are there because we sent them. We \nasked them to go there to execute the policy we in the Senate voted \nfor. We ought not do things and say things out of political anger or \npartisanship that are exaggerated, unfair to the President or our \ntroops and how they conduct themselves, that puts their lives more at \nrisk and makes their job more difficult.\n  I am pleased that this authorization bill came out of Chairman \nWarner's committee unanimously with a bipartisan vote. As we go forward \nwith it, we will improve the quality of our military, their \neffectiveness, and help execute more effectively the policies we have \nestablished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague. He \nhas taken an active role in a number of issues and that, together with \nhis work on the Judiciary Committee, gives him a special insight into \nthe issue of detainee matters.\n  The distinguished ranking member has arrived. I had hoped that \nSenator Cornyn could speak for 15 to 20 minutes, if that is agreeable, \nand then following that, perhaps the Senator from Michigan and I will \nhave some matters to address the Senate on. For the benefit of all \nMembers, the bill is open for amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, that certainly is fine with me. I always \nwelcome the opportunity to hear from our colleagues. I understand there \nare a number of amendments on the side of the Senator from Virginia \nthat may be ready to go this afternoon. We believe we have one that \nwill be ready at 4:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I say, with a sense \nof modesty, that we are making good progress on the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I thank the chairman and distinguished \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee. It is more with sadness \nthan in anger that I rise to respond to recent allegations made by some \nDemocrats that the Bush administration ``manufactured and manipulated \nintelligence in order to sell the war in Iraq.'' War is serious \nbusiness. I don't need to remind my colleagues that more than 2,000 \nAmericans have sacrificed their lives fighting to liberate the Iraqi \npeople, and many brave Texans are among them.\n  Today, Iraq represents the central front in the global war on terror. \nYet we have even seen the sad occasion of having sustained 2,000 deaths \nof America's fighting men and women in Iraq spark an ill-advised and \npremature call for withdrawal of our troops by the angry antiwar left. \nThat call has been picked up, in part, if not in whole, by some \npoliticians seeking to capitalize on that anger. But merely venting \nanger without proposing alternative solutions is not the work of \nserious people. It is a sad commentary on our public discourse when \npoliticians seek to use the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform \nto advance a political agenda.\n  While the critics focused on 2,000 Americans killed in action in \nIraq, another important number to remember is 3,000--the number of \ninnocent Americans killed on September 11. Is there any doubt that if \nwe pulled out of Iraq prematurely without stabilizing security, without \nbuilding the necessary infrastructure, and without allowing Iraqis to \nbuild successful democratic institutions as they are doing, that 9/11 \nwould be repeated over and over and over again by an enemy that would \ncontinue to target innocent civilians in pursuit of their perverse \nideology? If Iraq descends into civil war or is overrun by terrorists, \nif Iraq becomes a place where terrorists recruit, train, and export \nterror with impunity, how long do the critics believe it would take \nuntil we would be hit again on our own soil?\n  The war on terrorism is a war we must win. The stakes are too high to \nuse the war on terror as a political football. If there is any doubt \nabout the enemy and their goals, all one needs to do is read the letter \nfrom Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, Zawahiri, his chief lieutenant in \nIraq. Zawahiri clearly describes al-Qaida's vision of establishing an \nIslamic caliphate that would rule the Middle East and eventually the \nworld. It would also, not incidentally, include the destruction of our \nbest ally in the Middle East, the state of Israel.\n  Although we are making progress in Iraq, as we saw most recently \nduring the successful referendum on the constitution, there is \nobviously more work that needs to be done. We know that our troops have \nthe will to win. I am concerned that there are some here at home and \neven in the Senate who do not share this same resolve because they \nstubbornly refuse to learn the lessons of 9/11.\n  The latest accusation by some in the Democratic leadership, that the \nadministration has manipulated intelligence and has exaggerated the \nthreat, is nothing more than an effort to use the war in Iraq for \npolitical gain. That is shameful. It devalues the sacrifice our men and \nwomen are making on the battlefield every day. It places at risk \neverything that Americans have sacrificed on behalf of the cause of \nliberty here and abroad. Do the critics need to be reminded that it was \na few years ago when Democrats joined Republicans in a bipartisan \nacknowledgment that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the world?\n\n  In fact, it was the Senate, in 1998, that unanimously passed the Iraq \nLiberation Act that called for the United States to support efforts to \noverthrow that terrible dictator. It was President Clinton who so \neloquently described the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the \nconsequences of inaction when he said:\n\n       The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, \n     he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of the \n     region, the security of the world. The best way to end that \n     threat once and for all is with the new Iraqi government, a \n     government ready to live at peace with its neighbors, a \n     government that respects the rights of its people.\n\n  President Clinton went on to say:\n\n       Heavy as they are, the costs of action must be weighed \n     against the price of inaction. If Saddam defies the world and \n     we fail to respond, we will face a far greater threat in the \n     future. Saddam will strike again at his\n\n[[Page S12420]]\n\n     neighbors; he will make war against his own people. And mark \n     my words, he will develop weapons of mass destruction. He did \n     will deploy them, and he will use them.\n\n  President Clinton was correct in that assessment made in 1998. We are \nfortunate that today Saddam Hussein is no longer a threat to the region \nor to the world due to the bipartisan vote of the Congress to authorize \nthe use of force to remove Saddam Hussein in October of 2002. It was a \nbipartisan vote of the Senate that authorized that use of force.\n  Today, the political dynamics have changed. For their own cynical \nreasons, some Democrats have charged that the Bush administration has \nsomehow manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq. These same \nindividuals are calling for yet another investigation to somehow \njustify their patently false claims. I remind my colleagues that this \nissue has been investigated not only by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence but the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission. Of course, \nthe results of both investigations do not support the charges of \nmanipulation, so we hear yet another call for another investigation. \nWishing that the results were different cannot make it so. What do they \npropose? To initiate investigation after investigation until somehow \nthey manage to will into existence the results they have been hoping \nfor, I imagine.\n  I wish to ask my colleagues, did President Clinton lie when he \ndiscussed the intelligence that led him to support the forced ouster of \nSaddam Hussein? Did he manipulate intelligence to justify his bombing \nin Iraq? Or did he rely upon the same intelligence that this \nadministration and this Congress and our allies did when they came to \nthe same conclusion that Saddam was a threat to the region and to the \nworld? Are there Senators who today would renounce their vote to remove \nSaddam by force in October of 2002? Out of the bipartisan 77 who voted \nto authorize the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein, I have only \nlearned of two who have said they regret that vote and would renounce \nit.\n  Before the war, a leading Democrat--in fact, the Democratic leader--\nclearly stated his position in Iraq. As of this morning, his quotation \nwas still on his Senate Web site. It says:\n\n       What is my position on Iraq? Saddam Hussein is an evil \n     dictator who presents a serious threat to international peace \n     and security. Under Saddam's rule, Iraq has engaged in far-\n     reaching human rights abuses, been a state sponsor of \n     terrorism, and has long sought to obtain and develop weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n\n  I agree with this statement on the Web site of Senator Reid of today, \nNovember 7, 2005. But today we are told by the same Democratic leader \nthat somehow this administration was responsible for manipulating \nintelligence to authorize the war in Iraq when, in fact, he took the \nsame position at the time that force was used. At least his Web site \ntakes that same position today.\n  For the record, I would like to read the conclusions of the \nIntelligence Committee investigation and the Silberman-Robb \ninvestigation so there will be no doubt that the Bush administration \ndid not manipulate intelligence to justify this war. The Intelligence \nCommittee report, which was supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans, states the following:\n\n       The Committee did not find any evidence that Administration \n     officials attempted to coerce, influence, or pressure \n     analysts to change their judgments related to Iraq's weapons \n     of mass destruction capabilities.\n\n  Likewise, the Silberman-Robb Commission, a bipartisan commission \nappointed to look into our intelligence failures, concluded:\n\n       The Intelligence Community did not make or change any \n     analytic judgments in response to political pressure to reach \n     a particular conclusion, but the pervasive conventional \n     wisdom that Saddam retained WMD affected the analytic \n     process.\n  Madam President, this much is clear. No one attempted to manipulate \nintelligence leading up to the war in Iraq--not President Clinton, not \nMembers of the Senate, not this administration, all of whom, based upon \nthe same intelligence, concluded that Saddam represented an imminent \nthreat to the national security of the United States. Instead, we found \nthat while some of our intelligence was wrong on Hussein, it was \nobvious, and it is obvious today, that he was a threat to the civilized \nworld.\n  I believe all of this crystallizes into a question about how doubts \nare resolved in a dangerous and uncertain world. Do we resolve doubts \nin favor of a tyrant who has used weapons of mass destruction on his \nown people, who demonstrated an interest in acquiring nuclear weapons, \nwho refused to cooperate with weapons inspectors after 17 Security \nCouncil resolutions ordered him to do so, and who at last count \nmurdered at least 400,000 of his own people who are lying in mass \ngraves?\n  Giving Saddam Hussein the benefit of the doubt would have been a \ncrazy and irresponsible thing to do. Of course, the 77 Senators who \nvoted for the use of force against Saddam in October 2002 weren't \nbuying that Saddam was some harmless individual then.\n  So why now? Sure, we need better intelligence and we have undertaken \nsubstantial and meaningful intelligence reform to remedy the defects. \nIntelligence by its very nature is never certain, but we are \nrestructuring our intelligence community to ensure the President of our \ncountry, whether he be Democrat or Republican, gets the most accurate \nintelligence available.\n  Meanwhile, I hope the Members of this body who have politicized this \nissue by making false allegations of manipulation of intelligence would \nrealize that their allegations only serve to divide the American people \nand to dishonor the sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform and \nundermine critical American resolve to finish the important work that \nwe are about in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nif in morning business but on the amendment before us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we have certainly no objection to that. \nAt this juncture in the bill, it does not impair our ability to manage. \nI ask the Senator to please proceed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I commend Senator Levin and others \nfor their leadership in proposing this amendment. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment based on the belief that a \ncomprehensive, objective, and independent investigation into the \ncollection of intelligence through the detention, interrogation, and \nrendition of prisoners is long overdue. While I am a strong supporter \nof the amendment, I regret greatly the fact that we have been forced to \nseek the creation of a national commission on such a critically \nimportant matter that falls squarely within the oversight \nresponsibility of the Congress. Unfortunately, Congress's unwillingness \nto carry out these oversight duties in the past year has left us with \nno remaining alternative but to seek the creation of a national \ncommission.\n  Why do I say this? The collection of intelligence through \ninterrogation and rendition is an extremely important part of our \ncounterterrorism effort. The interrogation of captured terrorists and \ninsurgents is, in fact, one of the most important of intelligence \ntools. We must ensure that those interrogations are carried out in a \nproper and effective manner. This tool, as with all others, must be \napplied within the bounds of our laws and our own national moral \nframework, and it must be subject to the same scrutiny and \ncongressional oversight as every other aspect of intelligence. This, \nunfortunately, has not been the case.\n  Despite the critical importance of interrogation-derived intelligence \nand the growing controversy surrounding retention, interrogation, and \nrendition policies and practices, the Congress has largely ignored the \nissue, holding a limited number of hearings that have provided limited \ninsight.\n  More disturbing, the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate \ncommittee charged with overseeing U.S. intelligence programs and the \nonly one with jurisdiction to investigate all aspects of this issue, is \nsitting on the sidelines and effectively abdicating its oversight \nresponsibility to media investigative reporters.\n  As the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman, I have been pushing \nfor the past 10 months for a formal investigation into the legal and \noperational\n\n[[Page S12421]]\n\nquestions at the heart of the detention interrogation controversy, as \nhas my colleague from the State of Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  My proposal that the Intelligence Committee conduct an investigation \ninto this matter was rejected. A decision was made that the \nIntelligence Committee, as it is charged to do, would not formally \nexamine the legal and operational aspects of our detention and \ninterrogation program despite compelling and disturbing evidence that \nserious, possibly criminal, abuses had occurred.\n  Now, this decision is particularly curious given the litany of \ninvestigations carried out by the Intelligence Committee in the past. \nIn recent years, our committee has produced detailed investigative \nreports into prewar intelligence on Iraq, technology transfer to China, \nthe bombing of the USS Cole, and the shooting down of the missionary \nplane in Peru, and on and on. In fact, on July 30, 1999, a few years \nbefore he became our current chairman, Senator Pat Roberts wrote to \nthen-Chairman Richard Shelby and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey requesting an \ninvestigation into the intelligence related to the downing of CDR \nMichael Scott Speicher's F-18 plane in the early stages of the Persian \nGulf war.\n\n  The committee responded favorably to Senator Roberts' request, \nconducted the investigation, and produced a report. Each of the \ncommittee reports was produced as a result of formally authorized \ninvestigations, and each was a constructive contribution to \nunderstanding not just how and why intelligence failures occur but what \naction should be taken to avoid them in the future. Our unanimously \napproved first phase of our Iraq report last July, which was the \nweapons of mass destruction aspect, was a rather thorough and \ndevastating critique of the collection and analytical failings of our \nintelligence community prior to the war that has provided, frankly, a \nvery critical momentum to an intelligence reform movement that was \nalready gathering steam and ended up in the passage of landmark \nlegislation in December, which most people would have said a couple of \nmonths earlier was not possible. Yet when presented with a similar set \nof compelling reports on how the United States detains and interrogates \nprisoners, the majority on the committee has prevented us from pursuing \nan investigation.\n  Why? Well over a year has passed since the appearance of photographs \ngraphically portraying the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib \nprison. As my colleagues know, these images and other reports of abuse \nprovided a powerful propaganda tool to our terrorist enemies. Since \nthen we have seen a steady stream of accusations relating to the way \nthe U.S. military and intelligence agencies treat individuals in their \ncustody. Allegations of mistreatment have surfaced wherever the United \nStates holds prisoners overseas--across Iraq, Afghanistan, and at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  Troubling new revelations have become an almost daily occurrence, \nwith a disturbing number of these instances resulting in prisoner \ndeaths. At least 26 prisoners have died in American custody, and the \nunsettling charge has been leveled against the United States that we \nare exporting torture through rendition practices that lack \naccountability.\n  Who can honestly say that these events and allegations are not \nserious enough to warrant an Intelligence Committee investigation? My \ngood friend and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenator John Warner, believed such an investigation was needed back in \nFebruary of this year, and at the February 18 open Intelligence \nCommittee hearing on worldwide threats, which we do once a year, \nSenator Warner remarked:\n\n       And there's an issue out here, I say to my distinguished \n     chairman and ranking member and colleagues on the committee, \n     which I think we've got to address both in my committee and \n     in this committee, and that is the manner in which we gain \n     intelligence from those that are captured, either on the \n     battlefield or in other areas.\n\n  My hope was that sort of congressional inquiry referenced by Senator \nWarner back in February would have become a reality.\n  The Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee with \ntheir respective oversight of the military and intelligence communities \ncould have provided the sort of complementary reviews into troubling \nallegations swirling around our interrogation of prisoners in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and, as I said, Guantanamo Bay. Regrettably, our \nefforts and those of Senator Levin to authorize and conduct such an \ninvestigation have not succeeded. We are now, therefore, left by \ndefault with the remaining option of turning over this responsibility \nto a national commission to carry it out.\n  If the Senate oversight committees are either unwilling or unable to \ntackle the tough but necessary questions associated with detention, \ninterrogation, and rendition of prisoners, then we should step aside, \nif we have to, regrettably, and let the work be done by those \nunfettered by other considerations.\n  I am confident that this new national commission, like the 9/11 \nCommission, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission before it, \nwill provide the sort of comprehensive review of U.S. policy and \npractices relating to the treatment of detainees that has been absent \nso far.\n  Our amendment calls for a 12-month investigation in which all aspects \nof all of this must be looked at. More specifically, the 10-person \ncommission will examine and report upon the policies and practices of \nthe United States relating to the treatment of individuals detained \nsince September 11, 2001. The commission will also be tasked to \nevaluate causes and factors that have contributed to the alleged \nmistreatment of detainees, including an assessment of either those \ndirectly or indirectly responsible for the mistreatment.\n  I am worried about the legal aspects of our underpinning, and I will \nmore or less close with this: On May 18, 2005, the Central Intelligence \nAgency issued a statement that ``CIA policies on interrogation have \nalways followed legal guidance from the Department of Justice.'' That \nmay or may not be so, but was that legal guidance supportable? That is \nwhat you have to ask. Was it supportable? Was it factual?\n  A lengthy legal opinion on the Department of Justice interrogation \npractices, which had been issued in secret, in August, 2002, was \nquickly repudiated by the White House when it became public in June of \n2004 and was then superseded by a public Justice Department legal \nopinion in December of 2004.\n  As that episode shows, secret interpretations of the law beyond the \noversight of the Congress are an invitation to potentially great error.\n  What supporting roles do the CIA and FBI play in the interrogation of \nsuspects of military-run prisons and how are their activities \ncoordinated? It has been publicly reported that the CIA requested that \na number of prisoners held in Iraq not be registered and be kept from \ninternational inspection; therefore, the so-called ghost detainees.\n  More recently, it has come to light that FBI officials lodged \nstrenuous complaints about what they considered to be the mistreatment \nof prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. These reports and others strongly \nsuggest that different agencies are operating under different sets of \nrules, or they are not coordinated. This is a recipe for disaster which \nwill come back to haunt us one of these days.\n  The commission will also review policies regarding the controversial \npractice of the United States of rendering detainees to foreign \ngovernments for interrogation.\n  Our practice of contracting out to foreign governments the \ninterrogation of detainees is, to this Senator, particularly troubling. \nThere have been numerous reports of individuals turned over by the \nUnited States to a foreign government for interrogation allegedly being \ntortured.\n  In addition to the ethical and legal considerations associated with \nthis practice, the veracity of the information gained from these and \nother detainees is called into question if these statements were made \nunder physical coercion. Therefore, it is important that we have a \nthorough evaluation of the current policy guidelines and field \ndirectives for when it is appropriate to render a detainee to another \ncountry and what intelligence is gained from such a practice.\n  More specifically, we must examine the validity of assurances that \nthe\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\nUnited States is given when detainees are rendered to other countries \nthat they will not be tortured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. I \nthank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do have the privilege of being an ex \nofficio member of the Intelligence Committee. I served 8 years on that \ncommittee, and my concluding years was as ranking member. I have a very \nhigh respect for that committee and find, from my participation, \ntogether with others on it, under the leadership of Chairman Roberts \nand Senator Rockefeller, that the committee does a very good job.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition about this question of \nthe need for this country to establish an independent commission to \ninvestigate the detention and interrogation operations conducted by the \nDepartment of Defense and other elements of the Government in \nconjunction with the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12422-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE DETENTION AND INTERROGATION \n                               OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my judgment, a further investigation is \nsimply unnecessary. The Department of Defense has conducted 12 major \ninvestigations. Over 400 criminal investigations and hundreds more \ninformal investigations have been or are being conducted to determine \nthe responsibility and, if appropriate, culpability and accountability.\n  The combined investigations are unprecedented in scope. The CIA and \nthe Department of Justice are also conducting investigations into the \nactions of their employees related to detention and interrogation \nactivities.\n  Responsibility and accountability have been assessed. Over 400 \ncriminal investigations have been conducted and 168 remain open; 95 \nmilitary personnel have been criminally charged with misconduct, and 75 \nhave been convicted to date. In addition, 177 military personnel have \nbeen administratively disciplined. Almost 20 percent of those \ndisciplined have been officers.\n  Congress has held 30 open hearings, received over 40 closed \nbriefings, and countless staff briefings. The Department has been very \nforthcoming, providing complete investigations that include over 2,800 \ninterviews and over 16,000 pages of related documents.\n  The combined investigations have made 442 recommendations, over 300 \nof which have been implemented, and the rest are in progress, including \nstandardization policy and procedures for detention and interrogation \noperations, revising policies regarding the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross visits and reports, improved training and clear policy \nguidance for interagency detention activities.\n  Investigations have universally concluded that there was no policy of \nabuse and that no policy led to abuse. As the Schlesinger report \nstated--that was a commission established by the Secretary of Defense, \nindeed at the urging of the Congress and our committee, but it was \nSecretary Schlesinger and Secretary Harold Brown, both former \nSecretaries of Defense, one a Republican and one a Democrat, men who \nhave had extraordinary reputations throughout their lives. I feel that \nwas one of the major landmark investigations connected with this \nongoing problem. They stated:\n\n       No approved procedures call for or allow the kind of abuse \n     that, in fact, occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of \n     abuse promulgated by senior officials or military \n     authorities.\n\n  Any discussion of detainee abuse must be kept in perspective. \nSubstantiated cases of abusive conduct by DOD personnel are small in \ncomparison to the 70,000 persons who have been detained and the \nhundreds of thousands of interrogations that have been conducted \nhumanely, safely, and effectively over the past 4 years.\n  An independent commission would send potentially the wrong message to \nour Armed Forces of our lack of confidence in their conduct and would \nseriously undermine ongoing intelligence-gathering activities.\n  On a daily basis, we collect intelligence from detainees that \nprovides valuable information to our troops in the field, whether it is \nIraq or Afghanistan or other farflung posts. Simply put, this \ninformation saves American lives, certainly of the men and women in \nuniform, and I firmly believe it has helped prevent further serious \nattack, such as 9/11, on our Nation.\n  The investigative process has reassured the American people, \nstrengthened the Armed Forces, and demonstrated to the world that we \nare a nation of laws. Last month, 90 Senators voted in the affirmative \nfor an amendment that required civilized treatment of prisoners at \ndetention facilities. That is the McCain amendment, and I have been a \npartner with him in the very initiation of those efforts.\n  The amendment banned cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. That \nvote sent a strong signal. Who among us was not affected when Senator \nMcCain said that he and fellow prisoners in Hanoi knew and took great \nstrength from the belief that ``we were different from our enemies, \nthat we were better than they, that we, if the roles were reversed, \nwould not disgrace ourselves by committing or countenancing such \nmistreatment of them.''\n\n  Move on we must to win this war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Replaying \nthese dreadful and inexcusable instances again in public forum will \nbring no remarkable insights and no lessons learned, nor will it do \nanything to reduce the fighting. It will, in fact, draw resources from \nthe war effort by placing a heavy burden on senior commanders and key \ncivilian leaders.\n  The Committee on Armed Services held over half a dozen hearings on \nthis issue. We still have these matters under review. Still, the \nquestion of accountability remains, but we have to wait until there is \na conclusion of more of the military cases before I think we probably \nwill do our final work on this chapter, a chapter that I characterize--\nthat is Abu Ghraib--as one of the most serious I ever witnessed in my \nmany years of public service, either in the Pentagon or in the Senate \nas a member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Georgia. For that \npurpose, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Pryor, Senator \nIsakson, and myself, I rise to call up amendment No. 2433 to S. 1042 \nand request that Senator Landrieu be added as a cosponsor. I believe \nthe amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that the bill is \nnot currently pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, I suggest that we now go to \nthe bill. I believe there is a pending amendment which requires a UC to \nbe laid aside; am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that Senator Landrieu be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. First, Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of \nthe committee, as well as the ranking member, Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin, for their great leadership on this bill. This has been a \ndifficult process we have gone through, having spent, I guess, a week \nand a half at one point in time and having to suspend further \nproceedings and now we are back on it. In my opinion, all the work in \nthis body is certainly very critical to the Nation itself, but there is \nno more important legislation we take up every year than the Defense \nauthorization bill. When we are a nation at war, as we are right now, \nthere certainly is no more important legislation to show support by \nthis body, by the House, and by the American people to our men and \nwomen in uniform by making sure that we provide quality of life issues \nfor them, whether it is pay raises, looking after their families, or \nmaking sure they have better than adequate housing, but to also say to \nthem that we are going to provide you with the best weapons available \nin the world today, that we are going to provide you with the best \ntraining in the world today to make sure that you remain the strongest \nmilitary in the world, and as you fight for freedom and democracy on \nforeign soil, as our men and women are doing today, that they know and \nunderstand, without any hesitation, the American people and the Members \nof Congress stand firmly behind the work they are doing.\n  I wish to preface my comments with regard to this particular \namendment by stating something with which no Member of the Senate would \ndisagree, and that is that the way our Nation uses the Reserve \ncomponents of the U.S. military has fundamentally changed over the last \n15 years.\n  Several of my colleagues already alluded to this fact during \ndiscussion of TRICARE coverage for reservists earlier this year. I \nsupport that legislation and commend my colleagues, specifically \nSenator Graham from South Carolina and Senator Clinton from New York, \nfor their perseverance on this issue of providing TRICARE for Guard and \nReserve members.\n  Over the last decade and a half, the Reserve components have changed \nfrom a force in reserve to an absolutely essential component of the war \nfight in almost every operation the military engages and in every \ncareer field represented in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine \nCorps.\n  The Reserve components are now, and continue to become, a true \noperational Reserve that our military cannot operate without. This is \nreflected primarily in the rate of deployments and mobilizations of the \nReserve components.\n  The contribution of the Reserve components has increased over 60 \ntimes from the pre-Desert Shield/Desert Storm time period to the \npresent. From the post-Desert Storm period, from between 1993 and 1997 \nto the present, the Reserve contribution has increased between 5 and 10 \ntimes, depending on which year you consider. The same trends are \nillustrated if you look at the number of support days reservists have \nperformed over the last 20 years. The trend over the last 5 years is \nexponential.\n  My point, which cannot be any more clear, is that the way we are \nusing the Guard and Reserve has fundamentally changed. Based on this \nfact, I think it is only appropriate to consider that the way we \ncompensate and reward our reservists needs to change.\n  Another important factor to be considered is the current recruiting \ntrends for the National Guard and Reserve. The overall trend in Reserve \ncomponent recruiting is negative. In fiscal year 2005, the Army and Air \nNational Guard, the Army Reserve and the Navy Reserve, all did not meet \ntheir enlisted recruiting goals. In fiscal year 2002, the Army National \nGuard exceeded its goal by recruiting 104 percent of its objective, but \nin fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 that number dropped to 87 \npercent. It now stands at 80 percent. A similar story can be told for \nthe Army Reserve where it exceeded its goal for fiscal year 2002 with \n108 percent of its objective only to see that percentage drop to 84 \npercent for fiscal year 2005. Although not a crisis yet, these trends \nare definitely a cause for concern.\n  Retention numbers for the Guard and Reserve are holding fairly steady \nfor now. However, I do not believe anyone\n\n[[Page S12424]]\n\nexpects the retention rate to hold steady if we keep using our Reserves \nat the current rate. I believe the current rate at which we are using \nreservists, as well as current recruiting trends, necessitates that we \nreexamine the way we manage the Reserve.\n  As the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee \non Personnel, and the current cochairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus, \nthis is an issue with which I have wrestled considerably and want to be \nsure that we account for as we provide oversight of the personnel \npolicies of the Department of Defense.\n  The Department of Defense has made changes in this area by improving \nthe process of training and equipping the Reserve and supporting \nchanges in personnel policies that improve quality of life for members \nof the Reserve. However, with the possible exception of the TRICARE \nissue, these changes have been at the margins. The amendment I am \ncalling up today makes what I believe is a relatively minor adjustment \nto the Reserve retirement system. My amendment would lower the age at \nwhich a reservist can receive their retirement annuity by 3 months, \ncounting down from age 60, for every 90 days a reservist spends on \nactive duty during a fiscal year. Any service credited under my \namendment would have to be served in support of a designated \ncontingency operation. This amendment specifically rewards the members \nof the Guard and Reserve who have been called or ordered to active \nduty, had their civilian lives interrupted for an extended period of \ntime, and in many cases placed themselves in harm's way in defense of \ntheir country.\n  Currently, the average reservist, if they collect any retirement pay \nat all, receives a small fraction of the annuity that an Active-Duty \nmember receives. If this amendment becomes law, that percentage will \nrise slightly but in no way will this amendment result in a major \nchange with large financial implications.\n  I do not have a formal CBO estimate for the current version of my \namendment. However, based on CBO scoring for an earlier version, I \nsuggest that the cost of this amendment will be approximately $300 \nmillion over 5 years.\n  There have been several other bills and amendments related to Reserve \nretirement introduced in Congress and for the sake of comparison, I \nbelieve my amendment provides the right incentives and rewards, and it \nis also the least costly alternative which has been offered so far.\n  I think it is very important that we strike a balance between the \nActive-Duty forces and the Reserve component with respect to \ncompensation, quality of life, and other assets and incentives that we \noffer for people coming into Active-Duty service. I know and understand \nthat we can never totally equalize the benefits to the Active Duty \nalong with those of the Guard and Reserve for the simple sake that if \nsomebody joins the Active Duty, they need to be incentivized to come in \nand do the work that they are assigned to do knowing that they will be \ncompensated in a way that has been provided for them for decades \nrelative to retirement in this case. We cannot do that with the Guard \nand Reserve, but we do need to provide more incentives to do something \nabout these drastic reenlistment, as well as enlistment, numbers that I \nalluded to earlier in my comments.\n  One way I think we can certainly do that, from a retirement \nstandpoint, is to provide some small incentive to our reservists and \nour Guard men and women so that they will be somewhat comparable, \nthough never totally comparable, to the Active-Duty members. I believe \nthis amendment is significant and important because it recognizes the \nincreased contribution our reservists are making, rewards them for the \nservice in support of the global war on terrorism, and provides \nreservists in the middle of their careers with an incentive to stay on \nboard.\n  I have received some very good feedback from the Department of \nDefense on this amendment because, first, it incentivizes voluntarism. \nSecondly, it provides a motivation for retention. Thirdly, it is \nrelatively low cost.\n  The Reserve Officers Association of America, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, and the Reserve Enlisted Association \nalso support this amendment and see it as an important, responsible \nstep forward in support of our reservists.\n  There is no more important issue facing the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee than how we treat our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies. It is my hope that as we proceed with this bill over this \nweek, and as the committee entertains legislation and policy changes in \nthe coming months, that we keep the people at the receiving end of our \ndecisions and deliberations foremost in our minds.\n  We will continue to include the members of the Reserve components in \nthose deliberations and ensure that the Senate adopts policies that \nwork to their advantage that are fiscally responsible and that \nrecognize the significant changes that have taken place in the Reserve \nover the past decade and a half.\n  I close by saying, again, that without the leadership of Senators \nWarner and Levin, we simply would not be providing the compensation, \nnor the incentives, that we have in place today to the members of the \nGuard and the Reserve. I thank them for not just their great leadership \nbut their cooperation in working through these very difficult issues, a \nlot of which are driven strictly by budget. That is what makes it \nparticularly difficult when we have to talk about providing incentives \nlike compensation versus buying weapons systems. It makes it very \ndifficult, and to their credit they have provided the great leadership \nthat is necessary to make sure that we continue to be in a position to \nbe the strongest military in the world. And we are because our men and \nwomen who volunteer for that military, whether it is Active Duty or \nGuard or Reserve, are the very finest young men and women America has \nto offer.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia. We are studying this amendment very carefully. I am anxious to \nget the views of my distinguished colleague, the ranking member, and \nhis group.\n  As I listened carefully to the Senator's remarks, I was reminded by \nmy own experience--I had a very modest career in the military--I think \nI spent a total of 14 years in the Marine Corps Reserve and witnessed \nand participated in a callup of the Reserves in connection with the war \nin Korea. I recall very vividly that war hit us out of the blue in the \nsummer of 1950. The then-Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, under \nPresident Truman, was cutting and slashing the military right and left. \nIt was down to the raw bone. Suddenly this war engulfed the United \nStates and there were thoughts in the beginning that it would be fairly \nsimple to end the war.\n  I remember MacArthur was commander in chief of the forces at that \ntime, and he made a famous statement--I think it was in late September \nor October--that this war will be over and everybody will be home by \nChristmas.\n  Well, that was the fall of 1950, and action did not end until 1953, \nwhich had many names from the ``forgotten war'' to a ``police action,'' \nbut it did cause over 50,000 casualties.\n  The point I wish to make is I witnessed with my own eyes the Reserves \nbeing brought in. I was with a group that was called up on 30 days' \nnotice. Most of them had been in World War II. I had brief service at \nthe end of World War II in the Navy. We were all basically former World \nWar II veterans and just beginning to reestablish ourselves. It was \nonly an interval of about 4 years since most had been released then in \n1946 and, whammo, in 30 days we were in it.\n  At first I remember in the training detachments down in Quantico \nthere was a decided feeling among the old regulars of the Marine Corps \nthat we were second-class citizens, but once our folks hit the \nbattlefield, whether it was on the ground or in the air--I was assigned \nto an air unit as a ground officer--Reserve pilots flew right along \nwith the regular pilots, and one could not tell the difference. They \npulled equal missions together, took equal risks. I do not know how the \ncasualties bear out, but I know a lot--not a lot, but a number of our \nReserve squadron lost their lives, wounded.\n  So I say to the Senator, as I listened, I thought back of those days \nand how\n\n[[Page S12425]]\n\nin the ensuing years that was the first time in the Korean War that we \nreally involved the number of Reserves that were needed, and our \nregular forces then, not unlike now, had been pared down in numbers. As \na consequence, today I believe 60 percent of the persons serving in \nIraq are Reserves at this very moment. I use the term ``reserves'' to \napply to the Guard as well. So they are full partners.\n  Then, fast forwarding, I remember serving in the Pentagon during \nVietnam, and we decided to have, under the leadership of an \nextraordinary Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, the concept of a \ntotal force; in other words, whether one is Guard, Reserve, or regular, \nthey are a total force. The total force concept moved on through the \nyears.\n  I think the Senator is right on target. If the Senator will bear with \nus a little bit, we are trying to determine exactly how we are going to \ntreat this amendment. At the moment I am very impressed with the \nSenator's objective. I ask forgiveness for taking the time of the \nSenate to dwell on what I actually saw years ago and have seen, as the \nSenator has, on our visits to Iraq, one cannot distinguish between the \nGuard and the Reserves. They are all amalgamated into the regulars. \nActually, many Guard and Reserve units are functioning as units, \nsomewhat augmented, I suppose, with some regular officers, and vice \nversa some of the regular units are augmented with the Reserve and \nGuard officers. But it certainly is a total force and a magnificent \nforce we have serving today.\n  The Senator is right, all of these trends with regard to personnel, \nthey begin to--it is like the awakening of the dawn. The sun does not \nbreak through, and one begins to wonder what about this cloud cover, \nand there is some cloud cover associated with the recent statistics \nregarding the introduction of new Guard and Reserve persons.\n  I will say I think the retention has been pretty good in many areas \nof our Guard and Reserves, but nevertheless we need an inducement. I \nthink this amendment has the beginnings of something that is very \nimportant.\n  The Senator is a valued member of our committee. The Senator fought \nhard for this one. Give us a little time to work it around.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the Senator will yield very briefly, I say the \npassion that the Senator from Virginia has relative to the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces has been exhibited in our committee time and \nagain. It is pretty obvious to see why. It is because of men and women \nlike the Senator who have served in the Guard and Reserve over the last \n50 years that we now truly are a blended force. We are a force of \nmilitary men and women when it comes time to join hands and go to the \nfight. It truly is a seamless integration between the Active Duty and \nthe Reserve and the Guard today in Iraq. That is why I think it is very \nimportant.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments and his leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just to add a note, the Senator touched on \nthis, but we cannot and do not--and I do not think this will--erode the \nbase of pay and benefits given to the regular force. Those individuals \nhave committed to a career in the military. In a career of 20 years, \nthey will move 10 or 12 times. On the other hand, the reservist is at \nhome, most of them, in a status where there is an ever-present risk of \nbeing called up. For that, I think they should be given some special \nrecognition.\n  I believe the Senator has that embraced in these valuable ideas that \nthe Senator has in this amendment.\n  That is because they are ready to respond and they have to, not just \nmove on a set of orders, but they have to try to keep their families in \nplace in their homes; they have to try to work out some relationship \nwith their employers so they can go back. They have a whole set of \nproblems that are quite different than those in the regulars.\n  I do not think in any way this legislation encroaches on the \nimportant category of benefits for the regular forces, but does things \nthat recognize the importance of the Guard and Reserve.\n  I see another distinguished colleague on the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I say to the Senator from Maine \nI will be very brief because the Senator is waiting, but I want to \ncomment on the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  First, I commend him for offering this amendment. It is a very fair \namendment. It is a very balanced amendment. It takes on a very \nimportant subject and deals with it very forthrightly, which is the \nfact that our Reserve Forces are called upon more and more now and are \nput under greater demands, and there is a lot of pressure and a lot of \nstress now.\n  We do not require our Active-Duty Forces to wait until they are 60. \nAfter they get their 20 years in, they are eligible for retirement. \nWhat the amendment of the Senator does, as I understand it, is to \ncredit the Reserve personnel for 90 days of mobilized active-duty \nservice toward--it allows them to gain 3 months reduction from the \ncurrent requirement that they be 60 years of age.\n  It is a very important amendment. It addresses an inequity that we \nhave, which is we require our Reserve Forces, even after they have been \nmobilized, even if they are mobilized year after year, not to get any \ncredit for that active-duty service the way our regulars do.\n  I commend the Senator. It is a very fair amendment. It has a lesser \ncost than the one that was opposed by the Department of Defense last \nyear. I hope the Department of Defense will not oppose the Senator's \namendment. We have not received a statement from the Department of \nDefense yet, but I hope, even though they opposed the amendment last \nyear, they will not oppose the amendment of the Senator from Georgia.\n  It is a worthy amendment. It has bipartisan support. As I understand, \nin addition to his colleague from Georgia, Senators Landrieu and Pryor \nare cosponsors. We very much support his effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, last year an amendment \nsomewhat similar to this, but considerably more extreme in its reach, \nwas considered by the Senate. At that time I, along with others, \nestablished the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve. It was \nincluded in our Defense Authorization Act. That commission is now in \noperation. As a matter of fact, the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nand I attended the opening meeting here just days ago. It has an \nextraordinary list of members. I ask unanimous consent to have a fact \nsheet and a list of membership printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Commission on the National Guard and Reserves Fact Sheet\n\n\n                                MISSION\n\n       The independent Commission on the National Guard and \n     Reserves is charged by Congress to recommend any needed \n     changes in law and policy to ensure that the Guard and \n     Reserves are organized, trained, equipped, compensated, and \n     supported to best meet the national security requirements of \n     the United States.

Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has an amendment. \nIt is one of the 12 amendments we have under the unanimous consent \nagreement. There is a time limit on it, of which the Senator is aware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n[[Page S12427]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2436\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, in August the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission issued its fifth round of base closures since 1988. Soon the \nDepartment of Defense will begin implementing the BRAC report, \nundoubtedly having a direct and lasting impact on States across this \ncountry, including my own State of Maine. I rise today as a \ncongressional veteran of all five previous base-closing rounds to \nintroduce this amendment along with my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins. It is as well being cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Wyden, \nand Landrieu, and endorsed by the Association of Defense Communities, \nto place the communities that are directly affected by base closures in \nthis recent round in the driver's seat with respect to the critical \neconomic development decisions our base-closing communities are going \nto be confronting, and not placing the Department of Defense in control \nof their economic development and their economic futures.\n  Our amendment would require that, when making determinations \nconcerning the transfer of property and installations, the Secretary of \nDefense must offer that property first to the local redevelopment \nauthority, or the LRA, that represents the community and is required to \nbe established under the law. If the LRA accepts the offer, the \nSecretary is required to transfer the property to the LRA free of cost.\n  Incredibly, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act now provides \nfor the first time in any base-closing round the Secretary shall seek \nfair market value in the case of an economic development conveyance \nthrough which the Secretary transfers product to affected communities \nfor economic development purposes. In short, the law now says the first \norder of business is for the Department of Defense to receive fair \nmarket value, no matter the cost in economic development, no matter the \ncost to the communities themselves.\n  What kind of a perverse situation do we have, when the taxpayers and \ncommunities are facing closures or realignments and they are now \nconfronted with a triple burden? They have already contributed mightily \ntoward the cost of Iraq--more than $200 billion, $28.5 billion of which \nwas spent on redevelopment efforts in that country. Now their \nfacilities are being realigned or closed and now the statute is \nrequiring of them, if you want this property for economic recovery, for \neconomic development--because now they are reeling from the impact of a \nbase closure--you will be required as a community or communities to buy \nit back from the Department of Defense at fair market value. That \nobviously is going to cost millions upon millions of dollars to these \ncommunities that are already reeling from the economic impact as a \nresult of base closure.\n  It is no wonder communities are going to feel slighted and, indeed, \nabandoned by those they have supported for so long. Is this the message \nwe want to send, that we are going to make the recovery process Defense \nDepartment centered and not community centered?\n  As I said earlier, I have been a veteran of five previous base-\nclosing rounds when they first started in 1988. I have been through \nevery one of those rounds. It has always been, What can we do to \nmitigate the economic impact on the communities directly affected by \nbase closures? But now, regrettably, we are seeing a reversal in that \napproach under the current statute. Now we are saying the U.S. Defense \nDepartment is better equipped to move the development decisions in the \nDepartment as opposed to concentrating and allowing the communities to \nmake those decisions.\n  Are we to believe the Department of Defense is better equipped to \nmake decisions as to which property transfers will be most beneficial \nto a community's economic development, that the Department of Defense \nhas a greater understanding of the individual challenges confronted by \nour towns and communities in the aftermath of base closures than the \ntowns and communities themselves?\n\n[[Page S12428]]\n\n  I suggest such a notion is on its face absurd. Indeed, it is so \npreposterous I can hardly believe we are standing here today to offer \nthis amendment, that we are in a situation that we have to offer this \namendment. Why would we continue to require the economic future of our \nBRAC-affected communities to be determined by the highest bidder the \nDefense Department can identify?\n  So it is going to be the Defense Department that is going to be \ndriving the sale, the transfer, and the future economic plans of a \nparticular community and not the communities themselves. It contradicts \nthe purpose of what we need to do as a result of the base closures. In \nfact, in the aftermath of decisions that were made by the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission, I had the opportunity to speak with \none of the commissioners, who said one of the purposes in making this \ndecision--regrettably, on Brunswick--was the fact that we wanted to put \nthe communities in the driver's seat. We wanted the communities to be \nable to dictate their own future economic destiny, not the Department \nof Defense, because the original decision was a proposal for \nrealignment, and they recognized they could close the facility, the \nNavy could take the personnel and transfer the squadrons to Florida and \nkeep the facility and hold the communities hostage to an idle facility \nthat would not generate jobs. So they decided to allow the communities \nto make those decisions.\n  They made the decision, regrettably, to close the facility, but \nbecause they wanted the community to be able to take charge of its own \nfuture economic destiny and be able to dictate what the use of that \nabandoned base would be. So it makes no sense now to discover that we \nhave in statute where it says the Department of Defense is going to \nrequire, is going to insist on fair market value for transferring these \nproperties to the community. Ultimately, obviously, the Defense \nDepartment is going to be looking for the highest bidder. Ultimately \nthe Defense Department could potentially dictate the use of those \nfacilities, even if it contravenes the interest, the position, and the \ndecisions by the local communities in terms of how they want to use \nthat facility.\n  What happens if the Federal Government's idea of opportunity is a \nFederal prison or an oil refinery that a community strongly opposes? \nLegislation has already been introduced in the House which, if enacted, \ncould impose oil refineries on these communities. In fact, it has been \npart of their Energy bill in the House of Representatives.\n  Ultimately, under current statutes, these decisions would rest not \nwith the State, not with the town, or the city, but with the Department \nof Defense. Rather, we ought to look at the model established in the \nState of Maine by the success achieved after I secured a free transfer \nof land of the former Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, ME, that was \nclosed in the 1991 round and subsequently closed its doors in 1994 as a \nresult of that 1991 round.\n  At the height of its activity, the Loring Air Force Base augmented \nthe native population of Aroostook County by 10,000 individuals. Today \nthe community is only now beginning to see progress in recovering from \nits prior base closing loss, replacing 1,100 lost civilian jobs with \n1,400 new civilian jobs. I could not imagine where we would be today if \nnot for the free land transfer. Can you imagine if they cannot have the \nability to make decisions about their future without being handicapped \nabout paying fair market value for this property? It would have \nhandicapped them from making the kind of decisions to allow them to \nmove forward, if they were first required to pay for this property to \nthe Department of Defense.\n  It was bad enough they lost the base. It was bad enough they lost \n10,000 people who were located on that base.\n  I might add 10,000 is larger than many of the communities in the \nState of Maine.\n  Thousands of jobs depended on that base.\n  And we now say to the community, Well, sorry. You are now going to \nhave to pay fair market value to get it back. With the current base-\nclosing round, America faces 22 major base closures and 33 alignments. \nOutside Maine, leaders and residents in States such as California, \nGeorgia, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Texas, Utah, Oregon, \nNew Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Wisconsin, and New Mexico \nwill face considerable challenges as they attempt to successfully \ntransition local economies following base closures and realignments.\n  In fact, according to the data contained in the 2005 base-closing \nround, almost 33,000 civilian jobs will be lost in base closures and \nrealignments.\n  The Naval air station had a $211 million direct impact on the local \neconomy in 2004. But now the communities surrounding the air station \nare expected to directly lose 3,275 military and civilian jobs, as well \nas indirectly losing another 2,590 jobs, for a total of 5,865 jobs, or \n15 percent of this labor market. While there are only 32,000 people who \nlive in Brunswick and the neighboring town of Topsham combined, such a \nsignificant loss will cause a catastrophic unemployment increase in the \narea to an incredible 15 percent.\n  These communities need tools, not obstacles.\n  For those of you who are confronting the base-closure process for the \nfirst time, I can assure you that this will undoubtedly have a \nsubstantial and detrimental impact on these communities.\n  In the final analysis, the base-closing act, as it stands today, \nplaces a very difficult burden on the community because it places an \ninappropriately high priority on the Secretary of Defense to obtain \nfair market value at the expense of the best interests of the \ncommunity's economic recovery.\n  I know you will hear opponents in the Department of Defense make its \narguments. They will say, Well, suppose the community doesn't want to \naccept the property for any reason. Of course, our amendment says if \nthe community doesn't want it, and it would be mutually beneficial to \nthe community and the Department of Defense to have the property \ntransferred through another channel, the community need only to refuse \nthe offer process.\n  Similarly, the amendment would not require that the community request \nor accept all the property at an installation in order to receive any \nportion of that property.\n  The Department of Defense will also say we need the funds we would \nrecoup from selling property at fair market value to contribute to the \naccount used for closing or realigning military installations or \nenvironmental restoration and mitigation.\n  The Department of Defense may also claim that it requires the \nproceeds for the sale of closed base property in order to pay for that \nproperty's cleanup and redevelopment. However, history tells us that \nthis is absolutely not the case. In fact, according to the January 2004 \nGAO report, over the previous four base-closing rounds, proceeds from \nland transfers account for only 2.6 percent of the Department of \nDefense budget for cleanup, redevelopment, closure, and realignment \ncosts.\n  Selling off closed base property is clearly not necessary to these \nefforts and are certainly unwarranted when one considers the harm that \nit can cause to these communities that it purports to help.\n  Finally, it is critical to know that this amendment also incorporates \nthe safeguards currently applicable to these economic conveyances to \nensure the integrity of these types of transfers.\n  For instance, a property conveyance can only be provided to an LRA \nfor economic development or job generation. Moreover, once the property \nis transferred to an LRA, the proceeds from the sale or lease of the \nproperty within the next 7 years must be spent in support of economic \nredevelopment of the installation.\n  That is an important point because that would mean that it could \nreduce the Federal expenditures and environmental mitigation or other \nexpenditures that are required and are associated with the closure of \nmilitary installations.\n  In addition, this amendment retains safeguard provisions currently \ncontained in the BRAC Act to ensure the integrity of a transfer to a \ncommunity.\n  For instance, it retains the provisions covered under the \nComprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act of 1980 to \nensure that the property will be environmentally restored.\n  The amendment also includes an exception that protects the ability of \nthe Secretary of Defense to make transfers necessary for our national \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\n  I hope that we can work with my colleagues in addressing these issues \nwith this amendment. I certainly will invite the chairman of the \ncommittee and members of the committee to critically think about the \nimpact of the current statute on those communities that will be \ndirectly affected by base closures.\n  Are we intending the Department of Defense to be the economic \ndeveloper for these communities, for my communities in Maine, for \nBrunswick and Topsham that will not be able to plan for their economic \nfutures and their economic well-being? They want to be able to dictate \nthose choices. Are we now saying we are going to hamstring them where \nwe say it will require fair market value for the property of the closed \ninstallation? Ultimately, they are going to be at the mercy of the \nDefense Department.\n  The Defense Department is going to say we are going to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, and it is one of several options under the statute. The \nDepartment of Defense could sell it at auction to the highest bidder. \nIt could sell to a private entity, to an LRA. It could do a number of \nvarious things under the statute.\n  In the final analysis, they could override the interests of the \ncommunity, not to mention the fact that it will require the community \nto pay fair market value.\n  This is the first time for this to occur under the base-closing \nstatute. This is the fifth round. In the four previous rounds, this was \nnot the case.\n  I hope that we will reverse this course because it will have an \nenormous impact on my communities in Maine and the 22 other States \nacross this country that will be in similar positions.\n  I hope we can work through these issues.\n  I implore my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of the \nbase-closing communities, those directly impacted by the devastating \nloss of a military installation that will cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars, the thousands of jobs in my communities in the State of Maine \nand communities and taxpayers across this country who continue to spend \nhundreds of billions, $30 billion of which we are spending on the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  We have even closed bases in order to finance not only the war but \nthe expenditures within the Pentagon. And now we are saying to \ncommunities, You are going to pay a price for a third time. We are \ngoing to make you pay for those closed installations if you want to \ndevelop them. You are going to have to pay fair market value.\n  I submit that is unacceptable, it is unreasonable, and it is not fair \nto the communities that are directly on the line.\n  To dispel any misconceptions, let me clarify the goals of the \namendment and what it would and would not do.\n  If there is property that a community does not want, or it would be \nmutually beneficial to the community and the DoD to have the property \ntransfer through other channels, the community need only refuse the \noffer of property. Similarly, the amendment would not require that the \ncommunity request or accept all of the property at an installation in \norder to receive any portion of that property.\n  Moreover, it is critical to note that, while it is true that the \nrevenue that the DoD receives from selling installation property goes \ninto accounts that are used for such purposes as closing or realigning \nmilitary installations, or environmental restoration and mitigation, \nthis amendment would not significantly deplete those funds to the \ndetriment of affected communities.\n  The fact remains, the BRAC account has historically been funded \nprimarily with congressional appropriations from the general treasury, \nrather than proceeds from property sales and leases. While the DoD may \npoint to a few isolated examples where it recently obtained a large \namount of money in return for a property transfer--for instance for \ntransfers in places like Orange County, CA--those isolated examples are \nnot indicative of what it can be expected to receive elsewhere in the \nNation, where property values are considerably lower.\n  According to the BRAC Report, there have been a total of 97 base and \n5 installation closures categorized by DoD as ``major'' as a result of \nthe 1988 through 1995 processes. In addition, the DoD has stated that \nthere were 55 ``major'' realignments and at least 235 smaller-sized \nclosures and realignments as a result of past actions.\n  Yet, a January 2005 Government Accountability Office report found \nthat DoD's total land sales and related revenue was only about $595 \nmillion for the prior four base rounds combined. The $595 million is \nminimal in comparison to the approximately $23 billion Congress \nappropriated to the BRAC accounts for the four prior BRAC rounds. In \nfact, the revenue from sales only represented about 2.6 percent of \nthose accounts.\n  Furthermore, that $595 million figure is dwarfed by the amount that \nthe DoD has saved as a result of BRAC closures--about $28.9 billion in \nnet savings through fiscal year 2003 from the prior four closure \nrounds, according to GAO, and a projected $7 billion annually \nthereafter. And these are net savings, that already take into account \nBRAC implementation cost! Unlike these BRAC savings, which accrue to \ntaxpayers across the Nation, the negative impacts of base closures are \ndisproportionately and unfairly borne by the communities where bases \nhave closed.\n  This amendment also incorporates the safeguards currently applicable \nto EDCs to ensure the integrity of these types of transfers. For \ninstance, the property conveyances could only be provided to an LRA for \neconomic redevelopment or job generation. Moreover, once the property \nis transferred to an LRA, the proceeds from a sale or lease of the \nproperty, within the next 7 years, must be spent in support of economic \nredevelopment for the installation.\n  I have not been informed of any abuses that these safeguards would \nnot address, and from what I understand, the DoD tracks and audits such \ntransactions to ensure compliance. If further oversight is necessary, I \nwould not oppose it.\n  Some would contend that local towns and communities would not be best \nserved by their own, unsupervised redevelopment efforts. In response, I \nask, are we saying that the United States Department of Defense is \nbetter equipped to make decisions as to which property transfers will \nbe most beneficial to an individual community's economic development? \nThat the DoD has a greater understanding of the individual challenges \nfaced by our towns and cities in the aftermath of base closures than \nthe towns and cities themselves?\n  I would suggest that such a notion is, on its face, absurd. So why \nwould we continue to require the economic future of our BRAC-affected \ncommunities to be determined by the highest bidder the Department of \nDefense can identify?\n  Rather, we should look to the model established in my own State, by \nthe success achieved at the site of the former Loring Air Force Base in \nLimestone, ME, closed in 1994 as a result of a BRAC round. At the \nheight of its activity, the Loring Air Force Base augmented the native \npopulation of Aroostook County by 10,000 individuals. That is why I \nworked tirelessly to ensure that the base was transferred to the \ncommunity's redevelopment authority for free.\n  And I can tell you firsthand that the redevelopment of Loring--\nreplacing the 1,100 lost civilian jobs with 1,400 new civilian jobs--\nwould not have been as successful, if the community had not been placed \nin charge of its own redevelopment and had not received the majority of \nthe installation property for free as an indispensable redevelopment \ntool.\n  I am open to continuing to work with my colleagues on any reasonable \nconcerns about this amendment, but would emphasize the importance of \npassing it now. Should additional reasonable changes be necessary, we \ncan always address those issues through future legislation--but we \nshould not lose this opportunity to enact meaningful and necessary \nchange.\n  I implore my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of the \nBRAC affected communities across our Nation, who continue to contribute \nto the Iraqi war and reconstruction efforts, while simultaneously \nstruggling to convince our Government to support their economic \nrecovery, right here at home.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S12430]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I wish to recognize our \ndistinguished colleague from Maine, former member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We deeply regret that the Senator moved on, but she is now \non the Tax Committee. As someone said, that is where the money is.\n  It is with great reluctance that I say to my good friend that we will \nhave to very strongly oppose this. She makes an equitable argument, \npersuasive argument. But we have to take a look at the broad picture.\n  This is the fifth BRAC round. When the original legislation was \nwritten, there was quite an analysis put into that bill as to what \nhappens to the properties if the BRAC Commission declares it to be \nclosed. That framework of laws has guided four previous BRAC \nCommissions.\n  Let us step back and think. While this particular base, Brunswick--\nand I know it well, having been Secretary of the Navy--served the \nNation magnificently, I was somewhat surprised to see it was closed, \nbut the decision was made. And believe me, BRAC also hit my State \nseverely. The decision was made to close it. That is over. We can't \nrepeal that. But this base property does not just belong to the \ncitizens of Maine but all Americans. It is Federal property. As such, \nit is owned by all Americans. All Americans, through their tax \ncollections, provided the funds to improve this base over the years and \nto maintain the base.\n  We have to be careful as the BRAC Commission lays down a matrix of \nclosure adjustments all over America. In some instances, some \ncommunities would benefit enormously. Mind you, this bill governs BRAC \ndecisions, wherever it was in the United States of America on BRAC \nround 5, the one currently being administered.\n  When Congress enacted the first BRAC law, they very carefully \nassessed that there would be so many different locations, different \ncircumstances that we had to put down a series of steps that the BRAC \nCommission and subsequently those that are entrusted with the closing--\nnamely, the DOD--must follow by law.\n  For example, when a facility such as this is closed, the first thing \nto determine is, is there another military operation that could utilize \nthis base? This was primarily a Naval base. It could well be needed by \nthe Army or other departments of the military. That is the first thing. \nAre there other DOD missions? Second, other Federal agencies are \nconstantly relocating and reestablishing areas. The Federal Government \nis disbursing a lot of it out of Washington. Could not this property, \nowned by all citizens of America, be utilized by another Federal \nagency?\n  It is rather interesting. Through the years, there has crept in a \ndoctrine that the next priority should be, for example, maybe the \nIndian tribes. Oftentimes, there are agreements that go back years and \nyears regarding Federal property that was once occupied by the Indians. \nSometimes it might revert to the Indians. Maybe the Senator would seek \nto advise the Senate. I understand that the Senator recently amended \nthe amendment to protect the interests of the Indians. But the Indians \nare only one small segment. A number of base installations, through the \n16 years of BRAC, have been provided as shelters for the homeless.\n  Then we move down to the public benefit conveyances. Sometimes it was \ndetermined that these Federal facilities should be transferred to local \ntransportation or to airport authorities or veterans centers.\n  In other words, there is another whole category of not quasi-Federal \nbut certainly uses paralleling what the Federal Government provides \npeople--that whole category.\n  Then they have economic redevelopment conveyances; again, as the \nSenator said, either at fair market value or DOD can determine certain \ncircumstances so they could follow the very narrow provisions of the \nSenator's bill, turn it over to the local LRA. That is established \nmaybe at no cost.\n  It is important that we don't take a carefully crafted, a carefully \ntime-tested framework of laws regarding how the properties are to be \nused following a closure and suddenly wipe it off the books.\n  There are a number of old deeds. For example, one installation I \nhave--Fort Monroe, which has been in business for a very long time--\nunder the deed, if BRAC were to close it--and indeed this time BRAC did \nclose it--then it reverts to certain community interests.\n  This amendment, as I read it, would wipe out that deed.\n  I am not speaking from a selfish point of view. I am simply saying \nthat there are other Senators who should very quickly, if they are \ninclined to support Senator Snowe's amendment, check with your local \nState to make sure that if you are affected by this round, the fifth \nround of BRAC, there may be some old deeds, conveyances, and \nagreements, with a facility having been closed in your State, as to how \nthat facility then reverts to other interests.\n  This is not a very simple thing. You pull at the heartstrings when \nyou talk about, yes, Maine can use it. I don't doubt that Maine can use \nit. It is a first-class facility. But it belongs to the taxpayers. They \nhave paid for the construction of it. They have paid for years and \nyears of maintenance.\n\n  I suggest the framework of laws which has been in existence these 16 \nyears remain intact and this closure be conducted in a manner \nconsistent with the closures that have taken place in the several \nStates represented in this Senate over a period of some 16 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I, too, must reluctantly oppose this amendment. I have \ncome through significant base closings in my State and am going through \nthem right now. I know exactly what the Senator from Maine is referring \nto.\n  There are many occasions when land needs to be granted to a local \neconomic redevelopment authority at no cost. There are many cases like \nthat, but there are other uses that have to come first that she would \nnot allow for, including such things as parks or schools, conveyances \nfor those public purposes which it seems to me must come first if we \nare using Federal property and deciding what to do with Federal \nproperty. In terms of the priority list, it seems to me public purposes \nsuch as parks and schools should have priority over the economic \nredevelopment, as desirable as that can be.\n  But there is another problem with that amendment, and that is it does \nnot provide discretion. It makes it mandatory that the land always go \nfree to a local reuse even though that land may have tremendous value \nand the proceeds we have been able to obtain, which are not great, \nnonetheless have been there to help us clean up property which we want \nto turn over to local governments. We have huge cleanup costs. We have \nbeen able to obtain money for the resale of land. That money has gone \ninto the cleanup of these bases before they are turned back to the \nlocal authority.\n  I have nothing but understanding for the Senator from Maine in the \nsituation she and her State face. We have a number of facilities which \nhave been realigned in my home State which have value. In one case, we \nhave a property where a buyer is willing to purchase it if we could get \nthe military to negotiate with that purchaser. That would be money \nwhich would come to the Federal Treasury. The buyer is willing to pay \nto the Federal Treasury. Instead, the Air Force prefers to auction the \nproperty. The question is whether, under all the circumstances that \nexist, it is fairer to auction that property or to negotiate with a \nprivate buyer with whom the Government had long been negotiating.\n  Without getting into that issue as to which is fairer--an auction or \na negotiated sale--neither one of them would be permitted under the \namendment of the Senator from Maine. It would have to go for nothing to \nsomebody even though you have a buyer out there who wants to pay for \nit. We should not take such an absolute position on the disposition of \nthese properties. There will be occasions--and I happen to agree with \nthe Senator from Maine--where property should be turned over to a local \ndevelopment or redevelopment authority for free. That is true. But \nthere are also occasions where the property has tremendous value, where \nthe Government, as our dear friend from Virginia has said, has invested \nan awful lot of money in this base and where it has great value and \nwhere those dollars are needed in the Treasury, in part to pay for the \ncleanup of\n\n[[Page S12431]]\n\nproperty before it is turned over for any other use. I don't see why we \nwould want to write an absolute rule into the law which says that the \nproperty must be given away to a local reuse authority rather than \nthere should be an effort made to obtain fair compensation for it. It \ndoes not say that there always must be compensation; it says that there \nwill be an effort to seek fair compensation. There are certain ways of \nbuilding discretion and flexibility into that.\n  We have another situation where we have a significant piece of \nproperty that will be available as a result of this last round of base \nclosures. This property has immense value. I don't know that we can \ncome close to equating it to the Presidio in San Francisco, but it has, \nnonetheless, immense value. The question is, What will the military do \nwith this property? It is my belief that the military should keep it \nbecause part of the base that was kept open and not realigned needs the \nproperty for its own use. But the military may decide it does not need \nthat property. It may decide that property is expendable and can be \nsurplused. Then what?\n  Under the Senator's amendment, extraordinarily valuable property \nwhich any developer would like to get their hands on and pay for it and \npay the National Treasury money for must go for nothing to a local \nredevelopment authority. We cannot get any financial benefit from that \nland no matter how valuable if it goes to a local redevelopment \nauthority.\n  That is too rigid. That is too inflexible and deprives the Federal \nTreasury of desperately needed money, including money for cleanup. We \nhave a huge cleanup bill for these properties. We cannot simply give \naway the opportunity to recoup some funds for the Federal Treasury from \nhighly valuable land.\n  I have lost a lot of bases in my home State. All three of our \nStrategic Air Command bases have been closed. We have lost other \nfacilities, as well. I know firsthand what a complicated process this \nis. I do know, as the Senator from Maine says, there are occasions when \nproperty under all the circumstances should go to a local redevelopment \nagency without reimbursement to the Government, but there are other \noccasions when land is extraordinarily valuable and when people are \nwilling to pay for that land where, if it is not going to go for a \npublic use and it will be put up for private redevelopment, there \nshould be some recouping to the National Treasury.\n  I am afraid this is too rigid, and I cannot support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator talks about cleanup, but over \nthe years $1.4 billion has been recouped by the Department of Defense. \nThat money simply goes to the Treasury to an account earmarked for \nprecisely what the Senator from Michigan said, for cleanup and other \nexpenses.\n  Again, the Federal taxpayers who once owned the land now do not have \nto add additional burdens out of their pockets for cleanup as a \nconsequence of this existing framework of laws that has been there for \n16 years that enable some properties to bring about money for the \nFederal Government, but it goes precisely into that account for the \ncleanup, to save Federal taxpayers the added burden of cleanup \nexpenses. The Senator made a key point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 11\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I respond to several of the issues raised by the chairman \nand ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services. It is important. \nWe have to establish the fact that this is the first time we are \napplying the statute in this fashion. It is the first time this \nstatutory language is applying to a base-closing round that allows the \nDepartment of Defense to establish and impose fair market value for the \nuse of this property as opposed to transferring it for free to a local \nredevelopment authority. This is not some special interest authority. \nThese are local communities, State officials who have a genuine \ninterest in the future of their communities, whereas the Department of \nDefense is interested in a one-time sale.\n  I hope we would respect the interests of the community that is \ndirectly affected. After all, they are the ones who are \ndisproportionately bearing the burden of the base closure. Why isn't it \nthat they wouldn't have a direct interest in shaping it?\n  This is the first time this statute is going to apply to a base-\nclosing round. Is it fair, at a time we are asking our citizens, our \nconstituents, to pay $200 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq, \nlosing your bases, and then we are saying, If you want them back and \nyou want that property, you pay for it?\n  We have had four previous base-closing rounds. We had 97 major base \nclosures. Then we had 235 smaller sized closures and 55 major \nrealignments. And we never asked for fair market value. We have never \nsaid the Department of Defense was in the business of economic \ndevelopment. We said they were in the business of national security and \nrunning the defense of our country and wars, not being real estate \ndevelopers. Do they have an interest of where the future is going to go \nin Brunswick and Topsham, ME? I say not.\n  At Loring Air Force Base, it worked out very well. They had a \ncompatible relationship with the Defense Department. We have a defense \nagency there which is great. We have Job Corps there. We have private \nsector entities. We didn't disregard public benefits or the public \nagencies. In fact, the DOD, under this statute, does not have to \nconsider, does not have to transfer to any public agency, could \nconsider transferring some of this property to another public agency \nbut does not have to. It is no different from the LRA. This is wrong. \nThis is contravening the intent.\n  The chairman raises the question about deeds. Reversion will stand as \nit is. It will not revert back to the owner, as the Congressional \nResearch Service said, to the original owner. This language will not do \nanything to reverse that in any way. I make that clear.\n  We are moving in an entirely different track. All of America will \nbenefit from the savings, but not all of America is going to bear the \ndisproportionate burden of the base closure. For the Department of \nDefense now to say we are going to take charge and hold these \ncommunities, such as Brunswick and Topsham, hostage to the decisions \nthat are made by the Department of Defense and how they will use that \nproperty, frankly, I find it rather surprising, dismaying, and \ndisappointing we are at this point, and I have been through all five \nbase-closing rounds. I have been through it all.\n  We talk about environmental cleanup. Supposedly, according to the \nDepartment of Defense, they have a net savings of $28 billion. They \nshould have been able to clean up all of the bases by now.\n  Under my legislation, what it would allow is that the LRAs for the \nnext several years, for any money they made, would go back to the \ninstallation for job generation and for helping to clean up so it can \nmitigate the Federal costs for environmental litigation, which, by the \nway, the Department of Defense is not doing a very good job of in other \ninstallations. That is a serious concern. They have diverted those \nproceeds for purposes other than those for which they were intended.\n  That is the issue. They have had a net savings, according to their \nnumbers, of $28 billion, but they have not used it for what it was \nintended, which was to clean up other facilities from the four base-\nclosing rounds. They have not done it, so the local communities would \nbe in control, be able to help dictate their futures, so we do not have \nthe Department of Defense saying: Well, you better take this or else--\nor else you get nothing.\n  I do not think that is fair. I do not think that is fair to \ncommunities that have embraced the military for generations. At a time \nin which we are exacting a great cost from our constituents and \ntaxpayers, with more than $200 billion in Iraq--supplemental upon \nsupplemental, reconstruction, schools, security, sewage systems, \npower--we are saying now to communities that have just lost their \nbases:\n  Oh, by the way, you are going to have to pay hundreds of millions of \ndollars if you want it back and if you want to generate jobs.\n  Now, tell that to my communities, which are going to lose more than \n5,000 jobs, that if they want to create jobs, they are going to have to \npay hundreds\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\nof millions of dollars before they can start that process. If they \ndon't, the Department of Defense is going to tell them how their future \nis going to go. They will tell them whether they want an oil refinery \nbecause they are not going to have any choice. I cannot imagine that is \nthe direction we want to take with this statute.\n  It has worked very well in the past. As I have said, for hundreds and \nhundreds of base closures, it has worked well. It worked very well for \nthe former Loring Air Force Base. There has been a very compatible \nrelationship up there that has been a success, but that is because I \nwas able to secure a free transfer for facilities like Loring back in \n1991 so they could start with the tools they needed to help shape their \nfuture. It has worked. Allow that process to work. It has been \ndemonstrated it can work. But let's not create another obstacle by now \nhaving the Department of Defense in the business of developing real \nestate. I think it is a very unfortunate direction.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, support what is \nright for the communities that are going to bear a tremendous burden, \nand allow this process to work. It is in the best interests of the \ncommunities and in the best interests of this country,\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support today of this amendment \n offered by my colleague from Maine and myself to the fiscal year 2006 \nDefense/Authorization Bill.\n  Our amendment focuses on one goal, to provide the communities that \nare losing bases through the BRAC another opportunity to control their \nfuture redevelopment, recovery, and economic well-being.\n  The ``no-cost conveyance'' amendment that we have proposed would \nmodify the BRAC Act to give the affected communities the ``right of \nfirst refusal'' with respect to the transfer of property on the base. \nSpecifically, it would require that when making determinations \nconcerning the transfer of property at a base, the Secretary of Defense \nmust first offer that property to the community through its \nredevelopment authority. If the redevelopment authority accepts, the \nSecretary is required to transfer the property to the community at no \ncost.\n  This legislation provides for an important exception in the case of \nnational security, in order to allow the Secretary to transfer the \nproperty to a military service or other entity within the Department of \nDefense, the Coast Guard, or the Department of Homeland Security, if \nsuch action is necessary in the national security interest of the \nUnited States.\n  I support this amendment because I know personally what the true \nimpact of a devastating base closure can cause to a close-knit \ncommunity. I grew up just 10 miles from the now-closed Loring Air Force \nBase. After the base shut its doors in 1994, tens of thousands of \npeople left northern Maine and moved away because of the limited \nopportunities available to them once the Air Force left town.\n  Given the rural area of the former Air Force base, the fact that the \nbase was eventually transferred to the community at no cost was \ncritically important to spurring economic growth in an area that had \njust been devastated by the loss of thousands of jobs overnight.\n  The collateral damage of the base's closure went far beyond active \nduty military personnel and their families. It also affected many small \nbusiness owners who were forced to close their businesses and leave the \narea permanently. When a base closes, the need to attract new economic \ndevelopment is even more difficult and compounded by the fact that \nsupporting professionals have already left the area. The resulting job \nlosses and their impact on the local economy further highlight the need \nfor providing the option of no-cost conveyance at a time when many \nareas can ill-afford to spend millions of dollars to purchase vacant \nbuildings.\n  Much like a decade ago, the Midcoast region of Maine is now suffering \nthe same devastating fate through the closure of the last active duty \nairfield north of New Jersey, the Brunswick Naval Air Station. Not only \nwill this region lose 2,667 active duty personnel, 5,704 Navy family \nmembers, 715 civilian jobs, and an additional 1,300 drilling reservists \nwho contribute to the local economy each month, but also the community \nwill have to pay the Department of Defense fair market value for the \nbase's property.\n  Communities affected by a large base closure are already reeling from \nthe economic loss of the military as its neighbor, and to add the \nhardship of forcing the same community to pay the Department for \nvacating the area is essentially a ``double closure.'' \n  This amendment is not just to assist a base closing in my home State \nof Maine, but it is to help all bases affected across the country. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and in doing so \nsupport the communities nationwide that are experiencing the far-\nreaching ramifications of closure or realignment due to the recent base \nclosing round by the Department of Defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Allard amendment \nNo. 2423, with no amendments in order to that amendment prior to the \nvote. My understanding is this request has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the bill is open for further amendment, as \nSenator Levin and I are here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2430\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, on the question of the \nindependent commission, my good friend from Virginia rattled off a \nbunch of statistics as to how many investigations have taken place, how \nmany hearings have been held, how many witnesses have been interviewed, \nwith something like 12 major investigations. We have had 40 closed \nhearings, I think he said, 30 open hearings, and 16,000 pages of \ndocuments have been obtained.\n  As I thought was going to happen, those kinds of numbers were going \nto be utilized. The problem is, they are not particularly relevant to \nthe point which this commission amendment seeks to address, which is \nthere are huge gaps in these investigations. There could be 20 hearings \nor 50 hearings or 100 hearings, but these investigations have not \ngotten to 5 major points, such as, What is the role of the intelligence \ncommunity?\n  The people who have done the investigating have said they have not \ngotten to that point, they have not reached that issue. The CIA has not \ncooperated with them. So we have that huge gap in the investigations \nthat have taken place so far. Are there secret prisons around the world \nbeing maintained? What about the ghost detainees? There is not a week \nthat goes by that we are not reading about an issue that relates to the \nintelligence community, particularly the CIA's role in terms of \ninterrogating detainees. Yet that is an almost complete blank slate.\n  All of those investigations which have been made, which the Senator \nfrom Virginia referred to, have said: Well, we have not gotten into \nthat issue. We were not allowed to get into that issue.\n  Another major area is the U.S. Government policy on rendition. We \nhave not had any investigation on that.\n  Another major area is the role of contractors. We have not had any \ninvestigation on that.\n  Another major area is the legality of the interrogation techniques, \nparticularly the two major documents setting forth the techniques which \nwere going to be used, the so-called second Bybee memo and the memo \nfrom Mr. Yoo to the Department of Defense general counsel, Mr. Haynes. \nWe have not gotten there. So there has been no investigation of the \nlegality of the interrogation techniques permitted by the Office of \nLegal Counsel's memos to which I have just referred. And there are a \nnumber of outstanding document requests which have been flatout denied \nrelative to what happened at Guantanamo.\n  Now, it does not make any difference how many hearings have been \nheld--as long as you have those gaps which are greater than the amount \ncovered, you have not had a thorough investigation, or anything close, \nof detainee abuses and these so-called secret prisons around the world \nwhich are allegedly\n\n[[Page S12433]]\n\nmaintained. That is the point. That is why you need an independent \ncommission. You cannot sweep this under the rug. It is going to pop up \nagain. There is going to be another captain who is going to show up--\nand my friend from Virginia met with this captain. This is a letter to \nSenator McCain from Captain Fishback, who is in a parachute infantry \nregiment in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, talking about the \nway intelligence personnel were used to give directions to soften up \ndetainees. But we have had no investigation of intelligence.\n  So you have an honorable member of the U.S. military, CPT Ian \nFishback. I had a personal conversation with this captain where he \ndescribed to me what I just said, that there were directions from the \nintelligence community to soften up detainees. He says:\n\n       Instead of resolving my concerns, the approach for \n     clarification process leaves me deeply troubled.\n\n  This is a letter to Senator McCain. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2005]\n\n                           A Matter of Honor\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am a graduate of West Point \n     currently serving as a Captain in the U.S. Army Infantry. I \n     have served two combat tours with the 82nd Airborne Division, \n     one each in Afghanistan and Iraq. While I served in the \n     Global War on Terror, the actions and statements of my \n     leadership led me to believe that United States policy did \n     not require application of the Geneva Conventions in \n     Afghanistan or Iraq. On 7 May 2004, Secretary of Defense \n     Rumsfeld's testimony that the United States followed the \n     Geneva Conventions in Iraq and the ``spirit'' of the Geneva \n     Conventions in Afghanistan prompted me to begin an approach \n     for clarification. For 17 months, I tried to determine what \n     specific standards governed the treatment of detainees by \n     consulting my chain of command through battalion commander, \n     multiple JAG lawyers, multiple Democrat and Republican \n     Congressmen and their aides, the Ft. Bragg Inspector \n     General's office, multiple government reports, the Secretary \n     of the Army and multiple general officers, a professional \n     interrogator at Guantanamo Bay, the deputy head of the \n     department at West Point responsible for teaching Just War \n     Theory and Law of Land Warfare, and numerous peers who I \n     regard as honorable and intelligent men.\n       Instead of resolving my concerns, the approach for \n     clarification process leaves me deeply troubled. Despite my \n     efforts, I have been unable to get clear, consistent answers \n     from my leadership about what constitutes lawful and humane \n     treatment of detainees. I am certain that this confusion \n     contributed to a wide range of abuses including death \n     threats, beatings, broken bones, murder, exposure to \n     elements, extreme forced physical exertion, hostage-taking, \n     stripping, sleep deprivation and degrading treatment. I and \n     troops under my command witnessed some of these abuses in \n     both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       This is a tragedy. I can remember, as a cadet at West \n     Point, resolving to ensure that my men would never commit a \n     dishonorable act; that I would protect them from that type of \n     burden. It absolutely breaks my heart that I have failed some \n     of them in this regard.\n       That is in the past and there is nothing we can do about it \n     now. But, we can learn from our mistakes and ensure that this \n     does not happen again. Take a major step in that direction; \n     eliminate the confusion. My approach for clarification \n     provides clear evidence that confusion over standards was a \n     major contributor to the prisoner abuse. We owe our soldiers \n     better than this. Give them a clear standard that is in \n     accordance with the bedrock principles of our Nation.\n       Some do not see the need for this work. Some argue that \n     since our actions are not as horrifying as Al Qaeda's, we \n     should not be concerned. When did Al Qaeda become any type of \n     standard by which we measure the morality of the United \n     States? We are America, and our actions should be held to a \n     higher standard, the ideals expressed in documents such as \n     the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n       Others argue that clear standards will limit the \n     President's ability to wage the War on Terror. Since clear \n     standards only limit interrogation techniques, it is \n     reasonable for me to assume that supporters of this argument \n     desire to use coercion to acquire information from detainees. \n     This is morally inconsistent with the Constitution and \n     justice in war. It is unacceptable.\n       Both of these arguments stem from the larger question, the \n     most important question that this generation will answer. Do \n     we sacrifice our ideals in order to preserve security? \n     Terrorism inspires fear and suppresses ideals like freedom \n     and individual rights. Overcoming the fear posed by terrorist \n     threats is a tremendous test of our courage. Will we confront \n     danger and adversity in order to preserve our ideals, or will \n     our courage and commitment to individual rights wither at the \n     prospect of sacrifice? My response is simple. If we abandon \n     our ideals in the face of adversity and aggression, then \n     those ideals were never really in our possession. I would \n     rather die fighting than give up even the smallest part of \n     the idea that is ``America.''\n       Once again, I strongly urge you to do justice to your men \n     and women in uniform. Give them clear standards of conduct \n     that reflect the ideals they risk their lives for.\n           With the Utmost Respect,\n     Capt. Ian Fishback,\n       1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd \n     Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. He sets forth what has happened here in terms of abuses \nand how it hurts our military. It hurts him. It is not just hurting our \nhonor, it makes their lives more dangerous in case they are ever \ncaptured. And he ends by saying:\n\n       If we abandon our ideals in the face of adversity and \n     aggression, then those ideals were never really in our \n     possession. I would rather die fighting than give up even the \n     smallest part of the idea that is ``America.''\n\n  Now, that is a member of the U.S. military.\n  We cannot sweep this under the rug. The investigations so far have \nswept critical issues under the rug. They are going to surface sooner \nor later. Better to have an independent commission take a look at them, \nget it away from any partisanship, and have a commission the way the 9/\n11 Commission was appointed, with five Democratic appointees, five \nRepublican appointees, and have the President appoint the chairman of \nthe commission.\n  But we owe it to the Captain Fishbacks of this world. We owe it to \nall the men and women who serve so honorably, which is 99 percent, \nprobably 99.9 percent, of our military. We owe it to them to protect \nthem. One way to protect them is to make sure we have a thorough \ninvestigation, without these major gaps, as to what went wrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Gaps in the DoD Detainee Abuse Reviews\n\n       The carefully-carved out mandates of the nearly a dozen \n     reviews have left significant gaps and critical issues \n     unexamined.\n       1.

It depends on \n     the cooperation of foreign intelligence services, and on \n     keeping even basic information about the system secret from \n     the public, foreign officials and nearly all members of \n     Congress charged with overseeing the CIA's covert actions.\n       The existence and locations of the facilities--referred to \n     as ``black sites'' in classified White House, CIA, Justice \n     Department and congressional documents--are known to only a \n     handful of officials in the United States and, usually, only \n     to the President and a few top intelligence officers in each \n     host country.\n       The CIA and the White House, citing national security \n     concerns and the value of the program, have dissuaded \n     Congress from demanding that the agency answer questions in \n     open testimony about the conditions under which captives are \n     held. Virtually nothing is known about who is kept in the \n     facilities, what interrogation methods are employed with \n     them, or how decisions are\n\n[[Page S12434]]\n\n     made about whether they should be detained or for how long.\n       While the Defense Department has produced volumes of public \n     reports and testimony about its detention practices and rules \n     after the abuse scandals at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and at \n     Guantanamo Bay, the CIA has not even acknowledged the \n     existence of its black sites. To do so, say officials \n     familiar with the program, could open the U.S. government to \n     legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and \n     increase the risk of political condemnation at home and \n     abroad.\n       But the revelations of widespread prisoner abuse in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq by the U.S. military--which operates \n     under published rules and transparent oversight of Congress--\n     have increased concern among lawmakers, foreign governments \n     and human rights groups about the opaque CIA system. Those \n     concerns escalated last month, when Vice President Cheney and \n     CIA Director Porter J. Goss asked Congress to exempt CIA \n     employees from legislation already endorsed by 90 Senators \n     that would bar cruel and degrading treatment of any prisoner \n     in U.S. custody.\n       Although the CIA will not acknowledge details of its \n     system, intelligence officials defend the agency's approach, \n     arguing that the successful defense of the country requires \n     that the agency be empowered to hold and interrogate \n     suspected terrorists for as long as necessary and without \n     restrictions imposed by the U.S. legal system or even by \n     the military tribunals established for prisoners held at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       The Washington Post is not publishing the names of the \n     Eastern European countries involved in the covert program, at \n     the request of senior U.S. officials. They argued that the \n     disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts in those \n     countries and elsewhere and could make them targets of \n     possible terrorist retaliation.\n       The secret detention system was conceived in the chaotic \n     and anxious first months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, \n     when the working assumption was that a second strike was \n     imminent.\n       Since then, the arrangement has been increasingly debated \n     within the CIA, where considerable concern lingers about the \n     legality, morality and practicality of holding even \n     unrepentant terrorists in such isolation and secrecy, perhaps \n     for the duration of their lives. Mid-level and senior CIA \n     officers began arguing two years ago that the system was \n     unsustainable and diverted the agency from its unique \n     espionage mission.\n       ``We never sat down, as far as I know, and came up with a \n     grand strategy,'' said one former senior intelligence officer \n     who is familiar with the program but not the location of the \n     prisons. ``Everything was very reactive. That's how you get \n     to a situation where you pick people up, send them into a \n     netherworld and don't say, `What are we going to do with them \n     afterwards?' ''\n       It is illegal for the government to hold prisoners in such \n     isolation in secret prisons in the United States, which is \n     why the CIA placed them overseas, according to several former \n     and current intelligence officials and other U.S. government \n     officials. Legal experts and intelligence officials said that \n     the CIA's internment practices also would be considered \n     illegal under the laws of several host countries, where \n     detainees have rights to have a lawyer or to mount a defense \n     against allegations of wrongdoing.\n       Host countries have signed the U.N. Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, as has the United States. Yet CIA interrogators \n     in the overseas sites are permitted to use the CIA's approved \n     ``Enhanced Interrogation Techniques,'' some of which are \n     prohibited by the U.N. convention and by U.S. military law. \n     They include tactics such as ``waterboarding,'' in which a \n     prisoner is made to believe he or she is drowning.\n       Some detainees apprehended by the CIA and transferred to \n     foreign intelligence agencies have alleged after their \n     release that they were tortured, although it is unclear \n     whether CIA personnel played a role in the alleged abuse. \n     Given the secrecy surrounding CIA detentions, such \n     accusations have heightened concerns among foreign \n     governments and human rights groups about CIA detention and \n     interrogation practices.\n       The contours of the CIA's detention program have emerged in \n     bits and pieces over the past two years. Parliaments in \n     Canada, Italy, France, Sweden and the Netherlands have opened \n     inquiries into alleged CIA operations that secretly captured \n     their citizens or legal residents and transferred them to the \n     agency's prisons.\n       More than 100 suspected terrorists have been sent by the \n     CIA into the covert system, according to current and former \n     U.S. intelligence officials and foreign sources. This figure, \n     a rough estimate based on information from sources who said \n     their knowledge of the numbers was incomplete, does not \n     include prisoners picked up in Iraq.\n       The detainees break down roughly into two classes, the \n     sources said.\n       About 30 are considered major terrorism suspects and have \n     been held under the highest level of secrecy at black sites \n     financed by the CIA and managed by agency personnel, \n     including those in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, according to \n     current and former intelligence officers and two other U.S. \n     government officials. Two locations in this category--in \n     Thailand and on the grounds of the military prison at \n     Guantanamo Bay--were closed in 2003 and 2004, respectively.\n       A second tier--which these sources believe includes more \n     than 70 detainees--is a group considered less important, with \n     less direct involvement in terrorism and having limited \n     intelligence value. These prisoners, some of whom were \n     originally taken to black sites, are delivered to \n     intelligence services in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Afghanistan \n     and other countries, a process sometimes known as \n     ``rendition.'' While the first-tier black sites are run by \n     CIA officers, the jails in these countries are operated by \n     the host nations, with CIA financial assistance and, \n     sometimes, direction.\n       Morocco, Egypt and Jordan have said that they do not \n     torture detainees, although years of State Department human \n     rights reports accuse all three of chronic prisoner abuse.\n       The top 30 al Qaeda prisoners exist in complete isolation \n     from the outside world. Kept in dark, sometimes underground \n     cells, they have no recognized legal rights, and no one \n     outside the CIA is allowed to talk with or even see them, or \n     to otherwise verify their well-being, said current and former \n     and U.S. and foreign government and intelligence officials.\n       Most of the facilities were built and are maintained with \n     congressionally appropriated funds, but the White House has \n     refused to allow the CIA to brief anyone except the House and \n     Senate intelligence committees' chairmen and vice chairmen on \n     the program's generalities.\n       The Eastern European countries that the CIA has persuaded \n     to hide al Qaeda captives are democracies that have embraced \n     the rule of law and individual rights after decades of Soviet \n     domination. Each has been trying to cleanse its intelligence \n     services of operatives who have worked on behalf of others--\n     mainly Russia and organized crime.\n\n\n                       origins of the black sites\n\n       The idea of holding terrorists outside the U.S. legal \n     system was not under consideration before Sept. 11, 2001, not \n     even for Osama bin Laden, according to former government \n     officials. The plan was to bring bin Laden and his top \n     associates into the U.S. justice system for trial or to send \n     them to foreign countries where they would be tried.\n       ``The issue of detaining and interrogating people was \n     never, ever discussed,'' said a former senior intelligence \n     officer who worked in the CIA's Counterterrorist Center, or \n     CTC, during that period. ``It was against the culture and \n     they believed information was best gleaned by other means.''\n       On the day of the attacks, the CIA already had a list of \n     what it called High-Value Targets from the al Qaeda \n     structure, and as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attack \n     plots were unraveled, more names were added to the list. The \n     question of what to do with these people surfaced quickly.\n       The CTC's chief of operations argued for creating hit teams \n     of case officers and CIA paramilitaries that would covertly \n     infiltrate countries in the Middle East, Africa and even \n     Europe to assassinate people on the list, one by one.\n       But many CIA officers believed that the al Qaeda leaders \n     would be worth keeping alive to interrogate about their \n     network and other plots. Some officers worried that the CIA \n     would not be very adept at assassination.\n       ``We'd probably shoot ourselves,'' another former senior \n     CIA official said.\n       The agency set up prisons under its covert action \n     authority. Under U.S. law, only the president can authorize a \n     covert action, by signing a document called a presidential \n     finding. Findings must not break U.S. law and are reviewed \n     and approved by CIA, Justice Department and White House legal \n     advisers.\n       Six days after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush signed \n     a sweeping finding that gave the CIA broad authorization to \n     disrupt terrorist activity, including permission to kill, \n     capture and detain members of al Qaeda anywhere in the world.\n       It could not be determined whether Bush approved a separate \n     finding for the black-sites program, but the consensus among \n     current and former intelligence and other government \n     officials interviewed for this article is that he did not \n     have to.\n       Rather, they believe that the CIA general counsel's office \n     acted within the parameters of the Sept. 17 finding. The \n     black-site program was approved by a small circle of White \n     House and Justice Department lawyers and officials, according \n     to several former and current U.S. government and \n     intelligence officials.\n\n\n                         Deals With 2 Countries\n\n       Among the first steps was to figure out where the CIA could \n     secretly hold the captives. One early idea was to keep them \n     on ships in international waters, but that was discarded for \n     security and logistics reasons.\n       CIA officers also searched for a setting like Alcatraz \n     Island. They considered the virtually unvisited islands in \n     Lake Kariba in Zambia, which were edged with craggy cliffs \n     and covered in woods. But poor sanitary conditions could \n     easily lead to fatal diseases, they decided, and besides, \n     they wondered, could the Zambians be trusted with such a \n     secret?\n       Still without a long-term solution, the CIA began sending \n     suspects it captured in the first month or so after Sept. 11 \n     to its longtime partners, the intelligence services of Egypt \n     and Jordan.\n       A month later, the CIA found itself with hundreds of \n     prisoners who were captured on battlefields in Afghanistan. A \n     short-term solution was improvised. The agency shoved its \n     highest-value prisoners into metal shipping containers set up \n     on a corner of the Bagram\n\n[[Page S12435]]\n\n     Air Base, which was surrounded with a triple perimeter of \n     concertina-wire fencing. Most prisoners were left in the \n     hands of the Northern Alliance, U.S.-supported opposition \n     forces who were fighting the Taliban.\n       ``I remember asking: What are we going to do with these \n     people?'' said a senior CIA officer. ``I kept saying, where's \n     the help? We've got to bring in some help. We can't be \n     jailers--our job is to find Osama.''\n       Then came grisly reports, in the winter of 2001, that \n     prisoners kept by allied Afghan generals in cargo containers \n     had died of asphyxiation. The CIA asked Congress for, and was \n     quickly granted, tens of millions of dollars to establish a \n     larger, long-term system in Afghanistan, parts of which would \n     be used for CIA prisoners.\n       The largest CIA prison in Afghanistan was code-named the \n     Salt Pit. It was also the CIA's substation and was first \n     housed in an old brick factory outside Kabul. In November \n     2002, an inexperienced CIA case officer allegedly ordered \n     guards to strip naked an uncooperative young detainee, chain \n     him to the concrete floor and leave him there overnight \n     without blankets. He froze to death, according to four U.S. \n     government officials. The CIA officer has not been charged in \n     the death.\n       The Salt Pit was protected by surveillance cameras and \n     tough Afghan guards, but the road leading to it was not safe \n     to travel and the jail was eventually moved inside Bagram Air \n     Base. It has since been relocated off the base.\n       By mid-2002, the CIA had worked out secret black-site deals \n     with two countries, including Thailand and one Eastern \n     European nation, current and former officials said. An \n     estimated $100 million was tucked inside the classified annex \n     of the first supplemental Afghanistan appropriation.\n       Then the CIA captured its first big detainee in March 28, \n     2002. Pakistani forces took Abu Zubaida, al Qaeda's \n     operations chief, into custody and the CIA whisked him to the \n     new black site in Thailand, which included underground \n     interrogation cells, said several former and current \n     intelligence officials. Six months later, Sept. 11 planner \n     Ramzi Binalshibh was also captured in Pakistan and flown to \n     Thailand.\n       But after published reports revealed the existence of the \n     site in June 2003, Thai officials insisted the CIA shut it \n     down, and the two terrorists were moved elsewhere, according \n     to former government officials involved in the matter. Work \n     between the two countries on counterterrorism has been \n     lukewarm ever since.\n       In late 2002 or early 2003, the CIA brokered deals with \n     other countries to establish black-site prisons. One of these \n     sites--which sources said they believed to be the CIA's \n     biggest facility now--became particularly important when the \n     agency realized it would have a growing number of prisoners \n     and a shrinking number of prisons.\n       Thailand was closed, and sometime in 2004 the CIA decided \n     it had to give up its small site at Guantanamo Bay. The CIA \n     had planned to convert that into a state-of-the-art facility, \n     operated independently of the military. The CIA pulled out \n     when U.S. courts began to exercise greater control over the \n     military detainees, and agency officials feared judges would \n     soon extend the same type of supervision over their \n     detainees.\n       In hindsight, say some former and current intelligence \n     officials, the CIA's problems were exacerbated by another \n     decision made within the Counterterrorist Center at Langley.\n       The CIA program's original scope was to hide and \n     interrogate the two dozen or so al Qaeda leaders believed to \n     be directly responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, or who \n     posed an imminent threat, or had knowledge of the larger al \n     Qaeda network. But as the volume of leads pouring into the \n     CTC from abroad increased, and the capacity of its \n     paramilitary group to seize suspects grew, the CIA began \n     apprehending more people whose intelligence value and links \n     to terrorism were less certain, according to four current and \n     former officials.\n       The original standard for consigning suspects to the \n     invisible universe was lowered or ignored, they said. \n     ``They've got many, many more who don't reach any \n     threshold,'' one intelligence official said.\n       Several former and current intelligence officials, as well \n     as several other U.S. government officials with knowledge of \n     the program, express frustration that the White House and the \n     leaders of the intelligence community have not made it a \n     priority to decide whether the secret interment program \n     should continue in its current form, or be replaced by some \n     other approach.\n       Meanwhile, the debate over the wisdom of the program \n     continues among CIA officers, some of whom also argue that \n     the secrecy surrounding the program is not sustainable.\n       ``It's just a horrible burden,'' said the intelligence \n     officials.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                     ACCOUNTABILITY OF SENIOR-LEVEL OFFICERS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Name                              Investigative findings                Accountability\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall......................................

Mr. President, I yield the floor. I believe the Senator \nfrom Iowa is ready, in case the Senator from Virginia is ready to have \nhis amendment offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I want to clarify one thing. The \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, as the ranking member of our \ncommittee, participated in all of the hearings of the Armed Services \nCommittee. There were many hearings on the issue of the detainees, Abu \nGhraib. Then we went through the series of analyses by the Army \ninspector general. And on and on we went.\n  I do hope when he made a reference to sweeping things under the rug--\nI do not think our committee ever tried to sweep anything under the \nrug.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia. What our committee \nhas done is held some hearings. They are important hearings. They are \nvaluable hearings. They have not covered five critical areas. Those \nareas have to be brought to the surface. As to those areas, I am not \nsaying the chairman or our committee has swept them under the rug. We \nhave allowed those issues to be unaddressed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, when you use the \nterm ``we,'' let's be more specific. You mean the Congress in its \nvarious oversight capacities? Maybe the Intelligence Committee, which \nbasically has primary jurisdiction over intelligence issues, like you \npoint out the intelligence aspects of this? The Foreign Relations \nCommittee has held hearings on this issue. Indeed, the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee has held some hearings. So I judge that the \n``we'' you refer to is the broad responsibilities of the several \ncommittees in the Congress?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend for that clarification. The ``we'' \napplies to the Congress. We, the Congress, have oversight \nresponsibility. We have not carried it out. There are at least five \nmajor areas where we have failed to carry it out. We have to address \nthose\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\nareas. We have been unable to do so. I see no evidence that we will. \nTherefore, the only way we can do this is with an outside, independent, \n9/11-type panel.\n  But I was not in any way suggesting that any one committee has been \nthe source of this failure. It is all of the Congress together, which, \nobviously, is in the control of the Republican majority. That is a \nfact. But, nonetheless, we as a Congress have not carried out the \noversight responsibility which our troops deserve.\n  I hope I have assured my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to make certain.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I did not mean in any way to impugn--\n  Mr. WARNER. In our committee, you have sat side by side through \nalmost every minute of the many hours of hearings we have had on this \nsubject. While there may be areas which our committee may yet probe on \nthis matter--as a matter of fact, I do not think the whole series of \nhearings we have had has come to a conclusion. We still have the issue \nof the overall accountability. So there may be some point in time--but \nI have always felt we should allow more of the court-martial and \nvarious Uniform Code of Military Justice prosecutions, which are \nunderway, to be completed. I will be discussing that further with the \nSenator. But I just did not want it indicated that our committee had \nbrushed anything under the table.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend again. I would say of all the committees \nI know of, our committee, the Armed Services Committee, have carried \nout their responsibilities better than other committees. I wish to give \ncredit where credit is due--to our chairman. I do not know of any more \nhonorable, decent, hard-working, fair person in this body or any body \nin which I have ever served.\n  We have still, overall, as a Congress, failed in five major areas to \nlook at the way in which detainees have been handled. That failure is \ngoing to come back to haunt our troops, and it is haunting our Nation \nright now. But I surely did not mean in any way to single out our \ncommittee as being the source of that failure. But we are part of a \nlarger failure in terms of the whole Congress failing to carry out its \noversight responsibility.\n  Now, Mr. President, I wonder if my friend would accept a unanimous \nconsent request that the time we have just taken on this subject be in \nmorning business rather than deducted from the time on this amendment, \ngiven the interest in it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from \nIowa has taken the floor on a matter relating to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5 \nminutes provided to Senator Salazar prior to the vote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside, and I call up an amendment I have pending at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: Relating to the American Forces Network)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 903. AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Mission.--The American Forces Network (AFN) shall \n     provide members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of \n     the Department of Defense, and their families stationed \n     outside the continental United States and at sea with the \n     same type and quality of American radio and television news, \n     information, sports, and entertainment as is available in the \n     continental United States.\n       (b) Political Programming.--\n       (1) Fairness and balance.--All political programming of the \n     American Forces Network shall be characterized by its \n     fairness and balance.\n       (2) Free flow of programming.--The American Forces Network \n     shall provide in its programming a free flow of political \n     programming from United States commercial and public radio \n     and television stations.\n       (c) Ombudsman of the American Forces Network.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is hereby established the Office \n     of the Ombudsman of the American Forces Network.\n       (2) Head of office.--\n       (A) Ombudsman.--The head of the Office of the Ombudsman of \n     the American Forces Network shall be the Ombudsman of the \n     American Forces Network (in this subsection referred to as \n     the ``Ombudsman''), who shall be appointed by the Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       (B) Qualifications.--Any individual nominated for \n     appointment to the position of Ombudsman shall have \n     recognized expertise in the field of mass communications, \n     print media, or broadcast media.\n       (C) Part-time status.--The position of Ombudsman shall be a \n     part-time position.\n       (D) Term.--The term of office of the Ombudsman shall be \n     five years.\n       (E) Removal.--The Ombudsman may be removed from office by \n     the Secretary only for malfeasance.\n       (3) Duties.--\n       (A) In general.--The Ombudsman shall ensure that the \n     American Forces Network adheres to the standards and \n     practices of the Network in its programming.\n       (B) Particular duties.--In carrying out the duties of the \n     Ombudsman under this paragraph, the Ombudsman shall--\n       (i) initiate and conduct, with such frequency as the \n     Ombudsman considers appropriate, reviews of the integrity, \n     fairness, and balance of the programming of the American \n     Forces Network;\n       (ii) initiate and conduct, upon the request of Congress or \n     members of the audience of the American Forces Network, \n     reviews of the programming of the Network;\n       (iii) identify, pursuant to reviews under clause (i) or \n     (ii) or otherwise, circumstances in which the American Forces \n     Network has not adhered to the standards and practices of the \n     Network in its programming, including circumstances in which \n     the programming of the Network lacked integrity, fairness, or \n     balance; and\n       (iv) make recommendations to the American Forces Network on \n     means of correcting the lack of adherence identified pursuant \n     to clause (iii).\n       (C) Limitation.--In carrying out the duties of the \n     Ombudsman under this paragraph, the Ombudsman may not engage \n     in any pre-broadcast censorship or pre-broadcast review of \n     the programming of the American Forces Network.\n       (4) Resources.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide the \n     Office of the Ombudsman of the American Forces Network such \n     personnel and other resources as the Secretary and the \n     Ombudsman jointly determine appropriate to permit the \n     Ombudsman to carry out the duties of the Ombudsman under \n     paragraph (3).\n       (5) Independence.--The Secretary shall take appropriate \n     actions to ensure the complete independence of the Ombudsman \n     and the Office of the Ombudsman of the American Forces \n     Network within the Department of Defense.\n       (6) Annual reports.--\n       (A) In general.--The Ombudsman shall submit to the \n     Secretary of Defense and the congressional defense committees \n     each year a report on the activities of the Office of the \n     Ombudsman of the American Forces Network during the preceding \n     year.\n       (B) Availability to public.--The Ombudsman shall make \n     available to the public each report submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) through the Internet website of the Office \n     of the Ombudsman of the American Forces Network and by such \n     other means as the Ombudsman considers appropriate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify this Senator \nwhen I have spoken for 15 minutes.\n  This amendment, offered by me, Senator Dorgan, and a number of \nothers, addresses the problem of the extreme imbalance of political \nprogramming on American Forces Radio. As my colleagues know, for \nAmerican servicemembers and their families stationed in more than 177 \ncountries and territories around the world, as well as for Department \nof Defense civilians and their families, American Forces Radio is \nintended to broadcast a ``touch of home'' programming that reflects a \ncross section of what is widely available to stateside audiences. \nMaking U.S. entertainment and news programming available to American \nservicemembers wherever they are located is important for their morale \nand to keep them informed. But in order to accomplish this, American \nForces Radio needs to provide a wide variety of programming and views. \nUnfortunately, in recent years, it has failed to do so, in violation of \nits own guidelines.\n\n[[Page S12437]]\n\n  The amendment Senator Dorgan and I are offering is designed to \naddress this imbalance. The Department of Defense directive 5120.20R \nstates that: American Forces Radio and Television Services Broadcast \nCenter shall provide a free flow of political programming from U.S. \ncommercial and public networks. It shall maintain the same equal \nopportunities balance offered by these sources. Outlets should make \nextensive use of such programming.\n  That is what is in their directive. It also requires ``reasonable \nopportunities for the presentation of conflicting views on important \ncontroversial public issues.''\n  That is what we would expect. We would expect that our Armed Forces \npersonnel would have reasonable opportunities to hear the presentation \nof conflicting views on public issues. Yet in spite of these clear \nguidelines, the programming offered by American Forces Radio is \nanything but balanced. Instead, American Forces Radio carries the shows \nof noted conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlesinger, \nand James Dobson, to the near total exclusion of any progressive talk \nradio hosts.\n  On American Forces Radio's talk radio service, 85 percent of the \nshort commentary or talk radio programming with political content is \nconservative--Mark Merrill, James Dobson, Dr. Laura, and Rush Limbaugh. \nOnly 15 percent is progressive--Jim Hightower and Dave Ross. Here is \nwhat it comes down to in hours: More than 10 hours a week of \nconservative talk radio compared to less than 2 hours of progressive \ntalk radio and commentary.\n  Mind you, when I said ``offered,'' this is what is offered. The 33 \nAmerican Forces Radio outlets around the world are offered 85 percent, \nmore than 10 hours of conservative talk radio, and 15 percent, less \nthan 2 hours, of progressive talk radio. Now it gets worse. Again, what \nI mentioned is what is just offered to the American Forces stations. \nThe programming that is actually used by local stations is even more \nunbalanced. Of the 33 local stations around the globe, 177 countries \nand territories that our Armed Forces personnel listen to, 100 percent \nof what they actually get the chance to listen to is conservative talk \nradio, 100 percent; zero percent of progressive talk radio. Less than 2 \nhours of progressive talk radio is what is offered. What they actually \nget is nothing on the progressive side. But they get 100 percent of \nRush Limbaugh, 2,460 minutes a week; Dr. Laura, 1,245 minutes a week; \nand James Dobson, 60 minutes a week.\n  That is balanced? That is fair? That is not balanced. That is \nmonopoly. This is propagandizing our troops.\n  This is wrong. The amendment Senator Dorgan and I are offering, along \nwith Senators Obama, Dodd, Mikulski, Lautenberg, Kennedy, and Dayton \naddresses this imbalance in two simple ways. First, it will codify the \nAmerican Forces Network's obligation to provide political programming \nthat is fair and balanced. What I read before was just a DOD directive. \nIt has no force or effect of law. It says it should be balanced, should \nprovide equal opportunities. We need to make this law. That is what our \namendment does. It codifies the directive.\n  Secondly, it establishes an independent office of the ombudsman to \naddress imbalances, to report annually on whether American Forces Radio \nis satisfying its mandate to provide fair and balanced political \nprogramming.\n  What this amendment does not do is prescribe specific content or \nprogramming. That is not the role of the Senate. But I believe we do \nhave an obligation as Senators to all of our constituents to make the \nnetwork's talk radio programming representative of the diversity of \nopinion in America.\n  While I generally do not agree with Rush Limbaugh's commentaries--I \nam sure that comes as no surprise to anyone--I do not object to the \nfact that they are run on the American Forces Network. I have never \ncalled for American Forces Radio to pull the commentaries of Rush \nLimbaugh or any other conservatives from its talk radio service.\n  On last year's defense authorization bill, we offered an amendment \nthat simply asked that DOD develop appropriate methods of oversight to \nensure the network provided fair and balanced political programming. \nThis year, since they haven't done it, we want to codify it. But last \nyear when I pointed out the imbalance in programming--100 percent \nconservative talk radio, Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlesinger, James \nDobson; zero for progressives--Rush Limbaugh went ballistic on his \nradio show: Senator Harkin is now trying to take me off the air. He \nsaid I wanted to deny the troops the opportunity to hear him. He went \non and on. I had other reporters and press people ask me about it.\n  I said: Typical of Rush Limbaugh. He doesn't understand what is \nhappening. He wouldn't know the truth if it hit him in the face. I \nsaid: All I'm asking for is balance on taxpayer-funded radio. What Rush \nLimbaugh wants is monopoly. To him, to have someone oppose him and get \nequal time might be the same as, in his mind, taking him off the air. \nThat is probably the way he thinks.\n\n  But I have never called for taking him off the air. I just think \nthere ought to be some opposing views, representative of the diversity \nof opinion in America. I take issue with the fact that there is no \ncommentary broadcast on this network that would even begin to balance \nthe extreme views that Rush Limbaugh routinely expresses on his \nprogram. And where there is no alternative viewpoint, where there is no \nbalance, what you are left with is one-sided propaganda. And that is \nnot what we want on American Forces Radio. The men and women of our \nArmed Forces deserve and expect balance, not thinly disguised \npropaganda.\n  What I object to is that Rush Limbaugh is on all week, and our troops \nget to hear him, but they don't get to hear any viewpoints from the \nother side of the political spectrum.\n  Let's talk about one specific case in point, the scandal at Abu \nGhraib. We all know what happened there. I don't need to remind anybody \nof the pictures, the torture, the shame and disgrace it brought upon \nour country. We know what happened just a couple weeks ago with the \nMcCain amendment: 90 to 9, we voted to insist that our Armed Forces and \nothers follow the Army Field Manual on Interrogations; that we will not \ncondone torture, we will not condone the type of thing that we saw at \nAbu Ghraib. Ninety to nine on the Senate floor.\n  Here is what Rush Limbaugh had to say about Abu Ghraib: He called \nit--these are his words, not mine--``a fraternity prank.'' He likened \nit to a fraternity prank. He dubbed the humiliation of inmates ``a \nbrilliant maneuver, no different than what happens at the skull and \nbones initiation at Yale.'' This is Rush Limbaugh talking about Abu \nGhraib. He described the images of torture as ``pictures of homoerotism \nthat looked like standard, good-old American pornography.'' That is \nRush Limbaugh talking to our troops 100 percent of the time. He said of \nthe pictures at Abu Ghraib--this is a quote from Rush Limbaugh--``if \nyou take these pictures and bring them back and have them taken in an \nAmerican city and put on an American Web site, they might win a video \naward from the pornography industry.''\n  I ask, does this represent the views and attitudes of the average \nAmerican citizen? It may represent a few, but I think the vote in the \nSenate more accurately reflects the views of the American citizens. \nNinety Senators, Republicans and Democrats, conservatives, liberals, \nand everybody in between, basically said on the McCain amendment, no, \nwe don't want to have what happened at Abu Ghraib ever happen again. We \ndon't want to be engaged in torturing prisoners or detainees.\n  Now, it is in the newspapers that even Vice President Cheney is \nfighting the McCain amendment. Maybe Vice President Cheney and Rush \nLimbaugh feel that way, but I don't think too many other Americans do. \nThat is why we had a 90-to-9 vote here. Yet what do our Armed Forces \npersonnel and DoD civilians hear when they tune in the radio from their \nassignments around the world? They hear Rush Limbaugh telling them it \nis a prank, a brilliant maneuver, good-old American pornography. That \nis what they are hearing.\n  So what are our troops to think? Are they to think, that is Rush \nLimbaugh and that is what we hear so, therefore, that must represent \nwhat the American people back home feel about this? Maybe it wasn't so \nbad after all.\n  That is why we need some opposing views on American Forces Radio. Our \ntroops need to hear the other side of\n\n[[Page S12438]]\n\nthe story to get a balance. I have never said take Rush Limbaugh off. \nBut the network does need someone to give the other side of the story.\n  Again, that is what this amendment does. It codifies it. Again, 16 \nmonths ago, the Senate adopted a sense-of-the-Senate amendment I \noffered calling on the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the policies \nof fairness and balance of American Forces Radio were being fully \nimplemented and to develop appropriate methods of oversight to ensure \nthey were followed. That was last year.\n  Sixteen months later, the Department of Defense has made no progress \nin balancing out the more than 62 hours a week of conservative \nprogramming broadcast on the 33 American Forces Radio stations, \ncompared to zero of progressive, 16 months later, after this Senate \nadopted a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying it ought to be fair and \nbalanced.\n  On October 19, just a few weeks ago, I and 12 of my colleagues sent a \nletter to Secretary Rumsfeld expressing our concern, once again, with \nthe utter failure to address the lack of political balance.\n  Sixteen months later, no progress. As I said, we wrote this letter to \nthe Secretary of Defense on October 19. On Thursday of last week, we \nreceived a letter from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public \nAffairs, Mr. Lawrence Di Rita. It says:\n\n       The network plans to offer the show of one progressive talk \n     radio host Ed Schultz.\n\n  The letter makes absolutely no representations as to how soon or when \nit plans to offer Mr. Schultz's show on the network.\n  ``Offer,'' it said ``offer.'' They didn't say they would ensure the \nbroadcast. They said they are going to offer it.\n  As I pointed out earlier, they offer 15 percent per week of \nprogressive talk radio, less than 2 hours, and guess what. None of the \nAFR stations carry that paltry amount. Not one of their stations out of \n33 around the world, even bothers to broadcast any portion of those two \nhours.\n  Let me note that in response to a letter Senator Dorgan and I sent to \nthe Department earlier this year, Deputy Assistant Secretary Allison \nBarber replied that DoD ``recognizes that the domestic political talk \nmarket has grown more diverse and that the time has come to consider \nexpanding the AFN choices.''\n  I respectfully disagree with Deputy Assistant Secretary Barber. It is \nnot that the time has come to consider expanding the choices. We are \nlong past the time for that. The time has come for the DoD to act on \nexpanding and broadening the political discourse on American Forces \nRadio. There is no reason our servicemembers should receive 10 hours--\nmore than 10 hours--of rightwing conservative talk radio and absolutely \nzero hours, zero minutes, zero seconds of progressive talk radio. They \nneed competing views.\n  As I said, that was part of the mandate so our troops would have the \nability to get a wide variety of programming to keep them informed, a \ncross-section of what is widely available to stateside audiences. That \nis what they should have.\n  I suppose after my talk today old Limbaugh will come on the radio \nagain blasting me, saying Harkin wants to take him off the air, wants \nCongress to tell the radio networks what to carry. I can hear him now \ntalking about it. He got it wrong last year; there is no reason why he \nwould probably get it right this year--correct, I should say; he gets \neverything right but never gets it correct. Leave Limbaugh on there, \nbut give someone else equal time. I would like to see Ed Schultz have \nas much time as Rush Limbaugh. Why not? Ed Schultz is entertaining. He \nhas a viewpoint. It is more progressive, obviously, than Rush \nLimbaugh's, but there is no doubt he is doing well. In fact, I found \nthat in almost every market where Ed Schultz went up against Rush \nLimbaugh, more people listened to Ed Schultz than listened to Rush \nLimbaugh.\n  Oh, now maybe the scales are falling from my eyes. Maybe now I see \nwhy Rush Limbaugh doesn't want Ed Schultz on Armed Forces Radio. Our \nservicemen might tune him out and decide they would like to listen to \nEd Schultz more than they would listen to him.\n  Our amendment is needed because it codifies that fairness and balance \non taxpayer-funded radio is an obligation, and sets up an ombudsman to \nhelp ensure that goal. That is not unique. We have ombudsmen in other \nthings. We have ombudsmen for both of the other two major federally \nfunded broadcasting agencies. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nand the Broadcasting Board of Governors--that is the Voice of America--\nhave statutory language providing for diversity and balance in their \nprogramming and both the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and \nNational Public Radio have an ombudsman in place.\n  I fully intend, when the Secretary of Defense comes up for his \nappropriations hearing next year--I happen to be on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I happen to sit on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nand I intend to ask him these questions. Why do they think this is \nfair? Do they think this represents balance, a fair representation of \nthe diversity of American thought? Or do they feel it ought to be more \nbalanced, and if so, let's get on the stick.\n  I am saying to the Secretary of Defense, time for consideration is \npast. Move, move now. There is a lot of progressive talk radio in \nAmerica that gives an opposite view of Rush Limbaugh or Dr. Laura or \nJames Dobson. Get them on there. Let's even the pie. That is all we are \nasking for--fairness.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time under my regular \ntime of 15 minutes for other Senators to speak, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Virginia for his kindness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are going to take this amendment and \nstudy it. Senator Inhofe, who is quite interested in this subject, is \nunable to be here at this time, but tomorrow we will have further \nopportunity to debate it.\n  I am advised that the Department does not try to manage these \nprogramming agendas in such a way as to exclude, I am told, any \nparticular political bent or bias. Rather they go out and use \nnationally known and presumably credible organizations that establish \nratings and select programs which have very high ratings. In other \nwords, people want to listen to them.\n  That is the procedure, as I understand it, that is being followed by \nthe Department. I think Mr. Di Rita, who was trusted with this \nrecently, made a statement to the effect that is the process. I will \nread from at this juncture a letter to Senator Levin from Lawrence Di \nRita, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public \nAffairs. It says:\n\n       Thank you for your October 19th letter to Secretary \n     Rumsfeld concerning the radio programming distributed by the \n     Armed Forces Radio and Television Services on its American \n     Armed Forces Network.\n       The [Armed Forces Radio] attempts to make available to \n     forces stationed overseas a breadth of programming that \n     reflects the quality and diversity that would be available to \n     servicemembers and their families if they were in the United \n     States.\n       AFRTS provides 105,000 hours of programming choices per \n     year to programmers at 33 stations around the world.\n\n  I understand we have 33 stations geographically around the world so \nthat the beam can reach even the most remote of men and women in the \nArmed Forces. I am paraphrasing my own thoughts at this time. They are \nthe ones, the 33 stations, that make pretty much the decision as to \ntheir region and the consumer interest among the uniform people in \ncertain programs. So they provide 105,000 hours of programming at 33 \nstations around the world.\n\n       Programmers at individual stations choose from the . . . \n     mix of content they wish to air on their multiple broadcast \n     channels.\n\n  So there is a mix of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services \nprogramming, and then each of the 33 has a certain degree of autonomy. \nThey go into that list and pick those programs they think their \nlisteners will enjoy and utilize.\n\n       I am advised that the Armed Forces Radio and Television \n     Service managers are updating the programming mix and have \n     decided to include additional programs, including the Ed \n     Schultz Show, that apparently meet the criteria for that \n     [Armed Forces Radio and Television Service] managers apply to \n     such decisions.\n       As is the practice, these programs will be made available \n     to local [Armed Forces Radio and Television Service] \n     programmers. Local\n\n[[Page S12439]]\n\n     programmers decide which programs are broadcast. These \n     programmers typically are military or civil servants who have \n     the best insights into the interests and preferences of their \n     local audiences.\n       [Armed Forces Radio and Television Service] managers will \n     continue to monitor the programming mix and do their best to \n     provide a broad, high quality range of choices for local \n     station managers.\n\n  I think the Senator's points are well taken, but it appears that this \nsystem is working well at the moment. But I judge the Senator has views \nto the contrary. The Senator from Iowa can respond on my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, he is a \nvery thoughtful individual. I know he is fair and always has been fair. \nTo air commentary of the nature I discussed earlier--that which Mr. \nLimbaugh made about Abu Ghraib--with absolutely no counterbalance or \nrebuttal, sends entirely the wrong message to our troops.\n  Last year when we had the sense-of-the-Senate resolution--this was \nposted on CNN.com; they carried an article on it--Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense Allison Barber said:\n\n       It's not about conservative or liberal, it is about the \n     full selection of radio programming based on popularity----\n\n  Here in the States. That is ratings.\n\n       Still, Howard Stern has millions of fans, and his show is \n     not sent to the troops.\n\n  Barber explains:\n\n       His issue is one of content that is not appropriate.\n\n  They say it is popularity, but then they decide whether it is \nappropriate.\n  Are we to believe that the Abu Ghraib comments by Mr. Limbaugh are \nexcusable because of the high ratings his show receives? I partially \nagree with the Deputy Assistant Secretary's statement. It appears that \ncontent is sometimes a factor in deciding which commentaries to run on \nAmerican Forces Radio. At the same time, I also agree with the \ndirective DoD already has in place. There should be fairness and \nbalance in political programming on American Forces Radio. To use \ncommercial market share ratings as an excuse not to offer fair and \nbalanced programming will no longer suffice. When there are 33 stations \naround the globe, and they do not even carry 1 minute of an alternative \nto Rush Limbaugh, that has to say something. That it is not just \nratings. Something else is going on there.\n  One would think that at least they would carry the 15 percent that is \noffered. They do not even carry that, if the Senator knows what I mean. \nThe 33 stations around the world were offered 15 percent progressive \ntalk radio a week. They are offered it, but they do not carry any of \nit. So something is going on out there. I do not know what it is, but \nsomething is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly do not want the Senator to feel that we are \ntrying to control these stations in such a manner as to preclude \nmembers of the Armed Forces and their families from having an \nopportunity to hear opinions that differ. So in the course of the \nevening, I and others will look into this. We thank our friend from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Iowa yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 13 minutes 6 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought I had 14 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness. There is no one else on the floor, so I do not want to use up \nmy time. I ask unanimous consent for up to 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness so I may yield some time to whoever wants it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not object, but we do have a 5-minute \nrequest from the other side of the aisle, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague. We have the proponents of the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado and others. I ask unanimous consent that the proponents of the \namendment and those in opposition have at least 5 minutes each in \naddition to that. So that is 15. That would leave time for further \ndebate by others on this amendment. So I would say at the hour of 5:15 \nthat 5 minutes be allocated to Senator Salazar; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. To be followed by Senator Allard, to be followed by those \nof us who oppose the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request made by \nSenator Warner?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request by Senator Harkin \nthat he be allowed to speak as in morning business until 5:15?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. If anyone shows up to \ntalk on something else, I will obviously yield the floor. But I would \nyield to the distinguished minority ranking member of the committee \nwhatever time he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa. I support his \namendment. It simply would codify provisions in a directive. It puts \nsome force behind what is already supposed to be in regulation, which \nis that there be fair and balanced political programming for the Armed \nForces network radio broadcast. That is what the Harkin amendment does. \nIt does not do the allocation. It does not make a judgment. It simply \nsays we have to put some stronger teeth behind a regulation because we \nare talking about political programming. We have to be certain that \npolitical programming is fair and balanced. That is what the regulation \nstates it is supposed to be already and just simply codifying it means \nCongress believes that is essential, as well as in addition to that it \nestablishes an ombudsman to make sure the Armed Forces network adheres \nto its own programming standards and practices. I think that is a fair \nrequest, and I support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will just take a couple more minutes and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As long as there is no one else in the Chamber--if anyone \ncomes here, I would yield the floor to whoever would want it.\n  Let me go through again what this amendment does for Senators who may \nbe watching from their offices. The ombudsman would be appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense for a term of 5 years. They could not engage in \nany prebroadcast censorship. The ombudsman would conduct regular \nreviews of the integrity, balance, and fairness of American forces \nradio programming. It would respond to programming issues raised by \nAFR's audience regarding the network's programming and refer complaints \nto American forces radio management for response. The ombudsman would \nmake suggestions to American forces radio management regarding ways to \ncorrect imbalances, and the ombudsman would prepare and present an \nannual report to the Secretary of Defense and Congress on whether \nAmerican Forces Radio is satisfying its mandate to provide fair and \nbalanced political programming.\n  So that is what the ombudsman basically would do under our amendment, \nnot censor or anything like that. Basically, he would take complaints, \npass it on to management, issue a report to us every year on whether \nthe programming is fair and balanced, and any other comments and \ncriticisms that may come into the ombudsman's office. So that is \nbasically the amendment.\n  I have had my say on it. I think it is pretty clear. I thank the \nSenator from Michigan for his support. I hope all Senators could \nsupport this amendment. As the Senator from Michigan said, it just \ncodifies what is basically a directive right now. It just makes it more \nclear to DOD, from the Secretary of Defense on down, that we mean it \nwhen we say it has to be fair and balanced. We do not mean to take \nanyone off the air or shut anyone up, but we do mean to have it fair \nand balanced to represent the diversity of views of America.\n  Not all Americans agree with Rush Limbaugh. Not all Americans agree\n\n[[Page S12440]]\n\nwith Ed Schultz or Jim Hightower or me or anyone else, but we do have \ndiversity. That is what is so wonderful about our country. That is what \nwe are proud of as Americans, that we are able to speak our minds and \nhave our opinions heard and we do not have any censorship. Since we do \nnot have it here, we should not have it on the American Forces Radio \nnetwork, either.\n  I believe having served myself for a long time in the military, as I \nknow the Senator from Virginia has, too, our troops are well educated. \nThey are smarter today than they ever were even when I was in the \nmilitary. They know how to listen to one side or the other, and they \nshould have that opportunity. That is all we are asking for.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, the Senator from Alabama will speak to the \nAllard amendment, which is the subject of a vote in 20 minutes. I give \nhim 5 minutes, plus 2 or 3 other minutes. I thought he was right behind \nme.\n  The Allard amendment is rather a technical one. It requires our \ncolleagues to be informed on this amendment. I am opposed to it, but I \nwas asked to provide to the Senator from Alabama the time needed to \nspeak to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT No. 2423\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner. I chair the \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Armed Services Committee. This \nmatter is under our subcommittee's oversight area. I have great respect \nfor Senator Allard, who is proposing the amendment. He chaired the same \nsubcommittee. He is very much loyal to his workers in Colorado. He is \nvery much determined they get everything that he can get them, and I \nthink maybe a little more than they would be entitled to under a fair \nreading of the statute and the contract that is involved.\n  Therefore, with the greatest respect to Senator Allard and others who \nmay be supporting this amendment, I would oppose it. It reaches into a \nrelationship between the contractor employees who are performing the \ncleanup at Rocky Flats and their employer, who is a company called \nKaiser Hill. Kaiser Hill won the contract with the Department of Energy \nto perform cleanup work, and this deals with their relationship with \ntheir employees, not Government employees but employees for Kaiser \nHill. How would it amend those terms of that agreement between Kaiser \nHill and its private employees? The amendment directs the U.S. \nSecretary of Energy to instruct Kaiser Hill to grant retirement and \nhealth benefits to employees that those employees would have earned if \nthe cleanup had taken longer than it actually did. So that is why, of \ncourse, the Department of Energy opposes it.\n  They have looked at this very carefully. They have indicated they \nwould be open to some sort of discussion about what might be done. I \nhave also indicated that to those who support this amendment but have \nnot heard back from them.\n  So I believe the amendment as drafted is overreaching, and the \nDepartment of Energy objects to it. It is just not good policy for our \nGovernment. The cleanup did not take as long as some people projected, \nbut everyone knew the cleanup was going to be accelerated and would \nend. It was not a limitless timeframe. Rocky Flats is not there \nanymore. It has been cleaned up. There is empty space. The workers have \nall been disbursed and gone to other jobs.\n  I would just note that many Government contracts complete early or \nthey do not run as long as anticipated. So we cannot start down the \nroad of altering the benefits of contract workers when something \nhappens good for the Government because the matter proceeded along and \nwas able to be completed sooner than expected, although it was \naccelerated and everybody knew it was going to complete and complete \nsooner than many had projected.\n  One of the things that every employee has, and this is important to \nnote, every employee has been given a 1-year acceleration of the time \nand grade they get credit for, the time in service. The collective \nbargaining that went on as this contract moved forward, and everybody \nknew the contract would be completed early, they had a collective \nbargaining process, and they met with the steelworkers and others and \nthey agreed that they would take a $4,200 basic payment because they \nwere completing the work sooner, as an incentive or a thank-you for \ngood work done. That was done, and they received that.\n  So, again, this amendment would alter the freely entered-into \nagreement between these workers and Kaiser Hill concerning the early \ncompletion.\n  Now, most of the Kaiser Hill employees were covered under the \ncollective bargaining agreements which anticipated there would be \nstaggered layoffs as the completion of the cleanup neared. Union \nworkers negotiated substantial benefits such as lump-sum incentive \npayments in addition to providing for early and regular retirement \nbenefits and an extra year in service.\n\n  The Senate has recently conducted its debate on budget \nreconciliation. There has been a lot of debate and consideration about \nthe fiscal situation in which this country finds itself. There was a \ndebate about hard choices that we face as a Nation so we do not burden \nour children or grandchildren with financial obligations that, in \nretrospect, we cannot afford.\n  If we were a private company, I ask my colleagues, would we say we \ncould tell our stockholders that we paid more than we were supposed to \npay for a cleanup? I think we are concerned about this mainly because \nwe feel as governmental representatives, sometimes we ought to go \nfurther and do more. I know my colleague Senator Allard strongly \nbelieves we ought to do more and be generous.\n  I do join him in commending the workers at Rocky Flats for what has \nbeen achieved. The cleanup is done and workers have moved on to other \njobs and other employers. I cannot support, however, taking this \nunprecedented step--at least unprecedented to my knowledge--that is \nembodied in this amendment. It is contrary to good, sound fiscal \npolicy, good governmental policy. It is noble to want a job to be \nrecognized and people to be paid fairly for it. But military bases \nclose around the country all the time. Awards for contracts for \naircraft and ships get terminated. Sometimes they complete them sooner \nthan expected. People do not expect to be paid forever. Agreements were \nreached, as I said, to make sure people would be generously compensated \nas a result of this early closing.\n  I urge my colleagues, as difficult as they may find it, to vote \n``no'' on this amendment. I think it would be the right thing for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair advise the managers with regard to the \nremaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Allard, \ncontrols 5 minutes. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Salazar, has \nbeen granted 5 minutes under a unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Basically there is 2 minutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. My colleague from Alabama has basically stated the case. \nBut I must say this is a unique amendment among those I have \nencountered. You could induce laborers to have a slowdown at work so as \nnot to finish it and so attenuate this right or some other benefit, \nwhile at the same time they were taking inducements for expediting the \nwork.\n  I commend my good friend from Colorado. I know he fights hard for his \nconstituents. But were we to see this type of precedent distributed to \nother situations in Government contracting across America, we would be \nopening up a very interesting line of arguments by a number of \ncontractors and employees. So regrettably I have to oppose the \namendment of my good friend from Colorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will talk about my amendment for a \nmoment or two, but before I do, I have some cosponsors I would like to \nadd to the amendment: Senators Salazar, DeMint, Alexander, and \nCantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will take a little time to lay out the \nhistory of the cleanup of Rocky Flats after it was decided to close the \nfacility. It was a nuclear production facility that produced plutonium \ntriggers which were used for nuclear weaponry. When I first got \ninvolved in this issue, the plan called for 60 years to clean up Rocky \nFlats, costing somewhere around $35 billion.\n  In 1999, we were able to reach an agreement with the Department of \nEnergy and the contractor that for $7 billion, we could have it cleaned \nup in 6 years. So here we are in 2005 and we have cleaned up the \nfacility 14 months ahead of what anybody ever imagined.\n  When we first came up, everybody was snickering and saying that would \nnot happen. But we did a key thing; we put incentives in the contract \nwhich encouraged various members of the workforce, including the \ncontractors, to get the job done on time. In this case they got it done \nahead of time and ended up saving lots of money.\n  This means we are cleaned up 14 months ahead of time. That means \nprobably close to $500 to $600 million in savings because we are not \ngoing to have to pay for it next year. As a result of this early \ncleanup we are going to have about 70 workers out at Rocky Flats who \nare going to get cut short on their health insurance benefits and cut \nshort on their life insurance. It is very difficult to try to get \ninsurance after you have been working around a nuclear facility for 15, \n16, 17, or 18 years. Insurance companies don't like to insure them, and \nif you do get insurance, at least it is very expensive. It seems to me \nit is a matter of fairness to take care of these 70 workers.\n  The reason it is important to other cleanup sites around the country, \nand this is where I think the Department of Energy is shortsighted--if \nyou put in incentive contracts to get cleanup at these other sites \naround the country, getting them done on time or even early, as we did \nin Colorado, if you treat the workers fairly, I think the workforce at \nthose cleanup sites will be willing to step in and participate in the \nearly cleanup efforts.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to take care of the 70 or so workers \nwho got shortchanged because of early closure at Rocky Flats. But more \nimportantly, I want to see cleanup of these nuclear facilities all over \nthe country. There are a number of States that are going to be \nimpacted. A lot of us want to see these sites cleaned up for various \nreasons, not the least of which is to make sure we have environmental \ncleanup so we have a better environment in which to live here in the \nUnited States.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this particular amendment. I think \nit is very important. Let me take a couple of examples. Workers such as \nDoug Woodard and Leo Chavez now find themselves with either severely \nreduced benefits or no benefits at all. Doug started work at Rocky \nFlats all the way back in 1982 and then was responsible for monitoring \nradiation contamination at the site. He missed qualifying for the \nmedical benefits by less than 2 months.\n  For Leo Chavez, who worked at Rocky Flats for 17 years, DOE's \ntreatment was even worse. The Department of Energy thanked him for his \nservice and showed him to the door 6 working days before he qualified \nfor lifetime medical benefits. Let me repeat that. That was 6 days \nbefore he qualified for medical benefits. Yet his workers, then other \nworkers at the plant, walked away with those benefits. It seems to me \nit is a matter of fairness.\n\n  The Department of Energy has made the point they do not want to set \nany precedent. In this particular amendment, we have narrowed it down \nto the time length and when they qualify. We have narrowed it down to \nthese workers at Rocky Flats.\n  I believe this is an important amendment if you want to see rapid \ncleanup occur at these nuclear sites because the workers have to buy \ninto the program. If they do not buy into the program, then you are not \ngoing to have early cleanup.\n  I understand my colleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, might be \ndown to the floor. I want to take this opportunity, before my time runs \nout, to thank him for his work and effort. I thank Senator Cantwell and \nother Members of the Senate who have agreed to cosponsor this amendment \nbecause they have situations in their States similar to ours in \nColorado.\n  We all look forward to getting early cleanup, and hopefully the \ncleanup at Rocky Flats will set an example for the rest of the country. \nThe faster we have cleanup, the less money the American taxpayers will \nhave to pay. That is the bottom line. We are required to get this \ncleanup done. If we can do it and save taxpayer dollars, we need to do \nthat. In this case, from the original plan it saves billions upon \nbillions of dollars. Then we modified the plan, and it is well over \n$500 million we are going to save. We need to encourage this to happen \nthroughout the country. I am proud of the workers at Rocky Flats. It \nwouldn't have happened without their dedication and effort. We need to \nmake sure every worker at Rocky Flats will walk away from this cleanup \nbeing proud and feeling they were treated fairly.\n  I urge my colleagues, again, to join us in righting a wrong that I \nthink has been perpetrated by the Department of Energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, may I be recognized for an additional \ncosponsor, and that is Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the junior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, in a few minutes my colleagues here in \nthe Senate will be voting on an amendment sponsored by Senator Wayne \nAllard and myself, amendment No. 2423. I am here to speak for a few \nminutes to urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  This is an important amendment that recognizes the great work the \nemployees at Rocky Flats have been doing on behalf of our Nation for a \nlong time. When Rocky Flats was first proposed to be cleaned up, as the \nplace where plutonium triggers were being manufactured for the United \nStates of America and for national security, it was contemplated that \nwe were undertaking a project that would take many years. Some had \nsuggested it would take as long as 60 years to clean up Rocky Flats at \na cost of $35 billion. Yet when all was said and done, because of the \ngreat work of both Democratic and Republican administrations, and these \ndedicated workers, we were able to accomplish the task in just over 5 \nyears as opposed to 60 years and at a cost of $7 billion as opposed to \n$35 billion.\n  It was anticipated at the time when the contracts were executed that \nthe cleanup in no way, shape, or form would ever be accomplished any \nearlier than December 15 of 2006. Yet because of the great work that \nhas been done, the work has now been finished. It is unfair, from my \npoint of view, to penalize the employees who performed this great work \non behalf of our national security in this cleanup by simply not \nproviding them with the benefits that had been anticipated with a \nDecember 15, 2006 termination date for this contract.\n  What this amendment will do is provide up to $15 million for the life \nand health insurance benefits for these employees. These men and women \nwere exposed to radioactive elements and other toxic compounds that we \nare still trying to identify, and in amounts that even today we can \nonly guess at. We do not know what they were exposed to, how much, or \nwhen they were exposed to these radioactive materials. We know for sure \nmany have suffered serious illnesses and many have died as a result of \nthese exposures.\n  Under the current employment contract, these workers would become \neligible for full retirement benefits, including health benefits and \nlife insurance benefits, if the work had been completed on December 15 \nof 2006. But because the work was completed before that time, these \nemployees will not be eligible for these benefits unless we correct an \ninequity with the amendment that has been proposed. The extraordinary \nefforts of these employees\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\nat Rocky Flats who worked long hours under very difficult conditions \nmust be recognized by providing them with these benefits.\n  We believe these workers are entitled to receive these benefits \nbecause the cleanup of Rocky Flats, which was expected to be completed \nby December 15, 2006, has now been completed. We believe it is \nimportant that we recognize the employees at Rocky Flats who, at \nsignificant sacrifice to themselves and their families, created an \nopportunity for this Nation to learn how we can clean up our Department \nof Energy facilities.\n  In sum, what I would say to my colleagues here in the Senate is that \nwhat we have done at Rocky Flats, through the cleanup effort there, is \nto demonstrate to the Nation how we can move forward in an expedited \nfashion and clean up contaminated sites such as the one we had at Rocky \nFlats. I am grateful for the work of my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Allard, who has been leading our joint efforts on this \namendment. At the end of the day, we hope all of our colleagues will \nrecognize that these employees have done a very valuable job for our \nnational security.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, my understanding is that the majority \nleader and minority leader have determined that we will not have \nfurther votes tonight, but I advise colleagues we have a number of \namendments which are almost completed and ready for a vote tomorrow. We \nanticipate--and I will, hopefully, be joined by my ranking member \nhere--we can, during the course of business tomorrow, hear out the \nremainder of the amendments. I would hope so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if we could get a list of pending \namendments made, unless the chairman has already done that, as to what \namendments are already pending and how much time is left on those \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is that the clerk will \nrequire a period of time within which to compile this list.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12442-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, informally, I have been advised that \ntomorrow morning, in all likelihood, there will be a period for morning \nbusiness, and that this bill will be brought up somewhere in the area \nof around 11 o'clock in the morning. So again, I am joined by my \ncolleague from Michigan in urging Senators to complete the remainder of \nthe debate time, an hour being given to each amendment. There are \nseveral amendments which have been debated in part. We will provide for \nthe Record tonight the list of those amendments and the time remaining. \nQuite frankly, I am of the opinion we will have been able to have had \nthe full hour of debate on all of the 12 amendments each side has had \nby the close of business tomorrow.\n  Now, ``close of business'' leaves a little bit to definition. We will \ncertainly receive some recommendations from our joint leadership, but I \nwould hope we could complete this bill tomorrow night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, Mr. President, if the chairman will yield, that may \nbe optimistic, but I think we are making progress. I will work \novernight--I know the chairman will--to try to line up speakers to \ncomplete the pending amendments so we can at least have, hopefully, one \nvote before the caucuses tomorrow, regardless of what hour we start. I \nam going to try to line up some speakers to complete at least one of \nthese amendments before the caucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I might suggest the Harkin amendment, \nwhich was debated very thoroughly today. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe, desires to speak to that amendment and might possibly have an \namendment in the second degree. So that one, in all likelihood, could \nbe concluded. The Chambliss amendment is another amendment that I think \nwill not require a great deal of further debate. It is a very strong \namendment. It appears to me at this point to be one which I will \nrecommend colleagues support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand there may be a second-degree \namendment to the Chambliss amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Coming from your side?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my understanding. There may be such an amendment, \na second-degree amendment. But I would agree with you in identifying \nthe Harkin amendment as a good prospect for completion tomorrow \nmorning. We do have a speaker on our side--at least one--and I am going \nto try to line that speaker up for the morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, then, let's work together with a priority to try to \nhave that done.\n  Mr. President, at this time, my understanding is the parliamentary \nsituation is the bill is no longer before the Senate, to be brought up \nagain tomorrow morning, and that at this point we are in morning \nbusiness; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Bunning, Senator McCain, Senator Stevens and Senator \nRockefeller, as a cosponsor of the Integrity in Professional Sports \nAct. While it is unfortunate that it has come to this, it is becoming \nabundantly clear that Major League Baseball and other professional \nleagues are still more concerned about protecting their own collective \nbargaining rights than cleaning up their sport.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again. The abuse of illegal \nsteroids by professional athletes is inexcusable and has no place in \ncompetition at any level. Unfortunately, this has become a problem that \nwe can no longer afford to ignore. The most recent studies indicate \nthat possibly up to five to seven percent of students, even as young as \nmiddle school, have admitted to using steroids. This is an alarming \nstatistic. If Major League Baseball won't step up to the plate on this \nissue, we will do it for them.\n  Every day, millions of young people in this country dream of one day \nplaying ball in the big leagues. When superstar athletes, with their \nmulti-million dollar contracts and lucrative endorsements are seen \nusing steroids to improve their performance, it should come as no \nsurprise that many young athletes would choose to use steroids to \nimprove their own performance.\n  Professional athletes must be held to a higher standard when it comes \nto illegal substances such as steroids. Like it or not, young people \nlook up to professional athletes as role models. The Integrity in \nProfessional Sports Act will require all professional sports leagues to \nadopt a unified standard for testing as well as tougher penalties for \nany athlete found in violation of these standards. Unlike testing \ntoday, this act will require athletes to test during the off-season and \nfrequently during their season of play. Athletes will face severe \npenalties for a positive test: a two-year ban for the first offense and \na lifetime ban for the second.\n  I have little doubt that this act will aid in the effort to rid \nprofessional sports of these dangerous substances and bring integrity \nback to the game. We must send a strong message to professional \nathletes. If you choose to cheat and use illegal steroids, you risk \nending your career. In turn, our young people will hopefully get the \nmessage that using steroids to improve athletic performance is \nabsolutely the wrong way to go.\n  While this bill specifically addresses professional athletics, the \nimportance of stopping steroid abuse extends well beyond the track, \nbaseball diamond, or football field. We must continue to focus on the \nhealth and future of our children. I encourage my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this legislation to set the standard for fair competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12443-2", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes \nlegislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, \nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 1999, in Palm Springs, CA, Steven Cagle and a companion were \nattacked by Randy Reyes and Juan Rios in a Carrow's Restaurant. It is \nbelieved that the beating was motivated by the victims' sexual \norientation. Cagle stated that it was inhumane and, `` For no other \nreason than I am a gay man.'' Prosecutors are calling this a hate crime \nand are asking for the maximum sentence.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12443-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICARE BAD DEBT POLICY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, to discuss the change in Medicare \nbad debt policy as proposed in the budget reconciliation bill. I feel \nthere is a need to differentiate between debt owed by individuals and \ndebt owed by States. The sponsors of this policy argue that it will \nencourage skilled nursing facilities to be more efficient in the \ncollection of bad debt. However, how can the facility be more efficient \nif the State simply refuses to pay the Medicare co-payments through its \nMedicaid program? This body should examine the root of this problem \nbefore implementing the bad debt policy in this bill. It is my hope \nthat the conference committee considers this when examining this \npolicy.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Senator Lincoln makes a good point. While I support the \nFinance Committee's goal of encouraging accountability and \nincentivizing the collection of Medicare bad debt by skilled nursing \nfacilities, I do see the need to differentiate between debt owed by \nindividuals and debt owed by States. I believe this conference should \nconsider this point as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12443-4", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LIVE 8 CHARITY CONCERT IN PHILADELPHIA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few \nmoments to recognize Ebony magazine as this venerable publication \ncelebrates its 60th anniversary.\n  In 1945, at a time when segregation was the law of the land, an \noutlet for the positive portrayal of Black life in American popular \nculture was long overdue. With the birth of Ebony, Publisher John H. \nJohnson forced the world to consider real African Americans, including \ntheir diverse success stories. These same stories, which filled each \nmonth's edition of Ebony, gave African Americans a deeper sense of \npride in their heritage and their growing prosperity.\n  Ebony also provided millions with a rich, firsthand account of key \nmoments in the struggle for civil rights. Whether it was a sit-in at a \nlunch counter in the South or the historic March on Washington, the \nintrepid journalists and photographers of Ebony were present to bear \nwitness and to report the news through a prism different from the \nmainstream press. In fact, it was an Ebony photographer who captured \nthe now iconic photo of a grieving Coretta Scott King, with one of her \nchildren, at the funeral of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Not only \ndid this photograph capture the emotions of a nation, but it resulted \nin the first Pulitzer Prize awarded to an African-American man.\n  Since Ebony was founded 60 years ago, its circulation has grown from\n\n[[Page S12444]]\n\n25,000 per issue to 1.7 million per issue, and its readership has \nincreased from 125,000 per issue to more than 12.5 million per issue. \nAlthough it has had the largest circulation of any publication targeted \nto African-Americans for the duration of its existence, Ebony is much \nmore than a magazine. As just one example, its annual fashion \nextravaganza, Fashion Fair, has raised more than $58 million in its 48-\nyear history for various charities, has provided an outlet for hundreds \nof talented clothing designers, and created work opportunities for \nAfrican-American models, as well as spawned a line of cosmetics for \nwomen of color.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me, and the millions of Americans who \nhave been touched, inspired, and influenced by Ebony Magazine in \ncelebrating the 60th anniversary of this great publication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12444-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF THE KENTUCKY COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the Kentucky \nCommunity and Technical College System of Versailles, KY for their \nhurricane disaster relief efforts. KCTCS has opened their doors to the \ndisplaced student victims of Hurricane Katrina through Operation \nRebuilding Lives.\n  The KCTCS statewide system of 16 colleges on 65 campuses has adopted \nemergency policies offering displaced students greater accessibility to \nfinancial aid, scholarship opportunities, and online course sessions. \nIn addition, all KCTCS colleges have sponsored hurricane relief \nfundraising events ranging from blood drives to relief supply donation \ndrives.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking the Kentucky \nCommunity and Technical College System for their efforts.

GORMAN\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I pay tribute to not only a fine \nindividual, but an amazing artist, R.C. Gorman, who passed away on \nNovember 3 at the age of 74. R.C. Gorman was an artist appreciated not \nonly by New Mexicans, but he was also well respected nationwide and \ninternationally.\n  Rudolph Carl Gorman was born in 1931 in Chinle, AZ. As the son of \nNavajo Code Talker Carl Gorman, he grew up on the Navajo reservation \nsurrounded by the unique culture of the Navajo people. Gorman is best \nknown for his paintings, sculptures, and lithographs of American Indian \nwomen wrapped in blankets.\n  A long time resident of Taos, NM, R.C. Gorman's work became a fixture \nof Southwestern style of art. In his life, he had more than 20 one-man \nshows. A distinctive exhibition for Gorman was the ``Masterworks from \nthe Museum of the American Indian'' held at New York's Metropolitan \nMuseum of Art. This exhibit was particularly unique, because R.C. \nGorman was the only living artist represented.\n  When I pay tribute to individuals, it is important for me to make \nsure I am appropriately expressing who they were and the contributions \nthey made during their time with us. I don't believe I can state it \nbetter than R.C. Gorman himself in his book, The Radiance of My People. \nHe wrote, ``If I am remembered at all, I'd be very surprised and \namused. I don't really think about it or worry about it. But I suppose \nI would like to be remembered that I was an earnest worker. That I \ncared. That I know anyone can get what they want if they work hard \nenough. After all, I'm just a little boy from the reservation who used \nto herd sheep at Black Mountain.''\n  I extend my thoughts and prayers to his family and friends at this \ntime. It is my hope, that they remember the great impact he made during \nhis time with us from his work that inspired us to his friendship that \nendeared us. I express to them my deepest sympathy.\n  It is a great loss to the State of New Mexico and the Nation. I know \nmyself and many people will miss his spirited personality and he will \nalways have a place in our heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12444-3", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12444-S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDIANA SERVICE LEADERS SUMMIT\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to tell you about the \nextraordinary young Hoosiers I met last month in Indianapolis. On \nOctober 22, National Make A Difference Day, I hosted my third annual \nIndiana Service Leaders Summit to honor high school students from \nacross the State for their service and hopefully to inspire them to \ncontinue serving their communities throughout their lives.\n  In their schools and their communities, the young men and women I met \ntruly have answered the call to service. Some of them helped build \nhomes, some tutored and mentored younger students, and others raised \nmoney to support cancer research or fed the hungry. Several of the \nyoung men and women started service clubs on their own to address the \nproblems in their schools and communities. Each one of the students I \nmet spent hours making a difference and together they have impacted the \nlives of countless Hoosiers. I was honored to have the opportunity to \nmeet and speak with them. It was impressive and inspiring to learn \nabout the many causes they support.\n  Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``Some men see things as they are and \nsay `Why?' I dream of things that never were and say, `Why not?''' Each \none of these young men and women have already asked themselves ``Why \nnot?'' and have worked to make positive changes in their communities. \nThey represent a new generation of promise with the potential to make a \nreal difference across Indiana and the Nation.\n  During the summit, which was cohosted by Indiana University Purdue \nUniversity Indianapolis, the students heard from Hoosier leaders who \nhave chosen to dedicate their lives to serving others. The speakers \nhighlighted the five pillars of successful service: inspiration, \norganization, dedication, evaluation, and reflection. Following the \nspeeches, the students and I prepared more than 1,000 care packages \nwith the assistance of the Salvation Army that will be sent to Hoosier \ntroops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The students then divided into \ngroups and participated in service activities at different sites \nthroughout Indianapolis.\n  I would like to thank each one of the following individuals for \nparticipating in the summit and for their service to their communities: \nBradley Albachten, Amy Altemeyer, Joanna Barnett, Jessica Barnett, \nChelsea Rae Baugher, Jessica Beckner, Kirsten Bedell, Marc Bergman, \nErin Bess, Kortney Bogue, Kaitlin Bohlander, Kelly Bolt, Patrick \nBorders, Nicholas Brancolini, Emily Brunton, Neil Burk, Jessica Burton, \nRohini Chatterjee, Danielle Clark, Desmon Clark, Timothy Cleaver, \nNathan A.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \njudges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their family members, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Court \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2005. This bill is in direct response to \nthe tragic events that occurred in Chicago on February 28, 2005. On \nthat day, the husband and aged mother of Judge Joan Lefkow\n\n[[Page S12449]]\n\nwere shot and killed in their own home. The perpetrator, as described \nby Judge Lefkow, was an angry litigant. These attacks on Federal judges \nare not as isolated as one might think. Federal judges receive on \naverage 700 inappropriate communications or threats each year, and \nthree Federal judges have been assassinated in the last 25 years.\n  Shortly after the Lefkow murders, on March 14, 2005, I wrote to the \nDirector of the United States Marshals Service to find out what \nsecurity measures were in place and what additional measures could be \ninstituted, particularly off-site security measures, following this \nterrible tragedy.\n  On March 14, 2005, Assistant Attorney General William E. Moschella \nresponded on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service, stating that Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales and Director Reyna are reviewing all aspects of \njudicial security, both at judicial facilities and off-site, but no \nspecifics were offered, and no specifics have yet to be received.\n  On April 5, 2005, the Judicial Conference of the United States wrote \nto the President about the issue. Stating that ``attacks such as these \nstrike at the core of our system of government,'' the Judicial \nConference asked that immediate actions be taken to improve judicial \nsecurity, particularly outside of the courthouse. On May 6, 2005, I met \nwith Third Circuit Judge Jane Roth, who chairs the Committee on \nFacilities and Securities for the Judicial Conference, to discuss \nsecurity issues.\n  Congress quickly responded and passed the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief, which was enacted on May 11, 2005. The Act provided $11.9 \nmillion to the U.S. Marshals Service for ``increased judicial security \noutside of courthouse facilities, including priority consideration of \nhome detection systems in the homes of Federal judges,'' and as a \nresult home intrusion detection systems will soon be available to every \nFederal judge who wants one. But we must do more.\n  On May 18, 2005, I chaired a full Judiciary Committee hearing \nentitled ``Protecting the Judiciary at Home and in the Courthouse'' and \nit is evident from this hearing that much more needs to be done in the \narea of judicial security. The responsibility of protecting our Federal \njudiciary and the halls of justice rests primarily with the U.S. \nMarshals Service, but we heard compelling testimony that coordination \nand cooperation is sorely lacking between the Federal judiciary and the \nagency principally charged with its protection.\n  Not only does the U.S. Marshals Service arrogantly fail to coordinate \nand cooperate with the Federal judiciary, serious questions were raised \nregarding the efficacy of its existing security programs. For example, \na report issued by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice \nin March 2004 found that the U.S. Marshals Service's threat assessments \nare ``untimely and of questionable validity,'' and that the U.S. \nMarshals Service has ``limited capability to collect and share \nintelligence, and lacks adequate standards for determining appropriate \nprotective measures.''\n  This legislation would enhance judicial security in several respects. \nThe legislation would statutorily require the U.S. Marshals Service to \ncooperate and coordinate with the Judicial Conference regarding \njudicial security on a continuing basis. The legislation also would \nprovide new criminal sanctions on individuals who harass or intimidate \njudges either by filing false or malicious liens against judges or by \nknowingly posting personal information regarding Federal judges on the \nInternet with the intent that such information be used to harm them. \nThe legislation would extend the Judicial Conference's authority to \nredact sensitive personal information from judges' financial disclosure \nforms so that such information cannot be used for harassment or \nintimidation purposes.\n  The rampage in Atlanta reminds us that the issue of judicial security \nis no less of a compelling problem for State and local courts, where \napproximately 32,000 State and local court judges sit compared to \napproximately 2,400 Federal judges. This legislation would address \nthese State and local issues by authorizing grants for court security \nand witness protection.\n  In conclusion, there is no doubt that the rule of law is the backbone \nof our civilized society. The ability of the judiciary to determine the \nrule of law without fear or favor is an indispensable prerequisite to \nour democratic society. Our judges' personal security, along with \njudicial independence, must be safeguarded at all costs, and I believe \nthis bill is an important step toward providing those safeguards.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last May, the Judiciary Committee heard the \ncourageous testimony of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago. She is the \nFederal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in their home. The \ntragedy that befell Judge Lefkow and her family is a terrible reminder \nnot only of the vulnerable position of our judges and their families, \nbut of the critical importance of protecting judges where they work and \nwhere they and their families live. We cannot tolerate and no one \nshould excuse or justify--violence or the threat of violence against \nour judges. I was appalled earlier this year when right-wing activists \ncompared judges to terrorists and the KKK and threatened them with \npunishment for decisions they did not like, even quoting Joseph \nStalin's violent answer to anyone who opposed his totalitarianism by \nurging the formula of ``No man, No problem.'' Stalin killed those with \nwhom he disagreed. This rhetoric can only foster unacceptable violence \nagainst Judges and it must stop, for the sake of our Judges and the \nindependence of the judiciary. We ought to be protecting judges \nphysically and institutionally rather than taking rhetorical pot shots \nthat put judges in real danger and that attack the very independence of \nour federal judiciary.\n  When I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001, one of the first \nthings I did was push for passage of the Judicial Protection Act, which \ntoughened criminal penalties for assaults against judges and their \nfamilies. We enacted it. We were right to do so. Protecting our judges \nand Federal law enforcement officers should be a top priority for us.\n  Today, in order to meet the continuing challenges of keeping our \njudges, our Courts, and the rest of the Federal judiciary safe, \nChairman Specter and I are introducing the Court Security Improvement \nAct of 2005 (``CSIA''). CSIA responds to requests by the judiciary for \na greater voice in working with the United States Marshals Service to \ndetermine their security needs. It strengthens and expands protections \nfor judges and their families against the misuse of their personal \ninformation by those who intend to threaten them. It enacts new \ncriminal penalties for the mis-use of restricted personal information \nto seriously harm or threaten to seriously harm judges, their families \nor other individuals performing official duties. It also enacts \ncriminal penalties for threatening judges and federal law enforcement \nofficials by the malicious filing of false liens, provides increased \nprotections for witnesses, and makes available new resources for state \ncourts to improve security for state and local court systems.\n  I appreciate the work of Chairman Specter on this important bill and, \nin particular, for including an extension of life insurance benefits to \nbankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges, as well as health \ninsurance for surviving spouses and families of federal judges.\n  We must better protect the dedicated women and men throughout the \nJudiciary in this country who do a tremendous job under challenging \ncircumstances. They are hard-working public servants who are too often \nmaligned and unfairly disparaged. We owe it to them and to our \ndemocracy to find ways to make sure that tragedies like those that \nbefell Judge Lefkow are not repeated, and to ensure that Judges and \ntheir families have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital and \ndifficult jobs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nCourt Security Improvement Act of 2005, of which I am an original \ncosponsor. I want to commend Senator Specter and the other cosponsors \nof this bill for tackling the critical issue of judicial and courthouse \nsecurity.\n  Our democracy depends on the dedication of public servants, including \nthe men and women of the judiciary--from the trial courts to the \nappellate\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\ncourts--who daily preside over important and difficult issues. They \nfaithfully carry out their duties and diligently work to support the \nadministration of justice. We must do all that we can to provide \nadequate security to these dedicated men and women who sometimes are \ntargeted for violence or harassment because of the position they hold.\n  Unfortunately, episodes of courthouse violence in this country are on \nthe rise, including in my home State of Texas. I was a judge for 13 \nyears and have a number of close personal friends who still serve on \nthe bench today. I am outraged by acts of courthouse violence. I \npersonally know judges and their families who have been victims of \nviolence, and I have grieved with those families.\n  Acts of violence against judges are unacceptable and reflect a \ndistortion of the role of the judiciary. Judges are impartial umpires \nof the law--they simply call the balls and strikes--and they cannot \nhelp but disappoint people. However, it is unacceptable for judges, \ncourthouse personnel or other law enforcement officials to face threats \nand violence for doing nothing more than faithfully carrying out their \nprofessional duties.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has examined issues related to \ncourthouse security at a recent hearing. At this hearing, the Judicial \nConference raised several important issues, including its working \nrelationship with the United States Marshals Service, the need to \nprotect judges outside of the courthouse, and common instances of \nintimidation and harassment directed at judges.\n  This hearing and these issues provide the foundation for this bill. \nLet me discuss a few of the security improvements made by this bill.\n  The U.S. Marshals Service has primary responsibility for providing \nsecurity to the judiciary. However, the Judicial Conference testified \nthat they are not consulted when decisions, which directly implicate \ntheir security, are made. The Marshal's Service should willingly \ncoordinate and communicate with the judiciary on security concerns. \nThis legislation would codify this commonsense idea and keep the \njudiciary informed of, and allow them to provide suggestions for, \ndecisions regarding their security.\n  This bill also addresses a relatively recent problem that poses a \nparticular danger to public officials. Personal information, such as \nhome addresses and phone numbers, of Federal officials when posted on \nthe Internet can be readily accessed and used to intimidate or harm \nthem. Recently, personal information of Federal judges have been posted \non the Internet and used to facilitate threats against them. This bill \nwould punish those who, with the intent to harm, post restricted \ninformation of public officials, or of their immediate family, on the \nInternet.\n  Additionally, members of the Federal judiciary have been targets of \nintimidation or harassment by some who file false liens against the \nreal or personal property of a judge who has presided over a criminal \nor civil case, or who has otherwise acted against the interests of a \nlitigant. This provision would make it a crime to knowingly file a \nfalse lien against the property of a Federal judge or law enforcement \nofficer on the basis of their official status.\n  Finally, and importantly, this bill authorizes Federal grants to be \nmade available to State courts to improve security for State and local \ncourt systems. We must comprehensively approach this problem by \nproviding funding to State courts to update their security while \nstanding by to swiftly and severely punish those who cause or attempt \nto cause harm to anyone within the courts.\n  It is important for us to do all we can to protect the men and women \nwho make up our judicial system because they are essential to the \nproper administration of justice. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 972. A bill to require Members of Congress and legislative branch \nemployees to report all contact with officials and representatives of \ncountries designated as state sponsors of terrorism; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks about a \nbill I introduced earlier today, the Terrorist Lobby Disclosure Act of \n2005.\n  My legislation is simple, straightforward and necessary. Because the \nUnited States is actively involved in the global war on terror, we must \nbe vigilant in fighting this war on all fronts. This means supplying \nour men and women of the Armed Forces with equipment and materiel to \nconduct military operations. It means providing our intelligence \ncommunity with the resources it needs to make inroads against terrorist \norganizations and to better safeguard Americans against nations and \ngroups that hate our way of life. It means devoting the time and \nresources to ensure the safety of our borders, ports and airports. \nFinally, it means providing transparency in dealing with those nations \ndefined by our government as ``state sponsors of terrorism.''\n  According to the Department of State, Iran, Syria, Libya, Cuba, North \nKorea, and Sudan are the six governments that the U.S. Secretary of \nState has designated as state sponsors of international terrorism. \nThese are governments that engage directly in terrorist activity \nthemselves; support terrorist groups by providing funding, arms, or \nother material support; or provide training, logistical support, \nsanctuary, or diplomatic facilities. These states are the worst of the \nworst when it comes to fighting the global war on terror.\n  My bill requires Members of Congress and employees of the legislative \nbranch to disclose, on a quarterly basis, any contacts with \nrepresentatives or officials of governments that have been designated \nas state sponsors of international terrorism. The contacts must be \nreported to the U.S. Department of State, Secretary of the Senate, and \nClerk of the House of Representatives. My bill makes sure that the \ncongressional committees of oversight are also duly informed of these \ncontacts. Let me be clear, my bill does not prohibit these contacts. \nRather, with men and women serving in harm's way in the global war on \nterror, it simply requires disclosure and transparency in the conduct \nof their official duties.\n  As we commit final resources and valuable human capital to prosecute \nthe global war on terror, we ought to know if members of our own \ngovernment are meeting with individuals who are representatives of \nterrorist nations. The American people deserve to know if there are \ncontacts happening with representatives of these regimes--regimes that \nare actively opposed to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/11/07/senate-section/article/S12450-1", "month": "11", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2433.
