Mr. President, I wish everyone a good morning as we start \na very busy day in the Senate.\n  Yesterday, I think we defined a good glidepath to finishing the \nlobbying reform bill, after which we will return to the immigration \nissues.\n  Today, following our period of morning business, we will return to \nthe consideration of the lobbying reform bill. Yesterday, we invoked \ncloture by a vote of 81 to 16, and therefore I believe we will be able \nto finish that bill at an early hour today. The order from last night \nprovides that all amendments must be offered no later than 11 a.m. this \nmorning. The bill managers will be here and will be able to call up \namendments if Members are unable to get to the floor by 11 o'clock. \nTherefore, at 11 o'clock this morning, we will be able to determine how \nmany remaining amendments will require votes before we go to passage of \nthe lobbying reform bill. We already have a time agreement with Senator \nFeingold on his amendment relating to gifts, and we will vote on that \nissue prior to noon today.\n  Once we complete the lobbying reform bill, we will proceed to the \nborder control bill under the order entered yesterday. We will begin \nthat bill for a period of debate first before we get into the amendment \nprocess. Many Senators have indicated that there is a desire to have \nopening statements before we begin to consider other immigration \nissues. Therefore, we have provided for that period for debate, and I \nencourage Members to take advantage of this opportunity today, this \nafternoon, or this evening.\n  Having said that, we will be voting today on a number of lobbying \namendments as well as passage of the lobbying reform bill. I also \nencourage Senators to keep their schedules open for the remainder of \nthe week as we get into the border control bill and related issues. We \nare providing ample time for the consideration of this bill, and we \nneed to take advantage of each day between now and the recess for this \nbill.\n  It was now over 3 months ago that we said we would spend these 2 \nweeks on the issues of border control, of interior enforcement, and \nissues such as the temporary worker issues. We will be doing that over \nthese 2 weeks. I believe we can complete that over the course of these \n2 weeks. I do encourage our colleagues to get involved early, both in \nthe debate and taking advantage of the time we are providing beginning \ntoday, tonight, and every day and every night between now and the next \nrecess.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2484-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee has voted \nout a historic and monumental immigration bill. The work was intense \nand fast, and we spent less than, perhaps, half a day dealing with the \nentire area of the bill that is referred to as guest workers or what to \ndo with those who are here today illegally--perhaps 11 million to 20 \nmillion individuals.\n  I have reached a conclusion, having been in law enforcement for the \nmost part of my professional career, that the enforcement provisions \nare not going to be adequate--although there are some good ones there, \nsome steps forward--and our approach to those who are here and those \nwho wish to come here in the future has been poorly thought out and \nunprincipled.\n  I strongly believe that America has a tremendous opportunity to fix a \nbroken immigration system. The system as it operates today makes a \nmockery of law, and we all know that. It rewards bad behavior. It \nplaces bureaucratic hurdles and delays in front of those who want to do \nthe right thing in coming here.\n  The list of the ways the current system does not work, frankly, is \nalmost endless. We have had hearings and discussions, and you have read \nin the newspapers so many of the things that are disturbing about why \nour system does not work. Our failure to develop a lawful system has \nhad a number of perverse consequences. But one little-noted consequence \nis that many Americans, even those in this Senate, have come to believe \nthat it cannot be fixed, that it is hopeless, that we cannot get \ncontrol of our borders, that it is just a natural thing we should \naccept, that we go through the motions of doing something about it, but \nit really will never be fixed.\n  But the good news is that is not true. The failure of our current \nsystem is the result of identifiable defects, defects that can be \nfixed. It is not impossible. Fixing these deficiencies is not all that \ndifficult. Although it will cost real money, it is affordable. So what \nwe really need is the will to do it, the belief and the will and the \ndetermination to go forward and make this system work.\n  T.J. Bonner, who heads the National Border Control Council and who \nhas repeatedly expressed the frustrations of our Border Patrol agents--\nhe represents them--told us, at our Judiciary Committee, how to make \nthe system work. He said: First, control the borders. Second: Workplace \nenforcement needs to be effectually carried out; that is, to make sure \npeople who are not legal do not get jobs because the jobs are the \nmagnets. A third and connected step is to make our entry and exit \nsystem biometric and easier to use. That is part of the concept that \nwould be necessary to move us to an effective legal system.\n  Such actions, in my view, based on my study and the hearings I have \nattended, will allow us to quickly reach the magic ``tipping point.'' \nThat is the point where those who want to come to this country will \nreceive a clear message. And that message is this: It makes far more \nsense to enter our country legally rather than illegally.\n  Now, at this time, the opposite is true. Those who desire to enter \nAmerica would rather pay a fee to some transporter, some ``coyote,'' to \ncross illegally rather than enter lawfully. The situation is so bad \nthat while we apprehended 1.1 million last year entering our country \nillegally--think of that, 1.1 million--the number who have arrived \nsuccessfully has surged to almost 12 million, according to the best \nestimates. Many say more. How bad is that? That is not good. This is \nnot a policy which we can take pride in or have any confidence in, that \nwe have almost as many people illegally as legally coming.\n  So what do we do to fix it? You say: Sessions, what are you going to \ndo about it? What do you propose? There are some steps we can do. \nUnfortunately, because the system has been broken for so long, we are \ngoing to have to work very hard at first to get to that tipping point, \nto tip from illegality to legality.\n  But you see what happens when that occurs, when you reach that \ntipping point? Then the stress on the agents, who are out arresting \nthousands every night, is so much less because they have fewer to \napprehend. You have fewer in our deportation centers. You have much \nless of a problem for those who are deported--other than Mexicans, who \ncannot readily be deported to their country--because fewer are coming \nbecause they know if they come they are likely to be apprehended and \nthey will be immediately sent back to whatever country they came from.\n  It begins to work in a way that a lot of people do not think is \npossible, but it is absolutely possible, and that is, once we make \nclear you are not going to successfully be able to enter our country \nillegally, that you must wait in line to come legally, we will have far \nfewer people come here. Right now the word is out that we are open for \nanyone who desires to come, even if they don't desire to come legally. \nThat is what is causing so much problem.\n\n  One of the things we learned in the 1986 amnesty was not to give \namnesty again. You want to do the right thing, and we are going to do \nthe right thing about the people who have come here illegally. We need \nto spend some time on it. We need to care about every single one of \nthem. They are human beings with dreams and hopes, creatures of our \nHeavenly Father. Each one of them is entitled to respect, but they are \nnot entitled to the same benefits a lawful entrant into our country \nhas. Who would suggest that? I don't think that is a principled \napproach we can defend.\n  We learned in 1986 that we should not give amnesty. It failed. No \nserious commentator believes the amnesty of 1986 worked. It was widely \nheld to encourage illegal entry. There was a commission appointed by \nthe Congress, a bipartisan commission, 6 years after 1986 to review \nwhat happened when the legislation passed that created amnesty at that \ntime. They said it failed. It should not be done again.\n  By any standard of the definition of the word ``amnesty,'' the bill \nthat came out of committee is that. That is a loaded word. I don't want \nto be a demagogue with the word ``amnesty.'' But if amnesty has any \nmeaning, it is that people who came illegally are given an opportunity \nto receive every single benefit, including citizenship, as a result of \ntheir illegal act. That is how we have always meant it. That is what \nwas done in 1986. That is what was determined to be a failure.\n  Secondly, we must deal with and eliminate, as T. J. Bonner said, the \nmagnet of jobs for illegals. It will not be hard to stop the hiring of \nillegals by requiring biometric identifiers of foreign workers. It will \nbe easy. Most businesses will comply with what they understand to be \nthe plain law. If they are told they should require identification and \nit should be checked through the computer system that is being set up \nand will be set up to determine whether this is a lawful applicant, \nthey will do so. It will not be easy to prosecute those cases. We have \nlearned, however, that in 2004, only three cases of fines were assessed \nagainst an employer for bringing people into the country or hiring \npeople who were here illegally. So it has never been enforced. It is a \nmockery of the law. You have it on the books, but nobody has ever \nenforced it.\n  Businesses will comply. We will not have to prosecute all of them. As \nsoon as they realize this is not the policy of the United States \nanymore, that the policy of the United States is you should check your \nworkers before you hire them and make sure they are here legally, they \nwill do so. All of a sudden, this magnet can be eliminated. Again, \ntherefore, if you want to come to the United States to work lawfully, \nyou are tipped into the idea of waiting in line, take your time, come \nand have your background check done to make sure you don't have \nterrorist connections and don't have a criminal record,\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\nthose kinds of things, and then you can come in.\n  Border enforcement is not easy. We have 1,900 miles on the border. \nPeople say we should not have a fence; it is something deeply wrong \nwith that. I don't find anything wrong with that. I always heard the \nslogan ``good fences make good neighbors.'' It certainly has worked in \nSan Diego. But in the most busy areas where illegal entry is occurring, \nthat is a perfectly normal and natural thing. If we don't do that, it \nis an indication that we lack the will to see the matter through.\n  The House has a bill that deals with this issue. It proposes up to \n700 miles of fencing in the worst areas. It has worked in the San Diego \narea. It can work here. So it is a test. Are we committed to the \nenforcement question?\n  The committee bill did deal with some important steps on enforcement, \nhowever. It had some important steps. I don't want to diminish that. I \nhave used a metaphor to say, unfortunately, that it is like making an \n8-foot leap across a 10-foot ravine. We are almost there, but we are \nnot there. If we do a few more things, including barriers, including \nbiometrics, including workplace enforcement and detention, not having \nanymore catch-and-release programs, those kinds of things, we could get \nthere more quickly and more easily than most people think. We have made \nprogress, but we are not there yet.\n  I have discovered, as a former attorney general and prosecutor, U.S. \nattorney, from my local police officers in Alabama that they are not \nwelcomed to even voluntarily contribute their abilities in immigration \nenforcement. For example, there is a clear message told to local law \nenforcement--and I meet with groups of law enforcement officers \nwhenever I am in the State and enjoy that. I ask them how their drug \nlaws are going, what are they seeing on the streets, what problems do \nthey have. And I usually ask them about immigration. The standard \nanswer is, they have been told by the immigration enforcement officers \nthat unless they have 15 people illegally they have apprehended, don't \nbother to call. They won't come and pick them up. They are not \ninterested. What does that say about our intention to have a lawful \nsystem as opposed to an unlawful one?\n\n  I saw the front page of the Washington Times a few days ago. It had \nan article about an officer in the Midwest or the West who apprehended \n15 illegal aliens. He called the immigration people and they said: \nDon't bother. Don't call us.\n  This has been going on for years. It is the standard policy out \nthere. So this indicates to me we are not serious about having a lawful \nsystem.\n  It is absolutely possible for us to reverse this trend, to allow \nlarge numbers of people to come to our country to work, people who we \nknow are not connected to terrorism or are not criminal elements, drug \ngangs and organizations of that kind. We absolutely can do that. But I \nam afraid the legislation we have moved forward does not do so. We are \ngoing to have some discussion about the majority leader's bill, the \nFrist bill. It is more focused on the enforcement question. It does not \nattempt to settle the huge, difficult human issue of how to handle in a \nhumane and lawful way those who are already here unlawfully. That is a \nbig deal, and we will have to spend some time on that. But I don't \nunderstand the purpose of it. We will spend a day or so on that and \nthen apparently go to the committee bill.\n  It came out of committee with a pretty large vote, six ``no'' votes \non the committee. The Judiciary Committee has produced their \nlegislation. It is on the floor now, and it will be the main part of \nthe debate as we go forward. The only thing about which I will express \nconcern to my colleagues is that we haven't read it yet. I see the \nPresiding Officer, such an extraordinarily valuable member of our \ncommittee who cares about this issue deeply. We haven't even seen it \nprinted yet. We passed amendments, and we agreed to amendments on the \nfloor. We passed the agriculture jobs bill that was up here a year or \nso ago that got blocked. We passed it in a 5-minute discussion. I think \nit was maybe 50 or 100 pages. This bill is over 300 pages. We \nsubstituted the Kennedy-McCain bill for the chairman's mark and passed \nthat. Who has read that?\n  Then they said: Well, it wasn't quite the same as everything you have \nheard about our bill. We have made improvements on it. What \nimprovements? What does it say?\n  I urge my colleagues to not announce too quickly that they are in \nsupport of the legislation that came out of our committee because they \ndon't know what is in it yet. I don't know what is in it, and I am on \nthe committee.\n  We are dealing with one of the most momentous challenges of our time. \nWe need to do it in the right way. We can do it in the right way. What \nI believe we should do is follow the lead of the House of \nRepresentatives. People say that is a harsh bill. It is not a harsh \nbill. It is a bill designed to make the legal system work. What is \nharsh about that? Unless you believe lawlessness is the appropriate way \nto handle business in America, unless you don't respect the rule of \nlaw. It is not harsh to create a legal system. They have concluded that \nthe proper response to the crisis we face, with due respect to the \nconcerns of the American people, is to, first, demonstrate that we can \ncreate an immigration system that actually works. That is what the \nHouse decided to do. That is what they focused on, and that is what \nthey passed. They did not attempt, with a few hours debate, to deal \nwith the colossal issue of human concerns of those who are here and to \ndevelop an architecture for who we want to allow to come in in the \nfuture and under what conditions.\n  That is what we should do. That is what most of our hearings in the \ncommittee have been focused on. Then we will have some credibility with \nthe American people.\n  Let me share a couple of additional thoughts about matters I believe \nare important. The Judiciary bill--I don't want to call it Chairman \nSpecter's mark because it was so altered and changed. It had quite a \nbit of difference. But the bill that came out of committee did a number \nof different things. One, it would immediately legalize the 12 to, some \nsay, 20 million people who are here illegally. It would give them a \ngreen card in a relatively short period. It would then put them on an \nautomatic path to citizenship. Once they become a citizen, they are \nable to bring in family members and even brothers and sisters, mothers \nand fathers. It would double the number of legal visas, I think, to \n400,000. Each one of those would not be as though you have a visa to \ncome in. These visas are not just to come in to work for 6 months or a \nyear and go back to your home country. This 400,000 will allow you to \nstay up to 6 years and then allow you, at the end of 4 years, to apply \nfor a green card. And once you get that permanent green card, you can \napply for citizenship. So it will be about another 400,000.\n  We think, conservatively speaking, this bill would add 30 million \npeople to our Nation in the next 10 years. We ought to spend some time \ntalking about that. That is a big deal. That is a 10-percent increase \nin our population, and we ought to be thinking about what is in it. We \nspent very little time and we have spent very little national \ndiscussion in which the American people have had an opportunity to \nlisten on this issue. It is hugely important. We want to do the right \nthing about it.\n  Let me share this: The enforcement mechanisms we passed in \ncommittee--many of which are good, some of which failed that were \nneeded--are only a promise.\n  This is why the American people have a right to be cynical, they have \na right to be nervous, they have a right to watch this Congress like a \nhawk because that is what happened in 1986. Once you pass the guest \nworker part of the bill--which is what it is being called, and I am not \nsure that is a very good description of it--that becomes law; the \npeople become legalized; they put in for citizenship, and we double the \nnumber of people coming, et cetera, and that becomes our law right now.\n  What about the enforcement? We authorized UAV, the virtual fence. \nVirtual reality is all that is. That UAV is to see if somebody is out \nthere, but that is of very little value if you don't have somebody go \nout and pick them up. Anyway, we increase the bed spaces and increase \nsome Border Patrol officers by authorization. All the Judiciary \nCommittee bill can do is authorize those actions to be made. They have \nno ability whatsoever to fund them and to make sure they get carried \nout.\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\n  What we learned after 1986 is that Congress hasn't funded the things \nnecessary to make the border secure, and the Presidents--every one of \nthem since that time--seem to have little interest in making sure it \ngets enforced. They don't come before Congress and say we have a \nproblem at the border; we need more money, more agents, more detention \nspace, and more barriers. They let it go. So this is a dangerous thing. \nI am not going to vote for any bill that is a ``let me see one hand and \nnot the other.'' In other words, we are going to have one vote that \nwill be a permanent decision about how to deal with those who are here \nillegally. But we will not be able to have any guarantee that the \nenforcement system is going to be made workable. That is why the House \nbelieves they should complete the enforcement mechanisms first, which \nis a good principle that we should be concerned about.\n  The stress on our system is going to be incredible. Some in the \nimmigration system say, when they think what this will mean, they \ncannot imagine how this will ever work. They have a huge backlog on \napplications to come into the country. Our immigration service is \nexpected to make some background checks to make sure we are not \nallowing criminals and terrorists to come into the country. If we more \nthan double the number that are allowed to apply and enter, then their \nworkload is going to be incredibly heavy. It is not working now. We can \ndo better.\n  Finally, a lot of people have been unhappy with President Bush. They \nsay he has been too much for amnesty. They say he is not serious about \nthe border, and they have complained about that and so have I. I felt \nthat he has not been sufficiently concerned about creating a legal \nsystem that works. But I have to tell you, the bill that came out of \ncommittee is way past that. Please know that, Senators. I heard Scott \nMcClellan on the radio today, from the press conference he gave \nyesterday, and he stated the principles of the President. One of them \nis that those who come here illegally are not put on an automatic path \nto citizenship. That is what the President defines as amnesty. That is \nwhat he says he is not for.\n  But that is what this bill does. The bill puts the people who came \nhere unlawfully on an automatic path to citizenship. If that is not \namnesty, what is? The President does not support what is here. It is \nbeyond what he wants to do. He has a very generous idea about \nimmigration. He wants to do the right thing. All of us do, but we \ncannot defend the principle of granting amnesty because we know what \nhappened in 1986. It did not work. The independent commissions have \nsaid that.\n  I will conclude by urging my colleagues to recognize how important \nthis issue is to get right, how important it is that we do the right \nthing, so that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, we can be proud of \nwhat we did. And we can get there; we absolutely can. But this bill is \nnot the vehicle to do it. We should not pass it in its present form. I \nsay that with the caveat that nobody has seen the bill we will have on \nthe floor. It hasn't even been printed yet. That is a pretty sad case, \nif you want to know the truth. It was so complex and rushed through our \ncommittee in such a hasty way.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues for giving me a \nchance to share these thoughts. I urge each and every one of them to \nspend some time on this issue. Let's study this legislation and let's \ndon't be stampeded by politics or protests or that kind of thing. Let's \ntry to do the right thing and make sure that whatever we do is \nsomething we can be proud of and our children can be proud of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

There is 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have a half hour \nin morning business for the Democrats; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to my friend \nfrom Alabama. He has been very much involved and engaged in the \ndiscussion and debate on this issue in our Judiciary Committee. But I \ncaution those watching this debate to examine his comments, where he \nsaid: ``Any individuals that came here illegally, this bill puts them \nautomatically on a path for citizenship.'' That statement is \ncategorically wrong. It does not. I will explain about the provisions \nof the legislation. I would not support that proposal. The members of \nthe Judiciary Committee that supported the underlying legislation, the \nMcCain-Kennedy legislation, don't support that proposal.\n  We gather here today to begin debate on our effort to correct a great \nhistoric wrong.\n  For decades, this country has turned a blind eye to the plight of the \nstranger in our midst, and looked away in indifference as undocumented \nimmigrants have been exploited at the workplace and have been forced \nwith their families to live in constant fear of detection and \ndeportation.\n  We have ignored the tough conditions endured by the undocumented, and \nthe harmful ripple effects undocumented employment has on some U.S. \nworkers. For decades Congress has failed to take sensible steps to end \nundocumented immigration, and some of our policy choices have even \ncontributed to the current crisis.\n  We first confronted this problem directly in 1952, passing a law \nknown in the parlance of the time as the ``Wetback'' bill, which made \nit a crime to harbor or abet undocumented immigrants. But at the same \ntime, over the vigorous objections of President Truman, Congress carved \nout the Texas Proviso--so called because it was drafted by agricultural \nproducers from that State--which made it legal to employ undocumented \nimmigrants. This decision protected the ``economic pull factors'' which \nhave sustained illegal migration since that time.\n  In 1961 the Edward R. Murrow documentary Harvest of Shame directed \nthe Nation's attention to the miserable conditions under which migrant \nfarm workers toiled to bring cheap fruit and vegetables to our table. \nCongress responded by terminating the deeply flawed Bracero guest-\nworker program, and strict limits were imposed for the first time on \nlabor migration from Mexico. I was part of that effort in the Senate to \nend that unacceptable and outrageously exploitive program. These \nchanges to our immigration policy were well-intentioned, but with \nhindsight their result was predictable: by ending legal migration, but \nallowing employers to bid for immigrant labor, Congress all but \nguaranteed a generation of undocumented immigrants would emerge.\n  Since that time, economic disparity between the U.S. and its \nneighbors increased, globalization made travel in and out of the U.S. \neasier, and two whole generations of foreign workers and U.S. employers \ncame of age in an economic system organized around illegal migration.\n  In truth, Congress has done little since then to confront this \nproblem. In 1986 we passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, but \nIRCA's employer sanctions provisions have never been enforced. Rather \nthan confront the structural causes of undocumented immigration, \nCongress has repeatedly attacked the symptoms of this disease: building \nmore fences and placing more agents at the U.S.-Mexican border, and \nimposing more restrictions on immigrants' legal rights. These blunt \nenforcement tools have not quenched employers' thirst for immigrant \nworkers, and they have not given families the tools to be reunited with \ntheir loved ones. Instead, enforcement-only approaches have driven \nimmigrants farther into the desert and deeper underground.\n  For decades, we tolerated undocumented immigration because it seemed \nlike a win-win exchange: employers and consumers were given access to \ncheap labor and low-cost goods and services; but Congress was not \nrequired to make politically difficult decisions\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nabout expanding legal low-skilled immigration.\n  But, of course, undocumented immigration has not been cost-free--far \nfrom it. And recent changes make continued indifference to this crisis \nimpossible. Undocumented immigrants now live in every State in the \nNation, and whole sectors of the economy--from construction, to food \nservices, to health care, to agriculture--depend on undocumented \nworkers to stay in business.\n  Labor and business alike now demand a system in which workers' rights \nare respected and in which workers are no longer vulnerable to \ndeportation.\n  Millions of U.S. citizens now demand a system in which their \nhusbands, wives, parents, children, and neighbors can plan for the \nfuture. And the continued health of the American economy demands a \nsystem in which all of these workers join the formal labor force, pay \ntheir taxes, and play by the rules.\n  United States relations with Mexico and other countries of origin \nhave also changed, and changed dramatically. In 1965, when the \nfoundation for our current system was put in place, Mexico was an \nauthoritarian state and barely a top 10 United States trade partner. \nNow Mexico is a flourishing democracy, a partner in the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, and our No. 2 trade partner in the world. Over \n300 million legal border crossings occur between the United States and \nMexico each year, and trade across the border totals $650 million a \nday. Yet this relationship and our broader regional interests are \njeopardized by this humanitarian crisis at the border and by the \nexploitation of immigrants within the United States.\n  President Bush is traveling to Mexico this week, and the crisis of \nundocumented immigration, including the enormous strain it places on \nour partnership with Mexico, will be at the top of the agenda.\n  And, of course, the 9/11 attacks remind us that undocumented \nimmigration creates a crisis of insecurity. America spends billions of \ndollars tracking entries and exits at our ports of entry, but we have \nno idea about the identity of millions of immigrants already living \namong us. The vast majority of these undocumented immigrants are honest \nand hard-working, but our national security requires that we identify \nand monitor those who are not.\n  We all agree that the time has come for Congress to act, but how \nshall we do so? Fundamentally, we must choose between two alternatives.\n  Some would have us build higher and longer walls at the border. They \nwould have us further restrict migrants' legal rights and make these \nhard-working men and women not just subject to deportation but also do \ntime in U.S. prisons for the crime of living and working in this \ncountry. They would go much further, actually making felons of people \nsuch as Cardinal Mahoney and tens of thousands of other clergy and \nsocial workers who are offering counseling or humanitarian support to \nundocumented immigrants.\n  Yet the United States lacks the resources or the political will to \nactually remove all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants among us. \nDoing so would cost $240 billion, it would wreak havoc with our \neconomy, and it would destroy millions of American families. Nor in a \nglobal economy do we truly have the desire or the capacity to build an \nimpenetrable wall around ourselves.\n  The idea that blunt enforcement will disrupt this deeply entrenched \nsystem of undocumented immigration flies in the face of history and \neconomics. Rather, this enforcement-only approach would simply \nreplicate the policy failures of the past. Down this road lie further \nundocumented immigration, further insecurity, further economic \npolarization, and further exploitation of the poorest and most \nvulnerable among us.\n  I must say, on the issue of the wall, all we have to do is look at \nour recent history. We have spent $20 billion over the last 10 years. \nWe have a wall now that is 66 miles long. There are 1,800 more miles \nalong the Mexican border, if we are talking about building walls. We \nhave tripled the number of border guards, built the wall along the \nborder, and we find the present system is not functioning or working. \nHow many times do we have to learn that lesson, and how much more would \nit cost us if we go that particular route? It is a route that is \nunacceptable, expensive, and unworkable.\n  We propose an alternative approach. We propose to end this system of \nexploitation and to right this historical injustice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 more minutes.\n  We believe that immigrants, like women and African Americans before \nthem, have rights in this country, and the time is ripe for a new civil \nrights moment. We believe that a nation of immigrants rejects its \nhistory and its heritage when millions of immigrants are confined \nforever to second-class status and that all Americans are debased by \nsuch a two-tier system. The time has come for comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  Our opponents believe that blunt enforcement can solve our current \ncrisis. We believe that the culture and infrastructure of illegality \ncan only be disrupted and our security and prosperity can only be \nassured through a three-pronged approach.\n  First, we favor smarter and tougher enforcement through greater \nreliance on technology, better screening at our consulates abroad, more \ninternational cooperation on migration enforcement, working with Mexico \nand the other countries in Central America--which our opponents never \nthink about or have asked to or have a program to try to do--and also \ntracking terrorist mobility and more efficient screening at U.S. work \nsites.\n  Our national security and our immigration control efforts are both \nweakened when we fail to distinguish the millions of undocumented \nimmigrants making vital contributions to our economy and the handful of \nextremists who would enter the United States to do us harm.\n  How can we seriously consider diverting our scarce resources to \nbuilding a fence along the border? This is a 19th century solution to a \n21st century problem. A fence--muro de muerte is the alternative, and \nwe are saying that is the kind of wall we are going to build, with all \nthe technology we have? It is a bankrupt policy.\n  The focus on the border will not prevent undocumented immigration. \nAlmost half of all undocumented immigrants enter through legal \nchannels, and others will always find ways to go over, under, or around \nthe wall. More importantly, a United States-Mexico border fence does \nnothing to help us identify and track terrorists who would almost \ncertainly choose other strategies for entry, including the use of \nfraudulent or legitimate documents, or entry anywhere along an \nunguarded northern border or coastline.\n  Second, in an economy which depends on immigrant labor, we favor the \ncreation of legal opportunities so that all American workers have the \nright to labor with dignity and the protection of our laws. More \nopportunities must be created for workers and families to obtain green \ncards through our permanent visa system. And the 400,000 or so \nundocumented immigrants now joining our workforce each year must be \noffered access to temporary visas and to a spot in the formal economy \nwhen employers cannot find U.S. workers to take these jobs.\n\n  Our temporary worker program differs in fundamental ways from the \nfailed approaches of the past. We include robust wage guarantees to \nensure that temporary workers will not depress the wages and working \nconditions of American workers, which is happening at the present time, \nand we back up these guarantees with strong complaint procedures and \nprotections for whistleblowers. We believe guest workers must not be \ntied to a single employer but, rather, must have the right to vote with \ntheir feet by changing jobs when employers would exploit them. And we \nbelieve workers must have the right to adjust to permanent status if \ntheir situation changes and they choose to remain in the United States.\n  Third, immigration reform will be fundamentally incomplete without a \nplan for bringing the undocumented immigrants already among us out of \nthe shadows and into legal status. Our national security requires the \nUnited States to know who resides in our\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\ncountry. Our economic prosperity requires that undocumented \nimmigrants--5 percent of all workers in the United States--join the \nlegal economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his additional 4 minutes. \nThere is 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Illinois here. I am \ngoing to take 1\\1/2\\ more minutes, and then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, countless American families want their \nundocumented relatives to have the opportunity to become residents. One \nmillion immigrants rallied in communities across the country last week, \nand the crowds included thousands of families waving American flags and \ncelebrating America as their adopted homeland.\n  No one believes in amnesty for these immigrant workers and families, \nbut we do believe in giving them a chance to earn--earn--legal status. \nThat is the difference. Amnesty is a pardon. We are not pardoning any \nundocumented immigrants. What we are basically saying is: Come out of \nthe shadows, pay a fine, pay your taxes, learn English, and after all \nthose who are in line to come to the United States at the present time \nand have come to the United States, go to the back of the line and work \nyour way to citizenship by playing by the rules. There are 70,000 \npermanent resident aliens who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. If \nyou don't play by the rules, then you are subject to deportation. That \nis earning legal status, and that is the process we follow.\n  All undocumented immigrants deserve this chance, but only those who \npay the stiff fines, work for 6 years, pay their taxes, learn English \nand pass a civics test will be permitted to remain in the United \nStates.\n  Today, we embark on a historic debate. We have an opportunity to \ncorrect these historic wrongs. I look forward to the coming debate. \nTogether, let us move forward, not backward, on genuine immigration \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I have been here when Republicans and Democrats have \ncome together to accept the challenge of an issue that is not going \naway. This issue is not going away. We now have Republicans and \nDemocrats working together. The President has talked about this issue \nas well. Surely we ought to be challenged to find a way where this \nNation can make progress with Republicans and Democrats and hopefully \neven the administration working together to help do something that is \nsensible, responsible, workable, humane, and consistent with our \nnational traditions.\n  I yield back whatever time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts who \nhas just spoken. Senator Kennedy has led so many important fights in \nthe Senate. This may be one of the most historic. We know our \nimmigration system is broken. It just does not work.\n  In my office in Chicago, almost 90 percent of all of the work we do \nis on immigration. The stories will break your heart. There are people \nwho have come to this country and, for reasons that often cannot be \nexplained, are not in legal status today. As Senator Kennedy said, \napproximately half the undocumented people in America arrived here \nlegally. What happened? They were going to school on a visa and they \ndidn't take the necessary course work to be a full-time student. They \nlost their legal status. They were part-time students. They started \nagain as full-time students, and they are undocumented as a result, or \nthey came and stayed beyond their visas or they came into circumstances \nthat, frankly, created family situations so they could not leave: A \nwoman falls in love with an American citizen, is married, and has \nchildren. Her husband is an American citizen, all her children are \nAmerican citizens, but she is not. She is an undocumented person in \nthis country.\n\n  But let me tell you one story or one group of stories that I think \ndramatizes some of the injustices of the current system that I think \nshould be addressed. A few years ago, Senator Orrin Hatch and I worked \ntogether in a bipartisan effort to pass what is known as the Dream Act. \nSenator Hagel, Senator Lugar, and I are now cosponsoring it on a \nbipartisan basis. It came to my attention because we got a phone call \nfrom a woman in Chicago, a Korean-American woman who works at a dry \ncleaners in Chicago 12 hours a day. She said she had a problem. Her \nproblem was her daughter, who came to the United States at the age of 2 \nand became a musical prodigy. She played the symphony piano by the age \nof 8. She has played with the Chicago Symphony. She is an amazing, \ntalented musician.\n  She was recruited by Julliard School of Music--the best in America--\nto develop her skills as a musician. When she started to fill out the \napplication, she turned to her mother and said: It says here: \nNationality. American, right? And her mother said: No, we never filed \nyour papers. And here she was, a bright future ahead of her, and she \ncalled my office and said: What am I to do? We called the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service and they said: The answer is obvious. She \nhas to go back to Korea.\n  Back to Korea? She had been in this country for 16 years. Through no \nfault of her own, she was not a documented citizen or in legal status. \nShe had fallen through the cracks, one of the 11 million.\n  Let me tell you another story. It is about Diana, who was brought to \nChicago at the age 6 by her family from Mexico. Diana is undocumented. \nShe has lived her entire life in the United States. There is a 50-\npercent dropout rate among undocumented students in America--50 \npercent. She didn't drop out of school; she did the opposite. She \nstayed in school and made the dean's list all through high school. She \ngraduated with a 4.4 average out of 4.0, taking advanced placement \nclasses to pursue her dream of being an architect. She was accepted at \nNorthwestern University and was so excited. She came to learn that \nbecause she was undocumented, she couldn't get financial assistance. \nShe couldn't go to Northwestern. She went to another college. She is \nstill trying to be an architect.\n  Tell me: Is America a better place if those two girls leave or is it \na better place if they stay?\n  The Dream Act gives young people such as that a chance, people who \ncame to the United States, young people, through no decision on their \nown--their parents made the decision. They did the right thing, \nfollowed the rules, didn't break any laws, went to school, were good \nstudents, studied, aspired, and dreamed of the opportunity in this \ncountry, and then learned, to their bitter disappointment, they were \nreaching a point where they could not pursue their education.\n  The Dream Act says this: If you are one of those people, if you have \nbeen here 5 years or more, if you entered the country under the age of \n16, if you are in high school, you have a chance, and the chance is \nthis: Complete high school and then either 2 years in college or a \ncollege degree in the next 6 years, or serve in our military for 2 \nyears, and we will then give you a chance to start a long path toward \ncitizenship. That is important.\n  I can't tell you the people who come up to me in the city of Chicago, \nstudents, for example, who are undocumented, who want to teach. We need \nthem so badly. They want to teach math and science and critical \nlanguages. Yet, being undocumented, they can never be licensed to teach \nin my State of Illinois or virtually any other State.\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\n  Should these young people have a chance? Should they be allowed now \nto become part of America and our future? I think they should. The \nDream Act is part of this immigration reform, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first let me commend Senator Durbin for \nhis leadership on the Dream Act and making sure that it is now a part \nof the bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee. I was a cosponsor \nof that Dream Act, and I support it being a part of the bill.\n  For me, the current debate on immigration strikes very close to home. \nThose words at the base of the Statue of Liberty, ``Give me your tired, \nyour poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free,'' have a \nprofound personal meaning to me.\n  On my wall in my office, I have a picture of the house in which my \nmother was born and raised until she was 20 years of age in the small \ntown of Suha, Slovenia. It is a small house with a dirt floor. Yes, my \nmother was born and raised in a house with a dirt floor until she was \naged 20. Then she got steerage on the SS Argentina and came to America. \nShe was going to land at Ellis Island, but landed in Boston because of \nbad weather. I have a copy of the documentation from when my mother \nlanded here in America, it had her name and where she was from, and \nwhat she owned. She had one suitcase, a train ticket to Des Moines, IA, \nand $7. That is how my mother came to America. When she came, though, \nshe was welcomed into the American community. She got married, \nobviously raised a family. She has since obviously passed away, but she \nbecame a productive citizen, a loyal American who gave a lot back to \nher adopted homeland.\n  I know the current debate has stirred up a lot of passions, but this \nis nothing new. Across the centuries, successive waves of immigrants--\nGermans, Irish, and again on my father's side my great-grandfather, who \nwas an immigrant from the northern part of Ireland; Chinese, Italians, \nGreeks, others--every time they have come here they have aroused strong \nemotions. But in every case, Americans eventually rose above their \neconomic fears and ethnic prejudices. We were true to those Statue of \nLiberty words and, as a result, America has become stronger and richer \nand fairer. We are indeed the envy of the world.\n\n  Today, once again, we are in the midst of a difficult and often \nemotional national debate about immigration. I am optimistic that we \ncan arrive at a bill that addresses legitimate national security and \nlaw enforcement concerns, while also being faithful to our tradition \nand history as a nation of immigrants. I commend the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, for his skill and leadership in \nreporting a bipartisan bill from the Judiciary Committee that takes us \nin the right direction. I want to commend his ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, and Senator Kennedy for his strong work on getting this bill \nthrough and making it a decent, fair, but yet strong bill to protect \nour national security and to protect our law enforcement in this \ncountry.\n  My State of Iowa, I am proud to say, has a long history of welcoming \nnew immigrants. We have a growing immigrant Muslim population from Asia \nand the Middle East. In fact, Cedar Rapids, IA, is home to the oldest \nmosque in America, and we are proud of that. A quarter of a century \nago, responding to the plight of Vietnamese and Laotian boat people, \nformer Governor Robert Ray introduced programs to bring more than \n30,000 of these refugees to our State. Because of his courageous \nhumanitarian leadership, thousands of Iowans opened their homes and \ntheir hearts to these new immigrants.\n  More recently, tens of thousands of immigrants have come to Iowa from \nLatin America and elsewhere. They have come here in search of two \nthings: work and freedom. Work, in order to feed and clothe their \nfamilies; and freedom, to learn and to develop their talents, and to \ngrow. In most cases, they have found work. The Iowa economy is hungry \nfor immigrants who are willing to do jobs that basically are physically \ndemanding, oftentimes dangerous, one example, of course, being the meat \npacking industry.\n  But not all of these new immigrants have found freedom--the freedom \nto learn and to grow and to develop their talents. Earlier this month, \nat United Trinity Methodist Church in Des Moines, I met with a group of \nnew immigrants, an undocumented family. They told me about the \nhardships they face. They live in constant fear. They live in the \nshadows. What do they want? They want to become loyal, contributing \nAmericans, to pursue the American dream, to contribute as my mother \ndid, as my great-grandfather and his descendants did, to building this \ncountry we call America. But, instead, they are living an American \nnightmare of anxiety, exclusion, and exploitation.\n  So it is time for us to find a constructive and positive way to bring \nthese people out of the shadows and into the sunlight. One thing we all \nagree on is that the current immigration system is broken and needs \nreform. It is totally out of sync with today's social and economic \nrealities. It is time to come up with a just and fair immigration \nsystem, one true to our values and our tradition. I know we can come up \nwith a bill that is a win-win for all of us.\n  To that end, we need at least three things: One, we need tough, \nconsistent, effective enforcement of reformed immigration laws. Two, we \nneed to enforce sanctions against employers who hire immigrants \nunauthorized to work. Three, we need a temporary worker program with \ndocumentation that gives immigrants a reasonable path to earning full \nAmerican citizenship. As Senator Kennedy said earlier, we are not \ntalking about amnesty. That would be wrong. We are talking about a \nprocess of earned legalization, giving people who are here a practical \nway to earn citizenship by working, paying taxes, paying a fine, \nlearning English.\n  We need to deal with the reality before us. We have 11 million to 12 \nmillion undocumented people in this country, many of whom--as we \nlistened to Senator Durbin talk about--have lived here for many years, \nand many who came here as young children, as babies. Many of them who \nare here have children. They have other family members who are U.S. \ncitizens. They are contributing to our prosperity. They are making a \nbig contribution to our society. They may be undocumented; they may be \nliving in the shadows; but make no mistake: They are de facto members \nof our American community. They are integrated into the fabric of our \nnational life. They are filling jobs that, in most cases, go unfilled, \nand they are not going away. Frankly, we would face huge problems if \nthey did. As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said recently: ``If you kick \nout 11 and-a-half to 12 million people, it will bring our economy to a \nscreeching halt.''\n  So let us acknowledge the reality. Let's establish a legal framework \nwithin which these immigrants can work and learn English and pass \nsecurity background checks, pay a fine, the penalties that are \nnecessary, and then earn the right to eventually become a U.S. citizen. \nAt the same time, let's not delude ourselves with so-called simple \nsolutions that are unworkable, unaffordable, or just plain mean-\nspirited. For example, the House has passed a bill that calls for \ncriminalizing undocumented immigrants, rounding them up and deporting \nthem, and charging with crimes anyone who might help, including clergy \nand church members.\n  Does anyone seriously believe we can round up 11 million to 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants? Who is going to do it? Are we going to \nspend the $140 billion it would take to hire a vast army of agents to \ndo this? And even if it were physically possible to round up 12 million \npeople, how do you do it humanely? For example, would we be willing to \nbreak up families? Would we deport mothers and fathers but allow their \nU.S. citizen children to remain here? Would we deport an undocumented \nimmigrant who is here, married, has children? Would she or he take the \nchildren with them, or leave them here? What is going to happen to all \nthese people? How do you deal with this humanely?\n  Others advocate we spend tens of millions of dollars to build a 700-\nmile wall, a fence, across our southern border. That is nonsense. Did \nthe Great Wall of China work? Maybe for a month or two. Think of the \nBerlin Wall. Just remember the Berlin Wall. And think about a wall \nbetween the United States\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nand Mexico. Now we are going to build a wall across the Canadian \nborder, too? Let's get serious. This is nonsense, absolutely nonsense.\n  And does anyone want to talk about those who come to the U.S. and \noverstay their visas? There are an estimated 4 million people in the \nUnited States who have overstayed their visas. They get visas, they are \nhere, they are working. They overstay their visa and do not go back to \ntheir home countries; they decide to stay here illegally.\n  It is time to acknowledge why immigrants continue to come across our \nborder, making enormous sacrifices, risking their lives. They are \ncoming for economic opportunity to better themselves and to reunite, a \nlot of times, with their families. In other words, they are coming for \nexactly the same reasons that my mother came to America--to get \nreunited with family members who were here, to work, to raise a family, \nto better her life and to better the lives of her children. The \ndifference is they are coming now as undocumented because we failed to \ncreate a documented, legal avenue for our economy to get the workers we \nneed. It is not their fault, it is our fault--because we have not \ndesigned a good immigration system.\n\n  We have heard it said that undocumented immigrants drive down wages \nfor American citizens at the low end of the economic scale. According \nto this argument, undocumented immigrants are so desperate to work for \nthe minimum wage or less, they will tolerate harsh, unsafe working \nconditions. Unfortunately, there is a lot of truth to that argument. So \nwhat is the answer, kick them out? No. The answer is to bring them out \nof the shadows. If they are given documentation and legal status, then \nemployers will have to pay them a decent wage and treat them fairly. \nThis will raise the floor. It will raise wages at the bottom rungs of \nthe ladder, and this will benefit all American workers.\n  There is another huge cost and danger to allowing the status quo to \ncontinue. The current system has driven undocumented workers deep \nunderground. We are not able to document, track, or control who is \nwithin our borders. This is the ideal environment for al-Qaida and \nothers who aim to penetrate our society. Because of our preoccupation \nwith chasing down undocumented immigrants, we are diverting scarce \nresources from addressing the real threats to our national security, \nand this needs to change. Instead, we are tracking down gardeners and \ndishwashers, let's focus on those who really want to do us harm.\n  Throughout America's history, the subject of immigration has lent \nitself to fearmongering, demagoguery, and simplistic so-called \nsolutions. But to our credit--and to America's great social and \neconomic benefit--we have listened to the better angels of our nature. \nWe have refused to slam the door. We have been true to our tradition as \na nation of immigrants.\n  Today, once again, we are challenged to rise above fear and prejudice \nand to do the right thing. Legally or illegally, immigrants will \ncontinue to come to America as they have for four centuries. We need \nsmart immigration reform, reform that will protect our borders, crack \ndown on employers who hire those who are unauthorized to work, while \ncreating a guest worker program that gives immigrants the opportunity \nto earn legalization and to have family reunification.\n  In closing, I commend the Judiciary Committee for sending to the \nfloor a bipartisan bill that would accomplish these important things. \nIt would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so we know \nwho they are, where they live, where they are from, and so we can \nidentify any who could be a threat to our homeland security. It would \nallow earned legalization for those who pass security background \nchecks.\n  It is going to take more than 10 years for an undocumented immigrant \nto demonstrate that he or she is a person of good moral standing, is \npaying taxes, learning English, and has paid the necessary fines. These \npeople will not jump ahead of anyone who is already in line for \ncitizenship. I want to stress that point. There is a thought: Oh, they \nwill get in front of everybody. That is not true, not under the bill \nfrom the Judiciary Committee. They would work 6 years before they could \napply for legal permanent residency or green card status, and after \nthat they would work for another 5 years before they could apply for \ncitizenship. During this process, they would have to pay a fine, and \nwith those fines would help pay for this system.\n  Last, we don't need a wall around our borders. We can use unmanned \naerial vehicles, sensors, guard posts. We can do this without building \na wall, and we can protect our borders much better than we are doing \nnow. That is what is in the Judiciary bill. It is an excellent starting \npoint.\n  Again, I commend Senator Specter and the committee. They have done a \ngreat service to the Senate and to our country. I hope this Senate will \ndo the right thing in passing that bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2490-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2962\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the application of the gift rule to lobbyists)\n\n       On page 8, after line 16, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) For purposes of this subclause, the term \n     `registered lobbyist' means any person or entity required to \n     register pursuant to section 4(a) of the Lobbying Disclosure \n     Act, and any employee of such registrant as defined in \n     section 3(5) of that Act.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my friend from \nConnecticut and also the Senator from Pennsylvania for their amendment \non meals that was offered before the recess, and also the Senator from \nMississippi, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for accepting it. If \nwe are going to have a lobbyist gift ban, it clearly has to include \nmeals. The provision in the underlying bill that allowed for Senators \nand staff to continue dining at the expense of lobbyists as long as \nthose meals are disclosed on the Senator's Web site would have been an \nadministrative nightmare and also created a subculture of lawbreaking \njust as, unfortunately, the $50 limit has done.\n  The way we avoid that is just to ban meals from lobbyists, as we have \nbanned gifts in the underlying bill.\n  I am obviously not going to stand here and say that any Senator's \nvote can be purchased for a free meal or a ticket to a football game. \nBut I do not think anyone can say that all lobbyists are buying these \nmeals out of the goodness of their heart. At this point, no reform bill \nis going to be credible that does not contain a strict lobbyist gift \nban. And no one has ever explained to me why Members of Congress need \nto be allowed to accept free meals, tickets, or any other gift from a \nlobbyist. If you really want to have dinner with a lobbyist, no one is \nsaying that you cannot. Just take out your wallet and pay your own way. \nI can tell my colleagues from personal experience that you will survive \njust fine under a no-gifts policy. The Wisconsin Legislature has had \nsuch a policy for some 30 years and I brought it here with me to \nWashington. And I certainly have not gone hungry.\n  We ought to just stop the practice of eating out at the expense of \nothers. It is not necessary. It looks bad. It leads to abuses. So I \nsupport the Dodd-\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nSantorum amendment on meals and I am glad that it was adopted.\n  Here is the problem that I seek to address in my amendment. We have \njust said that we want to ban all gifts from lobbyists--tickets, meals, \npresents, everything. But it is a little known fact that the Ethics \nCommittee already has in place an interpretation of the term \n``registered lobbyist'' that narrows it somewhat. That interpretation \nmight make some sense for the prohibitions on lobbyists that are \ncurrently in our rules. But that same interpretation, if it is applied \nto this gifts and meals ban, will create a huge loophole.\n  Here is how it works. As my colleagues know, the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct requires organizations, trade associations, and companies that \nemploy in-house lobbyists to file a single registration. The registrant \nis the organization, and it lists its individual lobbyists on its \nregistration form. For purposes of the gift rules now, the Ethics \nCommittee treats the actual listed lobbyists as registered lobbyists, \nbut not the organization. If you do not believe me, look on page 43 of \nthe Ethics Manual. Here is the language:\n\n       For purposes of applying the special restrictions on \n     lobbyists in the Gifts Rule, an organization employing \n     lobbyists (outside or in-house) to represent solely the \n     interests of the organization or its members will not be \n     considered to be a ``lobbyist.''\n\n  If that interpretation is applied to the gift and meals ban, that \nmeans that the organization can continue to offer gifts and meals to \nSenators and staff.\n  So, for example, a company can give a Senator free tickets to a show \nor a baseball game, as long as a lobbyist doesn't actually offer or \nhandle them. If the lobbyist's secretary makes the call or the \norganization's CEO president, that would be permitted, or a lobbyist \ncan invite a Senator or staffer to dinner, as long as he brings along \nsomeone else from the organization to pick up the tab with the company \ncredit card.\n  Let me read some of the companies and organizations that have \nregistered under the LDA because they have in-house lobbyists. All of \nthe organizations I am about to list, and hundreds more, will be able \nto continue to give gifts unless my amendment is adopted: Chamber of \nCommerce for the U.S.A.; Association of Trial Lawyers of America; \nGeneral Electric Co.; American Medical Association; Northrop Grumman \nCorp.; Edison Electric Institute; AFL-CIO; Verizon Communications Inc.; \nBusiness Roundtable; Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of \nAmerica; National Association of Realtors; ExxonMobil Corp.; SBC \nCommunications Inc.; Boeing Co.; Lockheed Martin; AT Corp.; General \nMotors Corp.; American Association of Retired Persons (AARP); Sprint \nCorp.; Microsoft Corp; American Council of Life Insurance; Pfizer Inc.; \nNational Association of Broadcasters; Citigroup; J.P. Morgan Chase & \nCo.; Securities Industry Association; American Bankers Association; The \nSeniors Coalition; Ford Motor Co.; Merck & Co.; American Bankers \nAssociation; American Farm Bureau Federation; IBM Corp.; National Cable \nand Telecommunications; Association and state affiliates; Eli Lilly and \nCo.; Brown & Williamson Tobacco; American International Group Inc.; \nGeneral Dynamics Corp.; Motorola Inc.; Southern Co.; BellSouth Corp.; \nChevronTexaco; Investment Company Institute; Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline; DaimlerChrysler Corp.; Textron \nInc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; United States Telecom Association; \nIntel Corp.; National Association of Manufacturers; Health Insurance \nAssociation of America; Time Warner; Marathon Oil Corp.; American \nAssociation of Health Plans; Abbott Laboratories; Union Pacific Corp.; \nAmerican Chemistry Council; BP Amoco; Shell Oil Co.; United \nTechnologies Corp.; Mortgage Insurance Companies of America; Honeywell, \nInc.; Qwest Communications International Inc.; Property Casualty \nInsurers Association of America; Aircraft Owners and Pilots \nAssociation; Wyeth; Walt Disney Co.; Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization; Prudential Financial Cos.; Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc.; \nMonsanto Co.; CTIA--The Wireless AssociationTM (formerly the \nCellular Telecom Industry Association); The Bond Market Association; \nAsbestos Study Group; Johnson & Johnson, Inc.; Schering-Plough Corp.; \nProcter & Gamble Co.; American Forest & Paper Association; National \nFederation of Independent Business; American Institute of CPAs; \nRaytheon Co.; Visa USA Inc.; American Airlines; and International Paper \nCo.\n  These are all companies that have registered under the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act because they have inhouse lobbyists. So let me repeat. \nAll of the organizations I just listed, and hundreds more, will be able \nto continue to give gifts, tickets, and meals unless my amendment is \nadopted. By the way, each of the organizations I just listed has \nreported spending between $15 and $200 million on lobbying activities \nbetween 1998 and 2004. So let me make this very clear. If these \ncompanies can still give gifts, we won't have a real lobbyist gift ban. \nWe won't be able to look the American people in the eye and say, ``we \njust banned gifts from lobbyists,'' because we didn't.\n\n  We ought to just stop the practice of eating out at the expense of \nothers. But we need to make sure it's a real ban. My amendment will do \nthat. It simply says that for purposes of the gift ban only, the term \n``registered lobbyist'' means any person or entity who is registered \nunder the LDA and any employee of that entity. Very simple, and very \nfair.\n  Now let me point out one other thing before people get all worried. \nAll of the exceptions in the current gift rule continue to apply to the \nmeals and gift ban. That means it does not impact our colleagues, \nrelatives, personal friendship, widely attended events, food and drink \nof nominal value, etc. So that means that employees of these \norganizations can still have their friends who work on the Hill over \nfor dinner, they can still go out on dates, they can still exchange \nChristmas gifts, they can still get a housewarming gift from a \nneighbor. Organizations can still host receptions and Members and staff \ncan attend and have a bit to eat. My amendment simply makes sure that \norganizations that are registered under the LDA can't get around the \ngift ban by having people other than their lobbyists offer tickets or \nmeals or other gifts.\n  I say this with great respect for the Senators who have worked so \nhard in putting this bill together.\n  If we are serious about changing the rule on gifts and meals, we have \nto take the interpretation seriously. My amendment makes it clear that \nwe mean what we say. The era of the free lunch will be over. For real. \nAs it should be. If it is not adopted, there is no conclusion to be \ndrawn but that we are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the \nAmerican people. I don't want that to be the story coming out of this \ndebate. I hope the managers will accept this amendment and, if not, I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I rise in opposition to the amendment. I have \nworked in this area to make sure that we did some things that were \nnecessary and realistic. I think we should make it clear about gifts. \nWe do that in this legislation. We can't accept gifts.\n  I am offended at the very idea that some meal is going to cause me to \nvote one way or the other. But it suits me fine. As I have said on this \nfloor, I would be happy not to ever have to go to another luncheon or \ndinner. I would just as soon go home and order a Big Mac. But I think \nthis goes a step further which is problematic in a way that I don't \nbelieve the American people expect us to do or that we would want to \ndo.\n  Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, individuals who lobby on \nbehalf of other entities must register as a lobbyist. In addition, \norganizations such as corporations, trade associations, or a labor \nunion that employs in-house lobbyists or outside lobbying firms are \nrequired to register under the act.\n  However, for purposes of applying the restrictions that are imposed \non lobbyists under our gift rule, an organization that employs \nlobbyists to represent organizations or its members' interests is not \nconsidered to be a lobbyist.\n  Thus, for example, the AFL-CIO employs lobbyists. But for purposes of \nthe Senate gift rule, the AFL-CIO can sponsor a congressional \nfactfinding trip whereas if the AFL-CIO employed an outside lobbying \nfirm, the lobbying firm cannot sponsor such a trip.\n  Under the proposed amendment, for the purposes of our new rule \nbanning\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\ngifts and meals, the employees of the AFL-CIO would all be considered \nto be registered lobbyists. Janitors at the AFL-CIO would all be \nconsidered registered lobbyists. The janitors at the AFL-CIO \nheadquarters, the secretaries in the organization, all would be deemed \nto be registered lobbyists.\n  I am the son of a shipyard worker pipefitter union member. How far \nwould this extend? Would you not be able to go to a meal with a \nsupervisor of a pipe department because they have a lobbyist, not to \nmention the CEO?\n  So this is not just about corporate America. It is also about union \nmember trade associations and other organizations. We are trying to \ndeal with how we relate to lobbyists, but now we are going to extend it \nway beyond. You will not be able to go to a meal with the chairman of \nthe board of a sardine manufacturing plant. And why not, when you are \nin your State and you have an opportunity to go meet with workers and \nsit down with them? Are we going to be able to have a cup of coffee and \na donut?\n  I think we are beginning to go from the sublime to the ridiculous. It \ncould go on and on.\n  I am a big fan of Domino's pizza and McDonald's and Big Macs. I love \nthem. They are bad for you, but they are wonderful.\n  What about the kids working behind the counter? Would they be \nconsidered registered lobbyists because McDonald's has lobbyists? I \nassume they do. I don't think I have ever met one.\n  By the way, in the case of McDonald's, there are franchises. They own \nall the McDonald's in the Mississippi Delta, or they might own 10 or \n12. Would I not be able to go to lunch with my longtime friend in the \nMississippi Delta who owns those 12 McDonald's in the delta? Not only \nwould I miss an opportunity to be with a friend, I would not have an \nopportunity to understand the challenges and difficulties of running a \nsmall business, or running a restaurant in these towns, problems with \ncrime, workers' problems, workers' needs, the lack of insurance for \nentry-level employees.\n  How are we supposed to know all of this stuff? Like manna from \nheaven? We have to stay in touch with reality in order to serve here. \nWe have turned ourselves into not citizen legislators but professional \nSenators in this room divorced of any opportunity to hear what people \nhave to say. It is OK to talk to them so long as we don't have anything \nto eat. I think we are going a step too far.\n  Every company in the Fortune 1000 employs a lobbyist, either a \nprivate firm or an in-house lobbyist. Under this amendment, every \nperson who works for Exxon, Wal-Mart, Home Depot--not exactly dangerous \nplaces--and countless other businesses that employ lobbyists in \nWashington would be considered registered lobbyists.\n  I honestly cannot believe that we want to pass an amendment that \nwants to turn every employee not only in corporate America but in \nmanagement and labor and other associations into registered lobbyists. \nBut I think that is what the effect of this would be.\n  If the Senator wants to ban the CEO and chairman of the board of the \ncompany from paying for a meal, or the head of a labor union, do that \nspecifically. But this is so broadly developed I think it goes way \nbeyond that.\n  I think we would be well advised not to accept this amendment. I \nreluctantly went along with accepting the amendment earlier about \ndealing with lobbyists, but that is OK. I am willing to do things that \nwould prohibit improper conduct, or even the appearance of it, but I \nthink this is a leap way too far.\n  I hope we would not accept this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Mississippi. This reminds me of the experience in 1994 \nwhen there was stiff resistance to the idea of having a gift ban in the \nSenate. We achieved a significant victory by having at least a $50 \nlimit which has been, unfortunately, abused to this day.\n  I would like, at this time, to get this done in a way that does not \ncause us to have to come back. The point I make to my friend from \nMississippi is that this is a real loophole. I am not trying to find \nsome esoterical problem. It is a real loophole if employees of large \ncompanies, where the companies are registered as lobbyists, if they are \nable to buy meals. It undercuts the whole idea that we are prohibiting \nmeals by lobbyists and their employees.\n  I make two responses. First, this does not apply to companies that \nare not registered as lobbyists. For example, if the Senator from \nMississippi were to have lunch with, say, a banker in Jackson, MS, \nwhose company bank does not have a lobbyist, this does not affect that \nsituation. Let's not exaggerate how far it goes.\n  What is more important, I don't understand the premise. The Senator \nsaid he would not be able to have lunch or have dinner with a CEO. Why \nnot? All you have to do is split the bill. It is that simple. Maybe it \nis a different cultural tradition, but in Wisconsin if you go to lunch \nwith someone, or dinner, more times than not, you split the bill. It \nseems to me that Senators know how to do that. It is not about the \nperson trying to buy you a meal. It is just a good thing for us to do.\n  Whether this is practical or impractical, I say this again, we have \nhad this rule in Wisconsin for over 30 years for our State legislature. \nIt has worked just fine. Sometimes we kid around about it, the cup of \ncoffee situation, but it is a good, clean rule. And people understand, \nwhen you are a legislator in Wisconsin, you pay your own way. That is \nall there is to it. It is that simple.\n  I don't want to prohibit the Senator from Mississippi or anyone else \nfrom socializing with whomever he wants, and I certainly enjoy sharing \ndinner with friends. Sometimes, they are lobbyists. There is no \nproblem, though, with paying your own way.\n  If we don't do this, if we do not adopt this amendment, we are stuck \nwith a big loophole. I think the fears about this being difficult to \nadminister are exaggerated.\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 13\\1/2\\ \nminutes; the Senator from Wisconsin has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I be informed when I have consumed 10 \nminutes. I see my friend from Maine is here. She would like 2 or 3 \nminutes, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Wisconsin, he and I \nhave worked together on a lot of issues. I consider him one of my best \nfriends in this institution. I appreciate his kind remarks about the \nadoption of the Dodd-Santorum amendment, about 3 weeks ago now, when \nour joint amendment provided a total ban on meals coming from \nlobbyists.\n  I never could keep straight exactly what the numbers were, for \nexample, how much you could take at lunch and how much you could take \nat dinner. We decided we would require some bright line tests. Rather \nthan going through and setting a dollar amount--people probably forget \nthe number anyway and put themselves in jeopardy of being found guilty \nof something, unintentionally--we offered and passed a total ban on \nmeals, without exceptions.\n  So meals from lobbyists are now banned when this legislation becomes \nlaw. If you violate the ban provision, the fine is a maximum of \n$100,000 under the legislation we are adopting.\n  The concern I have about my colleague from Wisconsin and his \namendment is that it is broader and includes a much larger audience. \nThis bill is about lobbyists. You become a lobbyist through \nregistration under the Lobby Disclosure Act. It is not a self-selecting \nprocess where I decide tomorrow I'm a lobbyist. In fact, you have to \nregister and go through a process to become a lobbyist.\n  We have been very concerned for obvious reasons, given the recent \npast history, of what happens when lobbyists engage in certain \nactivities, some lawful and some unlawful, and the perception of \nwhether Members of this institution have somehow compromised themselves \nin those dealings. We have been determined to try and draw that bright \nline. My concern is that we begin to blur that line because now we are \ngoing to be declaring de facto--not\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nby law, not because they have registered--that virtually hundreds of \nthousands of people have become lobbyists. They will have no idea they \nhave become one, but they have become one under this amendment, \nsubjecting themselves, potentially, to a $100,000 fine for purchasing a \nmeal for a Member of Congress. As a practical matter, that is what will \nhappen here.\n  If your organization hires a lobbyist, and most do--I presume even \nthe bank in Mississippi has a lobbyist; today, almost every major \ninstitution, financial or otherwise, has someone who is representing \ntheir interests--the lobbyists have to register if they come to the \nSenate and talk to us. Therefore, they become not only de facto, but de \njure lobbyist because they have had to register to do so. If you are an \nemployee of that bank, however, and you live next door to someone, you \nare a longstanding friend, and my colleague from Wisconsin is correct \nin this regard, if a longstanding friend of my friend from Mississippi \ntook him to lunch, that would be an exception to the rule. However, \nthat longstanding friendship is subject, obviously, to some analysis as \nto how long the friendship is. That could pose this difficulty.\n  I don't think we want to extend this, in my view, and my colleagues \nmay decide when we vote on this and reach a different conclusion, to \ndealing with this legislation on lobbyists and their relationship to \nMembers of Congress, by expanding the universal definition of what is a \nlobbyist, to virtually every other employee of an organization that \nhires a lobbyist to represent their interest. This type of expansion \ngoes too far and is overly broad.\n  Let me tell you one fact situation that worries me. I had hoped maybe \nmy colleague might provide for some legislative language to close a \npotential loophole that I think could exist under the present \ncircumstance. That fact situation is the following. The lobbyist \ninvites the secretary to go out to have lunch with a Member of \nCongress. The secretary picks up the tab. The lobbyist is there. The \nlobbyist may have provided money to the secretary to provide lunch. \nNow, that would be an abuse of what Congress intended here because it \nthen would be doing indirectly what cannot be done directly, in a \nsense, bringing someone who is not a lobbyist to lunch. The lobbyist is \nat the lunch, they buy the meal, but at least ostensibly the person who \nactually bought the lunch was not the lobbyist.\n  If there was some situation we could close that loophole, that would \nbe abuse of what we are trying to do. But to extend broadly that every \nemployee of every organization that hires a lobbyist would then become \na lobbyist, in effect, for the consideration of this legislation, seems \nto me to go way beyond what we are intending to accomplish in this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I made the case to my colleagues, reform is not a static \nevent. It is an organic event. It grows over time. What we consider to \nbe reform today or not reform today, may down the road be the case. I \nhave been involved in every virtual effort on reform here for the last \n25 years. Twenty-five years ago what was considered appropriate \nbehavior, that no one had difficulty with, today we would consider very \ninappropriate behavior. And 5 years or 10 years down the road, maybe we \nwill have different standards.\n  As of today, I urge my colleagues, as of today, on this bill, dealing \nwith registered lobbyists, we have banned meals. That is a major step \nfor this institution to take. Cut it out altogether. If you are a \nregistered lobbyist, that is it, no more meals.\n  Let me also say, there is nothing in this legislation which permits \nany Member of Congress from doing that which they want to do. If a \nMember of Congress, a Member of this institution does not want to \naccept a meal from anyone, there is nothing in law which prohibits a \nMember from doing that. If a Member feels as though somehow it is wrong \nto be doing it, I strongly suggest that Member not do it. But it seems \nto me to extend this lobbying bill to people who have no intention of \never being a lobbyist, never see themselves in that regard, have \nrelationships, as my colleague from Mississippi has pointed out in our \nown States, with delegations, with staff, with others, these have \noccurred hundreds and hundreds of times when Members are back in their \nown areas--not longstanding friends, not relatives, people they do not \nknow that well at all but sit down under a variety of different \ncircumstances, including home settings, picnics, barbecues, other \nthings, where you may find yourself in violation of this law.\n  I don't think we want to do that. That goes a step further than what \nwe should be trying to accomplish with this legislation. I don't want \nto have to say to my constituents, you are potentially guilty of a \nviolation of law, subjected to $100,000 fine if you fall into this \ncategory, or to one of our colleagues as well.\n  We have done a good job, in my view, on this meals provision. It is a \nstrong line. It is a bright line. There is no longer any question of \nwhether it is a $10 meal or a $50 meal or a $100 meal; you cannot \naccept a meal from a lobbyist. That is it. If you do, you are \npotentially in violation of Federal law, or certainly civil penalties. \nThat is where the bright line, in my view, ought to exist.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Wisconsin. He has been a \nchampion of reform efforts since the day he arrived. I respect him for \nit immensely. But in this one, we are taking it a step further than I \nbelieve we should go at this juncture.\n  I urge my colleagues to either table this amendment or reject it, \ndepending on what the motion will be when the matter comes for a vote.\n  My respect for him is unlimited. I thank him for his thoughts in this \nregard but I urge the rejection of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I express my gratitude not only for the \nSenator's kind remarks to the Senator from Connecticut but I am pretty \nsure the McCain-Feingold effort that we fought for, for 8 years, would \nnot have succeeded if not for the brilliant leadership of the Senator \nas manager on the floor, for which I am always grateful and also for \nhis friendship.\n  I pursue the example that the Senator raised in a constructive way. \nIn the scenario the Senator raised where the secretary would come with \nlobbyists, what is the Senator's thought about how she would be paying \nfor that? Would she be paying for that with the company credit card, \nfor example?\n  Mr. DODD. Again----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Or with a personal?\n  Mr. DODD. Under his amendment, that would be a banned activity.\n  Putting aside whether she showed up with a lobbyist--if she shows up, \nand you go out and have lunch, and she pays for it with the company \ncredit card--under the amendment before the Senate, that would be a \nviolation. She could be fined $100,000.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. And does the Senator agree, under your current \namendment, that the secretary would be able to use the company credit \ncard to pay for it under the amendment we have agreed to?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. If she is not a lobbyist and she takes you \nto lunch and she decides that is how she is paying for it, she is not a \nregistered lobbyist, she is not in violation of the law in the \namendment we agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On this point--obviously, it may not be a secretary or \na CEO of a company; it could be some other employee--would the Senator \nat least consider whether we should take the step of prohibiting the \nuse of company resources or company credit cards? In other words, I \nthink it should be broader. You have raised some concerns about that. \nWhat about allowing personal resources to be used but not company \nresources?\n\n  Mr. DODD. I would certainly consider it.\n  The point I make, about the goal of this bill--the Senator and I have \ntalked about this at great length--is the bill should be narrowly \ntailored to registered lobbyists and their relationships to Members of \nCongress and senior staff.\n  My concern under this bill, is that by expanding that definition of a \n``lobbyist'' to include anyone who would use resources that were not \ntheir own, we are opening up a universe and making the legislation \noverly broad. I don't\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\nthink we want to go that far at this particular juncture. That is my \nown sense of matters.\n  It turns virtually everyone who works for any of these associations, \nlabor unions, trade association, a small business, a large corporation, \ninto a de-facto lobbyist. I think the opening up of a universe of that \nsize based on whether the lunch was paid for by a company credit card \nor their personal credit card at that particular time, goes too far.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think the Senator sees where I am going with this. I \nthink the Ethics Committee and others will have to be very reasonable \ninterpreters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has used 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will have him respond on my time.\n  The situation is that you are raising situations with personal \nfriends, and in those situations I don't disagree, I don't think there \nwould be a problem. I think the exception would be properly \ninterpreted.\n  I am asking the Senator to at least perhaps consider whether we \nreally want the kind of scenario that the Senator posits, where a \ncompany basically lines up people to come in and act as the person that \nuses the company credit card. It seems to me we have an opportunity to \nfix something here, not go as far as I want to go but at least prevent \nthe use of company resources and at the same time avoid the possibility \nof the true personal friendship situation from being affected.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I cited that example, and I \nhope I did not invite those out there who may decide to use this as a \nloophole.\n  If this becomes a problem, we ought to revisit the issue and somehow \nprohibit it because that is abusing the intent of the legislation.\n  It seems to me to pass legislation which would turn virtually \nmillions of people--when you start talking about the number of people \nwho can be affected by this--into lobbyists, per se, on the abject \npossibility that someone may abuse this down the road goes to far.\n  It goes further than I would at this juncture. In time, if we see \nthose who have engaged in this abuse have carved another loophole, I am \nprepared to come back and deal with that fact situation.\n  It is a fact situation that worries me. I say that to my colleagues. \nI am not unconcerned about it, but I am not so concerned about it at \nthis juncture that I am willing to put everyone else--the millions of \nothers who would not think about that, nor would they do that--in \nharm's way. That is my concern, putting innocent people, potentially, \nin harm's way. I do not think our intentions here, as Members, ought to \nbe that.\n  We are dealing with lobbyists. We are dealing with registered \nlobbyists. They have to go through certain procedures to achieve that \nstatus. Once they have achieved that status, there is a concern. We are \ntrying to deal with that problem. Taking people who go way beyond that \ndefinition, it seems to me, is a step that at least I do not want to go \nthat far.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, obviously, not only do I respect what \nthe Senator from Connecticut is doing, but I know his intentions are \nabsolutely to have the strongest possible bill we can have.\n  What I am trying to do, as strongly as I feel about this issue--\nbecause, again, Wisconsin has had this system, and it has worked just \nfine. So based on my own personal experience, this is not some kind of \na crazy system. Nonetheless, what I am trying to get at is a way that \nwe could have a rule, that even if somebody is technically considered a \nlobbyist--or we could do it some other way--they just could not use \ncompany resources to purchase the meal. That seems to me to be a very \nreasonable step.\n  When somebody goes out to lunch or dinner with somebody, it is one \nthing if they buy a friend or even someone they just met a meal, it is \nanother thing when they are using that company credit card. So \nobviously I am interested in the amendment I have offered, but I would \nask the Senator to think about whether what I am saying is an attempt \nto come to some kind of a reasonable agreement that actually addresses \nthe hypothetical that he has raised.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Three minutes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time, except for the \nfinal 15 seconds, to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my admiration for the \nSenator from Wisconsin. He is a champion of good government. I worked \nvery closely with him on the McCain-Feingold bill, and I think the \nworld of him.\n  I know the intent of his amendment is admirable, but I do not think \nit is workable. It is far too sweeping, and it will lead to all sorts \nof problems. There are literally millions of Americans who work for LDA \nregistrants. For example, I would imagine that nearly every employee of \na Fortune 500 company fits in that category. Many of those employees \nhave absolutely no responsibility for the lobbying activities of their \ncompanies. They probably have no idea their company, their employer, is \nan LDA registrant.\n  That is why I do not think this is workable. I think it will create \nall sorts of inadvertent violations of this important law. What we \nwould be doing, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, is \ntreating rank-and-file employees as if they were registered lobbyists. \nThat does not make sense.\n  The fact is, a lot of business in this country is done over lunch, an \ninformal lunch. I have lunch occasionally with the union presidents \nfrom one of my shipyards. Is that all of a sudden going to become an \noffense under this proposal because the shipyard employs a lobbyist in \nWashington?\n  I think we need to think more thoroughly about the implications of \nthis amendment. Its sweep is enormous. It brings millions of rank-and-\nfile employees into the jurisdiction of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. I \ndo not think that is addressing any problem.\n  Now, I do think it is important we strengthen this bill to make very \nclear that registered lobbyists cannot buy meals for Members of \nCongress. I support that reform. But let's have a sensible bill.\n  I do rise in opposition to the amendment from my good friend from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have had a good debate. I know \nthe intent of the amendment's sponsor is an honest one, but I really \nthink we are going down a trail we should not be. And I do not see how \nyou can start parsing it back away from it. So I would move to table \nthe amendment at this point and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin still has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right. At the appropriate time I will move to table and \nwill ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do not know if I will use the whole time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have such regard for the Senator from \nMaine that I would consider an exception for any lobster in Maine \nbecause she and I have shared lobster in Maine, and that is a very \nspecial thing I think everyone would accept.\n  My admiration for this Senator from Maine on these issues is truly \nboundless. She is the one who, somehow, we convinced to join us very \nearly on McCain-Feingold. And just like I said about Senator Dodd, if \nnot for Senator Collins, there is no way this major reform would have \never passed. So I am talking to some of the people who truly\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nhave been reformers in Congress over the years, some of them much \nlonger than I have been. And I say all of this with respect.\n  Let me say this. We know, because some of us have been working on \nthis for some time, that these opportunities for reform do not come up \nevery year. They tend to come up when something bad happens, whether it \nbe the concerns about the 1996 campaign finance violations or the \nAbramoff scandal. It is not like we are going to have a chance to do \nthis next year because that is not the way this place works. And, \nfrankly, there are weightier matters that face this country.\n  But I am warning my colleagues, this is a chance to not have another \nembarrassing loophole. If we do not do what I am suggesting here, we \nare going to be embarrassed. There are going to be meals arranged--not \nthe kind of scenario Senator Dodd suggested: an innocent situation but \na gaming of this meal ban to allow expensive meals to be bought by \npeople who work for some of the companies I have listed.\n  I do not think people are going to feel good about that. I think it \ncould raise some of the very things we talked about in terms of the \nwhole Abramoff scandal that led to this. I think we are missing an \nimportant opportunity to make sure this bill passes the test with the \nAmerican people. So again, with respect, I offer this amendment to make \nsure this amendment works.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I have been listening to the debate in my office, and I understand \nthe concern the leadership is expressing. It seems to me it boils down \nto an inadvertent concern. But, folks, I think the Senator from \nWisconsin has a point. I have had it as my practice since I have been \nin the Senate--and I don't think it is so hard--that when you sit down \nand have a meal, to just split the bill or you pay for it. I don't get \nthat.\n  Now, I am going to vote with the Senator. I expect he is going to \nlose on a tabling motion. But maybe there is a way he can come back and \ntighten up this inadvertent piece. Because I do understand. I have been \nin a position where I have sat with someone, told them I cannot let \nthem buy my lunch. They go ahead--and it is a friend or somebody who I \nhave known for a while--and I found out later they paid with a company \ncredit card. They told me they were.\n  Now, I know that is an exception. I know because the person is a \nfriend, it would get me out anyway of the exception under this rule. \nBut the point I am making is, I can picture someone saying ``Don't \nworry. I am taking care of my share,'' and it is a company credit card. \nIf that is the worry, there ought to be a way to deal with that.\n  But I say, with due respect--there is nobody I am closer to and think \nhas more wisdom than the Senator from Connecticut--but this one seems \npretty simple to me. If someone buys you lunch, buys you dinner, buys \nyou breakfast, you can say: Hey, I want half the bill.\n  I am going to support the Senator. But maybe if it loses, there is a \nway to come back at it a different way. I don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from \nDelaware for his support and his ideas on this issue because he \nobviously knows what he is talking about, having been a Member of this \nbody for a very long time.\n  I think, obviously, I will try to find some other way to do this. But \nhe has stated the key point. This is not hard to do. This is what we \nhave done in Wisconsin for decades. It is very simple to pay your own \nway. I do not know what it is, but I cannot understand what the problem \nis with having that kind of a clear prohibition. I think we will all be \nbetter off.\n  Mr. President, has the other side yielded their time? Has their time \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, has all time been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, we \nwent through these numbers and procedures rather quickly. I would tell \nour colleagues that there were some very good ideas in these \namendments. This is not a rejection of some of the concepts and ideas \nbut, rather, under cloture we have to stick with the germaneness \ncriteria.\n  If we started making exceptions, then this could have become an \nendless debate. It was painful in some cases because I substantively \nagreed with a number of these amendments. But the problem occurs, if we \nget into that process, we could be here for days trying to resolve \nthese matters. We ended up following the rule saying if an amendment is \nnot germane, it will have to fall.\n  Again I emphasize, this is not an indictment or criticism of the \nsubstance of some of these amendments but, rather, under the procedures \nwe are operating, we cannot begin accepting some and rejecting others.\n  I thank my colleagues for offering these amendments. I presume we \nwill see these amendments again under different circumstances where it \nwill be appropriate to consider them. We have no other recourse but to \napply rule XXII and ask the amendment be ruled out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2930, 2960, 2963, 2970, and 3182) were agreed.\n  The amendments, as modified, were agreed to as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2961, as modified\n\n       On page 24, after line 22, insert the following:\n       ``(8) for each client, immediately after listing the \n     client, an identification of whether the client is a public \n     entity, including a State or local government or a \n     department, agency, special purpose district, or other \n     instrumentality controlled by a State or local government, or \n     a private entity.''.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3181, as modified\n\n       On page 50, strike lines 8 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) Final report.--Five years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress a final \n     report containing information described in subsection (a).\n\n  The technical amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2979\n\n             (Purpose: To clarify disclosure requirements)\n\n       On page 22, lines 12 through 14, strike ``the registrant or \n     employee listed as a lobbyist provided, or directed or \n     arranged to be provided,'' and insert ``the registrant \n     provided, or directed or arranged to be provided, or the \n     employee listed as a lobbyist directed or arranged to be \n     provided,''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3184\n\n                (Purpose: To make a technical amendment)\n\n       On page 6, lines 13 and 14, strike ``Enrolling Clerks of \n     the Senate and'' and insert ``Clerk of the''.\n       On page 6, line 16, strike ``and establish''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3185\n\n(Purpose: To clarify that lobbying contacts for Congressional staff do \nnot include seeking lobbying disclosure compliance information from the \n Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate)\n\n       On page 39, line 17, after ``employed.'' insert ``This \n     subparagraph shall not apply to contacts with staff of the \n     Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives regarding compliance with lobbying disclosure \n     requirements under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3186\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a technical amendment)\n\n       On page 44, line 18, strike ``503'' and insert ``263''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3187\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a technical amendment)\n\n       On page 40, after line 2, insert the following:\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (b) \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3188\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a technical amendment)\n\n       On page 27, lines 21 through 23, strike ``, in addition to \n     any'' and all that follows through ``House of \n     Representatives.'' and insert ``.

Mr. President, I opposed the Ensign amendment on earmarks \nbecause I believe that it would have done more to hide earmarks than to \nexpose them. Under the bill before the Senate, an earmark is defined as \na provision, that specifies a non-Federal entity to receive assistance \nand the amount of that assistance. The Ensign amendment would have \nrevised the language to include assistance provided to any entity, \nwhether Federal or non-Federal. Every item of discretionary spending is \ndirected to some entity. Most is directed to Federal entities, such as \nfunding provided to the Department of Justice, the Department of State, \nor the Department of Defense, all of which are Federal entities. As I \nread the Ensign amendment, it would have categorized every item of \nFederal discretionary spending as an earmark. That would make the term \nmeaningless. It would also hide the real earmarks in a huge list of \nroutine funding provisions that none of us consider to be earmarks. The \namendment is simply too broadly drawn, and that is why I opposed it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I filed an amendment to the lobbying reform \nbill, S. 2349, on March 7. My amendment is the honest services \namendment, No. 2924.\n  It is disappointing that there will not be an opportunity to offer my \namendment--or to have it considered by the Senate--because cloture has \nbeen invoked and the strict rules governing amendments postcloture \nprevent me from offering this amendment.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to articulate more clearly the line \nthat cannot be crossed with respect to links between special favors and \ngifts and official acts, without incurring criminal liability. My \namendment would have offered an important and needed new dimension to \nthe lobbying reform bill. Ironically, because my amendment offers a new \nelement to the lobbying reform debate, it is now out of order.\n  It was only with the indictments of Jack Abramoff, Michael Scanlon, \nand Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham that Congress took note of the serious \nethics scandal that has grown over the last years. If we are serious \nabout restoring public confidence in Congress, we need to do more than \njust reform the lobbying disclosure laws and ethics rules. Congress \nmust send a signal that it will not tolerate this type of public \ncorruption by providing better tools for Federal prosecutors to combat \nit.\n  My amendment would have done exactly that. It would create a better \nlegal framework for combating public corruption than currently exists \nunder our criminal laws. It specifies the crime of honest services \nfraud involving Members of Congress and prohibits defrauding or \ndepriving the American people of the honest services of their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Under my amendment, lobbyists who improperly seek to influence \nlegislation and other official matters by giving expensive gifts, \nlavish entertainment and travel, and inside advice on investments to \nMembers of Congress and their staff would be held criminally liable for \ntheir actions.\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n  My amendment would also prohibit Members of Congress and their staff \nfrom accepting these types of gifts and favors or holding hidden \nfinancial interests in return for being influenced in carrying out \ntheir official duties. Violators are subject to a criminal fine and up \nto 20 years' imprisonment or both.\n  My amendment would strengthen the tools available to Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government. The \namendment makes it possible for Federal prosecutors to bring public \ncorruption cases without all of the hurdles of having to prove bribery \nor of working with the limited and nonspecific honest services fraud \nlanguage in current Federal law.\n  The amendment also provides lobbyists, Members of Congress, and other \nindividuals with much needed notice and clarification as to what kind \nof conduct triggers this criminal offense.\n  In addition, my amendment would authorize $25 million in additional \nFederal funds over each of the next 4 years to give Federal prosecutors \nneeded resources to investigate corruption and to hold lobbyists and \nother individuals accountable for improperly seeking to influence \nlegislation and other official matters.\n  The unfolding corruption investigations involving lobbyist Jack \nAbramoff and MZM demonstrate that unethical conduct by public officials \nhas broad-ranging impact, including the devastating consequence of \nundermining the public's confidence in our Government. Earlier this \nmonth, the Washington Post reported that, as an outgrowth of the \nCunningham investigation, Federal investigators are now looking into \ncontracts awarded by the Pentagon's new intelligence agency--the \nCounterintelligence Field Activity--to MZM, Inc., a company run by \nMitchell J. Wade, who recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe \nMr. Cunningham.\n  The American people expect--and deserve--to be confident that their \nrepresentatives in Congress perform their legislative duties in a \nmanner that is beyond reproach and that is in the public interest.\n  I strongly believe that public service is a public trust and that \nCongress must provide better tools for Federal prosecutors to combat \npublic corruption in our Government. If we are serious about reform and \ncleaning up this scandal, we will do so. I am disappointed that we \nmissed the opportunity this lobbying reform bill provided to bolster \nFederal corruption prosecutors, and I hope we will soon find another \nopportunity to act in the interest of all Americans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the hard work \nof my colleagues in this effort. The chair and ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senators Collins and Lieberman, and the \nchair and ranking member of the Rules Committee, Senators Lott and \nDodd, have worked tirelessly and in a bipartisan manner to bring a bill \nto the floor. I regret, however, that I find it necessary to vote \nagainst final passage of this measure because it simply doesn't do \nenough to address the critical need for comprehensive lobbying reform. \nWe had a golden opportunity to institute real reform and prove to the \nAmerican people that we are not completely oblivious to their concerns. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, we dropped the ball.\n  While it does contain some good provisions to increase lobbyist \ndisclosure and reporting requirements, the bill lacks imperative \nenforcement measures. We can pass all of the rules changes we want in \nthis body, but they are useless unless we back it up with a tough \nenforcement mechanism. I was disappointed that the Collins-Lieberman-\nMcCain amendment to create a Senate Office of Public Integrity was \ndefeated yesterday. That office would have had the ability to \ninvestigate complaints of ethical violations by Senators, staff, \nofficers of this Chamber. Headed by a Director appointed by the \nPresident Pro Tempore of the Senate upon the joint recommendation of \nthe majority and minority leaders, the Office of Public Integrity would \ninvestigate complaints of rules violations filed with or initiated by \nthe office.\n  At a time when the public is questioning our integrity, the Senate \nneeds to more aggressively enforce its own rules. We should do this not \njust by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee \ncurrently undertakes but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in \nany body that regulates itself. By rejecting the creation of a new \noffice with the capacity to conduct and initiate investigations, and a \nperspective uncolored by partisan concerns or collegial relationships, \nwe neglected to address this longstanding structural problem.\n  The proposed Office of Public Integrity would not only have assisted \nin performing existing investigative functions, but would also have \nbeen charged with approving or denying requests for travel by members \nand staff. Rather than prohibit official travel paid for by any entity \nother than the Federal Government, as some have proposed, our proposal \nwould have required that all travel to be precleared. The purpose of \nthis prec1earance was to ensure that the trips serve a legitimate \ngovernmental interest, and are not substantially recreational in \nnature. The Office of Public Integrity would have been an appropriate \nentity to conduct these review, but, sadly, the Senate voted to \nmaintain the status quo.\n  Another critical aspect of reform that is not addressed in this bill \nis the ability of a Member to travel on a corporate jet and only pay \nthe rate of a first-class plane ticket. Because cloture was invoked on \nthis bill yesterday, Senator Santorum and I were prevented from \noffering an amendment that would have required Senators and their \nemployees who use corporate or charter aircraft to pay the fair market \nvalue for that travel.\n  Senator Santorum and I were well aware that our amendment would not \nbe popular with some of our colleagues, but we felt that the time had \ncome for us to fundamentally change the way we do things in this town. \nMuch of the public views our ability to travel on corporate jets, often \naccompanied by lobbyists, while only reimbursing the first-class rate, \nas a huge loophole in the current gift rules. And they are right; it \nis. I have no doubt that the average American would love to fly around \nthe country on a very comfortable corporate-owned aircraft and only be \ncharged the cost of a first-class ticket. It is a pretty good deal we \nhave got going here. We need to face the fact that the time has come to \nend this Congressional perk.\n  There is a public perception that these lobbyist-arranged flights \nunduly influence Members of Congress and serve as a way for lobbyists \nto curry favor with legislators and their aides. We must change that \nperception. There was nothing in our amendment that would have \nprohibited a Member from using corporate aircraft. It simply required \nthat they pay the fair market value of the flight. It was a fair, \nreasonable approach designed to prove to the American public that we \nare serious about reform and would do what is necessary to restore the \npublic's trust. But, again, the Senate chose to maintain the status quo \nby preventing us from offering our amendment.\n  Finally, this bill does not go far enough to rein in the practice of \nearmarking Federal funds in the annual appropriations bills. Together \nwith Senators Coburn, Ensign, Feingold, Kyl, DeMint, Sununu, and \nGraham, I was prepared to offer an amendment that would amend the \nSenate rules to allow points of order to be raised against unauthorized \nappropriations, earmarks, and policy riders in appropriations bills and \nconference reports in an effort to rein in wasteful porkbarrel \nspending. If the point of order were successful, the objectionable \nprovisions would be stricken and the related funding would be reduced \naccordingly. Once again, we were blocked from offering this amendment \nas well.\n  In my judgment, if we are really committed to addressing \ncomprehensive lobbying reform in a meaningful and effective way, we \nneed to include earmark reform provisions in this legislative package. \nThe process is clearly broken when each year Congress continues to \nearmark billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, sometimes with \nlittle or almost no knowledge about the specifics of those earmarks by \nmost of the Members of this body. Sadly, the scandal that has come to \nlight recently concerning the earmarking by one former Member of the \nHouse is a pox\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nnot just on him, but on each of us and the process that we have allowed \nto occur on our watch. The American public deserves better and that is \nwhat my amendment was about.\n  In 1994, there were 4,126 earmarks. In 2005, there were 15,877--an \nincrease of nearly 400 percent. But there was a little good news for \n2006 solely due to the good sense that occurred unexpectedly when the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill was approved with almost no earmarks, an \namazing feat given that there were over 3,000 earmarks the prior year \nfor just that bill. Yet despite this first reduction in 12 years, it \ndoesn't change the fact that the largest number of earmarks have still \noccurred in the last 3 years--2004, 2005, and 2006.\n  Now, let's consider the level of funding associated with those \nearmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion \nin 1994 to $64 billion in fiscal year 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 \npercent from 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks \ndecreased. Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000, and more \nthan tripled in the last 10 years. This is wrong and disgraceful and we \nurgently need to make some changes in this process.\n  We, as Members, owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in \na way that reinforces, rather than diminishes, the public's faith and \nconfidence in Congress. An informed citizenry is essential to a \nthriving democracy. And, a democratic government operates best in the \ndisinfecting light of the public eye. This bill could go so much \nfurther to balance the right of the public to know with its right to \npetition government; the ability of lobbyists to advocate their \nclients' causes with the need for truthful public discourse; and, the \nability of Members to legislate with the imperative that our government \nmust be free from corrupting influences, both real and perceived. We \nmust act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the public's \nconfidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence. We \ncan, and we must, do better than this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when Jack Abramoff pled guilty in \nJanuary, it was clear that the Senate would have to address lobbying \nand ethics reform this year. For a short time, it seemed like \nsignificant reforms had become possible. While this bill contains many \npositive provisions, it falls too far short of what I hoped could be \nachieved for me to support it. So I will vote no.\n  Ethics reform is not something that happens around here every year. \nUnfortunately, it takes a perfect storm to get Congress to address \nthese difficult issues. We had that perfect storm this year with the \nJack Abramoff scandal, which exposed the seamy side of relations \nbetween lobbyists and Members of Congress. We had a chance to take \ndecisive action and really change the way things work in Washington. \nUnfortunately, we have missed that chance.\n  We had the chance to give the American people what they want and \ndeserve--a strong brew of tough lobbying and ethics reforms. Instead, \nall we gave them is weak tea.\n  The lobbying and ethics reform bill before us today includes a number \nof significant provisions, such as improvements in lobbying disclosure. \nBut the Senate missed a once-in-a-decade opportunity to address the \nmost serious ethical problems plaguing Congress. It left open a major \nloophole in the lobbyist gift ban, it retreated from earlier promises \nto get rid of privately funded travel, it allowed Members to continue \ngetting around revolving door restrictions by simply avoiding direct \nconversations with their former colleagues while accepting millions of \ndollars to run a lobbying office, and it refused to even vote on a \nproposal to make Senators pay the charter rate if they want to fly on \ncorporate jets. Perhaps most important, the Senate rejected a \nthoughtful proposal to establish an independent ethics enforcement \noffice.\n  The American people want to have confidence that their elected \nofficials are held to the highest ethical standards. My judgment is \nthat this bill doesn't meet that test.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate failed to live up to its \nresponsibility to keep faith with the American people and change the \nway business is done in Washington. I oppose the lobbying reform bill \nbecause it does not go far enough to effectively change the way \nbusiness is done in Washington.\n  It is not enough to reform the earmarking process. It is not enough \nto ban gifts and meals from lobbyists. It is not enough to rein in pay-\nto-play schemes like the Republican K Street project. Changing the \nrules does no good if we have ineffective enforcement and fundamental \nreform is needed.\n  It is not reform if business as usual continues and the fox is left \nguarding the chicken coop.\n  We need an outside entity, whether a congressional inspector general, \nas I proposed, or an ethics commission, as Senator Obama proposed, or \nan Office of Public Integrity as Senators Collins and Lieberman \nproposed, to police Congressional ethics violations. It is wrong that \nthe Senate failed to establish an Office of Public Integrity. Some of \nmy colleagues apparently are fine with the status quo. I couldn't \ndisagree more strongly. We need an independent entity to ensure Members \nact ethically. We need an independent entity to ensure that no one \nchanges the rules as they play the game as the House tried to do just \nlast year. We need an independent entity to ensure that violations are \ninvestigated and that offenders are punished. Without such an \nindependent entity, this attempt at ethics reform runs the risk of not \nbeing considered real or serious.\n  The fact is that Congress has not been able to effectively \ninvestigate or appropriately punish its Members for ethical violations. \nLast year, House Republican leaders were forced to rescind their \nattempts to change their Ethics Committee rules to protect former House \nmajority leader Tom DeLay from further ethics investigations. The House \nEthics Committee never sanctioned Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, and \nneither the House nor the Senate Ethics Committees has opened an \ninvestigation into the Jack Abramoff scandal. We can tinker with \ndisclosure and gift rules all we want, but until we get tough on \nenforcement, no significant change will happen.\n  A few weeks ago, former Representative ``Duke'' Cunningham received \nthe longest prison sentence ever imposed on a former Member of \nCongress. His crime? Collecting $2.4 million in homes, yachts, antique \nfurnishings, and other bribes--including a Rolls-Royce--from defense \ncontractors. This disgraceful conduct--beyond comprehension for me and \nmost of my colleagues--earned him 8 years and 4 months in a Federal \nprison and orders to pay the Government $1.8 million in penalties and \n$1.85 million in ill-gotten gains.\n  What is almost as shocking as Duke Cunningham's bribes is that under \ntoday's rules, the American taxpayer is still paying for his \ncongressional pension--a pension worth approximately $40,000 per year. \nUnder today's rules, Duke Cunningham will collect his pension--paid for \nby the American taxpayers--while he sits in jail for violating the law \nand ethics as a Congressman. That is simply unacceptable. And it has \ngot to change.\n  That is why Senator Salazar and I introduced the Congressional \nPension Accountability Act and attempted to offer as an amendment to \nthe lobbying reform bill. Our amendment would have denied Federal \npensions to Members of Congress who are convicted of white-collar \ncrimes such as bribery--Members who perform acts like Randy ``Duke'' \nCunningham.\n  As elected representatives, we must hold ourselves and all those who \nrepresent the Federal Government to the highest ethical standards. The \nprinciple is a simple one: Public servants who abuse the public trust \nand are convicted of ethics crimes should not collect taxpayer-financed \npensions. Right now, only a conviction for a crime against the United \nStates, such as treason or espionage, will cost a Member of Congress \ntheir pension. There is no reason the law should not be changed to \nensure that Congress does not reward unethical behavior. But because \ndebate on the lobbying reform bill was unnecessarily limited, I was \nprevented from offering my amendment to prevent Duke Cunningham and \nother Members who violate the law from collecting their pensions.\n  There are other important issues that the lobbying reform bill fails \nto address. For example, although the bill bans gifts and meals from \nlobbyists, it does not apply to the organizations that employ the \nlobbyists. Nor does it\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\napply to lobbyists paying for parties to ``honor'' or ``recognize'' \nMembers. And although the bill increases the amount of time that \nMembers and senior executive branch officials are prohibited from \nmaking lobbying contacts and conducting lobbying activities from 1 to 2 \nyears, it does include organizing and directing a lobbying campaign in \nthe prohibited activities. Thus, a former Member or senior executive \nbranch official cannot make contact directly, but they can direct \npartners or employees in a lobbying strategy. The bill does not include \nany restrictions on lobbyists soliciting and organizing fundraisers or \nserving as treasurers on officeholder committees, nor does it prohibit \nspecial interest groups from paying for and organizing congressional \ntravel junkets.\n  These are serious problems with this lobbying reform legislation. It \nsimply does not go far enough to have a real impact on the way business \nis done in Washington. And, frankly, it is not surprising given the \nlimited amount of floor debate we had on the bill and the number of \nimportant amendments that were never offered or debated because we were \nrushed to a cloture vote. I am disappointed that we could not take \nadvantage of this unique moment in history and enact serious lobbying \nreform. I am voting against this package because the American people \ndeserve a strong reform bill and this does not meet that test.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, to clarify where we are, we do have three \nremaining amendments by Senator Ensign, and there are other Senators \nwho are working on those amendments and discussing them with Senators \nwho have some concerns. Hopefully, we can work out all of them or a \ncouple of them. It may be a few more minutes.\n  When that is done, we will then dispose of those amendments one way \nor another, and we will be able to go to final passage.\n  I will be glad to yield the floor at this time so Senator Dodd can \nmake some comments, maybe go over some of the items we have in this \nlegislation, and I will join him at some point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi. I \nwould like to do that while we are awaiting final resolution of these \nremaining issues which we can, hopefully, conclude in short order and \nthen go to final passage of this bill.\n  I begin by again commending my colleagues from Mississippi and from \nMaine, Senator Lott and Senator Collins, and my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, and their staffs and our staffs for the \ntremendous work they have done on a bill going back some weeks now.\n  As my colleagues recall, we began consideration of this matter some \nweeks ago. We were derailed for reasons that were beyond our control. \nThere were matters that arose of national significance and importance, \nand Members rightly wanted to consider some of those issues in the \nmidst of this debate.\n  Nonetheless, I believe we put together a good product. It does not \ninclude every idea that surfaced during the consideration of these \nproposals, but I think it is a very solid effort and one in which my \ncolleagues can rightfully claim credit and with some degree of pride \nfor what we have done.\n  I again commend the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs for handling a major part of this effort, and again the Rules \nCommittee for coming out with a bill, a unanimous vote out of our \ncommittee, with matters we considered and presented to our colleagues \nfor their full consideration.\n  This is not a perfect bill. In my 25 years, I have yet to see one of \nthose. But we have a pretty good one, given the constraints of time and \ninvocation of cloture which left behind some very important amendments, \namendments which I would have strongly supported had they been offered.\n  Nonetheless, this is a strong bill. It bans gifts and meals from \nlobbyists altogether. That is a major step in reform.\n  It requires additional and more frequent disclosure of lobbying \nactivities.\n  It places tight new limitations, including Ethics Committee \npreapproval, on congressional travel funded by outside sources.\n  It increases the transparency of the earmark process. It toughens the \nconflict of interest rules for Members. It tightens the revolving door \nprovisions of Senate rules and bans floor privileges for former Members \nwho become lobbyists.\n  Further, it bans inappropriate attempts to influence hiring decisions \nby lobbying firms, such as the K Street Project.\n  It broadens disclosure requirements for massive grassroots lobbying \nefforts.\n  It requires that conference reports be available on the Internet \nbefore they are considered by the full Senate. And it makes other \nimportant changes to strengthen and tighten current lobbying laws.\n  This is no small achievement. Just those provisions alone are \nincluded in this bill which we will be voting on in very short order.\n  This bill is the result of the work, as I mentioned earlier, of two \nseparate committees, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the Rules Committee of this body. Both of these \ncommittees held hearings and markup sessions on those issues within \ntheir jurisdiction and reported measures on a bipartisan basis to \nimprove the transparency of our legislative work.\n  I know it doesn't happen with great frequency any longer, but it is \nhow this institution is supposed to operate: have hearings, have \nmarkups, try to build bipartisan consensus whenever we \ncan. Unfortunately, that bipartisan process is becoming the exception, \nnot the rule, I say with a great degree of disappointment. It used to \nbe that this was standard operating procedure. I am saddened to say now \nit has become the exception, as I said, unfortunately, and not the \nrule.\n\n  These two bills were joined together in one piece of legislation on \nthe Senate floor. Consideration of this matter has been truly a \nbipartisan effort. I have been honored to serve as the floor manager, \nalong with the majority floor manager who is here, the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, and I commend my colleague for his \ndiligence in bringing this legislation to the floor. He advised me very \nearly in the session that he intended to craft a lobbying reform bill, \nto have a full and open markup in the Rules Committee, and offer all \nmembers of that committee the opportunity to offer amendments. That is \nwhat he did, and that is why I think we ended up with as strong a bill \nas we did. Because we had the opportunity to fully debate and amend the \nchairman's mark in the committee, we were able to produce an original \nbipartisan bill that was reported to the Senate unanimously. That \nbeginning boded well for this legislation.\n  I also want to commend, of course, our comanagers of the bill--I have \nmentioned already Senator Collins of Maine--and my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, for their very similar bipartisan \napproaches to this legislation. As I noted earlier, it is unusual to \nhave a bill that is reported from two different committees merge \ntogether on a single measure on the Senate floor, but even more \nunusual, I suspect, is that the bill would be managed by Senate \ncolleagues from the same State, in this case my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I. This may be the first time that \nhas ever happened, I might point out, in this Chamber.\n  I also want to commend our leaders, Senator Frist and Senator Reid, \nfor their efforts to accommodate this bill in the very busy Senate \nschedule and for allowing this measure to remain the pending business, \neven in the face of other priorities. In particular, I commend Senator \nReid for his leadership on lobbying reform and for his efforts in \nintroducing the very first comprehensive lobbying reform measure in \nthis Congress. In large part we are here today because of Senator \nReid's early and persistent efforts to respond to this crisis of \nconfidence of the American people following the Jack Abramoff scandal \nin the House of Representatives, a matter involving the bribery \nconviction of a Member of that body and the legal proceedings against \ncertain administration officials involving allegations of lobbying-\nrelated improprieties.\n  That is why we are here debating this measure, because of that \nscandal of the\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nillegal activities of a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, that rocked the House \nof Representatives. The serious allegations have led to guilty pleas by \nformer Members and their staffs, and the activities of Abramoff and his \ncronies, wherein they violated current lobbying gift and ethics rules, \ncreating a climate of disillusionment, unfortunately, and distrust of \nthe United States Congress. I suspect we have not seen the end of the \nindictments, nor the full breadth of this scandal, unfortunately.\n  But to the credit of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, the \nUnited States Senate has acted not in haste but in a measured response \nto this scandal. Our goal is to ensure the confidence of the American \npeople in their system of representative government by ensuring that \nspecial interests cannot operate under a cloak of darkness.\n  This bill, with its extended disclosure requirements of lobbying \nactivities and its restrictions on the type of influence lobbyists can \nexert over Members of Congress through lobbying gifts, I think, can go \na long way toward restoring the confidence of ordinary Americans in \ntheir Government. We must now get this bill married to the House bill \nand get it enacted into law, and that will be a task, given the \nshortened calendar of this election year. But we cannot neglect this \nfinal chapter in our effort to bring real reform to Washington.\n  Lobbying reforms are important and certainly will change how business \nis done in our Nation's Capital. But these changes alone will not \naddress what I have consistently stated is the core problem, the one \nthat still hangs out there, and that is the need for true, meaningful \ncampaign finance reform that breaks the link between the legislative \nfavor seekers and the free flow of special interest private money. That \nwould be a much more significant reform, in my view, than all of the \nreforms that we have accomplished with this legislation, as important \nas they are.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for heeding the concerns that we not \nmix lobbying reform and campaign finance reform in one measure, and I \nremain committed to seeing that this body addresses real campaign \nfinance reform. But I am equally committed to seeing that we do not do \nso on this important piece of legislation.\n  We are all aware that the House leadership has included major \ncampaign finance measures in its lobbying reform bill. I am very \ngrateful to our colleagues in seeing to it that our efforts down the \nroad will exclude those kinds of provisions in the final product. In \nthe meantime, I welcome the opportunity to have as complete a debate on \ncampaign finance reform issues as we have had on lobbying reform. \nChairman Lott, my good friend, has indicated his willingness to hold a \nhearing on this issue in the Rules Committee. I would like to go \nfurther than that and hear him commit to a markup on the bill. He has \nnot gone that far yet, but he has committed to a hearing. I will take \nvictories as I can get them. If I can get a hearing, I will take the \nhearing, and then I will be lobbying him, without buying him a lunch, \nto see if we can't get a markup of a good campaign finance reform bill.\n  But for now, we should commit ourselves to moving forward to \nconference with the House. I urge the House to move forward as well on \nthis important lobbying reform bill. If the introduced version is any \nindication, as it appears, the House-passed bill will be substantially \nweaker than the job we have completed here--in a number of key \nrespects. We must hold fast to our stronger provisions whenever \npossible as we move forward. The American people are looking forward to \nus putting our house in order and ensuring that lobbying scandals of \nthe House are not repeated anymore in this Chamber.\n  So, again, I commend my colleagues for their tremendous work on this \nbill. It is a good bill. It is one we can be proud of, and I look \nforward to its adoption and moving to conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The bill before us has been improved by the amendments offered and \ndebated here in the Senate. There is no reason to believe that we \ncannot continue to build on these provisions in conference with the \nHouse. Although the Majority in the House only recently introduced \ntheir lobbying reform measure, I encourage the Leadership to move the \nmeasure expeditiously so that we can complete a conference on this \nmeasure before Congress gets bogged down in the fall campaigns.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator Lott and Senator Collins, and my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, for their leadership in \nbringing this bill to this point. I also want to thank the capable \nstaff of the Senate Rules Committee, Majority counsel Alexander \nPolinsky and staff director Susan Wells, for their many courtesies and \nassistance both during mark-up of this measure in Committee and during \nthe floor debate.\n  I also want to thank the staff of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for their efforts to successfully merge \nthese two bills and jointly support the managers. In particular, I want \nto thank the Majority staff director and chief counsel, Michael Bopp, \nand Senator Lieberman's Democratic staff, in particular his staff \ndirector and counsel, Joyce Rechtschaffen, chief counsel Laurie \nRubenstein, and counsel Troy Cribb.\n  I also want to thank my very capable staff, including my committee \nstaff director and chief counsel, Kennie Gill; our elections counsel, \nVeronica Gillespie, and Democratic staff members Candace Chin, Joe \nHepp, Colin McGinnis, and Carole Blessington.\n  And of course, no legislative effort of this magnitude could be \naccomplished without the assistance of our floor staff. Marty Paone and \nDavid Schiappa are invaluable in their efforts to structure our \nunanimous consent requests to accommodate our colleagues and the Senate \nschedule. Lula Davis and our cloakroom staff as well as our leadership \nstaff are indispensable to us in our roles as floor managers.\n  I say to all of these staff, and the many hundreds of others who work \nnight and day to bring good legislative ideas to fruition and work to \nmanage the Senate floor and its proceedings, job well done. This is \nlegislation that will truly make a difference in how the American \npeople view their government and will hopefully help to reconnect us to \nthe people we serve.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of our colleagues and look forward to \nworking with them as we move this bill to conference with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend and respond in the same sense and \nvein of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. Before I do that, \nand talk further about our relationship and how the Rules Committee \npackage came together, I would like to call on my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, to go over the specifics of what is \nincluded in the bill out of her committee work, and with Senator \nLieberman. I have never worked with a floor manager who has been more \nenjoyable than working with the Senator from Maine, her attitude and \nher help, her tenacity, and also, of course, Senator Dodd. But I \nthought before I respond further to Senator Dodd, I would like for us \nto understand the details of what was in the legislation that came out \nof the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first let me begin by thanking my \ncolleague from Mississippi, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for \nhis extraordinary leadership in bringing this bill forward. I also want \nto commend the ranking member of the committee, Senator Dodd. This has \nbeen an unusual and extraordinary experience where we have two \ncommittees that produced bipartisan bills with overwhelming support--\nonly one negative vote between the two committees--and have brought \nlegislation to the Senate floor where it was married together and \npresented to the full Senate. I am very proud that there has not been a \nsingle party-line vote that has occurred as we considered this bill, \nboth in committee--in my committee, anyway--and also here on the Senate \nfloor. I do think this is a model for how the Senate should act, that \nwe can act together in a bipartisan way and look at how much we can get \ndone when we do so.\n  So I salute Senator Lott and Senator Dodd for their extraordinary \nleadership. I also thank the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security \nCommittee, Senator Lieberman, for all that he has done to advance this \nvery important cause. Senators McCain and Santorum also were key \nfigures. Senator McCain introduced one of the earliest bills. Senator \nSantorum brought\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\ntogether a bipartisan group which agreed on certain principles that \nbecame the foundation of the legislation before us. The Senate majority \nleader, Senator Frist, and the minority leader, Senator Reid, worked \ntogether to ensure that we would complete action on this bill. I must \nsay, when the bill was pulled before, I was worried about whether we \nwould return to finish the job. We have done just that, and I am proud \nof that activity.\n  This legislation is a strong bill. It may not be a perfect bill--we \nprobably would all have different definitions of what a perfect bill \nwould be--but it is a strong bill that I believe will help to enhance \npublic confidence in the integrity of Government decisions. Let me \ndescribe some of the major provisions of the bill as approved and, in \nparticular, the emphasis on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee's provisions.\n  First of all, we greatly strengthened the disclosure required by \nlobbyists. The legislation requires quarterly filings rather than the \npresent semiannual filings by lobbyists, and it ensures that the \ninformation is made available to the public on the Internet. We will \nhave stronger, more accessible disclosure reports. This is important in \nterms of ensuring that there is adequate sunshine on these activities. \nOur goal, which would be accomplished by this bill, is to have lobbying \ndisclosure reports on a searchable, easily accessible public database, \nso that the public can evaluate the spending that is occurring, and so \nthat they know who is lobbying whom. I think disclosure is going to \nmake a big difference, and we put some teeth in the disclosure process \nby doubling the maximum penalty for noncompliance to $100,000. I think \nthat is going to provide ample incentive for prompt and full \ndisclosure.\n  Another provision of the bill will provide for auditing and oversight \nof the lobbyists' disclosure reports by the Comptroller General, the \nhead of the Government Accountability Office. The GAO will do some \nrandom audits, give us advice, and help us understand weaknesses in the \ncurrent system.\n  Another important provision that really hasn't been discussed much on \nthe Senate floor is that the legislation provides for mandatory ethics \ntraining for Members of Congress and congressional staff. I think this \nis important as well. I think a lot of times people aren't fully \ninformed of what the rules are. We are going to require mandatory \ntraining for both Members and their staffs.\n  Another provision of the legislation addresses the so-called \nrevolving door issue where Members of Congress and high-ranking staff \nleave Government for jobs focused on the institution in which they once \nserved. We extend the cooling off period during which a former Member \nof Congress or a former senior executive branch official may not lobby \nfrom 1 year to 2 years. We also make an important change in the so-\ncalled revolving door provisions as they apply to senior staff. Right \nnow the limitation is that a staff member cannot lobby the specific \noffice for which he or she worked for a 1-year period. We retain that \n1-year period--the cooling off period--but we extend it to the entire \nSenate or the entire body in which the staffer worked. So I think that \nis a significant strengthening of the revolving door provisions.\n  Our legislation also, for the first time, prohibits lobbyists from \nproviding gifts and travel that Members and staff are prohibited from \naccepting under the ethics rules. The burden has always been on \nMembers. We have a parallel requirement placed now, for the first time, \non lobbyists, and I think that is going to make a difference as well. I \nam pleased that we adopted an amendment on the Senate floor to draw a \nbright line to make it clear that lobbyists cannot provide gifts to \nMembers, including meals.\n  Another provision of our bill, this provision authored by Senator \nColeman, would create a commission to look over our ethics laws and \nrules and to make recommendations to Congress by July 1 of this year on \nany further changes that would be appropriate.\n  Again, I think this is an excellent bill. It is an important step \nforward toward the goal of restoring public confidence in the decisions \nthat we make.\n  Some people asked: Why does this matter? Why should we be even \nspending time strengthening our lobbying disclosure laws, prohibiting \npractices that might undermine the public's confidence in Government?\n  The reason this is so worthwhile and so important is that we cannot \ntackle the big issues facing our country if the public doesn't trust us \nto act in the public interests. Too often, the public is convinced that \nthe big decisions are tainted by undue influence. Lobbying conjures up \nimages of all-expense-paid vacations masquerading as factfinding trips, \nor special access that the average citizen does not have, or decisions \nthat are tainted by improper influence. That means the public doesn't \nhave confidence that we will do the right thing, that we will act in \nthe public interest rather than to meet the wishes of some special \ninterest. That is why this matters. The experts tell us over and over \nagain that there are so many important issues--entitlement reform, for \nexample--that we should be tackling. But if the public doesn't trust \nus, if the bonds of trust between public officials and their \nconstituents are frayed, then it is very difficult for us to make the \ndifficult choices, for us to make the hard decisions. That is why this \nmatters. That is why this legislation is so important. In many ways, it \nis the foundation that allows us to proceed to tackle the challenges \nfacing our great Nation.\n\n  I am very pleased and proud today that we have come together. I \nbelieve this legislation will be overwhelmingly adopted by the full \nSenate, and that is as it should be. I am also very pleased to see the \nranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee has joined us on \nthe floor. As I said earlier when he was not on the floor, he has been \nsuch a valuable partner. His commitment to good government and to \nrepairing the public trust in government is second to none. It has been \na pleasure to work with him as well as with Senator Lott and Senator \nDodd as we brought forward this bipartisan endeavor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the bill. Let me \nfirst thank my chairman, Senator Collins, for her extraordinary \nleadership in a good cause and in a characteristically, for her, not \npartisan way. I thank her for her kind words. I appreciate that she \nsaid them when I wasn't in the room. Somebody told me after I had been \nin Washington for a while, if somebody compliments you when you are not \nin the room, then you know they really mean it. I appreciate that from \nSenator Collins.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Lott and Senator Dodd, my \ndear friend, my senior Senator from Connecticut. This has been a strong \nfoursome. Probably there should be an alliterative ``F,'' like the \nfaithful or ferocious foursome. But this has been an important \nprecedent and one that has served the Senate well.\n  We had two committees, each with jurisdiction over part of lobbying \nreform. The leadership worked together to meld the products of both \ncommittees so we could consider this matter. It is actually quite a \nvaluable precedent for other large subject matter interests Members of \nthe Senate have which often get divided into pieces based on committee \njurisdiction. I am very grateful to my three colleagues, and with some \nreal sense of pride, I rise to express strong support for the Lobbying \nTransparency and Accountability Act on which we will vote shortly.\n  This legislation contains very significant reforms in a number of \ncritical areas. It ends all gifts to Members from lobbyists. It \nrequires significantly increased disclosure from those who are paid to \ninfluence Members of Congress. For the first time ever, it would shine \nsunlight on the activities of those who are paid to generate advocacy--\nphone calls, letters to congressional offices, so-called grassroots \nlobbying. It significantly slows the so-called revolving door by \ndoubling the ban on lobbying by Members once they leave Congress and \nsignificantly expanding the rules covering who staff can and cannot \nlobby.\n  This is not popular stuff inside here, but it is the right thing to \ndo, and we are about to do it. In short, this legislation upends the \nstatus quo with regard to oversight of lobbying and the relationship \nbetween lobbyists and Members of Congress. This upending of\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\nthe status quo is justified by the recent scandals that have afflicted \nus here in Washington, most prominently the crimes of lobbyist Jack \nAbramoff.\n  Trust between the people and their elected leaders is essential to \nour democracy. The behavior of Mr. Abramoff and his associates and some \nMembers of Congress has undercut that trust and sent the message to too \nmany people across our great country that in Washington, results go too \noften to the highest bidder, not to the greatest public good. That is \nnot the truth. But this legislation upends that perception, I believe, \nand the status quo.\n  There are many people to thank. I begin as I have with Senator \nCollins for her usual outstanding leadership. After a hearing in late \nJanuary, she was ready to mark up legislation a month later, despite a \nlarge workload our committee had in conducting the ongoing Katrina \ninvestigation. The legislation we passed out of our committee contained \nsignificant reforms that will not only change the way lobbyists and \nMembers of Congress interact but again, I believe, provide the American \npeople with additional information that they have not had before, and \nthat the media has not had access to before, about where billions of \ndollars for lobbying are being spent and for what purpose.\n  The measure approved by our Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee requires lobbyists to report more details, \nsignificantly more details, and to report more frequently about their \nactivities, including lobbyists' campaign contributions to Members of \nCongress, lobbyists' contributions to political action committees, and \nlobbyists' fundraising events hosted or sponsored by lobbyists or for \ntheir benefit for Members of Congress. They would also be required to \ndisclose travel they arrange for Members of Congress or executive \nbranch officials. All lobbyists' disclosures would have to be made \nquarterly rather than semiannually, and they would have to be made \nonline so that anyone who wished to monitor lobbyists' activities would \nbe able to do so online and do so, obviously, on a public, searchable \ndatabase.\n\n  For the first time ever, a relatively new but significant aspect of \nlobbying Congress would be subject to disclosure of the money they \nspend. These are the so-called grassroots lobbying campaigns, \nfamiliarly known around here as Astroturf campaigns because they are \nmanufactured. They are not just grass that naturally grows or letters \nor e-mails and calls that naturally come to Members of Congress on an \nissue, but they are organized. That is OK. No matter how it happens, \nwhen we hear from members of the public, it is important for us. But a \nlot of money is spent on these campaigns. It is a significant part of \nlobbying in Washington today. Those lobbyists ought to disclose how \nmuch money they earn or spend.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Carl Levin, \nfor working with me on this effort. He has fought for this for a long \ntime--more than a decade. I believe this is a significant victory, and \nit directly responds to the activities of Mr. Abramoff and his \nassociate, Michael Scanlon, who sought and received multimillion-dollar \ncontributions from Native-American tribes to a grassroots lobbying \neffort. In fact, Mr. Abramoff received enormous kickbacks from that \ngrassroots organization.\n  The major impact on grassroots lobbying firms is simply that they \nwill, for the first time, have to disclose. There is nothing in here \nthat inhibits grassroots lobbying. There is nothing in here that \ninhibits in any way the freedom of the American people to petition \ntheir Government, the freedom of companies to hire out--make money--to \norganize the public to petition Members of the Government. It is simply \na requirement that they reveal how much money they have charged and how \nmuch money they have spent.\n  That requirement to disclose clearly would have stopped this scheme, \nthis scam which Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon were carrying out because \nthe disclosure of the grassroots lobbying firm would have shown \nenormous amounts of money coming in, much more than was being spent. \nThe result, obviously, the answer to that puzzle, was that too much was \ngoing to Mr. Abramoff in kickbacks.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as I \nmentioned, slows the revolving door between Congress and K Street by \ndoubling, to 2 years, the amount of time a former Member of Congress \nmust wait before lobbying his or her former colleagues. This is a \nsignificant change; not one that I would say is inherently popular \nhere, but it is the right thing to do, and this legislation does it.\n  The leadership of the Rules Committee, as I said earlier, Chairman \nLott and Senator Dodd, ranking member, has done a great job in \nproducing a strong bill from their committee which, combined with ours, \nis now on the Senate floor. Their bill prohibited most gifts from \nlobbyists to Members of Congress and required preapproval and greater \ndisclosure of all congressional travel. It also addressed an issue of \ndeep significance to an increasing number of citizens by requiring that \nearmarks attached to legislation be listed, explained, and the Member \nbehind the earmark be identified. Those are significant changes.\n  These reforms were further strengthened on the Senate floor in this \ndebate with an amendment by Senator Dodd to make sure that all gifts \nfrom lobbyists are banned. All gifts from lobbyists to Members of the \nSenate are banned--including meals. This is a real victory for those \nwho believe the relationship between Members of Congress and lobbyists \nhas grown too cozy.\n  The bill was additionally strengthened with an amendment from \nSenators Grassley and Wyden that would abolish the practice of secret \nholds on legislation.\n  I also thank Senators McCain, Obama, and Feingold all stalwarts of \nreform and indispensable allies in this endeavor.\n  Senator McCain led the hearings of the Indian Affairs Committee \nwhich--I was going to say revealed--really blew open the Abramoff \nscandal and, when those were finished, drafted legislation to reform \nour lobbying laws, building on what he had learned in the Abramoff \ninvestigation. I was proud to join him as original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Feingold actually submitted a lobbying reform package a year \nago, even before we understood the Abramoff scandal.\n  Senate Minority Leader Reid provided essential impetus and I would \nsay muscle to the reform cause when he introduced his own reform \npackage supported by almost the entire Democratic Senate caucus earlier \nthis year.\n  Of course, Senator Collins and I are disappointed that the Senate \nyesterday rejected our amendment, introduced with Senators McCain and \nObama, that would have established an independent Office of Public \nIntegrity. I believe this office would have given further assurances to \nthe American people that we in Congress are not only dead serious about \nreform, we are dead serious about the enforcement of that reform. I \nregret that a group of us were unable to offer an amendment to increase \nthe reimbursement costs of airplane travel provided to Members by \nprivate entities. But even without those two additional reforms, this \nlegislation we are about to adopt sends a clear and powerful message \nthat in Washington we ourselves, in pursuit of greater legitimacy and \ncredibility and trust of the American people, are taking significant \nsteps to make sure that here in this Congress, results go to the \ngreatest public good and not ever to the highest bidder.\n  I have said many times throughout this debate that we have a once-in-\na-generation opportunity now to reach bipartisan agreement on a broad \nset of reforms that will reduce cynicism, prevent abuse, and restore \ntrust of the American people in their Government here in Washington. I \nbelieve this bill does exactly that.\n  On a final note, I wish to thank several staff members of all four \nSenators for their long hours and exceptional hard work on this \nlegislation. On my staff, I particularly thank Troy Cribb, who led our \nefforts on this bill, as well as my staff director Joyce Rechtschaffen \nand chief counsel Laurie Rubenstein. They labored to make this bill as \ngood as it could possibly be.\n  I also thank Michael Bopp, Jennifer Hemmingway, Ann Fisher, and Kurt \nSchmautz on Senator Collins' staff and Kennie Gill and Veronica \nGillespie on Senator Dodd's staff, and Senator Lott's able staff as \nwell. I thank them all, I thank my colleagues.\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't want to repeat everything that has \nbeen said here because we do have the need to move forward. We have \nsome amendments we need to dispose of, but let me take a minute to \ncomment as to Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins \nand their leadership and the way we work together.\n  I wish to do that by reminding you a little bit of history. When we \nstarted off this year, there were problems that were reflecting on the \nCongress and the way we do business--the Abramoff matter, as Senator \nLieberman has described. There was a feeling that we needed to address \nsome of those concerns. We needed to take a look at our lobbying laws \nand the rules of the institution. There was a concern about, was this \ngoing to be a panic reaction? Was this going to be everybody taking \ntheir partisan positions and not ever actually getting anything done, \njust looking for political advantage?\n  That could have been what happened, but that is not what happened. It \nstarted off by strong leadership on both sides of the aisle. Senator \nSantorum was designated by Majority Leader Frist to pull together a \ntask force to begin working on issues that needed to be addressed, and \nsolutions. Senator Reid stepped right out and started developing a \npackage on the Democratic side.\n  By the way, I think one of the ways we came to the point where we are \nis that there were some good things in the Reid proposal. When I \nbrought up the chairman's mark in the Rules Committee, several of the \npieces of that legislation came from the Reid ideas. Then it continued \nto move forward with important areas being addressed. I wound up in a \nmeeting that was somewhat of an amazement to me because it was a \nbipartisan meeting that included Senator Collins, Senator McCain, \nSenator Santorum, Senator Dodd, Senator Obama, Senator Isakson--a large \ngroup from both sides of all different political persuasions working \ntogether to see if we couldn't come up with bipartisan legislation.\n\n  I guess it was about that time when I started talking to Senator \nDodd, saying: Can we do this together and make it a truly cooperative \nthing? He wanted to do that, but both of us had to make sure leaders \nwere OK with that, and they were. They told us: Yes. Do your job and \noperate the way a committee is supposed to act--hold hearings, have a \nmarkup, report a bill, regular order. That is what we did.\n  I am pleased the way this has come about.\n  I could go around and commend everybody who has been involved but \nthat has already been done very legitimately.\n  But this is a case study of an issue that could have blown up. It was \nvery tough. It could have produced nothing but acrimony. That is not \nwhat happened, no.\n  It is not a perfect bill. But we have addressed some tough issues. \nWhen you start talking about outright ban of gifts, outright ban of \nmeals from lobbyists, taking action with regard to the flights and \ntransparency and disclosure, saying that former Senators cannot come \nonto the floor of the Senate when we are debating legislation where \nthey are registered lobbyists, and that also applies to former officers \nof the institution, except for ceremonial events. We also have very \ntight postemployment restrictions, and we address the question of \nearmarks.\n  I, for one, think that earmarks--and I don't particularly like that \ndescription, but where you have a Senator or a Congressman exercising \ntheir right to have language included in a tax bill or in a highway \nbill or in an appropriations bill for the benefit of some entity that \nthey are familiar with or something in their State, I think we should \nhave that right. I think it is our constitutional right, as a matter of \nfact, and I will fight for that. I will fight for it even if my \ncolleague from Mississippi were not the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. But he worked with us on how we could deal with this issue \nby making sure that it wasn't just about appropriations. It was about \ntax bills coming out of the Finance Committee, and authorization bills, \ntoo.\n  I must say, while I think the language in this area still is not \ntotally artfully crafted, we made some real progress there. This was a \nproblem that I believe people were concerned about where there was an \nearmark in a conference that had not been considered by either body and \nthere was no way to get at it--at a particular item--without a point of \norder, without taking down the whole conference.\n  That doesn't make sense. That is not the way the Byrd point of order \nworks. So we include that here.\n  I think that is where we need to go. We will continue to work with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, from all persuasions, to make sure \nthat we have thought that through carefully and produced the right \nresult. But we didn't duck the issue. We stepped up and addressed it by \nbringing people in and talking about the best way to deal with the \nearmarks issue.\n  But that leads me to the point that there are some amendments pending \nnow and the only three left that do get into this particular area.\n  In the effort to move forward and expedite these issues and come to \nconclusion, I think now would be the time to move to an amendment that \nis pending, which I guess would be 2981. I believe Senator Ensign has \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2981 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the \namendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order may be raised.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I raise a point of order--\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, don't I have a right to be heard before \nthe point of order is raised? I was recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada may proceed.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain and I understand that our amendment is \ngoing to be ruled nongermane. Previously, it was going to be ruled \ngermane. Since then some items were pointed out that has caused the \namendment to be ruled as nongermane. Despite that fact, I would hope \nthat the managers of the bill will work in conference to clarify the \nlanguage of this bill. I know the chairman of the Rules Committee has \nsaid that he will review this language. I believe he will. Our \namendment seeks to clarify that if things are put into a conference \nreport that were not in either the House bill or the Senate bill, a \nSenator would have the chance to take those items out without taking \ndown the entire conference report. One section of this bill creates a \nnew point of order against items that are slipped into conference \nreports. The provisions in the bill seek to address what has become a \nvery significant problem around here. A member slips something in, \nwithout debate. That certainly is not an open process. The purpose of \nthis lobbying reform bill is to make sure there is more transparency \nand our amendment is consistent with that.\n  The way the bill is drafted, there is a problem. The bill uses the \nterm matter without providing a definition or examples of anything that \nwould be considered a matter.\n  According to our discussions with the Parliamentarian, that \ndefinition would not allow a point of order to be raised because there \ncould be no way for the Parliamentarian to interpret the new rule. This \npoint of order would basically be null-and-void.\n  Our amendment was attempting to clarify the bill by providing a \ndefinition. That way we will ensure that we have openness in the \nprocess of conference reports. That certainly is the purpose of our \nbill and of our amendment.\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I ask the chairman if he would \nsubmit to a question through the Chair. I ask the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee if he would commit to working on this definition in \nconference so that it will meet with the criteria stated by the \nParliamentarian to give effect to the rule. That way the provisions of \nthis bill will meet with the intent of what\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nthe Chairman said in his previous statement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for purposes of debate only, I said in my \ncomments before the Senator offered his amendment that I realize it is \nnot perfect language. It has been difficult to achieve what we would \nlike to achieve. He worked on it in the Rules Committee. Senator \nCochran made some very important points, and we actually made some \nchanges as we went forward. But I think we still have some more work to \ndo to accomplish what we are trying to accomplish.\n  I will commit to work with Senator Ensign to try to find language \nthat does what we are trying to do and which has the support of all \ninvolved in the discussions this afternoon. I am not sure what the \nSenator is trying to do is what we want to do. But I also realize that \nthe language, the wording we have in there, the critical word is pretty \nnebulous. And we will have to work on that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very simply, I will let people know what \nthe intent is. I have worked with Senator McCain. I applaud his \nefforts. He has been doing this a lot longer than I have.\n  All we are trying to do is say if something was not in the Senate \nbill, not in the House bill, and it was put in, in the conference, a \npoint of order could be raised against that item without bringing an \nentire bill down.\n  Right now nobody wants to raise a point of order against a bill \nbecause they don't want to bring the whole bill down. Senators know we \nhave to fund the Government, so nobody wants to bring a point of order \nagainst a bill that does that. Nobody wants to vote on a point of order \nthat brings down the whole bill either. But if something was put in \nwhich was not in the House bill and not in the Senate bill, we want to \nbe able to surgically strike that provision to make sure that we have a \ncleaner process in government. This is not new ground as the Senate \nalready has this rule with respect to Budget reconciliation bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will yield for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my colleague, isn't it true that the reason this \namendment is being proposed is because the Parliamentarian looked at \nthe present language and informed the Senator and myself that it is not \nclear enough language that we could actually achieve the purpose of the \nbill that the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Connecticut \nhave proposed--in other words, we are in keeping with the intent of the \nlanguage in the bill, and we are trying to clarify it because the \nParliamentarian said that it is not clear. All we are asking, I think, \nis the managers of the bill to fix it so there is no doubt that we can \ncarry out the intent of the legislation which is before this body. That \nis all we are talking about.\n  It is also true, if it is not clarified, I will tell my dear friends, \nyou will see this amendment again. You will see it again and again. \nThis goes to the heart of what we are trying to stop. We are trying to \nstop ANWR from being put into a bill that has nothing to do with it. We \nare trying to stop liability protection for a flu vaccine added at \nmidnight which we have never seen before. It is an outrageous abuse of \nthe rights of the Members of this Senate who are not members of the \nAppropriations Committee; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, those and many other things have been put \nin. Sometimes good things are put in. But that is not the way the \nlegislative process is supposed to work. We are supposed to have an \nopen process. Senators should be able to see what is in a bill. We \nshould provide transparency so that the public can scrutinize what is \ngoing on. The current process is broken when we are forced to enact \nprovisions that were not in either one of the bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from \nConnecticut for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. The Parliamentarian may have suggested something other \nthan, but for the purpose of the legislative intent--and sometimes \ndebate can be enlightening--legislative intent, as far as this Senator \nis concerned, is exactly as the Senator from Nevada described and the \nSenator from Arizona described, if there is a matter which is neither \nin the House bill nor the Senate bill, and if it ends up in conference, \nthat matter is subject to a point of order--and for the very reasons \nwhich my colleague described.\n  I do not know how that is confusing language. If it is, I am \ncertainly committed to trying to straighten it out. I believe that is \nthe appropriate way to go.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nwhy would the Senators raise a point of order when this is simply a \nclarification of the intent of the legislation, according to the \nParliamentarian who has told us--I am asking a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Nevada see my point? There is no \nreason to raise a point of order if all we are doing is clarifying. We \nare wasting the time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I agree with the Senator from Arizona. I appreciate the \nmanager of the bill when he said he would work with us. I wanted it on \nthe record that the managers have committed to working with us to \nensure that the intent of the bill is clear. Which is exactly what our \namendment seeks to do. The bill managers have put it on the record that \nit is their intent. We hope in this process, as this bill moves \nforward, that the language that is ultimately adopted will include some \nkind of a definition, as we have tried to do, so that the intent of the \nSenate is clear. It needs to be done. We need to clean up the \nappropriations process we have going on in the Senate.\n  I don't see any reason to raise a point of order. I think it would be \neasier to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator wishes to proceed with his \nnext amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator could give me 60 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his approach on this.\n  Let me make a couple of points. Again, in a way, there is not as big \na problem here as indicated. For instance, I have been assured the \nexample that was used about ANWR, this, in fact, would apply to that \nand a point of order would be in order against the ANWR amendment being \nadded in conference that had not been in the other body. We will work \nthrough this.\n  The second point is and one of the reasons why I was prepared to make \na point of order, Senator Dodd and I, postcloture, have been very \nmeticulous; even when there were amendments he or I or both of us \nsupported, if they were not germane, we have not included them in the \nmanagers' package. We have held the line because once you start \nallowing exceptions, there is no end to it. We were trying to get \nthrough with as strong a package as possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2980\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I call up amendment No. 2980.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, let me discuss this amendment very \nbriefly. I want to be cooperative with the managers of the bill. I know \nthey want to wrap up this legislation.\n  This amendment is germane. We will have a recorded vote on this \nparticular amendment, unless the chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations agrees to a voice vote that we would win.\n  Section 103 of this bill creates a new Senate rule. Each Senator \nknows that we create very few new Senate rules because the rules we \ncreate are hard to change once created. The rules we make today will \ngovern the Senate's conduct for years to come. It is important we get \nlanguage right the first time so we do not have any unintended \nconsequences.\n  Within the proposed rule in this bill is a definition of the term \n``earmark.'' Many people in my home State of Nevada have heard the \nphrase earmark, as people across the country have. As taxpayers, \nNevadans understand some earmarks can be costly, some can be \nbeneficial. Earmarks are often the result of Senators using their \ninfluence\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nto require Federal agencies to spend significant dollars in their \nStates. In some cases, earmarks are given to State or local governments \nor charitable or philanthropic organizations. In many cases, these \nearmarks are justifiable. In many cases, these earmarks have a national \nimpact and can be justified because they meet a national purpose.\n  Each Senator has seen the abuse of the earmark process. That is why \nwe have offered this amendment. To clear up abuses. Our amendment \nprovides a clear definition of what an earmark is. Our definition \nclarifies that earmarks are not limited solely to non-Federal entities. \nThe definition also includes Federal entities. Spending for federal, as \nwell as non-Federal, entities in the earmarking process can be abused.\n  The Senator from Mississippi argued earlier it is a Senator's right \nto offer things that are good for their State. Senators have ideas \nabout how money should be spent. I actually have no problem with that \nphilosophy. I agree to a great degree with that philosophy. The problem \nis that such a process has been abused in too many cases. For instance, \nthe military provides a procurement list to the Armed Services \nCommittee that includes lists of things the military says they need. In \norder to benefit their state, Senators will contradict the decisions of \nthe military and override the military's request. They ignore what is \nin the best interest of the military in order to benefit their State. \nMilitary is a Federal project but this bill does not provide \naccountability. This bill would continue to allow Senators to put their \npolitical interests before the needs of the military.\n  That is why our amendment expands the definition of earmark to both \nFederal and not just non-Federal entities. That is why we should \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator started moving toward giving an example. So \nthat I will fully understand exactly what the Senator is trying to get \nat here, can he give me a couple of examples? He has referred to \nmilitary, for instance. I don't want to use any particular weapon \nsystem because I don't want to make anyone mad, but take generic \nhelicopter. If the Pentagon or the President's budget only included 100 \nhelicopters and a Senator of the Committee on Armed Services, in \nconference, said no, we are going to make it 200, would that be an \nexample of where the Senator is trying to get this language to apply?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would say to the Senator from Mississippi, if one \nSenator were to raise a point of order against the item you have \ndescribed, the process laid out in this bill would be to have the \nentire Senate decide the matter. If the rest of the Senate believes \nthat the additional helicopters are justifiable, then the----\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the type of example.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will give the Senate a more specific example. I will \nnot use the exact example I had mentioned to the Senator from \nMississippi previously because I don't think it is appropriate to \ndiscuss specifics like this on the Senate floor. The military tells \nCongress that they need certain items for the troops. They want \nsomething produced. Perhaps similar products are produced in different \nStates so there are competing products. The military has said, We like \nthis item made by one company, it is far superior. What is happening \ntoday is that some members, perhaps one on the Military Subcommittee on \nAppropriations, who represent a state with a similar product will use \ntheir influence to direct spending to products made in their own State. \nEven though the Pentagon says we like product A, Congress tells them \nthey must buy product B. When the bill comes back from conference, \nspending gets shifted. Spending is earmarked to go to one product \ninstead of for a product that the military said would be best for our \nfighting men and women.\n  That is exactly some of the things we are trying to avoid.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield for a further question, the \nlanguage we have would allow for that kind of designation to continue?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It would allow for the designation to continue.\n  I would say to the Senator from Mississippi, this amendment does not \naffect the point of order in the bill. I apologize if I was unclear on \nthat. This amendment affects the requirement that Senators be given a \nreport that identifies which members have requested which earmarks. It \nrequires that all earmarks be included in that report. That is all this \namendment is doing. We want Members, if they are going to request \nearmarks and redirect spending, to be identified. If they want to \ndirect spending to go to their State, they should be willing to be \nidentified. This is a simple sunshine provision. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for a second I will discuss again what the \namendment is. It requires that all earmarks included in a bill or \nconference report should be clearly listed--the sponsor identified, \nexplanation, et cetera.\n  I fully support the intent of that requirement. However, the \nunderlying definition of the earmark is only ``non-Federal'' at this \ntime.\n  The point the Senator from Nevada is trying to make in the amendment, \nthere are plenty of Federal pork barrel projects, if I may be so blunt. \nLet me give an example. The Army Corps of Engineers is clearly a \nFederal entity. In 2006 we spent $600,000 in the Army Corps of \nEngineers, a Federal entity, to study fish passage in Mud Mountain, WA; \n$275,000 to remove the sunken vessel State of Pennsylvania from the \nChristina River; $7 Million for the Arctic Energy Office--guess where--\nAlaska. Aren't you astonished? And $500,000 for the collection of \ntechnical and environmental data to be used to evaluate potential \nrehabilitation of the St. Mary's storage unit facility's Milk River \nproject, Montana. The list goes on and on.\n  These are all out of a Federal entity called the Army Corps of \nEngineers. They should be listed. They should be in the sponsorship, \nthey should be required to be listed, and as a Federal entity. So, \nclearly listed, sponsor identified, accompanied by information of the \nessential Government purpose of the legislation.\n  We are saying there are earmarks that are Federal entity as well as \nnon-Federal entity. That is all this amendment does. It changes it from \nFederal to as well non-Federal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it was interesting to notice the \narguments of the Senator from Arizona right before we had the vote on \ncloture on this bill. He pointed out what the consequences of cloture \nwould be, one of which would be that nongermane amendments could not be \noffered, and he listed two examples, one of which was amendments on \nearmarking.\n  I think this amendment, just as the previous amendment, should be \nsubject to a point of order. The Parliamentarian sustained the point of \norder that was raised by the chairman of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, but I am advised that the Parliamentarian would not \nrule that a point of order lies against this amendment. It is clear and \nobvious that it would.\n  But notwithstanding that disagreement, this amendment would have the \nmost impractical effects and unintended consequences of any I have seen \noffered. What the Senator is suggesting is that anytime you identify a \nproject or a program or an entity that is enlarged or constructed in \nany bill--an appropriations bill, an authorization bill from any of the \nauthorizing committees--you have to separately list or include in the \nconference report, it is not clear, the identity of those who support \nthe inclusion of that or who authored it.\n  There are many things here that are sponsored by one Senator, \ncosponsored by many others. In order to meet the criteria of this \nrequirement, we would have a voluminous stack of documents presented to \nthe Senate when a bill is presented, showing which Senators in \ncommittee may have offered that amendment or suggested to the committee \nthat it be included in the bill, and why.\n  We already have committee reports that accompany most pieces of \nlegislation that come to the Senate. In that committee report, the \nprovisions are discussed, described. It boggles the\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nmind to think what the consequences of this one provision would do, the \npaperwork, bookkeeping, and the like. I don't know of any Senator who \ndoes not want his name associated with a provision that he suggests or \nshe suggests be included in a bill, whether it is authorizing language \nor whether it is in an appropriations bill. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. I am not arguing that should not be included. It usually is well \nknown.\n  I plead with the Senate, let's not include this amendment on this \nbill at a time when we are right about to go to final passage. The bill \nreflects the consensus of the Rules Committee. The two managers of this \nlegislation did an excellent job of carefully reviewing all the \nsuggestions that were out there for lobbying reform, reforms of the way \nthe Senate does its business. We are going to have to go to conference \nwith the House. If there are better ways to word this earmarking \nprovision that is in the bill, there is a provision in the bill, the \ncommittee signed off on it, and we are coming to the very end of the \nconsideration. We are nitpicking. That is what this is, nitpicking. I \ndon't know of a better word to describe this amendment. It does not \nserve any useful purpose to inform the public.\n  What member of the general public is going to look through documents \nthat will be 2 feet high associated with almost any legislation that \nauthorizes or appropriates funds for a department's activities for an \nentire year? Think about it. Do not approve this.\n  I support the idea that we need to do a better job of controlling \nspending. We need to achieve more in the way of ensuring that projects \nare justified, that they are reviewed more carefully. That is a part of \nthis process. That is why this provision is in the bill. I voted for \nit. I supported it in the markup session of our Rules Committee. I am a \nmember of that distinguished committee. My colleague from Mississippi \nis the chairman of the committee. I am here supporting the work of his \ncommittee.\n  Friends and colleagues who want to be more demonstrative and more \nzealous and more volatile on the issue of spending restraint now come \nalong and insist that we vote on an amendment such as this. We should \nsay enough is enough. We have listened to all of the arguments. We have \nbrought this bill to the Senate. The consensus has been achieved.\n  So, Mr. President, I move to table this amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is nondebatable.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me say to the Senator from Mississippi, with all \nrespect and affection----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a point of order: Is a motion to table \ndebatable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it is not.\n  Is there objection to the Senator continuing?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Arizona was \nsuggesting that he be allowed 2 minutes to comment on this amendment. I \nhave no objection to him having 2 minutes. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat he be granted 2 minutes to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just amend that unanimous consent \nrequest, in case the Senator from Mississippi wants to respond to those \n2 minutes, that he would have an additional 2 minutes, if he needs it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond as to why this \namendment is necessary and why I do not think it is nitpicking. I think \na lot of us would have liked to have known who sponsored the amendments \nthat were put into the Defense appropriations bill by former \nRepresentative Cunningham, who is now in jail. We would have been very \nwell illuminated by the tens of millions of dollars that were somehow \nput into an appropriations bill in the middle of the night that none of \nus had ever seen or heard of. And we did not know who was behind it \nuntil he was on trial.\n  It is perfectly clear--it is perfectly clear--that this is not a \nnitpicking amendment. The people of this country deserve to know who \nputs in these projects in conference in the middle of the night, as a \nformer Congressman was able to do named Cunningham, ripping off the \ntaxpayers of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. That is why \nthis amendment is not nitpicking.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very happy to be here today as we are \nvery near to passing the ethics and lobbying reform legislation. This \nis important\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nlegislation, and it is legislation the American people care about. I am \nso glad the Senate has been able to take the lead in enacting these \nimportant reforms.\n  Let's step back a minute from the details of the legislation and \nremind Members of the Senate and the American public why we are here. \nIn the past year, America has been shocked, and some have certainly \nbeen disgusted, by revelations of corruption in our current system. \nWhile much of the behavior at issue in some of these scandals is \nalready illegal, the scandals have shown that some outsiders and \ninsiders believed they could act with impunity. It has shaken public \nconfidence in the Congress and our entire Federal Government.\n  Congress needed to act aggressively and swiftly, and we did that. I \nam very proud of those on this side of the aisle, in my caucus. When we \nreturned to session earlier this year, the first thing we did as \nDemocrats was unite behind the Honest Leadership Act. We moved beyond \nprinciples and speeches and introduced a strong reform bill, with the \nsupport of virtually the entire caucus. The entire caucus worked to \nachieve the effort here today. Senators Obama and Feingold led the way. \nThen we arrived at the committee structure, where on my side of the \naisle, Senators Dodd and Lieberman worked with integrity and swiftness, \nintelligence, experience, and part of that was that they worked with \ntheir counterparts, Senator Collins and Senator Lott, to allow us to \narrive at the point where we are today.\n  The baseline was a bill that we introduced. But people kept pushing \nand we have gotten something done. As I have already said, the Rules \nCommittee and Homeland Security Committee worked in a bipartisan way. \nWe worked in a bipartisan way to get where we are today. Included in \nthe bills that came to this floor was much of what was contained in the \nlegislation we introduced, the Honest Leadership Act.\n  I express my appreciation to Senators Lott, Dodd, Collins, and \nLieberman, who have acted, I believe, in an exemplary way in moving \nlegislation forward.\n  This is a good day for the Senate. I repeat, we are here as a result \nof bipartisan legislation. We are going to complete this legislation. \nThis is not a perfect bill, I know that. I would like to have seen some \nother things in this legislation, as would other Democrats, and I am \nsure other Republicans. But the bill makes a number of extremely \nimportant changes to lobbying disclosure rules and Senate ethics rules. \nIn many cases, the legislation is exactly what Democrats called for in \nour Honest Leadership Act.\n  Let's talk about what we have done today. We are going to have \npundits talk about what we didn't do. But let's talk about what we did \ndo. We should be proud of what we have done. We are going to extend and \nstrengthen rules against the revolving door. We are going to end gifts \nand meals from lobbyists. We have new rules for privately paid travel, \nrequiring preclearance and added disclosure. What we will do in this \nlegislation is clarify the pay-to-play scheme that some have referred \nto as the K Street Project that is unethical and violates Senate rules. \nThis legislation eliminates floor privileges for former Members who \nbecome lobbyists. This legislation strengthens lobbying disclosure \nrules, and that is an understatement. This legislation requires new \ndisclosure of ``astro turf'' lobbying campaigns and stealth coalitions \nused by business groups. This legislation reforms rules regarding \nearmarks, scope of conference, and availability of conference reports. \nWe should all feel that is an improvement and a significant step \nforward.\n  I repeat that this bill is not perfect, but it is a significant \nimprovement over current law and it will help restore the public's \nconfidence in Government. I am proud of the efforts of my colleagues to \nget this legislation passed today. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader and I are seen in the eyes of the \npublic as always being like a couple of bighorn sheep in rutting \nseason, running and bashing heads and moving back. That is what the \npublic sees. But this legislation could not have come to the floor \ntoday but for the work we did together--we did together--not anything \non which we gave speeches and issued press releases. We are here today \nas a result of the work we did together.\n  Only the majority leader and I know how difficult it is to get a bill \nto the point it is today. So I extend my hand to the majority leader \nfor working with us to get lobbying reform done. I repeat for the \nfourth time during my short remarks today, this is not perfect, but \npeople focus on how much we have done to improve the system. There are \nother days and other legislation that can come forward, but today, \nlet's feel good about a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I again express my appreciation to the managers of this bill. They \ndid remarkably good work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier this year, I made a commitment, \nwith the Democratic leader, to make lobbying and ethics reform a top \npriority this year and not just another political talking point. By \npassing lobbying reform today, the Senate, in a way that demonstrates \nus working together in a bipartisan way, will fulfill that commitment.\n  I am pleased the Senate has led the way. We were the first to develop \nideas through a bipartisan working group, the first to introduce a \ncomprehensive lobbying reform package to two committees, the first to \nhave those committee hearings and markups, the first to debate those \nissues on the floor of a body, and today we will pass the first \nlobbying reform bill in Congress in over a decade.\n  The goals of this legislation are simple, they are straightforward. \nIt is about trust. It is about transparency. It is about \naccountability. Trust is the foundation of our democratic government. \nWe are a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. \nThe American people have entrusted us with their votes, have entrusted \nus with their hard-earned tax dollars, and they expect us to uphold the \nhighest standards of honesty, of integrity. With public opinion of \nCongress at an alltime low, we have to do a better job of regaining \nthat trust and that confidence. We must bring more transparency and \naccountability into our Government. We must conduct our Nation's \nbusiness focusing on the public interest and not special interests. By \npassing this bill to reform our lobbying and ethics rules, we will do \njust that.\n  Among its many provisions, the bill will enhance public disclosure of \nlobbyist activities and campaign contributions, ban gifts and meals \nfrom registered lobbyists to Senators and staff, require enhanced \nscrutiny and Ethics Committee preapproval for privately funded travel, \nslow the revolving door between Government and lobbying, and reform our \nearmark process to cut pork-barrel spending.\n  I also thank the managers--Senator Lott, Senator Collins, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Dodd--for their tremendous work both in their \nrespective committees and, indeed, on the floor.\n  I thank Senator Santorum, who very early on, on the Republican side, \nstepped forward and with his leadership began a lobbying reform working \ngroup upon which much of this work has been based. Many of the \nprovisions in this bill are, in large part, a result of the meetings he \nhad.\n  I also thank all of my colleagues, again, as expressed by the \nDemocratic leader, on both sides of the aisle--and especially the \nDemocratic leader--for their cooperation in moving this legislation \nforward in a way and in a manner which I believe really dignifies this \nbody working together.\n  A lot of people say we have moved way too fast. An equal number say \nwe have moved too slow. Right now, there are many people coming forward \nsaying: No, we need to change these provisions. Adding to what the \nDemocratic leader said, this is not a perfect bill, but this bill is a \nmajor step forward. It is a product of working together, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  In closing, most everyone agrees that we have taken the issue of \nlobbying and ethics reform seriously. Indeed, we have. We have produced \na strong and meaningful result that will have implications for years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) is \nabsent due to death in family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I take no contributions from special \ninterest PACS or lobbyists. My office operates under a set of rules \ngoverning our interaction with lobbyists that is stricter than current \nlaw. Regardless of any legislation, I always hold myself and my office \nto the highest standard of conduct in our service to the people of \nWisconsin.\n  The past several months, however, have highlighted for congressional \naction on lobbying and ethics reform. Public concern has increased \nabout both illegal and unethical activities involving lobbyists. These \ninclude well-funded special interest groups that disguise their \nactivities through the formation of coalitions, associations, and \ngrassroots campaigns; improper campaign finance practices; lavish gifts \nto Members of Congress and their staffs apparently in violation of \ncurrent congressional ethics rules; and earmarks slipped into \nlegislation as favors for lobbyists without debate on proper \nconsideration.\n  The actions of others have made it clear that our current regulations \non lobbying are outdated and ineffective. That is why I supported S. \n2349, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006. It \nis my hope that this legislation will move us toward restoring the \npublic confidence in Congress by shining light on congressional \nprocesses and cracking down on lobbyist influence.\n  I realize that this bill falls short in certain areas. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of the Honest Leadership Act, which would have gone \neven further than the Senate-passed bill in reigning in inappropriate \ngifts, travel, and influence on Members of Congress. I supported \namendments that would increase the transparency of Senate actions and \nvoted against cloture to give other Senators a chance to offer \namendments to strengthen the bill.\n  If the legislation passed by the Senate today had gone further in \nincreasing accountability for Members of Congress, it would have gone \nfurther in restoring the public faith. However, I believe it is also \nour responsibility to balance far-reaching legislation with the time \nconstraints before us. This bill is far from perfect but it is an \nimportant first step in putting an end to the ``culture of corruption'' \nthat has become a part of Washington.\n  Serving in Congress is a great honor--one we must earn by always \nmaking the welfare of our constituents and the Nation our sole \nmotivation. The current lobbying scandals show how far we have drifted \nfrom that ideal. But the reforms will do much to correct our course. \nAnd, as always, I will continue to hold myself and my office to the \nhighest standard of conduct in our service to the people of Wisconsin.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, pursuant to the order of March 28, I ask \nthat the Senate now begin consideration of S. 2454. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the time until 8 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill tomorrow, the time until 12 noon be equally \ndivided in the same form for debate only, and that at noon the chairman \nbe recognized in order to offer an amendment; provided further that \nthere then be debate only until 5:30, with the time divided in a \nsimilar fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2454) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to provide for comprehensive reform and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to clarify, we are now on what will be \npassionately discussed over the next several days, a very important \npiece of legislation that addresses the range of border security issues \nsurrounding enforcement, interior enforcement, temporary worker \nprograms--a debate which I know and expect will be civil and held with \ndignity, but what is a very difficult debate.\n  I will make a brief opening statement and then turn to the chairman \nand ranking member, but also I would like to make a statement shortly \nafter they do.\n  Mr. President, this debate, when you boil it down to its essence, is \nabout the American dream and the home that this country offers for so \nmany hard-working people--a difficult debate, an important debate. But \nit is also an issue about what it means to be a nation, and every \nnation must keep its citizens safe and its borders secure.\n  That is why we are starting with the Securing America's Borders Act, \na bill I introduced prior to the March recess. This bill acknowledges \nthe overriding principle that we must protect our citizens by securing \nour borders. A nation that cannot secure its borders cannot secure its \ndestiny or administer its laws.\n  The situation along our southern border now ranks as a serious \nnational security challenge, second only to the war on terror. Every \nday we discover new facts that show how delay and inaction is making \nAmerica less safe and less secure.\n  In January, officials discovered a massive tunnel stretching nearly a \nhalf mile from Tijuana to San Diego. We don't know how many more snuck \nin. We do know that mixed in with the families seeking a better life \nare drug dealers, human traffickers, terrorists, and common criminals \nwho cross our border into this country every day.\n  But the danger is not only to America. It is danger to those who try \nto\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\ncross our borders as well. Unofficial data collected along the Arizona \nborder shows that nearly 225 people died last year crossing that \nborder. About 10 percent perished under circumstances that suggest foul \nplay.\n  We all know the terrible stories of criminals who prey on vulnerable \nmigrants, who charge outrageous prices to smuggle them across the \nborder and then often abandon them at the moment trouble strikes. It is \nwrong. It is time for us to act. And over the next week and a half on \nthis floor we will act.\n  The bill that I introduced includes a number of commonsense consensus \nmeasures that improve security along our physical border, crack down on \nhuman smugglers, simplify the process of deporting wrongdoers, and make \nit easier for employers to confirm their employees' legal status.\n  First and foremost, we need better enforcement and we need more \nmanpower on the ground. Last year, the Senate led the charge to provide \nfunding for 1,000 additional officers, more equipment, and more \ndetention beds. That was a start but only a start.\n  My proposal adds nearly 15,000 more officers over the next few years \nin a sustained and focused effort to buttress the nearly 20,000 already \ndeployed to work on border issues.\n  It also requires new investments in unmanned aerial vehicles, \ncameras, and sensors, and a comprehensive national border security \nstrategy.\n  It establishes a long-term project of building a virtual barrier to \ncover every mile of our 1,951-mile border with Mexico.\n  This will both make America safer, and it will reduce the number of \npeople endangering themselves trying to come into our country.\n  In addition to physically strengthening our border, the bill makes it \neasier for the Department of Homeland Security to catch people who \nviolate our immigration laws.\n  It enhances the collection of biometric data about who enters the \ncountry. And it allows the department to set up additional border \ncheckpoints. Moreover, the border security bill creates tough, new \npenalties for human smugglers and document forgers.\n  Under this bill, terrorists, dangerous gang members, and others with \nserious criminal connections face expedited removal from the United \nStates.\n  But this bill doesn't just draw on the common sense of the American \npeople for its provisions. It also looked to the 9/11 Commission Report \nfor guidance. This Commission recommended that we consolidate border \nscreening systems. The border security bill does just that.\n  It encourages the use of biometric data to keep track of who is \ncoming and going. Again, the border security bill does just that. It \nidentified the need of State and local officials to work with Federal \nagencies to identify terrorist suspects. The border security bill does \njust that.\n  Securing the border and enforcing our laws are crucial first steps to \nmaking America safer. But much more remains to be done. And we will \naddress these other issues over the next week and a half.\n  There are over 11 million people in this country llegally. Congress \nsimply cannot turn a blind eye to this growing number. We need to act. \nOur Nation is founded on the rule of law by generations upon \ngenerations of immigrants. We should not have to choose between these \nfounding principles. Instead, we need to honor both traditions.\n  In my view, neither the House bill nor the bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee yet quite strikes that appropriate balance, and \nboth need to be improved. I believe the House bill is incomplete \nbecause it fails to provide a comprehensive solution to our immigration \nsituation, one that allows for necessary and helpful legal immigration \nand that welcomes those who play by the rules.\n  We should reward those who respect the rule of law, who made it here \nthe right way, and who are trying to make it here the right way. I \nbelieve the committee bill by contrast goes too far in granting illegal \nimmigrants with what most Americans will see as amnesty.\n  I disagree with this approach not just as a matter of principle but \nbecause granting amnesty now will only encourage future and further \ndisrespect for the law. It will undermine our efforts to secure our \nhomeland. There are better ways to address this issue.\n  Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn have a proposal. Senator Specter had a \nchairman's mark and a proposed compromise, and all of these approaches \ncreated a temporary worker program without a grant of amnesty. We need \nto find a legal way for employers to find the people they need to keep \ntheir businesses running and continue to grow the economy. Creating \nlegal paths of immigration is a way to do this.\n\n  In the end, it is my hope we will have a bill which has both strong \nenforcement mechanisms with additional border and interior security and \nreal employer accountability that addresses the humanitarian and \neconomic challenges we now face without amnesty.\n  America has always been the place where one can come to live out a \ndream of improvement and renewal. But while we welcome those who \nrefresh and restore our American spirit, we have always done so within \na framework of the law. The full Senate should have a chance to \ndiscuss, to deliberate, to debate, and to decide how we balance that \nrule of law with the situation as we find it. We are here to solve \nproblems and not to stand by as problems get worse. Those problems are \ngetting worse. We need to work together so that all 100 Senators have \nthe opportunity to work within our rules to solve this problem.\n  The committee bill, while not perfect, makes real and significant \nprogress in many areas. I believe it can be improved upon. It has \nformalized a new consensus in the Senate, one that did not exist a year \nago, on aggressive provisions to protect our borders, including new \ndetection technologies, significant new increases in Border Patrol \nagents, tough provisions on alien smuggling and, for the first time, a \nreal employer verification enforcement title.\n  As is the right of the chairman, the Judiciary Committee product will \nbe offered as an amendment to the Border Patrol security bill that has \nbeen introduced. Moreover, I expect a whole series of amendments which \nwill attempt to tighten the amnesty and temporary worker provisions in \nthe judicial bill. I intend to support those amendments.\n  I recognize we have important principled differences that will be \nexpressed in the Senate with conviction and with passion over the next \nseveral days. I expect the debate to be contentious. I also expect it \nwill be civil and it will be respectful. I invite all who have ideas to \nwork with us. Together we can bring our best to bear on the problem of \nillegal immigration so America is safer and is more secure.\n  As I said when I introduced my bill, I want this coming debate to \nreflect our commitment to the rule of law and to our proud immigrant \ninheritance. We are a nation of immigrants. We have all benefited from \nAmerica's uniquely inclusive ethos. But America is also a nation of \nlaws. Our laws bind us and protect us. They transform us from seekers \ninto citizens. They are the very foundation of our democracy.\n  I am glad many agree on the need to ensure our debate is in the best \nkeeping of the Senate's tradition. We ought to be honest about the \nproblems we face, face them directly, and be honest about the outcomes \nwe seek, within a framework of conversation that does credit to the \nSenate and to the Nation. We will conduct this debate with respect and \nseriousness.\n  I look forward to a thorough discussion over the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity to take \nwhat could be a historic stand on reforming our immigration system, \nwhere many problems exist, including border security, ports, people \ncoming into our country whom we cannot identify, posing a potential \nsecurity risk from terrorists entering the United States. There are \nsome 11 million undocumented aliens in the United States who are \nunwilling to step forward because of their concern of being prosecuted \nand deported. We have an economy which relies very heavily on immigrant \nlabor.\n  We have now come to the point where legislation has been introduced \nwhich tackles these problems. The majority leader has said there will \nbe passionate\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\narguments. That is certainly true. Emotions run very high on these \nissues.\n  Some say we are a nation defined by the rule of law and that has been \nflagrantly violated by the 11 million people who have come to this \ncountry without conforming to the U.S. law. Many others who have come \non visas have overstayed their leave. And, at the same time, we pride \nourselves on being a compassionate nation. No one can deny that the \nUnited States of America is a nation built by immigrants. No one can \ndeny that.\n  In my own personal situation, my own family is Exhibit A. My father \ncame to this country in 1911 when he was 18 because the Czar wanted to \nsend him to Siberia. He preferred Pennsylvania. So he came to the \nUnited States. My mother came at the age of 6 with her family and \nsettled in St. Joe, MO. My brother and my two sisters and I have \ncontributed to life in America. Our story is replicated by millions of \npeople who have come from foreign shores and who have created a life \nfor themselves, as the majority leader says, the American dream. And \npeople still clamor to come to the United States because of the quality \nof life in this country, because of our democratic institutions, \nbecause of freedom of speech, because of educational opportunities and \neconomic growth, and a chance to have a better livelihood and a \nsuperior way of life.\n\n  When the majority leader comments about the committee bill and says \nit is amnesty, I disagree with him head on. It is not amnesty. It is \nnot amnesty because the lawbreakers are not being unconditionally \nforgiven for their transgressions. The lawbreakers, in order to move \nforward and stay in the United States and move toward a citizenship \npath, have to pay a fine. They have to pay their back taxes. They have \nto undergo a rigorous background examination. They have to work for 6 \nyears. They have to earn the right to move toward a citizenship track.\n  If there is a better way to bring these 11 million people forward so \nthat we can identify them, we are open to any suggestions which anyone \nmay have. The Judiciary Committee has worked on this issue for months. \nWe have had hearings. We have had analysis in the committee on markups. \nWe faced the leader's requirement that the bill be finished before \nyesterday, before Tuesday, or the Senate would proceed on the leader's \nbill as opposed to the committee bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee prides itself on getting its work done. We \ngot our work done. It was not easy, but we did it. In an unusual \nsession, people returned early from the recess, came back on a Sunday. \nIt doesn't happen around here, unfortunately. It should, but it \ndoesn't. We ought to work more Mondays. We are going to work Friday of \nthis week on this bill. We started at 10 o'clock on Monday morning and \nwith a short recess break we worked through until past 6 o'clock in the \nafternoon. People who are watching C-SPAN may not be too interested in \nwhat a quorum is, but that is when 10 Senators are present out of 18. \nThat is hard to do, especially when some Senators are in Iraq.\n  With the cooperation of the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, and the committee members generally, we were able to complete \nour task and complete and report out a bill on Monday of this week. \nThat bill will be the replacement bill on behalf of the leader's bill.\n  While the leader is still on the floor, I say in his presence, his \nbill is up about noon tomorrow. The committee bill will be a \nreplacement bill which will form the substance of the Senate \ndeliberation.\n  I thank the committee members for their hard work. We have taken \nthoughtful, constructive legislation introduced by Senator McCain and \nSenator Kennedy, and thoughtful, construction legislation introduced by \nSenator Kyl and Senator Cornyn, and suggestions made by other Senators, \nand have molded them into what we call a chairman's mark. That is the \nname for the amalgamated bill that was the basis for our consideration.\n  We have moved ahead. It was my hope that we might have structured \naccommodation, a compromise among the competing ideas. After debating \nit extensively on Monday afternoon, it was determined we could not \naccomplish that, but we are still working on it. We yet may be able to \nstructure a bill which will have more of what Senator Kyl and Senator \nCornyn were looking for than the final committee product. But all of \nthat remains to be seen.\n  However, we have produced a bill and the majority leader \ncharacterized it as ``while not perfect, significant progress,'' and I \nwould not disagree with the majority leader's characterization that it \nis not perfect. I have been here a while and I haven't seen a perfect \nbill yet. I hope to be here a while longer and I do not anticipate \nseeing a perfect bill. This bill, however much it is improved, is not \ngoing to be perfect, in any event.\n  We have provided for border security. We have what we call a virtual \nfence. Unmanned drones will patrol the borders. There will be overhead \nsatellite control. We have very vastly increased the number of border \nagents. We have provisions for employer verification, worked out with \nthe cooperation of Senator Grassley, who is not only a member of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary but also chairman of the Committee on \nFinance. That is on a title which is yet to be added and will be added \non the floor. We have a little jurisdictional issue, but we have worked \nout employer verification. Employer verification is a very major aspect \nof securing our borders.\n  We are going to have people come to the United States because of \nopportunity here, no matter what we do. We want to avoid the \ncircumstance President Bush described in a Saturday address last week \nof having people come to the United States in 18-wheelers. What is an \n18-wheeler? It is a big truck that has 18 wheels and people are stuffed \ninto it. Many have died trying to come into this country in that way.\n  We have the realistic prospect of having an identification card, much \nlike a credit card, which can go through an electronic process so that \nprospective employers will know whether the applicant for a job is here \nlegally. If the employer hires the applicant knowing they are illegal, \nthere will be tough employer sanctions to try to stop that practice.\n  As long as there is opportunity in this country, and without a guest \nworker program which will satisfy the needs of our economy, we are \ngoing to have people who will be determined to come here legally or \nillegally, any way they can get here.\n  We had a very important amendment offered by Senator Feinstein, who \nhad worked with Senator Craig, on agriculture. The statement was made \nby Senator Craig, and I believe it to be accurate, that agriculture in \nAmerica would collapse--tough word--collapse without migrant labor. \nThis committee bill includes a worker program which has been the \ncornerstone of what President Bush has urged.\n  I was pleased today to hear that Speaker Dennis Hastert commented he \nfavors a guest worker program, which would be a significant addition to \nwhat the House of Representatives has passed, an enforcement program. \nThat is the recognition that it is necessary for the American economy \nto have people come into this country to help us on the farms, in the \nhotels, in the restaurants, in so many lines of American work.\n  It is a good sign that when we function in conference under our \nbicameral system--the House has passed a bill; I am confident we will \npass a bill in the Senate on immigration; and it is subject to \nmodification and the will of the Senate--but with the recognition by \nthe Speaker of a guest worker program, that is a very positive sign.\n  We have improved the situation with respect to visas for highly \nqualified people. William Gates was in Washington, lobbying--a pretty \nhigh-priced lobbyist--to come talk about the needs of Microsoft--a \nmarvelous company, high tech, enormous advances for America--he wants \nmore people with Ph.D.s and wants a larger quota of visas for those \npeople to come in. We have accommodated that. And we have created more \nopportunities for people to come in who are students. If we can bring \nmore brains to the United States, we are going to be anxious to do so.\n  I believe it is important to say, simultaneously, that we are making \nstrenuous efforts to avoid bringing people into this country where \nthere are Americans who can handle the jobs. If\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\nAmericans can handle the jobs, we are not going to be bringing in other \npeople. We will give those jobs to Americans first. And before \nemployers may seek guest workers, under our legislation, there has to \nbe a showing that the jobs could not be filled by Americans.\n  We have tackled, in the committee bill, the 11 million undocumented \naliens, candidly, as best we could. We pride ourselves on being a \nnation of laws, and those who are here undocumented have come into the \nUnited States in violation of our laws. And now the question is, what \ndo we do? We do not want to have a fugitive class in America. We do not \nwant to have an underclass in America.\n  To contemplate, to even theorize about going out and taking 11 \nmillion people into custody is an impossibility. And if you took them \ninto custody, they have to be detained before they have a deportation \nproceeding. Where will you detain them? Where are there detention \nfacilities? Where are there beds? Where are there accommodations to \nkeep them for deportation proceedings?\n  So if we have a realistic expectation that these undocumented aliens \nwill have to come forward, there is going to have to be a program which \nwill encourage them to come forward. We are not going to go out and \narrest them and find them. And they have to know there is consideration \nfor their plight, even though they are here without complying with U.S. \nlaw. And they do have to pay a fine. They do have to pay their back \ntaxes. They do have to work for 6 years. And they have to undergo a \nbackground check. They have to comply with U.S. laws.\n  So it is not a free ticket. It is not amnesty. This word ``amnesty'' \nis a code word. It is a code word to try to smear good-faith \nlegislation to deal with this problem. If you move away from the label, \nif you move away from the smear word and analyze what is going on, I \nthink it is fairly stated that we do not have amnesty.\n  One line which we have not yet finished is the issue of judicial \nreform, judicial review. We need to have more in the way of immigration \njudges--better trained, better qualified--to handle the tough jobs \nwhich they have.\n  Then, we have an appellate line, the Board of Immigration Appeals, \nwhere the number has been cut from 23 to 11, and they are filing one-\npage opinions, which puts an enormous burden on judicial review in the \ncircuit courts. Our bill will return that number to 23. We will call \nupon the Board of Immigration Appeals to write opinions so the circuit \ncourt will know what their reasons are, to take a burden from the \ncircuit court of being required to start from ground zero to figure out \nwhat is going on in a case.\n  The chairman's mark has a provision that will consolidate appeals in \nthe Federal circuit. We have had a good bit of objection to that from \nthe Judicial Conference and from very prominent judges. Before moving \nahead, we did not include that in the bill which we reported out of \ncommittee. Instead, we are going to have a hearing next Monday. We may \neven get in the habit in the Senate of working on Mondays. Who knows \nwhat may come from this bill?\n  We are going to bring in experts in the field. We are going to bring \nin the chief judge of the Federal circuit. We are going to bring in the \nchief judge of the Second Circuit, which has a very heavy burden. The \nchief judge of the Ninth Circuit is not available. We will have other \nrepresentation from the Ninth Circuit to analyze that issue, to know \nmore about the structure as to what we will be doing there.\n  But I believe we are off to a good start. I believe that when we \nreplace Senator Frist's bill with the committee bill, we will have a \ncomprehensive reform package on the table. Then we will work the will \nof the Senate. We came close to striking a compromise, as I said, on \nMonday afternoon, and it was not successful. But it is going to be \nrevisited. I think we may yet be able to take portions of the Kyl-\nCornyn bill and integrate them into the committee bill, which relies \nvery significantly on McCain-Kennedy, to present an even more balanced \napproach.\n  May I say, in conclusion, that we ask Senators to file their \namendments. We have a difficult job. Instead of having 2 weeks, we are \ngoing to have, starting on Thursday--and Friday is always subject to \nsome question as to how late in the day we can go, if at all--and then \nwe have next week. And the temper of the Senate is to try to finish on \nThursday when we look toward a recess, especially the Easter recess. I \nam being very pragmatic here as to what we are doing, but I would not \nbe surprised if the leader was prepared to keep us in beyond Thursday \nnight, beyond even Friday.\n  So I urge--and I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, \njoins me in this--Senators to come forward with their amendments and be \nprepared to debate them and to start to think about time limits and to \nbe aware that we are going to hold the votes to 15 plus 5. We have many \nvotes which are held into the 30- to 40-minute category, which cuts \ninto the floor time to get this important work done.\n  And now, with another pat on the back to Senator Leahy for his \ntireless efforts and support, and who had a lot of things he wanted to \ndo in Vermont--it is hard to get Senator Leahy out of Vermont any \nearlier than absolutely necessary--he was back here on Sunday, and he \nwas there on Monday. And with the help of the committee--and we had \npretty good attendance--we reported out a bill. I accept the leader's \ncharacterization: while not perfect, significant progress. Let's make \nsome more progress, and let's get some real immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania for his kind words. I have told him privately, and I will \nsay it publicly, he has acted as a chairman should. I have been here 31 \nyears, now going on my 32nd year. I have seen great chairmen in both \nparties in this institution. I have seen others who were chairmen in \nboth parties.\n  Senator Specter is in the mold of the great chairmen. He took a very \ndifficult bill, by his own force of will--as he has with others--and \nkept us together, made sure we had discussions. We went across the \npolitical spectrum. We had people who feel very strongly, and rightly \nso, who had differing views--all distinguished Members of the Senate. \nHe herded them together, kept us together, and kept us in, doing what \nhas been a rarity: the type of Monday session he had to make it work.\n  I can assure colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, we would not \nhave this bill on the floor, in an ability where the Senate cannot only \nwork its will but do a fine piece of legislation, were it not for \nSenator Specter. Senator Specter made it possible with his leadership.\n  Senator Kennedy, on our side, has worked on these issues since before \nany of us presently on the floor were in the Senate. And with the work \nof Senators from both sides of the aisle, we have a bill that provides \na realistic, a reasonable system for immigration.\n  We voted in a bipartisan majority. We have seen, over the years, the \nJudiciary Committee become more polarized. We have seen, in the past \ncouple of years, more and more strongly bipartisan votes. In this case, \nit was a bipartisan majority with a vote of 12 to 6, with two-thirds of \nthe members of the committee voting in favor of a bill that protects \nAmerica's borders, strengthens enforcement, and--and this is what is so \nimportant--remains true to American values.\n  The Judiciary Committee has confronted the challenging problem of how \nto fix our broken immigration system head on. It has sent to the Senate \na good product. The committee met six times to debate a proposal \noffered by the chairman, meeting for long hours and considering dozens \nof amendments. The debate was substantive. It was civil. It was \nbipartisan. It was effective. And it was productive.\n  I might say, had it not been for superb staff on both sides of the \naisle, this would not have been possible. I think of the members of my \nown staff. I would log on sometimes at midnight, when I would get home \nfrom other things, and their e-mails were pouring in from the work they \nhad done. I would go back on the e-mails at 5 or 6 o'clock in the \nmorning, and there were new ones. They were working around the clock.\n  We were given a deadline of March 27 by the Senate Republican \nleadership. I understood that the majority leader\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\nhad committed to turn to the committee bill if we were able to meet his \ndeadline and report a bill by Monday night. It was difficult. At times \nit was a Herculean task that seemed almost the task of Sisyphus. It \nseemed undoable and the deadline impossible, but under the steady \nleadership of the chairman, with the hard work and dedication of so \nmany members of the committee--again, I compliment Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts on our side who worked so hard on this--we worked through \nthe long hours and numerous amendments and accomplished what seemed to \nbe the impossible.\n  When I mention those two Senators, it is not to leave out other \nSenators. We had so many who brought up amendment after amendment, who \nworked hard on it, all trying to get a bipartisan bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee sent this resounding message, as I said, with \na bill with a bipartisan vote of 12 to 6, with strong bipartisan \nsupport of every key amendment. These were not party-line amendments. \nThese were bipartisan amendments. It is a bill that is strong on \nenforcement and in some ways stronger than the bill passed by the other \nbody.\n  It includes a provision added by Senator Feinstein, for example, to \nmake tunneling under our borders a Federal crime. It is tough on \nemployer enforcement. And it is tough on traffickers.\n  It is also comprehensive and balanced. It confronts the problem of 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants who live in the shadows. It values \nwork. It respects human dignity. And it includes guest worker \nprovisions that have been supported by both business and labor. It \nincludes a way to pay fines and earn citizenship that has the support \nof religious and leading Hispanic organizations.\n  These provisions are not amnesty. I spent enough years in law and \nenough years as a prosecutor. I know what amnesty is. These are not \namnesty. Undocumented immigrants already in the country would not get \nto cut to the front of the line, but, in accordance with the \ncommittee's bipartisan plan, will need to pay fines, pay back taxes, \nwork hard, and wait in line for green cards. They have to pass \nbackground checks and play by the rules. With fines and hard work and \ngoing to the back of the line, after 11 years, by following a regular \npath to legal status, the currently undocumented will join as full \nparticipants in American society. Following this plan, we could create \nan orderly system for immigration that is consistent with traditional \nAmerican values and our history.\n\n  Opponents of a fair, comprehensive approach are quick to claim that \nanything but the most punitive provisions are amnesty. They are wrong. \nWe had an amnesty bill. President Reagan signed an amnesty bill in \n1986. This is not an amnesty bill. An editorial in the New York Times \nentitled ``It Isn't Amnesty'' makes the point that painting the word \n``deer'' on a cow and taking it into the woods does not make that cow a \ndeer. Frankly, in the State of Vermont, we deer hunters know the \ndifference between a cow and a deer. We better. Our committee bill \nshould not be falsely labeled. Our bill is more properly called what it \nis--a smart, tough bill.\n  The committee also voted to add several constructive and practical \nmeasures to the chairman's mark. We added a new version of the \nAgricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or AgJOBS, \na bill I have long supported. I was joined in that bipartisan effort by \nSenator Larry Craig. AgJOBS will reform the H-2A visa program for \ntemporary agricultural labor. This new version will help dairy farmers \nin Vermont and many other States to legally hire foreign workers. The \nbipartisan provision approved by the panel would make dairy workers \nable to work under visas for up to 3 years, with the opportunity to \nadjust to permanent residence and achieve their full potential to \nbecome eligible for higher paying occupations.\n  The American people are engaging with us in this debate. The Nation's \nnewspapers reflect the public's growing interest in how these decisions \nwill be settled. In my home State, the Burlington Free Press and the \nRutland Daily Herald have offered thoughtful editorial observations \nabout these issues. I commend these editorials to the attention of my \ncolleagues, and I will at the end of my statement include them.\n  The committee also adopted an amendment to include the bipartisan \nDevelopment, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, called the \nDREAM Act. This provision will allow immigrant students to attend \ncollege and become permanent residents if they follow the rules \nestablished in the act. It will free eligible students from the \nconstant fear of deportation, while allowing them to work so they can \nafford to pay for college. By our bipartisan committee vote, we hope to \nextend Hispanic young people greater educational opportunities so they \nmay realize the American dream and achieve their potential.\n  The committee agreed--wisely, I believe--to drop several \ncontroversial provisions. Early in the process, I led an effort to \nremove a provision directing the Department of Homeland Security to \nstudy building a barrier, a fence, a wall along our northern border \nwith Canada.\n  If I might just for a moment, I live less than an hour's drive from \nCanada. I see people go back and forth across that border all the time, \nfamilies who live on both sides. My wife is a first-generation \nAmerican. She was born in Vermont literally a couple hundred yards from \nthe Canadian border. Her parents were naturalized citizens coming from \nthe Province of Quebec. When I come home and she is speaking French on \nthe phone, I know she is talking with some of her relatives in Canada. \nBut tens of thousands of families, probably far more than that, cross \nthe northern border.\n  There are also businesses. We even have a store in Vermont where \nthere is a line painted down the center of the store, a cash register \non one side of the store with Canadian money and a cash register on the \nother side with U.S. money. Why? Because half the store is in Canada \nand half in the United States. With the proposal that was before us of \nthis barrier, this fence, it was going to be Joe would get a passport \nand bring me that box of Rice Krispies from the other side of the \nstore. I mean, it gets down to that. There are businesses up and down \nthe same way. When this proposal faced the light of day, we understood \nit easily.\n  There were other controversial provisions that we wisely dropped, \nprovisions that would have exposed those who provide humanitarian \nrelief--medical care, shelter, counseling, and other basic services--to \nundocumented aliens to possible prosecution under felony alien \nsmuggling provisions of the criminal law. If somebody is running a food \nbank or a shelter for battered children and women and they give aid, \nthey help people, they feed the hungry, if you have an order of nuns \nwho feed the hungry, under those circumstances, they faced a chance of \nbeing charged with a crime. For shame, for shame. Let's accept the \nbeatitudes as something that should go across all faiths, across all \nlaws. I thank so many in the relief and religious communities for \nspeaking out on this matter. Those criminal provisions should be \nfocused on the smugglers. Under the committee bill, that is what we \ndo--go after the real criminals, the smugglers, people who trade in \nhuman lives.\n\n  The committee also voted down a measure that would have criminalized \nmere presence in an undocumented status in the United States. Illegal \nstatus is currently a civil offense with very serious consequences, \nincluding deportation. But criminalizing that status was punitive and \nwrong. Let's be realistic. Are you going to go out and lock up over 10 \nmillion people? It would have led to further harsh consequences. It \nwould have trapped people in permanent underclass status, unwilling to \nmove into the mainstream of society.\n  These policies, which were included in the House-passed bill and \nsupported there by congressional Republicans, understandably sparked \nnationwide protests. They were viewed as anti-immigrant and \ninconsistent with American values and history, American values that \nattracted my grandparents to come here from Italy to settle in Vermont \nor my great grandparents to come from Ireland and do the same.\n  The committee bill was tough on enforcement and very properly so \ntough on the smugglers. It is smarter and fairer.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman for setting aside provisions in the \nmark\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\nthat would have consolidated all immigration appeals from around the \nNation into the jurisdiction of the Federal circuit, the court of \nappeals for the Federal circuit. That is a court we have wisely set up \nin recent years in Washington because it has specialized jurisdiction. \nIt was created to hear patent appeals and cases involving technical \nintellectual property issues, those issues which have so much to do \nwith the economy of our country. It was not set up to hear immigration \nappeals. In fact, the Judicial Conference, chaired by now Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts and Federal judges from across the country, expressed \nserious concerns with these proposals. The chairman did the right thing \nwhen he agreed to hold a hearing and further consider what provisions \nwill best correct the problems created by former Attorney General \nAshcroft's ill-conceived actions with respect to these matters in \ncutting down the number of people who could handle such matters.\n  I ask everybody to look at the peaceful demonstrations around the \ncountry over the last week. I will pick just one--in Los Angeles, half \na million people. I can't help but notice that. We have slightly over \n600,000 people in my State. They had almost the population of my State \nin a peaceful demonstration in Los Angeles. They were calling on us, \ncalling on the Congress, the U.S. Senate and our colleagues in the \nother body, to recognize the human dignity of all. These aren't \nnumbers. These aren't numbers. These are human beings. Do the right \nthing. We can do it in keeping with the longstanding American values. \nLet's not take the attitude that we are here, so no one else should be \nhere. We are a nation of immigrants. We really are. In this case, if we \nare going to truly have the American dream, we also need a \ncomprehensive solution to what has become a national problem. We need a \nfair, realistic, and reasonable system that includes both tough \nenforcement but immigration reform provisions. The bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee is that bill.\n  This could be a pivotal moment in helping to achieve that goal. The \nJudiciary Committee's debate has produced a bill that I believe would \nmake my grandparents proud. But I think it would make the ancestors of \nall of us proud. It is worthy of our support. We should stop and think \nfor a moment in this body, this exclusive body--there are only 100 of \nus who get a chance at any given time to represent almost 290 million \nAmericans--should we not do something that makes the country proud, \nmakes those other 290 million Americans proud and makes us in this body \nproud?\n  I thank the many individuals and organizations who were so helpful to \nus during committee consideration of the bill. Included among those \nsupporting this measure are many labor unions, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and other business groups, leading Hispanic organizations such \nas the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, many religious organizations, including the United \nStates Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorials from the Rutland Daily \nHerald, the Burlington Free Press, and the New York Times be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Mar. 28, 2006]\n\n                               One World\n\n       Vermont's economy is sending a mixed message. Unemployment \n     is low, and median family income is growing. But economic \n     growth is imperiled by a shortage of workers, and the costs \n     of housing and health care are becoming increasingly \n     burdensome.\n       The labor shortage is having several effects in the \n     economy. One of them is the appearance of large numbers of \n     illegal immigrants to work on the state's dairy farms. The \n     problem of illegal immigration will come before Congress this \n     week, and it is a contentious and complex issue. The \n     situation in Vermont is a microcosm.\n       It is often argued that workers from Mexico, legal or \n     illegal, are essential to the economy because they are \n     willing to do work that U.S. workers are unwilling to do. But \n     as Paul Krugman notes in the column below, workers shy away \n     from low-paying jobs because they are low-paying. If a farm \n     worker earned as much as a school teacher, there would be \n     more people willing to milk cows for a living. But farmers \n     are in a bind. If they had to pay that much for farm labor, \n     they would either have to raise the price of milk or they \n     would have to absorb a cost that few could afford. The price \n     of milk is out of their hands, and as long as illegal \n     immigrants are available to hire, they play a role providing \n     low-cost labor.\n       Thus, farmers who refuse to hire illegal immigrants find \n     themselves at a competitive disadvantage, forced to pay \n     higher wages for the same labor. That's why business \n     interests are among the chief proponents of allowing guest \n     workers into the country legally. Business reaps the benefit \n     of low-cost labor.\n       The result is that there is an underclass of workers, legal \n     or illegal, willing to work at wages below what is deemed by \n     many to be livable in the United States. It is a consequence \n     of our proximity to Mexico. Substandard wages in this country \n     are desirable to many Mexicans who, even earning low wages, \n     manage to send home money to support family members left \n     behind. The economic inequities between Mexico and the United \n     States cannot be abolished by passing a tough immigration \n     law, and the result is downward pressure on wages for \n     Americans.\n       That downward pressure exists in the industrial sector as \n     well. Many old companies have departed over the past 40 \n     years, replaced by a new brand of high-tech company or by \n     service sector jobs that pay less than traditional factory \n     jobs. Vermont has regained its footing after the industrial \n     decline that hurt Springfield, Rutland and Bennington so \n     badly, but continued industrial growth remains hampered by \n     the labor shortage caused by an aging population.\n       On top of these pressures are the extra burdens of high \n     housing and health care costs, which hit low- and middle-\n     income workers the hardest. Market forces beyond Vermont are \n     driving up those costs, and efforts in Montpelier by the \n     Douglas administration and the Legislature to ease the burden \n     of those costs are essential to future economic growth in the \n     state.\n       Thus, it is impossible to talk about Vermont's economy \n     without talking about the economy of the nation and the \n     world. The influx of farm workers from Mexico makes that \n     clear, but the rest of the economy, too, remains enmeshed \n     with the broader, changing world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 28, 2006]\n\n                  Immigration Bill Should Help Farmers\n\n       Vermont needs immigrant labor to help on dairy farms. There \n     are currently more than 2,000 Mexicans filling relatively \n     low-paying farm jobs that Vermonters won't accept. Without \n     that immigrant work force, some dairy farms would go \n     bankrupt.\n       That's a reality.\n       As the U.S. Senate focuses this week on immigration reform \n     changes, Congress should recognize the needs of farms for \n     this critical labor source. The Senate should create a \n     program to allow hard-working immigrants to legally hold jobs \n     in this country.\n       That might be structured much like the current program that \n     allows immigrant labor--primarily from Jamaica--to work for \n     less than a full year in Vermont picking apples.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday passed a good \n     version supported by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that suggests \n     a three-year work program that can be renewed.\n       The changes cannot create a permanent ``underclass,'' as \n     some have suggested. Instead, it should be based on ``common \n     sense, decency and reality,'' said Vermont Agriculture \n     Secretary Steve Kerr.\n       This is not a partisan issue. Vermont Sens. Jim Jeffords \n     and Leahy support such a change. President Bush has also \n     expressed a desire to enable immigrants to cross the border \n     and fill job vacancies, and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has \n     sponsored an agricultural jobs package.\n       There is resistance, however, from some senators who worry \n     about security threats linked to opening the borders in such \n     a way, and those who don't want to reward immigrants who have \n     broken the law to enter this country.\n       While it is important to tighten border security, this does \n     not preclude taking responsible steps to allow carefully \n     screened immigrants to hold jobs in Vermont that provide \n     income for their families and help the state's struggling \n     dairy industry.\n       ``This is a deciding issue,'' Kerr told the Free Press on \n     Monday, as the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington began \n     serious work on immigration legislation. ``This is a litmus \n     test.''\n       Kerr said Vermont farmers would certainly prefer to hire \n     local labor for these jobs. But, he said, it is virtually \n     impossible to find people willing to take these low-paying, \n     physically demanding jobs. The Mexican workers are paid \n     roughly $8 an hour, and the farmer provides many of the \n     basics, including housing and heat.\n       Creating a program that documents the arrival of those \n     workers makes sense. Local law enforcement would know who is \n     living in their communities, and the workers would have the \n     security of moving freely off the farm and knowing they \n     aren't at risk of automatic deportation.\n       Most importantly, farmers would have a reliable, hard-\n     working group of people helping with the milking and other \n     demanding farm tasks. For some, that might be the difference \n     between staying In business or throwing In the towel.\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 29, 2006]\n\n                            It Isn't Amnesty\n\n       Here's one way to kill a cow: take it into the woods in \n     hunting season, paint the word ``deer'' on it and stand back.\n       Something like that is happening in the immigration debate \n     in Washington. Attackers of a smart, tough Senate bill have \n     smeared it with the most mealy-mouthed word in the \n     immigration glossary--amnesty--in hopes of rendering it \n     politically toxic. They claim that the bill would bestow an \n     official federal blessing of forgiveness on an estimated 12 \n     million people who are living here illegally, rewarding their \n     brazen crimes and encouraging more of the same.\n       That isn't true. The bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee in a 12-to-6 vote on Monday, is one the country \n     should be proud of. Four Republicans, including the \n     committee's chairman, Arlen Specter, joined eight Democrats \n     in endorsing a balanced approach to immigration reform. The \n     bill does not ignore security and border enforcement. It \n     would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, add \n     resources for detaining illegal immigrants and deporting them \n     more quickly, and expand state and local enforcement of \n     immigration laws. It would create a system to verify workers' \n     identities and impose tougher punishments on employers who \n     defied it.\n       But unlike the bill's counterpart in the House, which makes \n     a virtue out of being tough but not smart, the Specter bill \n     would also take on the hard job of trying to sort out the \n     immigrants who want to stay and follow the rules from those \n     who don't. It would force them not into buses or jails but \n     into line, where they could become lawful residents and--if \n     they showed they deserved it--citizens. Instead of living off \n     the books, they'd come into the system.\n       The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill \n     wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record, a \n     steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine and back taxes, and \n     knowledge of English and civics. That's not ``amnesty,'' with \n     its suggestion of getting something for nothing. But the \n     false label has muddied the issue, playing to people's fear \n     and indignation, and stoking the opportunism of Bill Frist, \n     the Senate majority leader. Mr. Frist has his enforcement-\n     heavy bill in the wings, threatening to make a disgraceful \n     end run around the committee's work.\n       The alternatives to the Specter bill are senseless. The \n     enforcement-only approach--building a 700-mile wall and \n     engaging in a campaign of mass deportation and harassment to \n     rip 12 million people from the national fabric--would be an \n     impossible waste of time and resources. It would destroy \n     families and weaken the economy. An alternative favored by \n     many businesses--creating a temporary-worker underclass that \n     would do our dirtiest jobs and then have to go home, with no \n     new path to citizenship--is a recipe for indentured \n     servitude.\n       It is a weak country that feels it cannot secure its \n     borders and impose law and order on an unauthorized \n     population at the same time. And it is a foolish, insecure \n     country that does not seek to channel the energy of an \n     industrious, self-motivated population to its own ends, but \n     tries instead to wall out ``those people.''\n       It's time for President Bush, who talks a good game on \n     immigration, to use every means to clarify the issue and to \n     lead this country out of the ``amnesty'' semantic trap. He \n     dislikes amnesty. Mr. Frist dislikes amnesty. We dislike \n     amnesty, too.\n       The Specter bill isn't amnesty. It's a victory for \n     thoughtfulness and reason.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the distinguished Senator leaves the Senate \nfloor, Mr. Leahy, might I say that I was present while you spoke this \nafternoon. I was here when the distinguished chairman of the committee \nspoke. I commend both of you for the diligent and obviously hard work \nyou put in on a very hard subject for the American people. I think we \ngot off to a good start today. Your hearings set the right pace for \nAmericans to begin to understand that immigration is a complicated \nissue but that it can be solved. I am much more optimistic than I was a \ncouple of months ago that even with these timeframes which have been \ntough on you all, these mandates by our leader that you get things done \nby a time-certain, we have both been here long enough to know that \nmaybe that is how you get it done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico. We have known each other for over 30 years. I \nappreciate his words. I thank him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to speak today very \npersonally because I don't think very many people know, certainly \nlooking here at my good, new friend occupying the chair from the State \nof Oklahoma, I am quite certain he doesn't know that this Senator was \nborn by a mother who unknowingly was an illegal alien. She happened to \nbe Italian. We are now talking more about Hispanics, although not \nexclusively. But today in the Senate Hart Building, the Senator from \nNew Mexico had before him on the floor of his office, and in the chairs \nthat we had, about 30 Navajo young men and women--10th, 11th and 12th \ngraders--with a few adults, and about 5 or 6 students from a completely \ndifferent part of the State of New Mexico. They were sitting on the \nfloor asking me if I would talk to them about myself. ``Who are you?'' \nthey asked.\n  I started off by telling them who I was. I gave a little bit of a \nlesson on the Constitution, and about there being only two Senators \nfrom each State, and how lucky we are, because we have just as many \nSenators as New York has. Of course, they knew that. I told them that \nmight not seem fair, but the Constitution makes it fair because it is \nthe document of fairness.\n  Then we proceeded to talk about how I got here. I told them the story \nof how I ran for office on a dare and got elected. Then I talked about \nsome dates in our State's history. I said, in 1912, New Mexico became a \nState. Before that, in 1906, 2 boys arrived at Ellis Island with an \nuncle. One of these boys with the last name Domenici had a strange \nfirst name, Cherubino. People wondered what that was. In Italy, that \nwas a nice name that meant ``little angel.'' He was born the last child \nof that Domenici family because his mother died in childbirth, so they \nnamed him ``little angel.''\n  In 1906, Cherubino, who was my father, arrived at Ellis Island, \nhaving left a little town called Lucca, Italy. He arrives in \nAlbuquerque, NM, I told these young Indian students. He went to work in \na grocery store that, believe it or not, was named the Montezuma \nMercantile Company, and it was owned by Italian immigrants. These \nNavajo young people were wondering in awe, what are you talking about? \nI said, well, that is the way America was then. They welcomed aliens. \nThere were no illegal aliens. If you came from Europe during those \ntimes, they said, come, we want you. They didn't say you are \nautomatically a citizen, but they said come. These two boys were \nbrothers; my dad came with his brother. The reason why is something \nthat should not take the Senate's time tonight, other than to say they \nplanned to bring my father only, but he got scared to come without his \nbrother, so he cried and his brother said I will go, and then my dad \nsaid I will go, too. He said if you go, I will go. So his father played \nSolomon and sent them both. They went to France and got on a boat and \narrived in Albuquerque in 1906.\n  We became a State in 1912. If my math is right, that is 6 years \nlater. Guess what. By then, my father had bought the grocery store. He \nnever went to school, but you see, he was still able to buy the grocery \nstore. He was an alien. He worked hard and guess what happened. The war \ncame along. Don't get too far ahead of yourself. It was the First World \nWar. He got drafted as an alien. They put him in the Corps of \nEngineers. He told me one day: They wanted to promote me, but I told \nthem I didn't want another bar because I spoke English too poorly and I \nwas embarrassed to drill the boys. He was a little older than some of \nthem, but he turned down the little button, or whatever you get, \nbecause he didn't want to sound like an Italian instead of an American, \nso he did not take the promotion.\n  But he still came home from the war a hero. And because of his \nservice, he was made a U.S. citizen. Guess what. He went to see the \nbest lawyer in Albuquerque, NM, before he married my wonderful mother. \nHe said: If I marry her, because she has not finished her paperwork for \ncitizenship, will she be a citizen? The lawyer said: Oh, yes, sure, she \nwill be a citizen. Now, you see, that was wrong legal advice. So here \nmy mother bears four children to a wonderful citizen whose grocery \nstore is growing. She becomes kind of everybody's leader, the Parent-\nTeacher Association president, raising all the money for the Catholic \nschool, and guess what. She is an illegal alien.\n\n  My mother hadn't been back to Italy since she was 3 years old. \nRemember, that is like some of our aliens in America. You know them, \nSenator Martinez. They have been here 30 years, they have never been \nback to their home countries, they live in the same neighborhood, they \nhave children and\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nthey marry Americans, just like my mother. One afternoon when I am \nabout 9 or 10 years old, sitting in the backyard, guess who arrived? It \nwas during the Second World War, 2 years before the end, or a year and \na half. Who were we at war with? Italy. The immigration officers \narrived in their big black cars. They pulled up to the house, and there \nwas the Senator-to-be 45 years later--little Pete--with his sisters, \nand here they come. Of course, we think what happened was there was a \nflamboyant Italian man nearby that used to--excuse me--imbibe on \nweekends. They think he had a little too much imbibing and he was \nsinging a song out the window of the third floor of a hotel, right on \ntop of the grocery store, the Montezuma Grocery Store. Of course, \nsinging Italian, he probably excited some American who was a \nsupercitizen, right? He was worried about these illegal aliens. So the \nimmigration officers set about to see who among us were illegal aliens, \nand there she was, my mother, Alda Domenici. They decided she had to be \narrested because she was an illegal alien. So, sure enough, they came \nto do that and a neighbor had to come over to take care of us kids. I \nwas about 9 or 10. I was pretty frightened. I remember that we had a \nnice Zenith radio, a standup, and it had an aerial in it that would \npermit you to get music and pick up noise from overseas. The agents \ndisconnected the radio so we could not communicate with the enemy. Then \nmy father arrived at home. But guess who else arrived. That lawyer who \nadvised my parents on my mother's immigration status came because my \nfather called him up. That great lawyer, whose son was later Governor \nof New Mexico, got there to the house and said: What is the matter with \nyou guys? This is no lady to be arrested. She has been living here \nsince she was 3. Look at all her kids, and her husband has been running \nthis business. And the agents said: We have these orders that she has \nto be arrested. To make it short, the lawyer answered: Why don't you \narrest me, too.\n  So they had to arrest the lawyer, too. They took him to wherever they \nwere going--to Federal court, I suppose, and they took my dad's gun. A \ncouple hours later they put up the bond and she came home. I don't know \nwhen--probably about 6 months later--she filled out all the forms to \nbecome a U.S. citizen.\n  Why do I tell you this story? I want everybody to know that I am a \nRepublican. I don't want anybody to think that in order to understand \nwhat it is like to have things happen to you like what happened to me, \nyou have to be a Democrat or a Republican; you just have to live in \nthis country during these times, when things like this happen. They \nhappen and you know exactly how people feel. They are like everybody \nelse.\n  We talk about this whole issue of illegal aliens as if we are talking \nabout hooligans and people who are drug addicts. Of course, when you \nhave something as intricate as the border, which is where economics \ncome into confrontation--the economics of poverty come into \nconfrontation with the desire of adults to get ahead; that comes into \nconfrontation with those who want to make money by taking advantage of \nthat desire and charging people and becoming human smugglers--the \nthieves of human bodies; and that comes into confrontation with lying \nto and cheating Federal agents. You have this whole panorama of what is \ngoing on along our borders. Then we keep waiting for it to get solved, \nwhile all the time, day by day, thousands upon thousand of stories such \nas I have described are occurring.\n  There is no way to sit back, whether you are a competent, powerful \nradio announcer, newspaper article writer, editorial page writer, or \nlocal neighborhood noisemaker--there is no way you can properly capture \nthe reality of what we have let happen to this country. I, for one, \nwant it to be known that I think this problem is solvable. I believe we \ncan tighten up our borders. I believe it will take time--I believe it \nis impossible to pass a law and 6 months later have a border that is as \ntight as a belt, as some people say. It is going to take a lot of \nequipment and manpower and a lot of machinery and technology to do \nthat. It is also going to take the next 2 or 3 weeks in the Senate of \nhuman willpower built around a spirit that is American, that recognizes \nour country was built by people such as those I have described. And \nthere happen to be not as many named Domenici as there were back then; \nmore are named Martinez than Domenici today, and Salazar, and Chavez; \nand many of their first names are not like mine, which was Pietro, but \nthey are Enrique and Carlos.\n  I think there is a willingness to work these issues of border \nsecurity and immigration reform out. I want to suggest a couple of \nitems. I believe the American people are going to understand before we \nare finished that we are going to do our very best to make the border \nsuch that it will not be penetrated every day by thousands of people \nwho will be violating this new law we pass. I believe that is going to \nhappen.\n  I do believe, however, one thing that has not been discussed enough \nis that we are going to have to get much more cooperation from Mexico \nto get that done, and I would like my friend Senator Martinez, who is \nhere, to talk about that when he makes his comments.\n  The Mexican government and our Government must enter into an \nagreement, an accord, when this bill is finished that they are going to \njointly see that our border security provisions get enforced. I have a \nprovision requiring that in a bill that I introduced called the WISH \nAct. It has provisions saying that before the bill comes into force as \nfar as benefits to Mexico, the Presidents of the two countries must \nenter into an agreement regarding enforcing our drug laws, human \nsmuggling laws, and immigration laws; and also where Mexico will \nencourage their residents who live here to come forward and be \nrecognized under the law. And, fellow Americans, what we put on paper \nand make our law is going to have to be significantly enticing enough \nfor these millions of undocumented workers, some of whom have been \nliving here a long time, to risk putting up their hands and saying: I \nwill exchange the way I am living now for this new promise, this new \nproposal.\n  It better be good enough or they will continue living the way they \nare. So it has to have something in it that they want.\n  But it also has to say to the American people: We have this situation \nunder control; it is not going to continue on after we pass this bill. \nAnd that gets back to the 10 million to 15 million undocumented workers \nwho live here. We have called them all kinds of things. Let's just say \nthe 10 million to 15 million aliens who live in the United States who \nare not citizens of the United States, some of whom came here totally \nillegally, some of whom came here under temporary permits--that group \nof human beings has to be addressed by this legislation in a humane \nway. They must be addressed in a way that recognizes that they are \ncurrently contributing significantly to the United States, that they \nprobably are going to continue to contribute to our country, and that \nwhat we have in our minds about who they are and what they are is \nprobably not what they really are. In our minds, we have pictures of \nthem being leeches, people who are living off us instead of producing \nsomething we want or need.\n  I hope I get a chance to give another few comments later. I have some \nvery valuable information about the economic contribution of these \npeople. It is a very big contribution, in the billions of dollars in \ncommerce coming from these people living in our country. There are \nbillions of dollars in GDP contributions.\n  What kind of jobs are these people we are talking about currently \ndoing? Some of us speak about them as if the only jobs they have are \nkind of trashy old jobs that nobody else wants. That is some \nmisinformation, too. They are taking some menial jobs. We constantly \nsay: Why don't we let them come here because they will take those jobs \nthat nobody else wants? But they are also engaged in some very good \njobs. There are carpenters and automobile mechanics in certain cities. \nThey have moved their skills upward beyond that temporary permit they \nhave, and they are in another category, but they can't move up into \nthat new category under current law, to represent the new kind of \nlifestyle they live.\n  Also, about half of them have lived here a short period of time, and \nabout\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nhalf of them have lived here a long time. So I am just going to \ndescribe what maybe is the way we get the issue of undocumented workers \nsolved. Let's consider drawing a line at those who have lived here \nlonger than 5 years. It seems to me that this is an important \nconsideration, an important issue to look at because if one lives here \nfor several years, that person certainly has a different relationship \nwith the community and probably a different relationship all the way \naround than somebody who just arrived last week or even somebody who \nworks 3 months and goes home. If someone has lived here for 5 years and \nhas been working and maybe is just like that lady I described, my \nmother, who is living with an American and has children and has been \nhere 10 years but is not a citizen, we have to figure out how we are \ngoing to handle that.\n  I believe the President of the United States deserves enormous credit \nfor sticking with this issue for a long time. People have said: Where \nis the plan? He was the only big voice in America for the last 3 or 4 \nyears that has constantly said we have to do something about this \nproblem, and it is not just buttoning up the border. He said we have to \ngo beyond that and provide something for those who want to live and \nwork here--we must give them a chance to live here under humane \ncircumstances with the kind of grace and opportunity that is a \nprivilege of living in America. I think he is still saying that.\n  I am hopeful that before we finish this debate, the solution is going \nto come from a White House-Senate-House melding of ideas along the \nlines of giving some special treatment to those who have lived here for \na longer period of time--different and better treatment, easier access \nto the U.S., perhaps easier access to a higher level of status than \nwhat they had when they came here.\n  That is the essence of a proposal that I put in what I call the WISH \nbill. Workers who are here less than 5 years under my proposal can \napply for and get a visa without leaving the United States. If they are \nunemployed for no more than 30 consecutive days, they get a renewal of \nthat 3 year visa two more times. Then they have to leave America for at \nleast three years. That proposal is for people who have been here less \nthan 5 years.\n  One would say that is not so good. But what we are talking about is \ngiving these people 9 full years to do their best to arrange things and \nhave whatever successes they can make. So that is one approach to one \nportion of these people who are undocumented workers.\n  I suggest we split this group of people so that those who have been \nhere for longer than 5 years--which they can prove that with workers' \naffidavits and the like--start by obtaining the same visa I just \ndiscussed, but after 5 years, they can apply for another visa or a \nchange of status, except permanent residency, without leaving the \nUnited States. We would have no caps on the number of visas for these \nchange-of-status grants.\n\n  It would appear to this Senator that this could be the beginnings of \na compromise built around something that is understandable, realistic, \nand should be given due consideration by this body.\n  Not having had the burden--or the luxury--of serving on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have told Senator Kyl, who has worked very hard on this \nissue, that I am willing to work with him, and to the best of my \nstaff's ability they will work with him, to see if we can't come up \nwith some kind of a better approach than has been forthcoming \nheretofore.\n  I notice Senator Kennedy is present. Senator Martinez has asked if he \ncould speak next, and he has been waiting for quite a while. I assume \nthat is satisfactory.\n  In the absence of the Senator from Massachusetts, I spoke about the \nfact that frequently we get legislation done when we are told we must \ndo it under a deadline. There is still a lot to do on this bill, but I \ncan tell the Senator, there are a lot of people pulling for a solution \nand who want to be helpful.\n  This is, indeed, a true turning point in modern American domestic \npolicy history. It is a big opportunity. We solve it or we have some of \nthe worst problems confronting the American people that we can imagine. \nIt has almost gone beyond the solvable, but not quite because we are \npretty sanguine and willing to work.\n  Just as Senator Kennedy and his family have their roots in Ireland, I \nhad an opportunity to speak this afternoon about a very strange \nincident of how this Senator happened to be born to a woman who thought \nshe was American but was not. So I lived in a family for quite a while \nwith a father who became a citizen only because he served in the First \nWorld War. He married a woman who he was told would be an American if \nhe married her. He was told that erroneously by a lawyer, and she was \narrested during the Second World War--taken right out of our household. \nSo I understand this whole idea of a household with a father who is \nAmerican and a mother who is not, but they are living, working, and \ngetting ahead and driving their business. I understand that they are \njust like every other family in America. There is nothing different. \nThey have the same love, same hope, same will, and same aspirations as \nthose of us who were born here have.\n  I am here to be helpful. I thank the Senate for listening, and I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for listening to me again the last \n5 minutes. My wife is going to give me a note saying that my face is \ngetting red, and it is time to sit down. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from New \nMexico. I thank Senator Kennedy for indulging me for a couple of \nmoments. I know we are supposed to go back and forth, but I appreciate \nthe opportunity to be heard following Senator Domenici because I \nbelieve my comments are germane to the comments he made. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his courtesy. These will be very brief \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Domenici, I love hearing his story \nbecause it is the story of America. It is the fabric of America about \nwhich he spoke. I was so touched by the way he told it.\n  Obviously, as the only immigrant in the Senate, I think it is \nterribly appropriate that I speak at the outset of this very important \nnational debate on this issue in the Senate.\n  I am reminded as we talk about these issues that there are so many \ninteresting connections. When I came to the Senate as a Senator from \nthe State of Florida, it was such an incredibly proud moment for me \nand, frankly, for many in the community from which I come--the Cuban-\nAmerican community--since I was the very first Cuban American to have \nthis distinction and this honor. I also am probably the first Florida \nSenator to ever serve in the U.S. Senate who was not born in America. \nBut, Mr. President, the story of America is such that, as I started to \nlook at that history, I found out that the very first Senator from \nFlorida, when Florida became a State--I believe in 1854--was a fellow \nby the name of Yulee Levy who was actually born in the Middle East. He \nwas a fellow who had come to America as an immigrant and who ended up \nrepresenting the State of Florida as the very first of two Senators who \ncame, and he, in fact, beat me by a good little margin as the first \nforeign-born Senator from the State of Florida. But that is the sort of \nhistory our country is made of.\n\n  This is such a timely and important debate. I am pleased that you \nwould mention our President, who has been very steadfast and very \nstrong on the issue of a comprehensive solution to our immigration \nproblem. I love so much that you began this debate in such a loving \nway, in such a civil way, and in a way that allows us to think a little \nbigger and a little higher than the combat of the day and the rhetoric, \nfrankly, which so often gets so heated, which so often gets so beyond \nthe pale of what ought to be. I am proud of the Senate as the Senator \nbegins this debate with such a note of civility.\n  I believe we recognize first and foremost that our immigration system \nis broken, that we have to fix it, we have to set about fixing it. The \nSenator is so right when he speaks about the fact that it is almost too \nlate to fix and we have to act and we must act now. It is important, \ntoo, that we focus on a comprehensive solution.\n  It is obvious that we have to fix the border. All of us want to see \nthe border be secured and protected, to be something other than what we \nhave today.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\nThe resources will be there, we will do it, and it will be a commitment \nthat we make first and foremost for border security. I think all of us, \nno matter where we come from, appreciate the legality involved in \nborder security, but in addition to that, we have to be careful of the \nrhetoric. I don't believe we should allow the loudest voices, not \nnecessarily the best voices, to make a definition of what amnesty is \nand what amnesty should be. I believe we should look to solutions that \nare rooted in what America is about and our American values.\n  We cannot ignore the millions who already are here.\n  We have to give the border its importance, but we have to look beyond \nthat to the fact that there are millions who have been living here and \ncontributing to this Nation, and we look forward to an opportunity to \nfigure a mechanism.\n  Senator Domenici has put forward a proposal--and there are many \nothers on the table, obviously. The bill out of the Judiciary Committee \nmakes an important contribution there. We need to find a way that we \ncan come to grips with what to do with the millions of people who are \nliving here and who are already here making a contribution.\n  The Latin community of America, the Hispanic community of America, \nhas been galvanized by this issue like no other. This is a historic \nmoment in our history, and it is a moment we have to treat with great \ncare and great importance how we set the tone of this debate. I am \nhopeful that as we look to the future, we will come up with solutions. \nI am very hopeful that we can come together as a Senate. I am very \nhopeful that the Congress will come together, with the help of the \nPresident and others interested in this debate, to come up with \nsolutions which will provide a way forward, which will provide a \nhistoric opportunity for the people of America to be one Nation, to be, \nas our model says, e pluribus unum--``For many, one''--because I do \nknow that the immigrants who come to this Nation do not come to change \nAmerica, they come to be changed by the miracle that is America.\n  I know that I, as an immigrant, was changed by America. When I came \nhere, much like Senator Domenici's father, I did not speak the \nlanguage. You learn the language. You make it your business to become \nan American. I did not understand this culture. I had no idea as a 15-\nyear-old boy what the country was all about, but I made it my business \nso that I could make a contribution to it.\n  So I am hopeful that we can come together to find solutions to these \nissues. There is nothing easy about this problem, and I know people of \ngood will will come together so we can move forward in a positive way, \nin an American way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the last 15 minutes or so, we heard \nthe stories that have true meaning in terms of the whole American \nexperience. Senator Domenici talked about his parents and how they \nworked through the process of becoming proud Americans, and the good \nSenator from Florida told, as well, the story of an extraordinarily \nsuccessful immigrant who came here and is now serving with great \ndistinction, representing the people of Florida.\n  Last evening, just as the Senate was about to adjourn, Senator \nMcCain, who is the primary sponsor of this legislation, introduced me \nto a wonderful young American, Fabian Nunez, and Fabian Nunez is the \nspeaker of the California Assembly. His father was a Bracero in the \n1950s, and at the end of the Bracero Program, he went back to Mexico. \nHe came back here--the boy did--with his mother, who had been a maid \nand was also undocumented. She had worked two jobs. And this young boy \ncame back to the United States--as a young boy, had gone back to Mexico \nand came here at 8 years old. I also talked by telephone to the father, \nwho is 83 years old, and he said how proud he is that his son is now \nthe speaker of the California Legislature. That is the real story of \nAmerica.\n  At other times, we have seen where Democrats and Republicans have \ncome together and Presidents have come together with the Senate and the \nHouse and have taken action that has moved this Nation. That was \ncertainly true during the civil rights legislation where we knocked \ndown the walls of discrimination, of race and religion, and also of \ngender. We knocked down the walls of discrimination against the \ndisabled with the Americans With Disabilities Act. We came together as \nwell to pass the Medicare Act so that many of our elderly people would \nnot live in poverty and also would be able to get the health care they \nneeded. We came together to do that. We came together in terms of the \nhigher education legislation, and today millions of young people are \nbenefiting from that system. I certainly hope that we can, as we start \nthis debate, come together as Americans to deal with this issue.\n  It is a new civil rights issue, but it is one that is going to \ncontinue to be an issue unless and until we address it. There are \ndifferent approaches, and they have been outlined earlier today, and \nthey will continue to be outlined tomorrow. But I think the stories we \nheard this evening are the clearest and most compelling evidence of \nwhat this country is when it is at its best and what it can be. It is \nin that spirit that Senator Domenici spoke and that Senator Martinez \nspoke and that others have spoken, Democrats and Republicans. It is \nthat spirit which we hope to capture when we address this issue and \nfinally vote on the legislation that is before us.\n  I look forward to having the chance to speak at greater length \ntomorrow. I spoke earlier today about the history of the whole migrant \nprogram and the steps that have been taken. There have been failures \nand some successes, but the challenging opportunities are the ones we \nface today. This is an issue which isn't going to go away. It is going \nto take the best that is in all of us. I am very hopeful that when the \nvote is finally cast, it will be for a meaningful, comprehensive \nprogram that will recognize the national security issues which are \ninvolved, will understand the economic issues involved, and finally, \nand perhaps most importantly, understand the issues of values which are \ninvolved. I will have more to say on that on the morrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are a Nation of immigrants. There are \nso many great stories of people who have come to this country and \nenriched our Nation and benefited their families and had great life \nexperiences. There is no dispute about that. I don't think there is a \nsingle Member here who would deny that.\n  But there is a suggestion that those who do not support the Kennedy \nbill--or whatever you want to call the bill that came out of the \nJudiciary committee, of which I am a Member and the Presiding Officer \nis a Member--if you don't support that bill, you want to run everybody \nout of the country and you want to lock them up and prosecute them. If \nyou don't support this bill, you have bias against them and you don't \nbelieve in immigration. You don't believe in the great freedoms of our \ncountry. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is not right.\n  What we are trying to do is to develop a system to deal with the \nimmigration crisis that we have that is consistent with our values as \nAmericans, that is consistent with the rule of law in this country, \nthat treats people who do the right thing better than it treats people \nwho do the wrong thing. That is what this debate is all about. We are \ntrying to set policy for the future about the people who are allowed \ninto our country, how many and under what circumstances. A Nation \nsurely has a right to decide how many people it allows to come in. We \nare one of the most generous nations in the history of the world in \nallowing people to come here. But we have a right to decide how it \nshould be done.\n  Under this bill, we have provisions that actually allow a virtually \nunlimited number of unskilled workers to come in, but limits the amount \nof skilled workers that come in. How weird is that?\n  This legislation came together in a most hasty way and violates a \nnumber of principles. One thing I would mention, the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Coburn, has been involved in these discussions. I know he and I \nshare a common view about it. I thought we all agreed we would not have \namnesty. The President, as much as he believes in bringing people into \nthis country, as\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nmuch as he believes in allowing workers to come here who want to work, \nhas said: No amnesty. Our Democratic colleagues have said: No amnesty. \nThis morning I said: The truth is, this bill is amnesty. It is exactly \nlike the 1986 bill, and everybody said that was amnesty. They didn't \neven dispute it.\n  I have the definition from ``Black's Law Dictionary,'' the one law \nstudents use to get legal definitions, and it uses the 1986 bill as an \nexample of ``amnesty.'' Of course it was. And the bill that came out of \nthe Judiciary Committee is the same thing.\n  I have to tell you, Senator Specter's bill that we started with in \nthe Judiciary Committee was not amnesty. Senator Frist's bill is not \namnesty. But the bill that we came out with was. That is just a fact. I \nam going to go into some detail about that because Senator Kennedy has \nsaid it is false for me to say this is amnesty. We are going to talk \nabout it. Senator Leahy said it is not amnesty. Why are they saying \nthis now? I'll tell you what is going on.\n  They are over there talking with the President and they are trying to \nget a compromise. They are trying to come up with something so they can \ncome back and say it is not amnesty. They will claim that they moved in \nthis direction and now they want to pass it.\n  We are going to have to read this bill, and we are going to have to \nthink about it because it is a major issue facing our country today. It \nreally is. We need to do the right thing, and we can do the right \nthing. I am actually optimistic about our options and our capabilities \nof coming up with something that will work. But this bill is not it. It \nis absolutely not it.\n  I want to say a couple of things first. We are going to pass \nlegislation dealing with the entry of people into our Nation. We are \ngoing to pass legislation, and I will favor properly drafted \nlegislation that will increase the number of people who come to our \ncountry lawfully. We want to pass legislation that treats fairly and \ndecently and humanely the 11 to 20 million people who are here \nillegally. But I hope and trust we won't pass amnesty which gives the \nfull benefits of legal entry into our country to those who come \nillegally.\n  That is really what we are talking about, because what we learned in \n1986 was that when you do that, before the ink is dry on the bill, \nother people come in illegally because they expect we will be right \nback here again in this Congress giving them amnesty again. So we need \nto reestablish the principle of law. That is all I am saying. We can \ntreat people in a good way. We will not have to remove all of these \npeople from America. They would not have to be prosecuted and put in \njail. How silly is that? That can't be done. Nobody is proposing that.\n  What we are working on is legislation that can bring law, bring \nprinciple, and bring integrity to our immigration system, and I believe \nit is within our grasp to do so. But I am not going to support the \nlegislation that is before us now. It is just not good.\n  The question about amnesty and where we are arises from the nature of \nthe provisions in the bill that passed the Judiciary Committee. I don't \nknow what to call it. I guess it is the Kennedy-Specter bill. Senator \nSpecter's bill, though, that he offered and we began with, did not do \nthe unprincipled things that this compromised bill does.\n  Senator Frist, the majority leader, has offered legislation that does \nnot create a direct path to citizenship for the entire illegal alien \npopulation. His bill didn't do that. The original Specter bill did not \ncreate a new or direct path to citizenship for illegal aliens. Before \nthe committee markup, the Specter bill would have given illegal aliens \nworking in the United States a temporary work permit, renewable every 2 \nyears as long as the individual was working.\n\n  We still don't have the language that passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I know Senator Coburn has been around Congress for some \ntime, and he serves on the Judiciary Committee with me. We still don't \nhave the language we voted on Monday. I don't know for sure exactly \nwhat it is, but we sure should not be passing a piece of legislation \nwhen we haven't even had a chance to read it.\n  But in the committee, a complete amnesty program was adopted for the \nillegal alien population and large, new permanent immigration programs \nwere created for low-skilled workers. The committee bill, as reported, \ncreates a direct pathway to citizenship for aliens who have broken our \nlaws.\n  You will hear claims that this bill is earned adjustment, earned \ncitizenship. Those are descriptions, but they are misnomers. This bill \nreally is--in the sense that we have been talking about it for several \nyears now as a part of an American dialog, in every sense of what \npeople mean by amnesty--it is amnesty. If it is not amnesty, it is the \nsame thing as amnesty. That is what it is.\n  There are four different amnesty provisions in the bill. These four \namnesty programs are what you are voting for or against when you vote \non the Judiciary Committee bill. Let me clearly describe to you the \nbreathtaking enormity of the four programs that I believe clearly \nconstitute amnesty in the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  Element No. 1, the committee bill takes every illegal alien in the \nUnited States who pays $1,000 and was employed before January 7, 2004--\nwhether full time, part time, seasonally or self-employed--and puts \nthat person on a direct path to citizenship. The family of the illegal \naliens, their spouse and children, would also be given amnesty, even if \nthey are not already in the United States. They would now be able to \ncome and come legally.\n  How will it be given out? How do you get on this direct path to \ncitizenship? What is required of the person who seeks it? The truth is \nthat other than illegal presence in the United States, very little is \nrequired.\n  We have been following very carefully the draft of the bill that we \nwere provided and that we had as we voted on this legislation in \nCommittee. The final passed version, however, is still being cobbled \ntogether, but I am confident that what I'm saying is accurate with \nregard to these issues.\n  All illegal aliens present in the United States before January of \n2004, who have worked illegally here since then for any amount of time, \nwill first be given an H-5B nonimmigrant status, good for 6 years. They \nare made legal for 6 years. Their spouses and children will be given \nthe same status. After 6 years and another $1,000 fine, the aliens and \ntheir families will get green cards if the alien has been ``employed in \nthe United States, either full time, part time, seasonally, or self-\nemployed, or has met educational requirements.''\n  The education requirement is as broad as being in a 1-year vocational \nwork program at ``an institution of higher education.''\n  These requirements are very broad.\n  A self-employed person could be someone who worked 1 day a year, and \nthere is no limit on that definition. A person who meets the work \nrequirement through education has to prove that they had full-time \nattendance in as little as a 1-year educational program, not that they \ncompleted any educational program.\n  Additionally, the work requirement and education requirement for the \ngreen card are completely waived if the alien is under 21. After \ngetting the green card, illegal aliens will be able to apply for \ncitizenship like any other lawful permanent resident. They are put in \nthe same status as the people who came here legally.\n  To satisfy the work requirement of being employed in the United \nStates, either part time, seasonally, or self-employed, the bill states \nthat an alien can conclusively establish his work history in the United \nStates either by, one, presenting records maintained by one of the \nfollowing: Social Security Administration, IRS or any Federal, State or \nlocal government agency or employer, a labor union, a day labor center, \nand ``organizations that assist workers in matters related to \nemployment,'' or presenting two of the following: bank records, \nbusiness records, sworn affidavits from nonrelatives or remittal \nrecords.\n  However, the documents listed that conclusively establish work \nhistory are not even really required.\n  Later on, the bill states that the burden of proof that the alien \nmust meet to qualify is even lower than that. It says: ``The alien has \na burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien \nhas satisfied the requirements. An alien must meet such burden of proof \nby producing sufficient\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nevidence to demonstrate such employment as a matter of reasonable \ninference.''\n  Reasonable inference? That is not a proof standard. It is a situation \nthat allows everyone to qualify.\n  Why would we want to do that?\n  The bill then states: ``It is the intent of the Congress that the \nwork requirement be interpreted and implemented in a manner that \nrecognizes and takes into account the difficulties encountered by \naliens in obtaining evidence of employment due to the undocumented \nstatus of the alien.''\n  It is not that hard to prove you have worked. If you work for an \nemployer, you can get the employer to provide a statement that you \nworked for them even if you don't have pay stubs. It is not that hard.\n  This basically obviates any requirement of proof and allows anybody \nto qualify.\n  I am just telling you that is what is in the bill. I wish it were not \nso. I am not making this up. I am reading to you what is in the bill.\n  The work standard is not a work standard at all. In fact, the bill \nbasically says that Congress is telling the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to accept pretty much anything as proof of work.\n  This is an open invitation to fraud and will prevent Department of \nHomeland Security from vetting out fraudulent applications.\n  It is a perfect example of why our immigration laws are so messed up.\n  We have placed so many difficult obstacles in front of agencies that \nare required to enforce them that they have become utterly \nunenforceable.\n  We say that we have a work requirement, and then we say it can be \nseasonal, it can be part time, and it can be self-employed. Then we say \njust about any records you can produce, or that you conjure up will be \nsufficient. But if you do not have records and you have a reasonable \ninference that you worked, they must let you qualify.\n  Basically, that is what the Department of Homeland Security office is \ngoing to do. They are going to accept anybody's application. There is \nno way you could object to it. This standard appears to be a standard \nbut is not one at all.\n  What about waiver of the work requirement? What if you have not \nworked since January of 2004 and did not work before then. Does this \nbill leave you out? Does it mean you can't be a citizen now? Can you \nqualify for this type of amnesty? The answer is still yes.\n  Even if you are an illegal alien who has never worked in the United \nStates and cannot produce any evidence to reasonably infer that you \nhave worked illegally in the United States, you and your family can get \non the bill's direct path to citizenship. You get automatic amnesty, no \nrequirement to prove work.\n  If you have full-time attendance at an institution of higher \neducation--graduation is not required--full-time attendance at any \nsecondary school, as defined by State law, or you are a minor under the \nage of 21, what does qualifying for amnesty get you?\n  The mere filing of an application for amnesty triggers the following \nthings: Employment authorization for the alien, the alien's spouse and \nchildren, permission to travel abroad and return to the United States, \nprotection from being detained, determined inadmissible or deportable \nor removed pending final adjudication of the alien's application for \nadjustment of status.\n  Only future conduct or a criminal conviction removes these \nprotections.\n  Additionally, if you have already been ordered removed from the \nUnited States or if you are subject to mandatory detention for a \ncriminal conviction, the Department of Homeland Security has to give \nyou the opportunity to show you are eligible for amnesty before you can \nbe removed.\n  This will simply freeze the entire detention and removal operation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  If you are legally here in January of 2004 because you got a work \nvisa before you came to the United States, you will not get the benefit \nof this amnesty.\n  Repeat that: If you are legally here because you got a valid work \nvisa or permit before January of 2004, you do not get the benefit of \nthis amnesty. This amnesty benefits you only if you came here \nillegally.\n  So we are only giving you a direct path to citizenship if you first \nbroke our laws. If you came here the right way and did not break the \nlaw, you are out of luck. No new path to citizenship for you.\n  They say this is a guest worker program.\n  The second major part of Specter-Kennedy substitute amendment--that \nwas an amendment that was substituted for the original Specter bill in \nthe past--is a new program for bringing low-skilled workers into the \nUnited States, in addition to illegal aliens already doing these jobs. \nThe program puts them on a direct path to citizenship. It is a new \nprogram.\n  The new program would bring 400,000 low-skilled workers per year into \nthe United States on a 3-year work visa. This visa is renewable for 3 \nyears. It is essentially a guaranteed entry for 6 years to work in the \nUnited States.\n  This 400,000-per-year cap is supposed to be limited, they say to \n400,000. This is several times what the cap is today. I am mistaken--\nseveral times this 400,000 is how many will be allowed to come in under \nan illegal system. But the cap that purports to be is completely \nartificial. If the cap is reached and actually 400,000 come in that \nyear and an additional 80,000 visas can be given out that year, the cap \nwill go up automatically the next year as much as 20 percent. By the \nsixth year this program will immigrate 2.4 million new low-skilled \nworkers, at a minimum, into the United States.\n\n  On day one, when the worker arrives in the United States, the \nemployer can sponsor the alien for a green card. It gives them legal \npermanent status. Normally the employers or family members sponsor the \nalien before they have the right to permanent entry and a green card. \nBut this is a major change. The person can sponsor himself and make his \nown application. So after 4 years of work, the new immigrants can self-\npetition for a green card and then be eligible for citizenship.\n  Normal grounds for inadmissibility, except for the most serious \ncrimes on national security grounds, can be waived for a fee of $1,500. \nAll legal permanent residents are eligible for citizenship after 5 \nyears. All legal permanent residents, green card holders, after 5 \nyears, are eligible for citizenship. If they have not been convicted of \na felony, if they have basic English skills, they can become a citizen \nautomatically. People all over this country and all over the world are \nwaiting and hoping to be able to be selected to be able to come to the \nUnited States following the laws and rules.\n  To be eligible to come to the United States under this low-skilled \nimmigrant worker category, the alien is merely required to pay a $500 \napplication fee, undergo a medical examination, and show they are \ncapable of performing the labor or services required, and have evidence \nof employment from ``employers, employer associations or labor \nrepresentatives.'' Those are probably some of the people who have been \nleading these protests the last few days.\n  Under the bill language, you can qualify for this new program and \ncome to the United States as a low-skilled immigrant even if you were \nin removal proceedings and signed a voluntary departure agreement but \nnever left, or you were already removed from the United States and \nillegally reentered. If you had been removed and illegally reentered, \nyou are eligible.\n  One might ask, why does this program cover these people? I thought \nthe program was for people who wanted to come to the United States to \nwork in the future, not for those who are already here. This provision \nis specifically designed to make sure that illegal aliens who are not \ncovered by the bill's amnesty provisions because they did not work in \nthe United States prior to January of 2004, or because they were not \nlegally present in the United States on that day, are not left without \na direct path to citizenship also.\n  This bill covers everybody. It should be called ``no illegal alien \nleft behind.'' I am not exaggerating. It is fixed so that if they are \nnot covered under this ``magic'' date, January 7, 2004, they are \ncovered under the new exemptions of the 400,000 people per year.\n  Element three, the Dream Act. That was brought up several times. It \nnever moved in the Senate. But boom, in 2 minutes, Senator Durbin \noffered the\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nDream Act and we voted on it in committee Monday afternoon as an \namendment to the bill. It took him less than 2 minutes to get it in the \nbill as an amendment.\n  The Dream Act does two things. It grants amnesty to an unlimited \nnumber of illegal alien minors who graduate from a high school and \nenroll in college or the military for at least 2 years, or who perform \nhours of volunteer work, or who can show ``compelling circumstances for \nthe inability to do any of those three,'' and, two, eliminates United \nStates Code section 1623 which I will describe below, thus allowing all \nillegal aliens enrolled in college to receive in-State tuition rates.\n  This means that while American citizens from Tennessee, Georgia, \nSouth Carolina, Massachusetts, have to pay out-of-state tuition rates \nif they send their kids to the University of Virginia or the University \nof Alabama, people who have illegally immigrated into this country do \nnot.\n  How much sense does that make, to have people here illegally and they \nhave more benefits than those who are here legally? Instead, they \nreceive educational benefits paid by the taxpayers of Virginia and \nAlabama for in-State residents. I do not mean to suggest in any way \nthere are not good kids out there. We need to figure out a way to \naccommodate them and work with those who have come here illegally. \nMaybe they came here a long time ago. Maybe they came here illegally as \na junior or senior in high school. They came across the border and now \nthey want to be on a direct path to citizenship.\n  I am not saying we should not wrestle with how to treat them in a \ngenerous way, but should we give them more rights than we give to \nAmerican citizens? When you do too much of this and you work at it too \nhard, pretty soon you end up with a mockery of law, an unprincipled \nbill that cannot be defended, and we are in the situation of wondering \nwhy would you want to bother to try to come into the country legally. \nWhy not come illegally?\n  So the Dream Act establishes a seamless process to take illegal \naliens directly from illegal status to conditional permanent resident \nstatus, to legal permanent resident status, to citizenship.\n  First, the illegal aliens who came here before age 16 and have been \nhere for 5 years will be given conditional permanent residence through \ncancellation of removal if they have been admitted to college or have a \nGED or a high school diploma. So if you get your high school diploma or \nget yourself into college somewhere, whether you are passing or not, \nthen you qualify for cancellation of removal.\n  Step two, after 6 years, the alien will then be eligible to apply for \na green card if they have attended 2 years of higher education, served \n2 years in the military, performed 910 hours of community service for \nan organization that receives funds under the Combined Federal \nCampaign, or prove an extreme and unusual hardship, and you have good \nmoral character and do not have a deportable offense. It is a \nguaranteed step forward if you do not do something wrong and get \nyourself convicted of a felony.\n  After 5 years, those green card holders can apply for citizenship and \ncannot be denied if they meet the basic standards of English and have \nno criminal history. Current law provides ``that an alien who is not \nphysically present in the United States shall not be eligible on the \nbasis of residence within a State or a political subdivision for any \npostsecondary educational benefit unless a citizen or national of the \nUnited States is eligible for such benefit in no less amount, duration \nand scope, without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a \nresident.''\n  That is basically the law we passed several years ago, I think before \nI came to Congress. It said if you are here illegally, you do not get \nin-State tuition.\n  We are going to reverse that. Congress just passed it 8 or 10 years \nago. The DREAM Act would eliminate this provision and allow illegal \nalien college and university students to be eligible for in-State \ntuition without affording out-of-State students the same opportunity. \nThus, the University of Alabama could offer in-State tuition to illegal \nalien students while requiring citizens residing in Mississippi to pay \na much higher tuition rate. In fact, that is being done probably in \nviolation of law in some areas right now.\n  Allowing all the illegal aliens enrolled in college to receive in-\nState tuition rates means that while American citizens from the 49 \nother States have to pay out-of-State tuition rates to send their kids \nto the University of Alabama or Virginia, people who have illegally \nimmigrated into this country might not. Out-of-State tuition rates \nrange from 2 to 3\\1/2\\ times what in-State tuition rates are. It has \nalways struck me that one of the things you do to encourage people to \ncome here legally and abide by the law, is not give benefits to those \nwho come illegally. It is one thing not to prosecute them; it is one \nthing not to take them out of the country; but to give them benefits \nthat people who do the right thing get? We should not do that. It is \nbad policy.\n  So what about loans in the DREAM Act? I think this is still in the \nbill. We have not had a chance to see all of language. This was in the \nDREAM Act originally. I do not know if it is still in there under the \nJudiciary bill, but I assume it is. Under title IV of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965, as amended, legal permanent residents and \ncertain other eligible noncitizens receive Federal student financial \naid, including Pell grants and Stafford student loans. That is part of \nthe 1965 act.\n  The committee bill will add illegal students, illegal alien \nvolunteers, and illegal alien military members to the list of people \neligible, by changing their immigration status to that of a legal \npermanent resident. This change in status would make them eligible for \nFederal financial aid. Pell grants and Stafford loans currently \ncomprise 85 percent of postsecondary student aid available to citizens \nand eligible noncitizens. In fiscal year 2002, 8.8 percent of the \nindividuals receiving Pell grants were eligible noncitizens over \n380,000 people.\n  We want to help people and be generous. But if you are in an illegal \nstatus, I do not see why there is an obligation to give the same extra \nbenefits that you do to those who are lawfully here.\n  Pell grants. The Federal Pell Grant Program is the single largest \nsource of grant aid for postsecondary education funded by the Federal \nGovernment. There is already a current fiscal year Pell grant shortfall \nof over $2.5 billion. We have done a lot of different things to try to \nget money as high as we can get it this year. The fiscal year 2003 \nestimated program costs are approximately $12.5 billion. The annual \nappropriations is $11.4 billion. Now we want to open up Pell grants to \nillegal aliens?\n  Although Pell grants are a discretionary program, the cost of \nincreasing the number of eligible recipients in an award year is \nconsidered direct spending, when the appropriations and maximum grant \naward for that year are already set in law and a payment schedule is \npublished. Thus, we could be facing a budget point of order with this \nbill. In other words, since in a number of these instances the right to \nhave a Pell grant for qualifying persons is an entitlement, making more \npeople eligible for this entitlement could subject this bill to a \nbudget point of order.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 58,500 additional Pell \ngrants would have been given within 1 year if last year's DREAM Act had \npassed, with an average grant being $2,420. How many people do not get \na dime who try to send their kids to college, out of State maybe, \npeople who have worked hard all their life, middle-class Americans? \nThey do not get a dime. But somebody who is here illegally gets $2,400? \nI do not think that is fair. I do not think that is being insensitive \nto legitimate interests of people who want to come to America, who want \nto participate in the American dream, or is inhumane in any way.\n  What about Stafford loans? The Congressional Budget Office estimated \nunder last year's DREAM Act--the one that was offered last year but did \nnot pass--65,000 would enroll during the first year and meet all other \ncriteria. Because 1 in 10 students borrow student loans, the student \nloan costs would increase by $22 million per year over the 2003-to-2012 \nperiod.\n  While we were going about our business in committee, the AgJOBS bill \nwas offered as an amendment. Well, we had a big fight on the AgJOBS \nbill last year. It was offered on the floor of the Senate. Senator \nSaxby Chambliss of\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nGeorgia, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, opposed the bill, \noffered a number of important amendments that I thought made it far \nmore sane, far more appropriate, and the bill did not pass, after a \ngreat deal of debate.\n  Well, in about 15 minutes, in the committee, Senator Feinstein \noffered the AgJOBS bill to the Specter bill, the committee bill. It was \na 106-page amendment. It put 1.5 million illegal alien agriculture \nworkers on a direct path to citizenship--just like that.\n  How does it do it? After the Feinstein amendment, 1.5 million illegal \nalien workers who pay a $500 fine and demonstrate they worked in \nagriculture for 150 workdays in the last 2 years will be given blue \ncards and will be allowed to stay in the United States. Because a \nworkday is defined as 1 hour of work per day, an alien who worked in \nagriculture for only 150 hours--there are 168 hours in a week--over 2 \nyears will qualify. So if you work 150 hours over 2 years, you qualify.\n  Spouses and children of illegal alien agriculture workers also get \nlegal status and work permits, and they are not limited to working in \nagriculture either.\n  The blue card holder is eligible for a green card in two ways: after \n3 years of 150 additional workdays--1 hour per day is all that is \nrequired--per year or after 5 years of 100 additional workdays per \nyear.\n  Then, what about citizenship? For these who come here illegally, and \nthey work 150 hours, what happens as to their citizenship? Even though \nthey came here illegally, are they put on the path to citizenship? Yes. \nAll legal permanent residents become eligible for citizenship after 5 \nyears.\n  On May 18, 2004, the Washington Times published a column by Frank \nGaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy, titled ``Stealth \nAmnesty'' dealing with the AgJOBS bill when it came up back in 2004. \nThe article correctly summarized the AgJOBS bill when it said this:\n\n       By the legislation's own terms, an illegal alien will be \n     turned into ``an alien lawfully admitted for temporary \n     residence,'' provided they had managed to work unlawfully in \n     an agricultural job in the United States. . . .Once so \n     transformed, they can stay in the U.S. indefinitely while \n     applying for permanent resident status. From there, it is a \n     matter of time before they can become citizens. . . .\n       If any were needed, [the AgJOBS bill] offers a further \n     incentive to illegals: Your family can stay, as well. \n     Alternatively, if they are not with you, you can bring them \n     in, too--cutting in line ahead of others who made the mistake \n     of abiding by, rather than ignoring, our laws.\n  What about the safe harbor provisions? Under the AgJOBS bill, which \nwas added to this committee proposal without much debate, an illegal \nalien is undeportable as soon as the amnesty paperwork is merely filed. \nSo if you file your amnesty paperwork and you are otherwise deportable, \nit automatically stops. No adjudication of the application is necessary \nto kick start the legal status of the illegal alien.\n  Once an alien receives a temporary work visa, it never expires unless \nthe worker is otherwise deemed deportable or applies for permanent \nresidence and is denied. There is nothing temporary about a single \ntemporary work visa lasting indefinitely. It is not temporary. The \nalien's blue card status can only be revoked if the alien is determined \nto be deportable, the blue card was acquired through fraud, the alien \nis convicted of a felony, three or more misdemeanors, or an offense \nwhich involves serious bodily injury or damage to more than $500 of \nproperty.\n  What about all the legal stuff that gets involved with this? How do \nyou prove all this stuff? The AgJOBS amendment even goes so far as to \nprovide free legal counsel to illegal aliens who want to receive this \namnesty. The AgJOBS amendment specifically states that recipients of \n``funds under the Legal Services Corporation Act'' shall not be \nprevented ``from providing legal assistance directly related to an \napplication for adjustment of status under this section.''\n  Not only will the AgJOBS bill give amnesty to 1.5 million illegal \naliens, it would have the American taxpayer pay the legal bill of those \n1 million illegal aliens.\n  We are going to work on something here. We are going to pass some \nlegislation--if not this year, soon--that will work through all these \ndifficult human issues and treat people in a fair and just way. Nobody \nis proposing that we do not. I mean that. There is a consensus in this \nCongress that it is time for us to fix this problem, to deal with the \n11 million people here illegally, to allow more people to come legally, \nand to shut down the border and stop people from coming illegally. But \nthis legislation does not do that.\n  People say: I want to vote for something. I want to fix it.\n  Don't vote for this bill. It will not fix it. Not only does it give \namnesty to 1.5 million illegals, it would have the American taxpayer \npay the legal bills of the 1 million illegal aliens.\n  What about the H2A farm workers? The sponsors of the AgJOBS bill will \nhave you believe that farmers want the AgJOBS bill. They say: This is \nfor agriculture. It has to be done. If you don't do this, the country \nis going to collapse. Maybe that is the case in the District of \nColumbia where the national groups get to write the letters and speak \nfor their farmers and come in and tell us what farmers want, regardless \nof what the individual farmers have to say. One of those people talked \nto me about it.\n  I said: That may be your opinion, Mr. Farm Leader, but if you took a \npoll of the farmers I know in my home State or the Presiding Officer \nknows in his home State, I will bet you 80 percent of them would agree \nwith me that this is not a principled way to do business. This is not \nthe right way to do business. We are not here to serve agribusiness. We \nare here to promote the national interests of the United States, to \ncreate an immigration system consistent with our generous values, and a \nlegal system that will work, not to reward those who violate the law \nbut provide the benefits to those who follow the law.\n  Last year when we debated this bill, I received an open letter from \nthe Southern Farmers Coalition. The letter is signed by a list of \norganizations and individuals who participate in the H2A program. The \nletter says: Overwhelmingly, the majority of H2A program users in this \ncountry--the list of signatories is expansive, including the North \nCarolina Growers Association, the MidAtlantic Solution, Georgia Peach \nCouncil, Ag Works, the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, \nthe Virginia Agricultural Growers Association, the Vidalia Onion \nBusiness Council--I like Vidalia onions--and the Kentucky-Tennessee \nGrowers Association. They all signed this letter. The cover page of the \nletter, contrary to what some national agricultural experts say, says \nthis:\n\n       Farmers in the southern United States are opposed to S. \n     1645--\n\n  the same bill being offered as an amendment today, as part of this \nbill--\n\n     introduced by Ted Kennedy and Larry Craig. It is an amnesty \n     for illegal farm workers. It does not reform the H2A program. \n     Please oppose this legislation.\n\n  These are the farmers who are supposed to be helped by it. That is \nwhat they say about it: ``Please oppose this legislation.''\n  The text of the letter, which asked me to stand up and fight against \nthis legislation, states:\n\n       Ag JOBS is nothing more than a veiled amnesty.\n\n  I am reading this letter from the farmers themselves.\n\n       Ag JOBS is nothing more than a veiled amnesty. While \n     everyone, it seems, agrees that the H2A program desperately \n     needs reform, this legislation does not fix the two most \n     onerous problems with the program--the adverse effect wage \n     rate and the overwhelming litigation brought by legal \n     services groups against the farmers using the H2A program.\n\n  That is what the farmers told us. The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The Craig-Kennedy-Berman reform package provides a private \n     right of action provision that goes far beyond legitimate \n     worker protections and expands legal services attorneys \n     ability to sue growers in several critical areas. These \n     lawyers, who have harassed program users with meritless \n     lawsuits for years, will continue to attack small farmers \n     under the new statute. Supporters of the Craig-Berman \n     legislation have endorsed this alleged reform, believing, in \n     a misguided fashion, that it will bring stability to the \n     agricultural labor market. It will not. It will create \n     greater instability. As the illegal farm workers earn \n     amnesty, they will abandon their farm jobs for work in other \n     industries. Many of the attached signatories have been \n     actively involved in negotiations surrounding this \n     legislation. The following groups have broken ranks with the \n     American Farm Bureau, the National Council of Agricultural \n     Employers, the Agricultural Coalition for Immigration Reform, \n     and the American\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\n     Nursery and Landscape Association to oppose the legislation \n     because those groups have decided an amnesty is more \n     important than legitimate H2A reform. You are likely to hear \n     that the majority of agriculture supports this bill. The \n     industry, in fact, is split. History has demonstrated that \n     the amnesty granted under the Immigration Reform and Control \n     Act of 1986 was a dismal failure for agriculture employers. \n     Farm workers abandoned agricultural employment shortly after \n     gaining amnesty and secured jobs in other industries.\n\n  Of course, they did. So why should we pass this Judiciary bill, what \nI guess we can call the Specter-Kennedy package?\n  Who supports the amendment? I know who supports the amendment. The \nnational lobbying groups are really out of touch with the desires of \nthe American people and the desires of farmers and the desires of those \nwho want to see a good and decent system created.\n  I don't believe I am out of touch on this issue. I believe I know \nwhat average American citizens and farmers want. They want real \nimmigration reform that guarantees the laws we pass will be enforced \nand that people who do not honor our immigration laws will be punished, \nnot rewarded with worker visas and green cards. So I strongly oppose \nthe Specter-Kennedy bill that came out of committee, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join in that.\n  Now, earlier, Senator Leahy said that the 1986 bill Congress passed \nwas amnesty. He said it was amnesty, and he admitted it was. ``Blacks \nLaw Dictionary'' says that the 1986 bill was amnesty. It is the very \ndefinition of amnesty.\n  By the way, when we passed that bill, it was supposed to fix the \nimmigration problem. As I explained and talked about this morning, that \nis a very important concept. So the deal in 1986 was that we were going \nto give amnesty to 1 million people who we thought were here illegally. \nWe now think there are 11 million here illegally. We are going to give \namnesty to those, and we are going to create a legal system that \nencourages people to come legally and we won't have this problem again. \nThose who were dubious about it said: No, this amnesty would encourage \nmore people to come illegally, but the pro-amnesty crowd won out and \nthey passed the legislation and it became law.\n  Well, what happened immediately afterward? It wasn't 1 million people \nwho showed up to claim amnesty; it was 3 million--three times as many. \nI don't know how many will show up this time. Will it be 11 million or \n33 million? Probably not 33 million, but I would not be surprised at \nall, based on our history, if we would have a good many more show up \nand claim amnesty.\n  Six years after the bill passed, the Congress, in a very unusual \naction, voted to form a commission to review the legislation to see if \nit worked. The commission, a bipartisan professional commission, did a \nstudy and said it was a failure. It did not work, did not do what it \nwas supposed to do.\n  Well, the Citizenship and Immigration Services tried to say that 1986 \nwas not amnesty. But everybody has agreed it was. CIS later explained \nwhat the 1986 bill did. I would like to go over it with you because \nthis current bill does the very same things. It is just not disputable. \nSo if we have any understanding of what an amnesty program is, we have \nthe 1986 act to give us a guide. It says:\n\n       The legalization program was not amnesty, but a targeted \n     program that balanced the offer of legalization with \n     stringent requirements.\n\n  This is how they defended this problem.\n\n       Legalization of applicants had to: prove to INS \n     adjudicators that they had resided in the U.S. since January \n     1, 1982--\n\n  I went over with you how this bill said you had to be here since \nJanuary 2004. If you came after 2004, you could still get in. That is a \nreal stringent standard. You had to prove you resided there before that \nday--\n\n     pay a $185 fee--\n\n  We upped it to $1,000--\n\n     for principal applicants, $50 for each child, with a $420 \n     family cap; accept ineligibility for most public benefits for \n     5 years after application--\n\n  We don't even do that in this bill. It says you could not go on \nwelfare for at least 5 years. We did that in 1986. That is not in this \nbill today--\n\n     and complete an 18-month period of temporary residency. After \n     that, and only after successfully completing an English \n     language and civics requirement within a year-long one-time \n     window--\n\n  Which is a very low-grade test for the most part--\n\n     and the payment of an $80 fee per applicant (with a $240 \n     family cap) they were eligible to apply for permanent \n     residency. In exchange, the applicant would be authorized to \n     work, travel, and after becoming a permanent resident, \n     petition for the immigration of certain family members.\n\n  They could bring family members in from out of the country to join \nthem. Then, of course, once you become a permanent resident, it is a \nmatter of 5 years to become a citizen, if you have not been convicted \nof a felony and you can speak English. I don't want to be demagogic and \nsay this is amnesty, amnesty, amnesty, and vote against the bill. I am \nsaying that everybody agreed that 1986 was amnesty, and it did not \nwork.\n  Everybody I hear publicly talking about this bill says it is not \namnesty. Senator Kennedy, I think, used the word ``lie'' after I said \nit was amnesty this morning. I think I have demonstrated that it is \nprecisely the same scheme that was used in 1986, which we proved didn't \nwork. If that is not amnesty, what is? Senator Leahy defended the bill \nand said it is not amnesty. President Bush said he doesn't believe in \namnesty. All he believes in is immigration, and he wants us to do \nbetter and be as generous as we can possibly be. But he doesn't believe \nin amnesty.\n  Scott McClellan, yesterday at the press briefing he does for the \nPresident, said that the President believes that a direct path to \ncitizenship is amnesty, and he opposes that.\n  This bill provides a direct path to citizenship for people who came \nto this country illegally. That is just the fact. If we want to have \npeople say it is not so, we will keep talking about it every day this \nweek. That is all I am saying. I wish it weren't so. It is not \nnecessary that we do that. We can provide a humane and decent way to \ngive people full opportunities to live and progress in our society \nwithout giving the people who come here illegally benefits over those \nwho wait in line and come legally. That is what it is all about.\n  So I will just say that, in this rush to move a bill through and to \nprove that we care, we have not thought it through. We spent 5 days in \nmarkup in the Judiciary Committee, and about 4 of those days we really \nspent some time dealing with enforcement and border issues. We talked \nabout them in some depth. We went over the wording of the statutes with \nsome care. We debated single words. Senator Durbin, who is here, is a \ngreat lawyer. He made some points, being the skilled lawyer he is. We \nchanged words and did all kinds of things.\n  But when we got to the last day, Monday, they offered an AgJOBS bill, \nwith over 100 pages, in about 15 minutes, and it passed. We still had \nnot seen the draft of it. During the debate in our committee on how to \nhandle the 11 million people in a decent, fair, and just way, to not \nremove them or make them all leave this country in a permanent way or \nto abuse them or prosecute them, but how to handle this in a logical, \nsane way--we spent almost no time on it.\n  I urged the committee to stay with the enforcement matters like the \nHouse did. Let's start hearings immediately and get the best minds in \nAmerica. Let's find out who these 11 million people are, their desires \nand wishes; what would be a good and principled way to deal with them; \nwho we should let into our country in the future; what standards should \nwe use; should we have unlimited numbers come in for low-wage jobs and \nhave limits on the high-wage people? Is that logical, what we want to \ndo?\n  How many more people do we want to allow into our country legally? \nThis bill will allow every year, annually, at least 400,000, and that \nnumber can increase every year, forever.\n  I wish to make one more point, and this is where the American people \nhave to watch this Congress. If we pass this amnesty legislation, if we \npass the legislation that makes all these status changes and makes them \ninto law and they become law, that becomes a permanent decision of this \nU.S. Congress.\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\n  But what about the promises that we are going to have enforcement? I \noffered an amendment in committee that was accepted to add 10,000 \ndetention beds. That probably is not nearly enough, but it would make a \nbig difference. That was accepted. I offered an amendment to increase \nthe number of Border Patrol agents. It probably is not a large enough \nnumber, but it would ramp it up faster than the plan was, and that was \naccepted.\n  Then it hit me. I have been in the Senate long enough, and I should \nhave been more alert. This is an authorizing committee. The Judiciary \nCommittee is an authorizing committee. We know what happened in 1986. \nThey granted amnesty, they gave everybody amnesty, and they promised in \nthe future they were going to fund an enforcement mechanism, but they \ndidn't do it. It was the bait and switch.\n  So what did we get? We got an authorization to step up enforcement on \nour borders, but we didn't get the money to do it. We don't have it \nyet. Who is to say we won't have a slowdown in the economy next year, \nand they will cut the money, we will never get the enforcement, and we \nwill still have large numbers coming into the country illegally. That \nis a big concern to us.\n  We need to tie this issue down so that we know and the American \npeople can have confidence that the enforcement mechanisms will work \nand will be funded. That is why the House took the approach they did.\n  I again say it is not true that those of us who oppose this bill \noppose immigration. It is not true. We actually, at least as far as I \nam concerned, need to increase the numbers that come here legally. It \nis not true that we want to prosecute people.\n  What is true is that it is important for our Nation to create a \nhumane, fair, and just way to deal with the people who are here \nillegally and to make positive and thoughtful decisions about how we \nwant to handle immigration in the future. I do not believe this bill \ndoes that job. It is not something I can support. I hope the Senate \nwill not support it. We will see a number of amendments that can make \nit better. I hope our Senate colleagues will study the legislation and \ninform themselves of the great issues at stake so we can fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2526-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, yesterday America lost one of the \npreeminent public servants of our time when former Secretary of Defense \nCaspar Weinberger passed away at the age of 88.\n  An inventory of Cap Weinberger's service to our country is a tribute \nto his patriotism. He served in the Army in World War II. He oversaw \nthe State of California's finances for Governor Ronald Reagan. That was \nduring the 1960s. He served under Presidents Nixon and Ford as Chairman \nof the Federal Trade Commission, Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, and as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, \nand Welfare. He again served Ronald Reagan as our country's 15th \nSecretary of Defense, from 1981 to 1987.\n  Cap Weinberger understood America and he understood the American \nmilitary. As Secretary of Defense during the tipping point of the Cold \nWar, he led an unprecedented rebuilding of an American military that \nhad been demoralized and devastated by Vietnam.\n  His legacy was the most professional and technologically advanced \nmilitary the world has ever known. He knew we needed the world's best \nmilitary not because we wanted war but because we wanted to prevent \nwar.\n  I was struck by an excerpt from Cap Weinberger's memoir ``In The \nArena,'' published in the Washington Post this morning. It said this:\n\n       Some thought it was incongruous that I did so much to build \n     up our defenses but was reluctant to commit forces abroad. I \n     did not arm to attack. . . . We armed so that we could \n     negotiate from strength, defend freedom, and make war less \n     likely.\n\n  Cap Weinberger stands out as the model--the model--of what a \nSecretary of Defense should be. When I was president of the World USO \nin the late 1980s, I had the privilege of working very closely with \nSecretary Weinberger. As a Senator, I sought often his wise counsel and \nsound advice. Without fail, he was always candid, thoughtful, and \ngenerous with his time and, I would say, always correct in his \nanalysis.\n  All Americans owe this great patriot our gratitude and deepest \nrespect. We have much to learn from the lessons of Casper Weinberger's \nservice to his country and his exemplary life. Lilibet and I offer our \nthoughts and our prayers to Secretary Weinberger's family, as I know do \nall Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2526-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HERB TOBMAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Herb \nTobman, who passed away on Tuesday. Herb was from a different era of \nLas Vegas. The town was a lot smaller then, and everyone knew him as a \nsuccessful businessman and a community leader. What impressed me most \nabout Herb though was his quiet generosity that impacted the lives of \ncountless Nevadans. I know that Las Vegas would not be the place it is \ntoday without Herb Tobman.\n  I first saw Herb as a preteenager at Squires Park ballfield. He \nplayed fast-pitch softball in the Horseshoe Club championship league \nwith my brother Dale. His athletic accomplishments were widely known: \nHerb was a high school all star in every sport. He was a champion \nhandball and racquetball player, and later he went on to play \nprofessional basketball.\n  Herb was born in the Bronx in 1924. In the 1950s, Herb moved to Las \nVegas, where he secured a $1,200 loan. This small sum allowed Herb to \nopen City Furniture Exchange, the first used furniture store in Las \nVegas. The business thrived, and it was a Las Vegas landmark for more \nthan 25 years.\n  His success as a businessman led Herb to start Western Cab Company in \n1965. Herb started with one cab, and ended with more than 134 taxicabs \nand 355 employees.\n  Soon after, Herb took his business acumen to the gaming industry. He \nwas an associate of Moe Dalitz, the developer of the original Desert \nInn Hotel and Casino. Herb helped develop the Sundance Hotel and Casino \nin downtown Las Vegas. Before the modern Las Vegas casinos were built, \nthe Sundance was the tallest building on the Las Vegas skyline. In \naddition to these accomplishments, Herb also managed the Marina, \nFremont, Aladdin, and Stardust resorts. Herb was known throughout the \nindustry for his kindness and generosity to his employees.\n  In addition to his business accomplishments, Herb was also an active \nparticipant in Nevada politics. In 1986, he ran in the Democratic \ngubernatorial primary against incumbent Richard Bryan. Instead of using \nhis wealth to fuel his political aspirations, Herb limited \ncontributions to $10 per individual. Needless to say, those limits put \nhim at a competitive disadvantage, but Herb still managed to receive \nmore than 15 percent of the primary vote. The vote total is a testament \nto Herb's reputation throughout the state.\n  Accomplishments in business and politics would be enough for some \nmen, but it was not enough for Herb. From an early age, Herb learned \nthe importance of giving back to his community. Herb never sought \nrecognition for his efforts, but he impacted almost every life in \nsouthern Nevada.\n  Every year, during the holidays, Herb anonymously fed hundreds of \nhomeless individuals in Las Vegas. He helped local children with their \ncollege expenses, and he helped people who were down on their luck. No \nchallenge was too great. If Herb knew you needed help, he was there to \nprovide it oftentimes unknown to his beneficiaries. I needed help on \nseveral occasions, and Herb was always available. Herb was my friend \nand I will miss him very much.\n  There are many successful individuals throughout Nevada, but very few \nhad the sense of community of Herb Tobman. Nevada is a better place \nbecause of Herb.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2527-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n                      THE VALUE OF SERVING OTHERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Cameron Ball of Henderson, NV, recently \ndelivered a moving speech on the value of serving others to the \nCoronado High School Honor Society. Over the past year, Cameron and the \nstudent body of Coronado High School have worked tirelessly to improve \ntheir community. Many of these students will enter college next year, \nbut I hope they will keep Cameron's speech close to heart; service is a \nlifelong pursuit, and we all have an obligation to help others. I \ncongratulate these students on their accomplishments for Coronado High \nSchool and Henderson, NV.\n  I ask unanimous consent Cameron Ball's speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSpeech to 2005-2006 Inductees of Coronado High School's National Honor \n                                Society\n\n       Throughout the year, you have all proved yourselves \n     involved, caring, and crucial parts of our community. If we \n     were to have taken turns volunteering, one at a time, we \n     would have performed community service for more than a year. \n     Although this is a formal recognition of all your hard work \n     and service, you must all remember that dedication to a cause \n     does not end here, but it is a lifelong process. Induction \n     into NHS does not directly make your deeds significant, and \n     stops short of granting you success in life. Induction into \n     this club provides you with the experience you will need to \n     launch yourself into greater tasks. Emerson wrote: ``The only \n     reward of virtue, is virtue: the only way to have a friend, \n     is to be one.''\n       Induction into National Honor Society is not a life-\n     defining moment, but an infinitesimal instant in a continuum \n     of time. The significance of this club and its actions, your \n     actions, will seem to fade over the years. Spent will be the \n     money we worked so hard at raising from Hip Hop 4 Hearts; the \n     smiles we have put on the faces of those whom were fed, \n     clothes and given gifts will have waned. The tangible \n     accomplishments of this club will vanish gradually like \n     footprints in the sand. Instead, thoughts of college life \n     will fill your mind; money will still be sorely needed the \n     world over; and everywhere, pariahs of humanity will hide in \n     obscure poverty, waiting to be lifted from the black pit of \n     circumstance.\n       Nevertheless, our actions and intentions have not been in \n     vain. NHS has not immortalized the happiness of an \n     individual. That would be impossible. National Honor Society \n     has catalyzed your involvement in a lifelong process: a \n     journey of love; a wrestle with dignity; a mission to make a \n     difference. The road that lies before you is intrinsically \n     more important that what you have done with these past three \n     quarters of your high school career. With your experience and \n     whetted appetite to serve, you will find that it becomes \n     easier to replenish the smiles on the faces of troubled \n     friends and strangers. If you pledge yourself to improving \n     the lives of others, you ensure that life continues. My life, \n     taken alone, is meaningless. As soon as I become one with my \n     community, I gain an identity: a purpose. I can do this by \n     volunteering, donating the fruits of my labor to a worthy \n     cause, or simply by giving everyone I see a smile. After all, \n     ``a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature'' \n     (Emerson). Deeds, both great and small, are never wasted. As \n     Emily Dickinson wrote:\n\n     If I can stop one heart from breaking,\n     I shall not live in vain:\n     If I can ease one life the aching,\n     Or cool one pain,\n     Or help one fainting robin\n     Unto his nest again,\n     I shall not live in vain.\n\n       Your deeds have been exceptional thus far, and for that we \n     recognize you here today. The next step in serving is to shed \n     yourself of recognition for your actions. Give back to your \n     community more than you take from it, and do so modestly. Do \n     not boast of your accomplishments. Conceit never cured any \n     illnesses. Lao Tzu, ancient philosopher, propounds: ``True \n     virtue does not `act,' and has no intentions . . . Know \n     glory, but cleave to humiliation.'' By doing this, you will \n     rally others to your side--kindle in the despondent, a flame \n     of hope. Know your charge. Lift others to your side, and \n     never push them down. As for yourself, transcend the grasps \n     of hubris, and look to austere altruism for your guidance, \n     albeit at times seemingly insignificant, for even the \n     smallest action can change the course of history.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2527-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            DEATH OF FORMER ESTONIAN PRESIDENT LENNART MERI\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I would like to honor the \nextraordinary life and legacy of the late Estonian President Lennart \nMeri. President Meri was an inspiration to his countrymen, a true \nfriend of the United States, and a stalwart advocate for freedom. His \npassing on March 14, 2006, was a tremendous loss to the people of \nEstonia and the world.\n  Born in 1929 to the renowned diplomat and Shakespearean translator \nGeorg Meri, Lennart's early childhood exemplified the plight of the \nEstonian people. Living in a country ravaged by war and subjected to \nthe brutality of Soviet occupation, Lennart attended nine different \nschools and studied in four different languages. He was eventually \ndeported from his homeland to Siberia along with thousands of other \nEstonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. During his forced exile, he \nhelped feed his family by picking potatoes.\n  President Meri experienced more hardship as a boy than most men do in \na lifetime, but he was quick to turn his struggles into opportunities. \nIn the course of his itinerant education he became fluent in French, \nGerman, English, and Russian. He also developed a tenacity that would \nserve him well throughout his life.\n  Lennart eventually came back to Estonia to study history and \nlanguages, graduating from Tartu University with honors in 1958. The \nSoviet Government prevented Lennart from working as an Estonian \nhistorian, but he again found possibility where others might have only \nseen discouragement. Instead of accepting defeat, he established \nhimself as a writer, filmmaker, and dramatist, and used these avenues \nto preserve Estonia's national identity.\n  For over 20 years, the Soviet Union refused to allow Lennart to \nventure beyond the Iron Curtain. Ultimately, when he did travel abroad, \nhe served as a lone, unofficial emissary of what was by then an almost \nforgotten country. He established contact with politicians and \njournalists, recounting the story of Estonia to whoever would listen. \nWhen the collapse of the Soviet empire finally freed his country, \nLennart was able to continue representing his newly independent \nhomeland as an Ambassador and Foreign Minister. Ultimately, Lennart \nserved two terms as President of the country he had loved and \nchampioned for so long.\n  Lennart's accomplishments were myriad; he helped build Estonia's \nForeign Service from the ground up, established strong ties with the \nWest, and reached an historic agreement with Boris Yeltsin to end \nRussia's military presence in Estonia. Beyond these remarkable \nachievements, though, Lennart left behind a bequest of liberty that \nwill endure along with the free nation of Estonia. I hope each of us \nwill appreciate that legacy and continue working to advance the cause \nof freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2527-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2527-S2528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I want to give a statement on \nWomen's History Month. This is an important time for Americans to \nreflect on the invaluable contributions women make in our society. \nWomen are our families, our coworkers, and our neighbors. They juggle \nmany roles in making our homes, our neighborhoods, and our country \nstronger. Eighty million women in our country are mothers. Sixty \npercent of American women work at least part time. Nearly 2 million \nAmerican women are veterans. More than 200,000 women are doctors, and \nmore than 2\\1/2\\ million women are registered nurses.\n  South Dakota's own history is filled with women who balanced the \nneeds of their families and their communities to make our country \nbetter. Mamie Pyle is one such woman. In 1902, Mamie's husband passed \naway when she was just 36, leaving her to raise four young children on \nher own. Not only did Mamie find a way to send all four of her children \nto college in the early 1900s, but she also led the South Dakota \nwomen's suffrage movement for a decade. Because of Mamie's \ndetermination, South Dakota ratified the national women's suffrage \namendment in 1919. Mamie continued to serve her community as a member \nof the Huron College board of trustees for more than 40 years. In 1947, \nSouth Dakotans honored Mamie by naming her the State's Mother of the \nYear at age 81.\n  It is women like Mamie who teach South Dakota girls--and all of us--\nof the difference one person can make in our society and of the \nthousands of women who have made South Dakota the great State it is \ntoday.\n  This month we remember that women are our soldiers, our doctors, our \nsocial workers, our mothers, and our teachers. And we remember the \nwomen who came before them and made these roles possible. So many of\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nthem are unknown to us, but our gratitude to all of them is no less \nreal.\n  Women's opportunities continue to expand in South Dakota, in America, \nand throughout the world. They are leaders in South Dakota, taking on \nnew roles every day in our communities. Cecelia Fire Thunder is one \nsuch woman. Cecelia is the first female president of the Oglala Sioux \nTribe. She has fought to improve the education of her tribe's children \nand the health of her tribe's community. This is not Cecelia's first \nrole as a caregiver to her community. Before becoming president, she \nwas a nurse and healthcare provider.\n  Yet even as we celebrate South Dakota's women of yesterday and today, \nwe live in uncertain times for women. As we honor the women who have \nhelped us throughout history and those who make our country a better \nplace today, it is imperative that we keep our promises to them.\n  As the 200,000 active American women soldiers return home, we must \nkeep our promise to them to give them access to the health care they \nneed. Four million women are battered in their homes in this country \nevery year. We must keep our promise to them to fully fund law \nenforcement and violence prevention programs under the Violence Against \nWomen Act. More than 2,500 children will be born into poverty today \nalone in this country. We must keep our promise to their mothers that \nevery child in every community in this country will receive a quality \neducation. One in four Native American women live in poverty. We must \nkeep our promise to them to make their communities stronger with \nprograms that provide access to quality, affordable housing under the \nNative American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act.\n  And most importantly, when the women in our communities are \nvulnerable, we cannot abandon them. We cannot ignore their needs. When \nwe know that the leading causes of death for women are heart disease \nand cancer--and the average fatality rates for South Dakotans with \nthese diseases are higher than the national average fatality rates--we \ncannot cut Government support for research that will cure these deadly \ndiseases as the current 2007 budget proposes. We as a community must \nstand by our promise to women to find a cure for these diseases.\n  This month we honor the women who protect our values in our homes, in \nour communities and overseas. This month we thank them for their \nsacrifices, their compassion, and their leadership. This month we renew \nour promises to them to continue building a safer, better, more just \nsociety for them, for their families and for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2528-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF GERALD J.

Arcari \nMeritorious Achievement Award from the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica--MOAA--on March 18, 2006.\n  I have come to know Gary through his service as minority staff \ndirector of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, of which \nI am ranking member. His responsibilities include recruiting and \nretention, separation and retirement, pay and benefits, personnel \npolicies, military medical programs, and military officer nominations. \nGary is highly deserving of this award for his strong staff work on \nnumerous legislative initiatives affecting military people.

Mr. President, I rise today with sadness to note the \npassing of a college basketball icon, Ray Meyer, the longtime coach of \nthe DePaul University Blue Demons. Mr. Meyer died on March 17 of \ncongestive heart failure at age 92. Although we mourn his passing, I \nchoose to celebrate the memory of a good and decent man and a \nquintessential Chicagoan.\n  Ray Meyer had a hardscrabble upbringing on the West Side of Chicago \nthe youngest in a family of seven boys and three girls. His dad ran a \nwholesale candy business but died when young Ray was only 13. Finding \nan outlet in competitive sports--baseball, basketball, football, and \nwrestling--Ray Meyer started to make a name for himself at St. Agatha's \nGrade School, Quigley Preparatory Seminary, and St. Patrick's Academy.\n  Coach Ray's earliest mentoring skills led him to the love of his \nlife--Margaret Mary Delaney--when a local priest cajoled Ray into \nassisting him with the St. Agatha's parish girls team. The ``Coach and \nMarge'' had a lifelong love affair in a marriage of 46 years that ended \nonly with Marge's death in 1985 at age 72.\n  Earning a scholarship to Notre Dame under coach George Keogan, Ray \nMeyer had a distinguished collegiate career. He graduated on the honor \nroll with classmates including future Notre Dame president Theodore \nHesburgh and future executive vice president Edmund Joyce. Graduating \nin 1938, Ray was the proud recipient of Notre Dame's Byron V. Kanaley \nAward for lettermen demonstrating the highest in academic achievement \nand leadership.\n  Following graduation, Meyer worked several jobs unrelated to his love \nof sports. Shortly after his marriage, Ray was offered the job of \nbasketball coach at Joliet Catholic high school, but he refused when \nthe school fell $100 short of his requirement for an $1,900 annual \nsalary. But fate intervened when his former Notre Dame coach George \nKeogan suffered a heart attack and Ray was hired to fill in for the \nremainder of the 1940-41 season, staying on as an assistant to Keogan \nuntil 1942 when DePaul University came calling.\n  Early in his career, Coach Meyer was blessed with a bespectacled, \ngangly 6-foot-10-inch center named George Mikan. Mikan, who later was \nnamed the outstanding player of the first half of the 20th century, was \nawkward and inexperienced. Under Ray Meyer's tutelage and his own work \nethic, George Mikan turned into a dominating force as one of the first \ntrue big men to excel at the college level.\n  In 1943, Mikan and his DePaul mates played in the 1943 NCAA \ntournament against the Georgetown Hoyas and a freshman reserve named \nHenry Hyde the same Henry Hyde who is just now serving his final term \nin the other body as a distinguished member of Congress from Illinois. \nIn 1945, the Mikan-led Blue Demons won the National Invitational \nTournament, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA \ntourney.\n  Coming to DePaul in 1942, Coach Ray stayed 42 years on the sidelines \nand another 13 as the colorful radio broadcaster for the games of the \nschool he loved, then coached by his former player and son, Joey Meyer. \nRay Meyer's list of coaching accomplishments is truly impressive: 724 \nvictories at 1 school; 55 years of attending all of DePaul's 1,467 \ngames; 37 winning seasons; an NIT title in 1945; NCAA Final Four teams \nin 1943 and 1979; and membership in the Basketball Hall of Fame. DePaul \nUniversity recognized the role of Coach and his wife as ambassadors in \nits expansion to the largest Catholic University in the United States. \nDePaul named in its campus Fitness and Recreation Center after the \ncoach and the floor at its home court, Allstate Arena, as the ``Ray and \nMarge Meyer Court.''\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\n  Coach Meyer was not only good, he was resourceful. For many years, \nhis recruiting budget was minimal. Enticing promising players to come \nto a school in the shadow of the North Side ``L'' was difficult. \nFinding housing for players near a campus with little student housing \nat that time was also a challenge. Sometimes, the players were fed from \nthe Meyer kitchen or some extra meal tickets at the Roma on the corner \nof Sheffield and Webster, where they could enjoy a great Italian beef \nsandwich. But Coach was imaginative and diligent. He used both \nqualities to establish and operate a basketball camp in Three Lakes, \nWI, for 55 summers.\n  Ray Meyer left an impact on all of his players. He had some great \nones Mikan, Jim Lamkin, Howie Carl, Dave Corzine, Mark Aguirre, Rod \nStrickland, Terry Cummings, and Dallas Comegys, among others. But he \nhad an incalculable impact on his school, his family and friends, \nChicago, the Midwest and the Nation. Hall of Fame coach and native \nChicagoan, Mike Krzyzewski, may have said it best:\n\n       Coach Meyer casts a large shadow on the game of college \n     basketball. . . . He truly loved the game and the kids he \n     coached. It was so evident. In each game that he coached and \n     each game that he announced. I love him. He served as a great \n     example of what a coach should be.''\n\n  To his children sons Tom, Joey, Bob and daughters Barbara and Pat and \nhis 18 grandchildren, I send my most heartfelt condolences, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and memory of a \nwonderful human being, Coach Ray Meyer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2529-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        IN MEMORY OF BUCK OWENS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I rise to honor the memory \nof the late Buck Owens, the Country Music Hall of Fame honoree who \nintroduced a uniquely California sound to country music. Mr. Owens, a \nlong time Bakersfield resident, passed away at his home on March 25, \n2006. He was 76 years old.\n  Alvis Edgar Owens, Jr. was born in Sherman, TX, in 1932. At an early \nage, he nicknamed himself, ``Buck,'' after a mule on the family farm. \nSeeking better fortune during the Great Depression, the Owens family \nmoved west in 1937, settling in Mesa, AZ.\n  An avid music fan, Buck learned to play the guitar in his early \nteens. By his late teens, he was already a regular on local radio \nstations and was playing shows in honky tonks and bars around Phoenix. \nA precocious and determined young man, it was apparent to many that \nBuck was a prodigiously talented musician who was destined for great \nsuccess.\n  Buck's many accomplishments amassed over a five-decade recording and \nperforming career have rightfully cemented his status as one of the \ngreatest country-western entertainers ever. He was truly a trailblazer \nwhose trademark stinging electric guitar and rhythm sound \nrevolutionized country music. Buck's 21 country singles from 1963 to \n1988 were a testament to his longevity and staying power. Buck's music \nwas universally celebrated and embraced, as evidence by the Beatles' \ncover of his song, ``Act Naturally'' in 1965. The consummate \nentertainer, Buck's iconic television entertainment show, ``Hee Haw'' \nenjoyed a remarkable 25 year run on the airwaves.\n  I was delighted to have met Buck back in 1997 at his Crystal Palace \nin Bakersfield. He was kind and generous of spirit, as when I was \ninvited to present one of his special red, white, and blue guitars to a \npromising music student named William Villatoro. I still vividly \nremember how the young man was deeply moved and inspired by his \ngenerous gesture. I will certainly remember Buck Owens as a man of \ngreat compassion who possessed a profound love for his country. \nAlthough he is no longer with us, I take great comfort in knowing that \nBuck Owens was not only able to be a shining light in the life of a \nyoung man from Bakersfield, but also to the millions of others who \nadmired his musical gifts and were touched by his humanity.\n  Buck Owens has left behind a legacy of artistry and boundless love \nfor his adopted hometown of Bakersfield and California's Central \nValley. He will be dearly missed.\n  Buck Owens is survived by his three sons, Buddy Alan, Michael, and \nJohnny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2529-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING JAZZ LEGEND AND COLORADAN DIANNE REEVES\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to one of \nthe world's most recognized jazz vocalists who also happens to call \nDenver home--Dianne Reeves.\n  Earlier this year, Dianne won a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album, \nthis time for her work on the soundtrack of the Best Picture-nominee, \n``Good Night, and Good Luck.'' The album is filled with standards like \n``Straighten Up and Fly Right,'' and ``Too Close for Comfort.''\n  Dianne grew up in Denver where she was raised by her grandmother, \ntaking piano lessons before discovering her love of singing. She got \nher start in the jazz band at Denver's George Washington High School \nwhen she was discovered by trumpeter Clark Terry while performing with \nthe band at the National Association of Jazz Educators Conference in \nChicago. She went on to tour with Harry Belafonte while still in her \ntwenties before being signed to the legendary Blue Note record label in \n1987. Just 4 years ago, the world enjoyed her performance at the \nclosing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, \nthat critics called ``spellbinding.''\n  This Grammy award was not Dianne's first. Rather, it was her fourth \nin six nominations. Previously, she won the Best Jazz Vocal award 3 \nyears in a row, an unprecedented feat for an artist in any vocal \ncategory. She has joined with fellow jazz giants like Wynton Marsalis, \nrecorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, performed with the Berlin \nPhilharmonic, and was the first vocalist to perform at the Walt Disney \nConcert Hall in Los Angeles.\n  Dianne has been recognized around the world for her outstanding \nartistic accomplishments and contributions, and we in Colorado are \nproud that she still calls our State ``home.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2529-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2529-S2530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PIEDMONT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, DULUTH, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Piedmont \nElementary School, in Duluth, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Piedmont School is truly a model of educational success. The school \nhas 220 pupils in kindergarten through grade 5 and provides school \nreadiness services for 30 preschool children.\n  One program unique to Piedmont Elementary is its reverse-\nmainstreaming program, which makes it possible for kindergarteners to \nspend time in a special education classroom for kindergarten children \nwith special needs. The experience helps these children to interact \nbetter with one another and to appreciate the challenges that some \nchildren must meet every day.\n  The school prides itself on its efforts to ensure that everyone will \nfeel valued at Piedmont and that everyone--pupils, staff, parents, \ngrandparents, and visitors--will know that they are always welcome. In \nkeeping with this cordial theme, each child arriving at Piedmont for \nthe first time receives the red-carpet treatment: A red carpet of \nconstruction paper, which is signed by all the children currently \nenrolled, is laid down as part of the welcoming ceremony.\n  Also along the lines of good citizenship, each month, a new character \ntrait is taught in the classrooms and at monthly assemblies, focusing \non respect, responsibility, compassion, citizenship, fairness, and \nhonesty.\n  Much of the credit for Piedmont School's success belongs to its \nprincipal, Kris Teberg, and her dedicated teachers. The children and \nstaff at Piedmont School understand that, in order to be successful, a \nschool must go beyond achieving academic success; it must also provide \na nurturing environment where students develop the knowledge, skills, \nand attitudes for success throughout life.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Eveleth-\nGilbert Public Schools, in Eveleth, MN, and Gilbert, MN, which recently \nearned an Award for Excellence in Education for exceptional and \ninnovative achievements in educating children.\n  The Eveleth-Gilbert Public School District is truly a model of \neducational success. About 10 years ago, the district initiated an \naccelerated reader program to teach literacy skills and an appreciation \nfor reading at all grade levels. Originally, this unique reading \nprogram was established for the District's 10th-grade students and is \nnow used in grades 2 through 12.\n  The accelerated reader program takes a fun and exciting approach to \npromoting reading, both at school and at home. The students read books \nand take a 10-question, computer-assisted assessment to score their \ncomprehension, earning accelerated reader points for every assessment \nthey pass. The students love to track their own progress, and teachers \noften involve the class in setting goals for accruing accelerated \nreader points. Students receive instant feedback and gain increased \nmotivation to read more books. As students test themselves on more \nbooks, the accelerated reader system enables close monitoring of \ngeneral levels or reading performance and other diagnostic information.\n  The success of the accelerated reader program is reflected in the \nstudents' scores on the reading portion of the Minnesota Comprehensive \nAssessment tests. Over the past 2 years, Franklin Elementary and Nelle \nShean Elementary, the district's two elementary schools, and Eveleth-\nGilbert Senior High School, earned four- and five-star status from the \nMinnesota Department of Education for their test scores in reading.\n  Much of the credit for the success of the Eveleth-Gilbert Public \nSchools belongs to the superintendent, Mike Lang; the building \nprincipals, Deborah Hildie, Jan Mesich, and Lyn Bol; and all the \ndistrict's dedicated teachers. The students and staff at the Eveleth-\nGilbert Public Schools understand that, in order to be successful, a \ndistrict must go beyond achieving academic success; it must also \nprovide a nurturing environment where students can develop the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout life. All of \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Eveleth-Gilbert Public Schools \nshould be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate the Eveleth-Gilbert Public Schools in Eveleth and \nGilbert for winning the Award for Excellence in Education and for \nexceptional contributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2530-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DENFELD HIGH SCHOOL, DULUTH, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Virginia \nPublic Schools, in Virginia, MN, which recently earned an Award for \nExcellence in Education for exceptional and innovative achievements in \neducating children.\n  The Virginia Public School District is truly a model of educational \nsuccess. The district has superbly nurtured students' progress in \nacademics and in the performing arts. Its educators are very proud of \ntheir students' accomplishments and believe that the school system \nprovides young people with the highest quality of education in a \nwonderful learning environment.\n  Nestled in the center of Minnesota's Iron Range, the Virginia Public \nSchool District has endured the ups and downs of a difficult economic \nclimate and declining school enrollments, while continuing to produce \nextraordinary student successes, academically and artistically.\n  In 2004-2005, 100 percent of the seniors at Virginia Public Schools \npassed the Basic Standards Tests in reading, writing, and mathematics. \nStudents at Virginia Secondary School are qualified to enrol in many \nchallenging, upper-level courses, including honors British literature, \nadvanced placement biology, physics, and Spanish 3, honors American \nliterature, accounting, economics, history, and medical careers.\n  Much of Virginia's success has been attributed to a caring, well-\nseasoned staff of veteran teachers. Nearly 80 percent of Virginia's \nfaculty have 10 or more years of teaching experience. Moreover, 54 \npercent of Virginia's teachers hold master's degrees.\n  In addition to strong academic programs, Virginia is justly proud of \nits extraordinary music programs. The band, orchestra, and choir \nstudents are second to none in the region and well known throughout \nMinnesota. The orchestra program, which is the only string program \nremaining on the Iron Range, is one of only a handful existing outside \nof the Twin Cities metropolitan area.\n  The Virginia vocal music program has a strong tradition of \nexcellence, reaching back decades. Virginia's A Cappela Choir, the \nschool's premier choir, has consistently won superior ratings at the \nState music contest.\n  The Virginia band program is led by the award-winning Virginia \nMarching Blues, who have traveled across the United States and Canada, \nwinning numerous awards and splendidly representing Virginia and the \nState of Minnesota. The jazz band and the concert band also \nconsistently win superior ratings at the State music contest, achieving \nthis distinction virtually every year for three decades.\n  Much of the credit for the Virginia School District's success belongs \nto its superintendent, Phil Johnson; the dedicated principals, Michael \nKrebsbach, Willie Spelts, and Kraig Konietzko; and all the district's \nteachers.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the city of Coalinga, one of the few California cities \nthat was founded as a mining boomtown and survived.\n  The city originally known as ``Coaling'' was a sleepy coal mining \ntown until oil was prospected in the region as early as 1865 by \nSoutherners displaced by the Civil War. However, aside from being used \nto control dust on the roads and as a pitch for roofing, there was \nlimited use for petroleum in those days. Limited uses, coupled with \ntransportation challenges, caused early interest in oil to die down \nconsiderably. In 1891, the Southern Pacific Railroad purchased the 160-\nacre Melville Curtiss homestead and laid out the town site that became \nCoalinga. Local folklore attributes the desire for better musical \neffect for the addition of the final ``a'' and the eventual adoption of \nthe town name, Coalinga. By the time the city was incorporated on April \n3, 1906, the interest in oil had risen again.\n  In 1909, the Silver Tip well broke loose in the greatest gusher \nrecorded in California at that time; spraying 36,000 barrels of oil in \na 72-hour period. The emergence of Coalinga as an oil boomtown caused \nenough excitement that the Los Angeles Stock Exchange was shut down for \na day so that the financiers of California could go witness and \nexperience the boom for themselves. At its peak, the Silver Tip well \nproduced 10,000 barrels of oil a day.\n  Coalinga's thriving oil fields of that time were to produce \npersonalities and companies that were to become the giants of the \nindustry. R.C. Baker, the founder of Baker Oil Tools, first honed his \ntrade in Coalinga. Republic Oil Field Supply can also trace its \nbeginnings to the city. The formula for world famous A root beer was \nfirst concocted in downtown Coalinga. Perhaps most famously, Coalinga's \noilfield workers fought and won the industry's first 8-hour workday.\n  On May 2, 1983, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake altered the face of \nCoalinga. All the brick buildings constructed during the 1900s boom \ntoppled or they had to be demolished. A large slice of the character \nand charm of Old Coalinga was lost. However, the town's residents \ndemonstrated remarkable unity and determination in putting forth the \nhard work to make sure that Coalinga continues to grow in spite of the \nearthquake. Today, the former boomtown with the old brick buildings \nthat was left reeling after the 1983 earthquake is a thriving city that \nis primed for even greater residential and business growth in the \nfuture.\n  For the past century, the city of Coalinga has served as a testament \nto the importance of community, optimism, and cooperation. As the \nresidents of Coalinga work together with great pride to make their city \na better place to call home, I congratulate them on their centennial \nanniversary and wish them another 100 years of good fortune and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2531-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORIAM TO JUDGE DELBERT E. WONG\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Delbert Wong, the first Chinese-American judge in the \ncontinental United States. Judge Wong passed away on March 10, 2006, at \nthe age of 85.\n  Delbert Wong was born in Hanford, CA, on May 17, 1920, and was raised \na short distance away in Bakersfield. After obtaining an associate of \narts degree from Bakersfield College, he transferred to the University \nof California, Berkeley, where he received an undergraduate degree in \nbusiness.\n  After he left U.C. Berkeley, Delbert joined the Army Air Corps during \nWorld War II and became one of 18 B-17 Flying Fortress navigators that \ngraduated in his class at Mather Field in Sacramento. During his \nservice with the military, he was 1 of only 3 navigators who completed \ntheir 30 bombing missions. For his bravery and dedication, 1LT Delbert \nWong was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, as well as four Air \nMedals, for his wartime service.\n  Following the war, Delbert was faced with a tough choice: should he \njoin his family's grocery business or enter law school? He chose law \nschool, and in 1949 became the first Chinese American graduate of \nStanford University's School of Law. After his graduation, Delbert \ncontinued to break new ground. He was the first Asian American to be \nappointed Deputy Legislative Counsel serving the California State \nLegislature, and the first Asian American to be appointed a deputy \nstate attorney general.\n  During his tenure as a deputy State attorney general, Delbert was \nappointed by then-Governor Pat Brown to the Los Angeles County \nMunicipal Court bench in 1959, making him the first Chinese American \nnamed to the bench in the continental United States. Two years later, \nJudge Wong was elevated to the superior court, where he served for over \n20 years.\n  Throughout his career, Judge Wong was an exemplary jurist who \ndedicated his life to public service. Even after he retired from the \nbench in 1986, he continued to be deeply involved in his community.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Judge Wong researched and reported on \nracial issues within the Los Angeles Airport Police Bureau at the \nrequest of the Los Angeles Department of Airports; was appointed by \nthen-mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley to serve on a panel tasked with \ndrafting an ethics policy for the city of Los Angeles; and was \nappointed chair of the Asian Pacific American Focus Program of the \nNational Conference of Christians and Jews, to combat the rise in \nviolence against Asian Americans.\n  Together with his wife Dolores, Judge Wong was also an ardent \nsupporter of the Chinese American community, making significant \ncontributions to the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, the Chinatown \nService Center, and the Asian Pacific American Friends of the Center \nTheater Group.\n  Judge Wong was a trailblazer for Asian Americans in the field of law. \nHis dedication to justice and equality was evident in everything that \nhe did. His many years of service--for the city of Los Angeles, for the \nState of California and for the Nation will not be forgotten.\n  Judge Wong is survived by his wife Dolores; his children Kent, \nShelley, Duane, and Marshall; and his three grandchildren. I extend my \ndeepest sympathies to his family.\n  Whether he was fighting for our country or fighting for integrity and \nequality under the law, Judge Delbert Wong was undeterred in his \nefforts to make America a better place to live. He will be missed by \nall who knew him. We take comfort in knowing that future generations \nwill benefit from his passion and dedication to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2531-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2531-S2532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3440.

A bill to provide standing for civil actions for declaratory \nand injunctive relief to persons who refrain from electronic \ncommunications through fear of being subject to warrantless electronic \nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one of the issues that has been hovering \nover this Chamber--and this country, of course--is the NSA program, the \nPresident's program to do wiretaps on American citizens if part of the \ncall originated in a foreign country.\n  First, let me stress that I think most of us in this Chamber, \nDemocrat and Republican--certainly myself--believe the President should \nbe given the tools he needs to fight terror. In this brave new world, \nthe tools are different, and because a rule worked in 1960 or 1980 does \nnot necessarily mean it works in 2005 or 2006 or 2004. We have to be \nflexible. I think you can be flexible in a way that both protects our \nsecurity and protects our liberty. In most issues, this does not \nconflict. My watchword on most of these issues is: Have a debate, have \na standard, and have an independent arbiter check that that standard is \nbeing met.\n  That worked, for instance, in wiretaps. Before 1971, it was a mess. \nJ. Edgar Hoover was listening in on whomever he chose. There was a \ndebate on this issue. There was a standard--probable cause--and there \nis an independent arbiter, a federal judge, who determines whether \nprobable cause is met. And it works. Neither the prosecutors nor the \ndefense bar have any complaints.\n  We could come to the same exact conclusion in the new world we face, \nwhere warrants are needed far more quickly regarding many more people. \nIf you are doing information gathering where you look for patterns, \nthat might be needed. Again, because one way worked in the past doesn't \nmean it still works, and I think most Members, myself included, want to \nbe flexible. The problem is when the executive branch arrogates this \nissue to itself and says, We can decide to do whatever we want, either \nunder the constitutional executive power--that is pretty broad--or even \nunder a grant of war powers, a grant to use force which, as most know, \nI supported back when the President asked for it in 2001.\n  Now there is a great debate. The President and his supporters say he \nwas allowed to do these wiretaps without changing the law, without \ncongressional approval. Some on the other side say he never should have \nbeen allowed to do it. I think that is a small minority. Many others \nsay: Yes, he should be allowed to do it, but there ought to be a \ncongressional debate, a change in the law, and perhaps a standard would \nbe applied.\n  Right now we are deadlocked on that issue. We are deadlocked because, \nwhether it is the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee on \nwhich I serve, this body in general, or the Nation--nobody knows, did \nthe President go outside the ambit of the law about asking for a \nwarrant? Some think yes, and they are pretty sure of that. Some think \nno, and they are pretty sure of it. They are pretty sure that he \ncouldn't. Many are not sure at all.\n  I ask you, who is the logical group or person to make that \ndetermination? The executive branch generally through our history has \nhad a lean to expand executive power. That is natural.\n  The legislative branch has had a lean on the other side. That is how \nthe Founding Fathers set up our Government in their wisdom and it seems \nto have worked very well ever since 1789. To say we should just go \nalong with what the executive branch wants is not going to work. \nFrankly, even though I am a Senator and believe in protecting the \nlegislative prerogative, if we only did what the legislative branch \nwanted, that probably wouldn't work, either; and, needless to say, we \nare divided on this.\n  The most logical place for this to be settled is in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. They don't side with executive or legislative power, \nnecessarily. They are authoritative, they are respected, in a sense \nthey are the supreme arbiters, and they could put this question to rest \nand we could move on.\n  There is one difficulty. There will be people who will challenge \nthese wiretaps through the normal process and we might get to the \nSupreme Court in 3 or 4 years. During all that time, the gridlock and \ndeadlock we face on this issue, and the concomitant gridlock and \ndeadlock that occurs in other issues related to this, would be hanging \nover this body. So I tried to figure out how can we get the Supreme \nCourt to hear this case quickly.\n  The bill I am introducing right now will do just that. We have \nconsulted some expert authorities and there are two basic problems--one \neasier, one harder. The easier is to simply expedite the judicial \nprocess, to grant expedited review. The minute a case is decided in the \ndistrict court, it goes right up to the Supreme Court because time is \nof the essence--and I believe it is here. We have good precedent for \nthis. It was done recently so the Supreme Court could hear on an \nexpedited basis McCain-Feingold, and they came to a conclusion, and \nelections could be held and we moved forward. That is a typical example \nof where you would do that.\n  Our bill does grant such expedited review. But what about standing? \nHow do you quickly get into the district court to do this? And, by the \nway, I have a feeling very few in this body would want to grant an \nexpedited hearing to someone who might be participating in or accused \nof terrorism. So you have a dilemma that, while you want expedited \nreview and it would seem logical that the Supreme Court should be the \nplace, the cases that are out there are not the ones that would seem to \nmerit that kind of expedited review--a special case; particularly if \nsomeone is accused of terrorism. We in New York know better than \nanywhere else that is a dastardly act.\n  What we have done--frankly, in consultation with some leading experts \non this--is we have granted standing to a\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nvery narrow class of citizens who actually have refrained from making \noverseas calls because of a fear that they might be listened to under \nthe NSA program. But these are not people who are accused of terrorism \nin any way. These are, rather, people who maybe would be--and it is a \nsmall class--business people who would regularly call, say, \nAfghanistan. Maybe they are importing rugs, who knows? But they are \nafraid to because their calls might be listened in to.\n  It might be academics, maybe a professor of linguistics who might be \ndoing research into the Pashtun language, and now has refrained from \nmaking calls. These are people who have been chilled by the reports \nthat their calls might be listened in to. They are American citizens \ncalling the foreign country and would have standing.\n  Our bill gives those people standing, gives them a right to go to \ndistrict court quickly and then with expedited review to the Supreme \nCourt, so we could actually get a decision, very possibly, on whether \nthe President's wiretapping was under the ambit of the law very \nquickly. It is very authoritative. It might break through the dilemmas \nwe face.\n  I am introducing this legislation this afternoon and I ask my \ncolleagues to give it careful consideration. It is clearly not partisan \nlegislation. Given the current composition of the Supreme Court and the \ntwo new Justices who have just been added, it is hardly a liberal or \nDemocratic court, and it could settle the issue once and for all so our \ncountry could achieve some comity on this issue and move on and discuss \nother issues.\n  I urge my colleagues and everyone else in this great country of ours \nto examine this legislation, see if they wish to support this \nlegislation or something close to it, and maybe we can move this kind \nof bill on the floor quickly so we could get the kind of expedited \nreview that I think many of us would seek from the one body that would \nhave the authority to make such review ultimately, and that is the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  The bill will be handed to the desk for introduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2470. A bill to authorize early repayment of obligations to the \nBureau of Reclamation within the A Irrigation District in the State \nof Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southern \nIdaho Bureau of Reclamation Repayment Act of 2006. This Act authorizes \nprepayment by landowners of their allocated portion of the obligations \nto the Bureau of Reclamation within A Irrigation District and will \nallow individual landowners to prepay their obligations if they so \ndesire. Additionally, the Act will allow the landowners who have \nprepaid to be exempt from the acreage limitation provisions set in the \nReclamation Reform Act of 1982, thereby creating an appropriate market \nfor the sale of those lands now owned by landowners who have either \ndied or have retired.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this necessary \nbill through the legislative process quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2475. A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of a National Museum of the American Latino Community, to \ndevelop a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a \nNational Museum of the American Latino Community in Washington, DC, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today which I believe will enhance the experience of the \nmillions of visitors who visit our Nation's Capital every year, and \nwill contribute to the ongoing, deeply rewarding, and profoundly \nimportant process of national self-discovery. As we learn more about \nwho we are as Americans, we gain strength from our history and enrich \nour vision for the future.\n  In that spirit, together with Senators Martinez, Hatch, Bingaman, \nHutchison, and Menendez, I have introduced the National Museum of the \nAmerican Latino Community Commission Act. The bill will establish a \nCommission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the \nAmerican Latino Community. The Commission members, selected by the \nPresident and Members of Congress, will be tasked with studying the \nimpact of such a Museum, developing a plan of action and a fundraising \nplan, and proposing recommendations to make the Museum a reality.\n  I am pleased to be building on the work of several members of \nCongress during the 108th Congress, most notably Senator Hatch and \nCongressman Xavier Becerra.\n  On May 10, 2005, Congressman Xavier Becerra re-introduced the \nCommission bill in the House of Representatives with Congresswoman \nIlleana Ros-Lehtinen. Since then, 107 Representatives have lent their \nsupport to H.R. 2134, and tomorrow, the Subcommittee on National Parks, \nRecreation and Public Lands in the House Resources Committee will meet \nto examine the proposal.\n  Washington, DC is more than the seat of our government; it is the \nsymbolic heart of our country. When American travel to their Capital, \nthey expect the museums, monuments, and national parks they visit to \nreflect the complete American experience. I celebrate the recent \nopening of the National Museum of the American Indian and the \nannouncement of the location of the new National Museum of African \nAmerican History and Culture. I believe we must celebrate the diversity \nof our Nation and her rich national heritage.\n  Many assume that Hispanics have just arrived on our country's shores. \nBut these newly arrived Hispanics are only a small segment of a much \nlarger community that has been an integral part of American history \nsince before our country was founded.\n  Hispanics soldiers fought in the American Revolution alongside \nGeneral George Washington, our first Commander-in-Chief, and have \nserved in every subsequent military conflict in which the U.S. has \nfought. During the war that led to our Nation's birth, General \nWashington's army was successful at Yorktown in part because of support \nfrom a diverse army led by Bernardo de Galvez on a southern front \nagainst the British, driving them out of the Gulf of Mexico, fighting \nthem on the Mississippi and in Florida.\n  In the Korean War, 140,000 Hispanic soldiers served. During the \nVietnam War, more than 80,000 Hispanics served. While Hispanics \ncomprised only 4.5 percent of the U.S. population at the time, they \nrepresented 5.5 percent of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir country. More recently, 20,000 Hispanics took part in Operation \nDesert Shield and Desert Storm. And today, more than 10 percent of the \nUnited States Armed Forces are Hispanics.\n  In sum, we will honor the more than 1.1 million Hispanic veterans \nliving in America today, by sharing this long history with all who come \nto our Nation's Capital.\n  My own family's story speaks to this truth.\n  Over 400 years ago, in 1598, my family helped found the oldest city \nin what is now these United States. They named the city Santa Fe--the \nCity of Holy Faith--because they knew the hand of God would guide them \nthrough the struggles of survival in the ages ahead.\n  For the next four centuries, that faith in their future guided them \nto overcome extremely painful and challenging times. As humble and poor \nfarmers, the circumstances of their lives forged the priceless and \ntimeless values my father Henry and mother Emma instilled in their \neight children.\n  They were indeed a part of our country's greatest generation. My \nmother traveled across the country to work in the Pentagon's War \nDepartment, and my father was a proud veteran of World War II. In fact, \none of his last requests was to be buried in his uniform.\n  Although neither had a college degree, they taught us about the \nvalues and promise of America. All eight of their children became first \ngeneration college graduates, inspired by their\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\ndedication to God, family, community and country.\n  As the National Capital Planning Commission states: ``the memorials \nand museums that define Washington's Monumental Core express America's \nconnections to its past and its direction for the future. They help us \nunderstand what it means to be an American.''\n  As a proud American, I want to ensure that every individual who \nvisits Washington has a chance to learn the full history of who we are \nand who we are becoming as Americans.

Mr. President, today I stand in recognition of America's \npublic servants who provide the essential, often unseen services on \nwhich our great country thrives. As the ranking member of the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, I am honored to submit a resolution paying tribute to these \nemployees in celebration of Public Service Recognition Week. I am \ndelighted to be joined by the leadership of the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senators Voinovich, \nCollins, Lieberman, Coleman, Levin, Coburn, and Carper.\n  The 22nd anniversary of Public Service Recognition Week, which takes \nplace the week of May 1, 2006, showcases the talented individuals who \nserve their country as Federal, State and local government employees, \nboth civilian and military. From Hawaii to Maine, throughout the Nation \nand around the world, America's public employees use this week to \nshowcase the exciting challenges of a career in public service and \ndemonstrate how government workers create a brighter future for us all.\n  Public servants perform essential services that our nation relies on \nevery day. They care for our veterans, protect our public lands, ensure \nthe safety of our food and water, and deliver the mail and needed \nmedical supplies, in addition to countless additional tasks.\n  Over the past few years we have all been reminded of the remarkable \nwork of public servants, including our men and women in uniform. Their \nsteadfast devotion to the defense of this Nation and the ideals we hold \nmost dear is commendable. Nearly 2,600 military and Department of \nDefense civilian employees have lost their lives since the beginning of \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The sacrifice \nof these brave men and women remain a constant reminder of the courage \nwith which the members of our Armed Forces serve. Nor should we forget \nthose Federal civilian employees who work side-by-side with our troops \nabroad and provide needed support for their mission. Military and \ncivilian employees alike continue to earn our admiration with their \nunwavering strength and dedication.\n  The men and women who serve in the Coast Guard exemplify public \nservice as demonstrated by their tireless efforts to rescue the people \ntrapped in their homes by the flood waters from Hurricane Katrina.\n  Another example of the countless contributions public servants give \nto the Nation is Orlando Figueroa, the Deputy Associate Administrator \nfor Programs, Science Mission Directorate, at the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration, who led the Mars Exploration Rover Project. \nMr. Figueroa and his team created a mobile science lab used to conduct \nremote exploration on the surface of another planet, which allowed the \nexploration of regions beyond the original landing site. This fantastic \naccomplishment has produced a wealth of scientific discoveries \nrevealing Mars as a potential habitat. The work of Mr. Figueroa and \nother Federal scientists spark the imagination, fuel the human spirit, \nand inspire us to pursue even greater things.\n  President John F. Kennedy said, ``Let the public service be a proud \nand lively career.'' While Public Service\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\nRecognition week provides the opportunity to honor and celebrate the \nworks of our Federal employees, it also serves as a time to call upon a \nnew generation of Americans to explore the opportunities of such a \n``proud and lively career.'' Through job fairs, agency sponsored \nevents, and special exhibits, Public Service Recognition Week allows \nindividuals from all walks of life to gain a deeper appreciation of the \nchallenging, exciting, and rewarding work available in the federal \ngovernment.\n  I encourage my colleagues to bring to light the works and services of \nthe federal employees in their states and join in this annual \ncelebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2538-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 413--COMMENDING THE VIRGINIA WESLEYAN COLLEGE MARLINS \nMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2006 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n       ASSOCIATION DIVISION III NATIONAL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Testimony from State and local officials and community leaders \nsupporting the legislation included a statement from Ms. Kristine \nCastagnaro, Executive Director of the Hawai'i Council on Economic \nEducation, who said, ``residents of all ages deserve to possess the \nskills necessary to make wise choices for their lives and \ncommunities.'' Mr. Brent Dillabaugh, Public Policy Director of the \nHawai'i Alliance for Community Based Economic Development, said, \n``Fostering basic financial and economic literacy is one of the most \nimportant aspects in achieving self sufficiency. As credit options \nbecome increasingly sophisticated and difficult to understand it is \ncrucial that individuals have the capacity to make sound financial \ndecisions.'' I support such State-level efforts in Hawaii and similar \nefforts across the country highlighting the need for us to focus on \nthese important issues.\n  Education in personal finance and economics means empowerment, \nbecause it can provide people with the tools they need for sound \ndecisionmaking. Unfortunately, many individuals do not understand even \nthe basics of our complex economic system. Although much continues to \nbe done to provide more Americans with an education in personal finance \nand economics, a number of troubling indicators show that many people \nare ill-equipped to negotiate life's financial choices.\n  For instance, scores went up for the first time on the Jump$tart \nCoalition's 2004 test of the financial literacy of high school seniors, \nbut on average, students still failed the exam. States have responded \nso that now all recognize to some degree the need for economic or \npersonal finance in their curriculum. However, according to the \nNational Council on Economic Education, only 17 States require an \neconomics course be offered in their high schools and only 15 require \nan economics course as a graduation requirement. Moreover, only 8 \nStates require a course be offered with content in personal finance and \nonly 7 States require students to take such a course. This picture must \nimprove, as barriers to credit continue to decrease, and credit card \nholders become younger and younger. According to a recent national poll \nby Junior Achievement, 5 percent of teenagers 13-14 years of age \nreported having credit cards, and this percentage doubles to 10 percent \nfor those 17 years of age, and doubles again to nearly 20 percent for \nthose 18 and older. Early use of credit should be accompanied by early \neducation in money management and the basics of economics.\n  On the other end of the spectrum, a tenth of our Nation's families \nare without an account at a mainstream financial institution. The most \ncommon reason people give for not having a checking account is that \nthey do not write enough checks to make it worthwhile. Still, checking \naccounts are useful in a number of other ways and typically serve as \nthe first formal relationship one will have with a mainstream financial \ninstitution. Opening an account at a mainstream financial institution \nis a critical step in the path to homeownership and entrepreneurship \nand allows individuals to benefit from the relatively low fees, savings \ninstruments, and other wealth building opportunities offered by banks \nand credit unions.\n  Increased financial and economic literacy can help people navigate \naround the countless pitfalls found in the marketplace. Consumers with \na variety of credit histories can easily find credit in many different \nforms. Lenders' aggressive marketing campaigns encourage families to \ntake on substantial debt for indulgences and luxuries, which can be \nharmful if the families are already saddled with debt and are not \nsaving toward an education or retirement nest egg. Taking out these \nloans is irrational, but abusive marketing efforts have resulted in \nunprecedented levels of borrowing.\n  Thus, although the availability of credit has grown dramatically, \nfinancial literacy has not yet increased adequately in response. \nConsequently, we are presented with a number of troubling statistics. \nLast year's personal savings rate was negative for the first time since \n1933, at the end of the Great Depression. A negative savings rate means \nthat, on average, people are spending more money than they make. \nMoreover, the household debt service ratio, which gives a sense of the \nproportion of disposable income people are using to pay off their debt, \nincreased to record levels in 2005. These findings suggest a serious \nproblem exacerbated by the fact that most workers have not calculated \nhow much they need to save for retirement, even if they believe they \nare behind schedule in their retirement savings.\n  As policymakers, we need to focus on these issues year round. \nHowever, focusing on Financial Literacy Month in April means that we \nhave a designated part of the year when we can reassess our efforts to \nhighlight that worked and improve on those that have not. Once again, I \nthank my colleagues for their support of this resolution.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Akaka, in support of his resolution designating April as \nFinancial Literacy Month.\n  Financial literacy is an imperative for all Americans. From creating \na family budget, to managing credit, to saving for retirement--\nAmericans need to understand financial principles more than ever \nbefore. However, research shows that Americans lack a fundamental \nunderstanding of personal savings, financial planning, and budgeting. \nAccording to the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, \nover 60 percent of our high school students could not pass a quiz with \nbasic questions on savings and budgeting. In addition, an AARP survey \nfound that less than half of those over age 45 could identify and \ndefine basic financial terms such as ``diversification'' or ``compound \ninterest.''\n  Financial literacy is critical as more Americans take on more of the \nresponsibility for managing their retirement savings. Pension plans are \nshifting from defined benefit plans, which guaranteed a certain benefit \nlevel for a lifetime, to defined contribution plans, which are based on \nthe investment decisions of individual employees. Unfortunately, too \nmany individuals do not have the tools to plan for retirement in a \nmanner that will guarantee their long-term financial health. In fact, \nthe Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 60 percent of \ncurrent workers are actively saving for their retirement, and only 42 \npercent of workers and their significant others have calculated what \ntheir financial needs will be in retirement.\n  The lack of financial literacy has serious ramifications, not only \nfor individuals who fail to adequately budget and save, but for the \nnational economy as well. The personal saving rate has recently turned \nnegative, and personal saving is a component of national saving, which \ndrives economic growth.\n  These trends are certainly troubling. In recent years, the work of \nSenator Akaka and others have focused attention on the threat posed by \nour Nation's high financial illiteracy rate. For example, Senator \nAkaka's Excellence in Economic Education Act promotes financial \nliteracy in primary and secondary schools. Many groups have developed \ninnovative programs to reach children of all ages on this topic, and \nincreased access to formal economics classes has helped acquaint \nstudents with the financial services marketplace. In addition, public-\nprivate partnerships have helped adults increase their financial \nliteracy and gain a better understanding of long-term financial \nplanning tools.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will take another step to help \nincrease awareness about the need to improve our Nation's financial \nliteracy, and I am pleased to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2542-S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2467\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Alabama \nfor coming to the floor and addressing one of the most important bills \nwe will consider this year, the question of the immigration system in \nAmerica. My colleague and I may disagree--and we do disagree--on the \nsubstance of this bill, but I thank him for engaging the Senate in this \nconversation and dialogue. It is important that the American people \nknow what we are about, and they should also know that we are taking \nour time to do it right.\n  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with the Senator from \nAlabama. We spent a lot of time on this bill, as we should have. It is \na big challenge. I am not sure it is perfect. I think we can make it a \nbetter bill. But I am certainly pleased that the bill we brought to the \nfloor is a balanced approach.\n  The one thing I like about it is it starts in the same place as many \nof its detractors want us to start, and that is to make sure that we \nhave enforcement in this country. There should be laws; they should be \nenforced. That means we should do more, put more resources and more \neffort into making certain that our borders are not porous. It is a \nchallenge. During the course of any given year, I am told that 300 \nmillion people pass between the United States and Mexico. The vast \nmajority of them are doing it legally. But at the same time, there are \npeople crossing that border into the United States illegally. We need \nbetter border enforcement, smarter border enforcement, using the best \ntechnology available today. Some of the suggestions we have heard I \nthink are perhaps in answer to a problem of 100 years ago, but building \na wall around the United States is hardly going to stop the immigration \nproblem.\n  Over half the people currently in the United States undocumented did \nnot enter illegally across the border. They came here legally, and \nbecause their visas expired or there were other circumstances or \nchanges in the paperwork that they filed with our Government, they are \nnot presently documented or in legal status. So this concept of \nbuilding a fence or building a wall seems to me to be nothing more than \na symbol--perhaps an unfortunate symbol--for a country as great as \nAmerica.\n  Let me say a word or two about the bill that is going to be debated \non the Senate floor for several days, perhaps through next week. It is \na bill which addresses our immigration system in America. Most everyone \nagrees: This system needs to be changed. It is not fair. It is not a \nsystem that we are proud of because it doesn't deal with the serious \nissue of how many people are in the United States not in legal status--\nundocumented people.\n  One of the comments made several times during the course of the \ndebate by my colleague from Alabama was that the bill coming out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee creates amnesty. What is amnesty? Very \nsimply, if you have been charged and found guilty of a crime, an \namnesty says: We forgive you. We are not going to hold you responsible \nfor your crime. There are things that you can do to pay your price to \nsociety for the crime you have committed. If you pay that price, people \nsay: Well, that isn't amnesty. You have extracted some cost for the \ncrime that has been committed.\n  Let me remind my colleague from Alabama what this bill does that \ncomes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe editorial from today's New York Times of March 29, 2006, entitled, \n``It Isn't Amnesty.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            It Isn't Amnesty\n\n       Here's one way to kill a cow: take it into the woods in \n     hunting season, paint the word ``deer'' on it and stand back.\n       Something like that is happening in the immigration debate \n     in Washington. Attackers of a smart, tough Senate bill have \n     smeared it with the most mealy-mouthed word in the \n     immigration glossary--amnesty--in hopes of rendering it \n     politically toxic. They claim that the bill would bestow an \n     official federal blessing of forgiveness on an estimated 12 \n     million people who are living here illegally, rewarding their \n     brazen crimes and encouraging more of the same.\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\n       That isn't true. The bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee in a 12-to-6 vote on Monday, is one the country \n     should be proud of. Four Republicans, including the \n     committee's chairman, Arlen Specter, joined eight Democrats \n     in endorsing a balanced approach to immigration reform. The \n     bill does not ignore security and border enforcement. It \n     would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, add \n     resources for detaining illegal immigrants and deporting them \n     more quickly, and expand state and local enforcement of \n     immigration laws. It would create a system to verify workers' \n     identities and impose tougher punishments on employers who \n     defied it.\n       But unlike the bill's counterpart in the House, which makes \n     a virtue out of being tough but not smart, the Specter bill \n     would also take on the hard job of trying to sort out the \n     immigrants who want to stay and follow the rules from those \n     who don't. It would force them not into buses or jails but \n     into line, where they could become lawful residents and--if \n     they showed they deserved it--citizens. Instead of living off \n     the books, they'd come into the system.\n       The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill \n     wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record, a \n     steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine and back taxes, and \n     knowledge of English and civics. That's not ``amnesty,'' with \n     its suggestion of getting something for nothing. But the \n     false label has muddied the issue, playing to people's fear \n     and indignation, and stoking the opportunism of Bill Frist, \n     the Senate majority leader. Mr. Frist has his enforcement-\n     heavy bill in the wings, threatening to make a disgraceful \n     end run around the committee's work.\n       The alternatives to the Specter bill are senseless. The \n     enforcement-only approach--building a 700-mile wall and \n     engaging in a campaign of mass deportation and harassment to \n     rip 12 million people from the national fabric--would be an \n     impossible waste of time and resources. It would destroy \n     families and weaken the economy. An alternative favored by \n     many businesses--creating a temporary-worker underclass that \n     would do our dirtiest jobs and then have to go home, with no \n     new path to citizenship--is a recipe for indentured \n     servitude.\n       It is a weak country that feels it cannot secure its \n     borders and impose law and order on an unauthorized \n     population at the same time. And it is a foolish, insecure \n     country that does not seek to channel the energy of an \n     industrious, self-motivated population to its own ends, but \n     tries instead to wall out ``those people.''\n       It's time for President Bush, who talks a good game on \n     immigration, to use every means to clarify the issue and to \n     lead this country out of the ``amnesty'' semantic trap. He \n     dislikes amnesty. Mr. Frist dislikes amnesty. We dislike \n     amnesty, too.\n       The Specter bill isn't amnesty. It's a victory for \n     thoughtfulness and reason.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me quote from this:\n\n       The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill--\n\nwhich is the bill that will come before us soon--\n\n     wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record--\n\nno criminal record--\n\n     a steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine, payment of all back \n     taxes, and knowledge of English and civics.\n\n  Those are the things a person has to go through to reach the point \nwhere they are considered open for the possibility of legalization. So \nit isn't as if we have wiped away the fact that some people are here \nillegally; we are making it clear that if they want to become legal in \nthe eyes of the United States, there is a cost to it. It is a cost in \ncommitment, and it is a long one.\n  So I think The New York Times has it right, and I think my colleague \ndid not have it right. This is not an amnesty. I don't support an \namnesty. There are some who do, but no Members of the Senate that I \nknow of are suggesting an amnesty. Instead, we have set up a process. \nFirst, enforce the laws at the border and through employers. Second, \nsay to those people who are here: If you are prepared to go through a \nlengthy, involved, and demanding process, we will give you a chance to \nbe part of America. I think that is the only sensible way to approach \nthis. If we don't start with that possibility, that a person here who \nwants to call America home permanently can reach that goal legally, \nwhat will bring that person out of the shadows? If a year from now or 2 \nyears from now there are still millions of Americans whom we don't know \nby name, by address or by occupation, we will not have addressed the \nproblems with immigration, and America will not be as secure as it \nshould be.\n  The process we are putting together will bring these people out of \nthe shadows, into a process where they are disclosed, known to the \nGovernment and all others, if they are to stay in the United States. I \nthink that is the only way to approach this sensibly.\n  There is another part of the bill which my colleague from Alabama \naddressed which is near and dear to me personally. It is a piece of \nlegislation which I introduced several years ago with Senator Hatch of \nUtah, reintroduced recently with Senator Hagel of Nebraska, a \nbipartisan bill known as the DREAM Act. This part of the bill addresses \nthose who are minors, who were in the United States undocumented.\n  There is one thing we all should agree on: Adults who enter our \ncountry illegally are responsible for their actions. They should be \nheld accountable. That is what the bill does. But undocumented children \nare different, and I think they should be treated differently. Unlike \nundocumented adults, children brought here by their parents are too \nyoung to understand the consequences of their actions. We are not a \ncountry that punishes children for the mistakes of their parents.\n  Listen to what the Supreme Court said in Plyler v. Doe, and I quote:\n\n       Those who elect to enter our territory by stealth and in \n     violation of our law should be prepared to bear the \n     consequences, including, but not limited to, deportation. But \n     the children of those illegal entrants are not comparably \n     situated. They can affect neither their parents' conduct nor \n     their own status.\n\n  Now, unlike many undocumented adults and all foreign student visa \nholders, these young people have lived in this country for most of \ntheir lives. It is the only home they know. They have assimilated into \nAmerican culture. They have been acculturated into American society. \nThey are American in virtually every sense of the word except their \ntechnical legal status. Think about it. A child brought into the United \nStates by parents at an early age of 1 or 2, in the United States for \n16, 17 or 18 years, still has not reached legal status by virtue of \nliving here, by going to school here, by participating in America. They \nare still undocumented. If we give foreigners on student visas--those \nwho come to go to school in the United States--a chance to obtain legal \nstatus after only a short time in this country, surely we should extend \nthe same opportunity to young people who have grown up here and show a \npromise to contribute to America.\n  Under title VI of the chairman's mark which we considered in the \ncommittee, an undocumented individual could have qualified for gold \ncard status if they were working in January of 2004, but a person who \nwasn't working on that date because they were too young or in school \nwouldn't qualify, no matter how long they lived here. We addressed \nthat. The chairman's mark was not adopted by the committee. A different \napproach was addressed. And the committee adopted the provision I am \ntalking about today, the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act would address the situation of many young people. It \nwould permit undocumented students to become permanent residents if \nthey came here as children, if they are long-term U.S. residents, if \nthey have good moral character, and attend college or enlist in our \nmilitary for at least 2 years.\n  During the 108th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee marked up \nthis DREAM Act, and it was voted out by a vote of 16 to 3, a strong \nbipartisan vote. Compromises and changes were made.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senator from Alabama, when he spoke about \nthe DREAM Act earlier, did not make reference to the current version of \nthe law. There were three things in particular that he said that were \nnot accurate, which I would like to clarify for the Record.\n  First, the path for a young person to become an American citizen \ninvolves education or military service. It does not include community \nservice, which the Senator mentioned earlier.\n  Second, those students who go on to college, if they are allowed to \nby the States where they reside, and receive in-State tuition, that is \nstrictly a State decision. They would not be eligible for Pell grants, \nthe grants of Federal funds to college students. We eliminated that.\n  The Senator from Alabama referred to Pell grants earlier, but that \nprovision was eliminated from the DREAM Act.\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\n  Finally, the number of students who are likely to benefit from this \nand be involved with our colleges is dramatically less than the number \nquoted by the Senator from Alabama. He said it is likely--I quote from \nhis statement on the floor:\n\n       Sixty-five thousand students would enroll during the first \n     year.\n\n  We have a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office. Their \nestimate is that about 13,000 students might enroll during the next \nacademic year. And they go on to say it is unlikely because they are \nprobably going to be community college students, that they would be \nreceiving substantial amounts of Federal assistance as students.\n  So those three points made earlier by the Senator from Alabama were \nnot accurate. They do not describe the current law as passed by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I think the best way to describe what this \nis about is to tell you some of the stories of actual young people who \nhave been affected by this.\n  A young lady named Theresa was raised in Illinois. She is an amazing \nyoung lady. She came to the United States when she was 2 years old. Her \nparents brought her here from Korea. Her mother is the family's only \nbread winner, and she works at a dry cleaners in Chicago.\n  If you know that great City of Chicago, which I am honored to \nrepresent, 85 percent of the dry cleaning establishments are owned by \nKorean Americans. They are wonderful, hard-working people. They are \nthere from the crack of dawn until late at night, 6 and 7 days a week.\n  Her mother is one of those people. She raised Theresa, and realized \nat an early age that Theresa was an extraordinary young girl. She had \nmusical talents that none would have imagined. She began playing the \npiano when she was 8 years old. She became a musical prodigy, winning \nthe Chicago Symphony Orchestra Youth audition. The top music schools in \nthe United States recruited Theresa. They wanted her as a student.\n  She only learned when she applied to the schools that she had a \nproblem, and the problem is this: When her mother brought her to this \ncountry her mother never filed any papers. So Theresa is an \nundocumented person in America. She is here illegally. Now, at the age \nof 18, after having lived here all of her life since she was 2, she \ndiscovers it, and she calls my office--her mother did--and said: What \ncan be done?\n  She started filling out the application for the Juilliard School of \nMusic, and they put a question in there on citizenship. She said: I do \nnot know what to put down. We had better call.\n  They called my office. We asked the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. They said she is undocumented. She is here illegally. I said: \nWhat can be done? We want to get this young girl on the right track to \nbecome an accomplished musician. We know she will be.\n  They said: There is one thing she can do. She can go back to Korea.\n  Go back to Korea after 16 years? That was the only alternative \navailable to her.\n  Luckily, she has gone on to school without financial assistance, \nincurring a lot of debt in the process. She is in this gray shadow \nworld of people who are undocumented living in the United States--a \nyoung woman who will undoubtedly be a great contribution to America's \nculture at some point in her life. She still does not know what her \nfuture holds. She is not the only one.\n  One of her music teachers told me about her. She said: I worry that \nour country, the richest and most blessed in the world, will not permit \nthis very large talent to be developed. We are not such a rich land \nthat can throw away the talents of our children.\n  Theresa is among the lucky ones who went off to college at great \nfinancial sacrifice. But she is one of the people I am talking about. \nTheresa is not alone. There are thousands like her. They turn out to be \nhonor roll students, star athletes, talented artists, valedictorians, \naspiring teachers, doctors, scientists, and engineers. They follow the \nrules and work hard in school. And they beat the odds.\n  Fifty percent of the Hispanic students in high school in America \ntoday drop out. They do not finish high school. They and others who are \nfrom other countries have to struggle with culture and language, and \nmany of them give up. But the ones who don't give up are exceptional \npeople.\n  Let me tell you about another one, Dianna, whom I met, a very bright \nyoung lady. She went to high school in Chicago and aspired to become an \narchitect. That was her dream. She entered contests, was an honor \nstudent in high school, won competitions statewide in Illinois to move \non toward architecture. She graduated from high school with a 4.4 out \nof 4.0, applied, and was accepted at Northwestern University to become \nan architect, a dream come true.\n  Then it was discovered that she was undocumented, the papers had not \nbeen filed. She had been here all her life but still was not a legal \nAmerican, living in the United States. She couldn't get financial \nassistance to go to that great university and instead had to go to \nanother school where she is pursuing her education at great expense but \nworries that the day will come when she wants to be licensed as an \narchitect and she cannot be because she does not have legal status. She \nis not documented.\n  Those two young women I just talked about are classic examples of why \nthe DREAM Act is important.\n  Would America be a better place if those two girls left, if we didn't \nhave the architectural skills of Dianna or the musical skills of \nTheresa or the other student who came up to me in the streets of \nChicago and said: Senator, I finished high school and then I went to \ncollege and paid for it all on my own because I can't get any financial \nhelp. I want to be a teacher. I want to teach in the schools of \nChicago, the public school system. I can't be licensed as a teacher \nbecause I am undocumented.\n\n  Would we be better off if that young man who came up to me left \nAmerica? I don't think so.\n  In many respects, these young people, like our own children, are our \nfuture. They are our hopes. What we do with the DREAM Act is say we are \ngoing to take this group of students and give them a chance. Here are \nthe conditions: They have 6 years under the DREAM Act. A student could \nobtain conditional legal residency for 6 years if the student has been \ncontinuously present in the United States for at least 5 years prior to \nthe enactment of this law, was under 16 years of age when he entered \nthe United States, has graduated from high school or obtained a GED in \nthe United States or has been admitted to an institution of higher \neducation in the United States, can demonstrate good moral character, \nis not inadmissible or deportable under specifically enumerated \ngrounds.\n  The student could obtain legal permanent residency if within the 6-\nyear conditional period he earns a degree from an institution of higher \neducation or completes at least 2 years towards a bachelor's degree or \nserves honorably in the U.S. military for at least 2 years.\n  That is not amnesty. We say to that young person: We don't know the \ncircumstances that brought you here. But if you have done a good job as \na student, if you were prepared to continue your education to \ncontribute to America, if you are prepared to serve America in our U.S. \nmilitary and risk your life for this country, we will give you a chance \nto be a citizen. You have to earn it. It is not free. It is not \namnesty. It is not unconditional. We put these provisions in the law.\n  I think that is a reasonable thing to do. I think otherwise we are \ngoing to waste talent, talent that America needs among the thousands of \nstudents who may be helped by the DREAM Act. They may be a doctor who \nwill treat your child in the future. They may be a researcher who will \nhelp advance the cures in medical treatment. They may be an engineer \nwho will help us find new composite metals that we use for a space \nprogram. The possibilities are limitless because opportunity is \nlimitless in America.\n  Why would we want to walk away from these kids? Why would we want to \nturn our backs on them?\n  Finally, I say to States across America that you decide how to treat \nthese students. Many States like my own have already decided, but you \ndecide whether these undocumented students will be eligible for instate \ntuition or out-of-State, which is more expensive. But each State makes \nthe decision. That is a change in the Federal law, but it is a change \nthat States can make without a Federal penalty.\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\n  I received a letter of support for the DREAM Act from a group of \nAmericans who lost loved ones in the September 11 terrorist attacks. \nHere is what they wrote me:\n\n       We will all be safer if we unite against terrorists, and if \n     our immigration system can be made more rational and \n     reflective of our values as a Nation.\n\n  President Bush said the other day some words that I think are worthy \nof repeating on the floor of the Senate. He said:\n\n       It is true that we are a Nation of laws, but we are also a \n     welcoming Nation. We are a Nation of immigrants.\n\n  I stand before this body, as I have said many times, so proud of the \nfact that my grandmother and grandfather had the courage to pick up and \nleave a tiny little village in Lithuania in 1911. My grandmother picked \nup my mom, a 2-year-old infant, and brought her and my aunt and uncles \non a boat from Germany to Baltimore, MD, where they caught a train and \nwent to St. Louis, MO, and then crossed the river into East St. Louis, \nthe town where I was born.\n  My grandfather worked in the steel mills, packinghouses, and the \nstockyards--did things that all immigrants did, the hardest, toughest, \ndirtiest jobs. He kept the family together.\n  My mother made it to the eighth grade and then went to work, as young \nwomen did in her era, and then was married to my dad and applied and \nbecame a naturalized citizen.\n  I have her naturalization certificate in my office today. I am very \nproud of it. Today, her son is the 47th Senator in history from the \nState of Illinois. It is an American story, our family story. And it is \na story repeated over and over again.\n  Some of the children who will be helped here, some of the young \npeople who will be helped here, will make extraordinary contributions \nto our country. I can't even predict what they will be. But would we be \na better nation, a stronger nation by turning them away, telling them \nto go back to Korea and Mexico and Ireland and Poland and all the \nplaces they have come from? I don't think so.\n  I think the letter from the families of the September 11 victims says \nit all. We need to have an immigration system that reflects our values \nas a nation. We shouldn't deport extraordinary people like the ones I \nhave described. They will make America a better place. We should extend \na welcoming hand and an opportunity for them to earn their way into \nlegalization in America. That is what the DREAM Act will do.\n  I urge my colleagues, when they consider this bill as it comes to the \nfloor, to support this legislation and the DREAM Act provisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/29/senate-section/article/S2546-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
