REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last Saturday, in the wake of one terrible \nloss, our Nation suffered another loss, a quiet loss but one that was \nalso deeply felt across the land. We learned that William H. Rehnquist, \nthe 16th Chief Justice of the United States, had passed away. Karen and \nI and the entire Senate family extend our deepest sympathies to his \nfamily and to his friends. Our Nation mourns the loss of a great \nleader.\n  William Rehnquist was an American hero--a World War II veteran, a \nlifelong public servant, a brilliant legal mind, and a jurist of \nhistoric consequence. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. This \nwas especially true in his final months as he stoically fought the \ncancer that would eventually claim his life.\n  Since October 2004, when the Chief Justice announced he had thyroid \ncancer, his chin remained up and his mind focused and devoted. Today, \nthat optimism, that determination, that strength of spirit in purpose \nremain an encouragement to us all.\n  I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to get to know William \nRehnquist during my tenure in the Senate. I am honored to call him a \nfriend. But even more, perhaps the most one can say of any leader, I \nsimply feel blessed to have lived in his time and in the country that \nso benefited from his wisdom.\n  William Rehnquist was born on October 1, 1924, in Milwaukee, WI. The \nson of William Benjamin Rehnquist, a\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\npaper salesman, and Margery Peck Rehnquist, a multilingual translator, \nhe spent his childhood in the Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood, WI, where \nhe attended public schools. Even as a young student, William Rehnquist \nexpressed interest in public service, telling others he wanted to \n``change the government.'' Well, he did exactly that.\n  William Rehnquist grew up in an era marked by grave challenges and \nextraordinary triumphs. He saw our Nation rise from the depths of the \nGreat Depression to defeat the threat of Nazi Germany and Imperial \nJapan.\n  On December 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was bombed, William Rehnquist \nwas 17 years old. Shortly thereafter, he signed up to fight, joining \nthe Army Air Corps, serving at home and abroad from 1943 to 1946.\n  After the Armed Forces, with the help of the GI bill, William \nRehnquist went on to college. At Stanford, he earned a bachelor's and \nmaster's degree in political science and graduated Phi Beta Kappa. But \nhis academic journey was far from over.\n  He took a brief hiatus from Stanford, heading east to Harvard for a \nsecond master's degree, this time in government. In 1950, he returned \nto Stanford ready for law school and the defining point in his life. \nFrom Stanford, William Rehnquist would graduate first in his class that \nincluded none other than his future colleague on the high Court, Sandra \nDay O'Connor.\n  As a law student, he was known for his astute ability to defend \nconservatism and for his bright legal mind. One of his professors \ndescribed William Rehnquist as ``the outstanding student of his law \nschool generation.'' This same professor would later introduce him to \nSupreme Court Justice Robert Jackson. In a private interview, William \nRehnquist convinced Justice Jackson to award him with a coveted \nclerkship with the Supreme Court, despite Rehnquist's initial thoughts \nthat he had been ``written [off] as a total loss'' by Justice Jackson.\n  After completing his clerkship, he married Natalie Cornell. The \ncoupled settled in Phoenix, where they raised three children--James, \nJanet, and Nancy--and where Justice Rehnquist would practice law for 16 \nyears.\n  As a young lawyer, William Rehnquist was known to wear loud shirts \nand ties, prompting even President Nixon to refer to him as ``the guy \ndressed like a clown.'' But clearly, Nixon was impressed by what he saw \non the inside of the young lawyer from Phoenix. President Nixon \nselected Rehnquist to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel.\n  In 1971, President Nixon nominated William Rehnquist again, this time \nto replace Justice John Marshall Harlan as an Associate Justice on the \nSupreme Court. William Rehnquist was overwhelmingly confirmed by a \nDemocratic Senate by a vote of 68 yeas and 26 nays.\n  In 1986, President Regan nominated Justice Rehnquist as Chief \nJustice, and the Senate, by a wide margin once again, confirmed him to \nserve as the 16th Chief Justice of the highest Court in the land. \nToday, I echo what my good friend and former colleague Senator Bob Dole \nsaid of the Chief Justice during that confirmation debate now two \ndecades ago. He was a man of ``unquestioned integrity, \nincorruptibility, fairness, and courage.''\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I had the privilege of getting to \nknow the Chief Justice, or ``the Chief'' as the law clerks called him. \nAnd since our first introduction, I found William Rehnquist to be \nthoughtful, intelligent, and, I must say, quite humorous.\n\n  A skilled writer and avid historian, Chief Justice Rehnquist is the \nauthor of a number of books on Supreme Court history and the American \nlegal system. Many articles have been written about William Rehnquist \nand his successes as Chief Justice of the United States, and in almost \nevery one of these articles, he is praised for his superb ability to \nefficiently manage the Court.\n  Speaking to this point, Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White once \nsaid:\n\n       I have never ceased to marvel how one person could possibly \n     carry out all of the tasks given the Chief Justice and yet \n     also decide cases and write opinions as the rest of us do. \n     Yet Chief Justices do them with regularity and, of the three \n     Chief Justices with whom I have served, the man who now sits \n     in the center chair in the courtroom . . . seems to me to be \n     the least stressed by his responsibilities and to be the most \n     efficient manager of his complicated schedule.\n\n  A former adviser to the Chief Justice said that Justice White's \ncomments mirrored his own observations. He said that William \nRehnquist's rigorous work ethic and dedication to efficiency is \nreflected on his staff, which he, in fact, reduced when he became Chief \nJustice, relying on only three clerks, although he was authorized to \nhave four.\n  The former adviser described William Rehnquist as a man who could do \ntwice the work of the average judge in half the time. Having worked \nalongside William Rehnquist on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, I \ncouldn't agree more. I treasure the days we spent together on this \nBoard of Regents. In his capacity as the chancellor of the Smithsonian, \nhe served as chairman of the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. I, in that \ncapacity, saw firsthand the Chief Justice's commitment to that \ninstitution, the Smithsonian, attending every meeting despite his very \nbusy day job at the Court. He even hosted planning meetings for board \nstaff and liaisons of the Supreme Court in the Natalie Cornell \nRehnquist Dining Room, named after his late wife of 38 years. Recently, \nhe brought the entire Court to the Smithsonian's American History \nMuseum to see the Brown v. Board of Education exhibit.\n  As he did on the Court, since the Chief Justice became chancellor, he \nemphasized the importance of efficient management in the Smithsonian's \naffairs, and he brought a certain sense of distinction to our work for \nthe Smithsonian. Moreover, he inspired me to always be mindful of our \nduty to history, our place in preserving the strength of this Nation we \nserve.\n  In recent months, while the ongoing debate in the Senate regarding \njudicial nominations was occurring, I thought a lot about our Federal \ncourts and our judges. I have often wondered what are the most \nimportant qualities to look for in an individual who is being \nconsidered for a lifetime appointment on the courts. I have looked to \nthe Chief, and I have seen those qualities embodied in his approach to \nthe law--commitment to judicial restraint, fairness, integrity, \nimpartiality, even temperament, openmindedness, and respect for the \nConstitution and the rule of law.\n  What is more, William Rehnquist was a man not only of high intellect \nbut common sense--a unique combination reflected in the clarity of his \nopinions.\n  I witnessed firsthand William Rehnquist's intelligence, his \ntemperament, and his commitment to equal justice under the law when he \nbecame only the second Chief Justice to preside over Presidential \nimpeachment in the trial of President Bill Clinton.\n  A friend of mine and a former administrative assistant to the Chief \nJustice said:\n\n       What impressed me most about the manner in which he \n     presided over the impeachment trial was his astute and facile \n     recognition of and respect for the traditions and rules of \n     the Senate. I knew he would provide impartial leadership but \n     he also adjusted his superb management skills appropriately \n     to the Senate's traditions. At the conclusion of the trial he \n     was praised by the Leaders of both parties. It was another \n     demonstration of the rare combination of high intellect and \n     common sense that he possesses.\n\n  To this day, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle continue to \nremember the Chief Justice for his efficient managerial skills and his \nsteadfast respect for the Senate during the impeachment trial. In an \natmosphere of partisanship, the Chief Justice was a constant reminder \nof the solemn legal duties our Constitution requires of the Senate.\n  The Chief loved the Court. He held a deep respect for the law and its \ntraditions, and in turn his colleagues, even those with different \njudicial philosophies, held a deep respect for him.\n  A former colleague who often decided cases differently than the Chief \nJustice, Justice Harry Blackmun, praised William Rehnquist as a \n``splendid administrator'' and often testified to his fairness and \ncommitment to the coherence and cohesion of the Court.\n  Once the Court's leading liberal, Justice William Brennan called \nChief Justice Rehnquist ``the most all-around successful'' Chief that \nhe had known and described him as ``meticulously fair.''\n  Another liberal on the Court, Justice Thurgood Marshall, described \nhim as ``a great Chief Justice.''\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\n  In his 19 years as Chief Justice of the highest Court in the land, \nChief Justice Rehnquist never placed himself on a higher plane than his \ncolleagues. To fellow Justices, his law clerks and secretaries, he was \nsensitive, humble, and ever respectful.\n  I am confident that the President's nominee to the Chief Justice's \nseat, Judge John Roberts, will bring the same dignity to the job and \nearn the same level of respect from his colleagues. Judge Roberts, \nafter all, learned from the best. From 1980 to 1981, he was clerk to \nthen Associate Justice Rehnquist.\n  Having come to know John Roberts these last few weeks, there is no \ndoubt in my mind that he has the skill, the mind, the philosophy, and \nthe temperament to lead the Supreme Court.\n  With his passing over the weekend, the Supreme Court loses one of the \nmost prolific scholars and brilliant legal minds ever to sit on the \nFederal bench. His passing marks a sad day for America, but it is also \na day to reflect on our great fortune to have had William Rehnquist in \nthe service of our Nation.\n  For over 33 years, Chief Justice Rehnquist generously offered America \nhis brilliant mind, his unwavering leadership, and his fair and \nimpartial judgment. He was the embodiment of all of the ideal qualities \nof a judge, and his humility, wisdom, and superb managerial skills \nallowed him to become one of the most memorable, influential, and well-\nrespected Supreme Court Justices in our history.\n  Many feel that history will remember the Chief for presiding over the \nSenate during impeachment trials, for his participation in landmark \ndecisions, for his perseverance in fulfilling his duties through ailing \nhealth. I believe William Rehnquist will be most remembered for his \nmagnificent leadership and management, his ability to build consensus, \nhis compassion and respect for others, and his fair and impartial \nreview of each and every case that came before the Court. The imprint \nof William Rehnquist's gavel will not fade fast. No, it is indelibly \nstamped upon the face of American history and the legacy of the law we \nuphold. America was blessed to have William Rehnquist as Chief Justice \nand today he enters the history books as one of the greatest Chief \nJustices ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  May God bless William Rehnquist and may God bless the United States \nof America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9695-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was a high school student in a place \ncalled Basic High School in Henderson, NV. I was a boy about 16 years \nold, and Mrs. Robinson came into the classroom. She was a part-time \ncounselor and a full-time government teacher. She pulled me out of the \nclass and she said, I have looked at all of your reports and you should \ngo to law school.\n  I had never met a lawyer, had never even seen a courthouse, let alone \nbeen in one, but I accepted Mrs. Robinson's word that I should go to \nlaw school. From that day forward, that is what I set my mind to do. I \ncame back here to go to law school. I was a full-time student at George \nWashington University, went to school in the daytime and worked as a \nCapitol policeman in the nighttime.\n  Still having never been in a courthouse, as a law student in an \nappellate practice course I was taking, the students were invited to go \ninto the Supreme Court to listen to a Supreme Court argument. I can \nremember going there. The case the professor chose was not one that \nsounds very exciting. It certainly did not sound very exciting to me at \nthe time. It did not involve some spectacular criminal case. It \ninvolved a case called Baker v. Carr. The first time I was ever in a \ncourthouse I listened to one of the most important, significant Supreme \nCourt arguments in the history of the country because those lawyers \ndebating this case, these issues of law, were there to talk about the \none man-one vote doctrine, which the U.S. Supreme Court a few months \nlater, after having heard these arguments, decided that we in the \nUnited States would be bound by one man, one vote.\n  As a result of that, reapportionment took place in State legislatures \nand, of course, in the United States through the Federal courts. In the \nStates where the legislature did not follow the one man-one vote rule, \nthe courts took over.\n  As I look back, I was so fortunate to be able to have my first \nexposure to the law in the place where I later became a member of the \nSupreme Court bar. Having heard that case is something I will always \nremember.\n  I was a trial lawyer, and I have argued cases before the Nevada \nSupreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, but I never argued a case before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. I wish I had had that opportunity.\n  Having heard Baker v. Carr those many years ago, I have never \nforgotten it. That is why it has been so pleasant for me to develop a \npersonal relationship with some of the Supreme Court Justices, one of \nwhom was the man whose funeral I will go to today at 2, William \nRehnquist.\n  I said earlier and I will say again, I had a tour of duty as chairman \nof the Democratic Policy Committee and every Thursday there is an off-\nthe-record discussion that takes place in the Senate with Democratic \nSenators, and we always try to come up with things that will interest \nthe Senators. I said to a number of my colleagues I wanted to invite \nWilliam Rehnquist to come to the Democratic Policy luncheon and they \nsaid, no, he is a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, he is partisan, and he \nwill not come anyway.\n  I picked up the telephone and in a matter of a minute or two he was \non the line. I said, Mr. Justice, would you come to this policy \nluncheon? You will talk for 5 or 10 minutes, and we will ask questions.\n  Yes, I would like to do that.\n  He came over to the LBJ Room, one of the best luncheons we ever had. \nHe answered all the questions. As I reflect on Justice Rehnquist coming \nto that Democratic Policy luncheon, the thing I remember more than \nanything else is how funny he was. He was a man physically large in \nstature with a biting sense of humor.\n  I felt so comfortable having him preside over the impeachment trial. \nThat was also kind of an awkward time for me. I had just been selected \nas the assistant Democratic leader. I had this seat right here. I had \nnever sat so close to what was going on before and I felt so \nuncomfortable sitting here. My first tour of duty in the Senate in that \nseat was as a Senator as part of the impeachment trial of President \nClinton.\n  Of course, I visited with him, talked to him when he kept getting up. \nHe had a bad back and he suffered a lot from physical pain for many \nyears as a result of his back. He would get up every 20 minutes or so \nand stand and walk around his chair. I had a number of very nice, warm \nconversations with him at that time.\n  The conversation I will remember beyond all other conversations with \nthe Chief Justice, there was so much speculation in the newspapers \nabout he was sick and he was going to step down and would it be this \nMonday or the next Monday or when was it going to be. So in that I felt \ncomfortable and had spoken to him on the telephone a number of \noccasions, I called him at his home and I said, I am sorry to bother \nyou at home. He was not well. I said, the simple reason I have called \nyou is to say, do not resign.\n  He said, I am not going to.\n  I am not going to talk about all that was said during the call, but I \nwould say he told me he was not going to resign. I will always remember \nthat telephone conversation with the Chief Justice of the United \nStates. I am confident I did the right thing in calling him. I did not \ntell any of my colleagues. I did not tell my family. I did not tell \nanybody, but I picked up the telephone and I called him, and I am glad \nI did.\n  So I join with the distinguished majority leader in spreading on the \nrecord of this Senate the accolades for this good man. He was very \npolitically conservative, so I understand. He served as a lawyer for 16 \nyears after he graduated first in his class at Stanford Law School and \nI have a great amount of affection for that law school. One of my\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\nboys went to Stanford. It was a wonderful place to go to school. He \nserved in the Army Air Corps. He was Phi Beta Kappa. That was not \nenough education for him. He got a second master's degree at Stanford \nafter having gotten a master's degree at Stanford.\n\n  I am sorry that he is not going to be on the Court any more because I \nthought he was an outstanding administrator. He spoke for the Federal \njudges with strength and clarity. When we kept piling stuff on Federal \njudges to give them jurisdiction and do things, he complained about it. \nHe said they work too hard, they have too much to do. So we are going \nto miss his voice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9696-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9696-S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HURRICANE KATRINA AND SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina was a tremendous hit to \nus. When I say ``us,'' I mean the American people. We recognize this \nadministration needs to have a review of what took place. Certainly \nthey have to acknowledge that, but I think it is the wrong thing for \nthe President to be investigating himself. That is basically what he \nsaid he was going to do yesterday. Baseball games do not work out very \nwell when you have the man throwing the pitches calling the balls and \nstrikes.\n  I heard the House is going to start meeting today on actually passing \nlegislative matters that are so important to being able to give relief \nto these people, but outside the $10.5 billion we did on an emergency \nbasis last Thursday, we have not done anything here legislatively to \nhelp the people who are so devastated. It is time we get to work for \nthe gulf coast families.\n  What does it mean to have lost everything? That is what has happened \nto tens of thousands of people. They have lost everything. They are at \nthe National Guard Armory sleeping on cots. There are hundreds of them \ncoming from Nevada. The Senator from Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln, \nindicated yesterday there are about 60,000 evacuees who have come to \nArkansas with no jobs, no money, no change of clothes--nothing. They \nare counting on us, and we in the Senate are not doing anything.\n\n  We all care about these victims. This is not a question of who cares \nthe most. But I have to say, and I raise a flag of concern, tomorrow \nmorning we are going to the Commerce, Science, and Justice \nappropriations bill. Under the rules of the Senate, you are really \nrestricted as to what you can do on an appropriations bill. This \nappropriations bill is no different. We can do a few little things to \nhelp the victims but almost nothing: SBA loans and maybe a few things \nfor law enforcement, but there is nothing that gets the victims the \nhealth care, the housing, the education, or the financial relief they \nneed now. We need to adjust our priorities on the floor of the Senate.\n  If we go to another appropriations bill, the same problems are here. \nWe cannot get to the things that we need to get to, to help these \npeople who are so desperately in need of help. I personally think we \nshould finish the Defense authorization bill. That is what should be \ncalled up. Call up the Defense authorization bill. I spoke to the \nmajority leader last week about this and indicated I would talk to \nSenator Levin about how much time he thought it would take. I reported \nmy findings to Senator Frist. We have to get to the Defense \nauthorization bill. We spent some time on it; a few days, as you will \nremember. Nothing happened, to speak of. The bill was pulled.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of people who will be affected by the \nDefense authorization bill, not only those on the ground as soldiers \nand marines and airmen and some naval personnel who will be helped, who \nare on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have to do it for that \nreason, but we also have to do it for the hundreds of thousands of \nveterans who are affected by what we do with the Defense authorization \nbill, or do not do, and right now we are doing nothing. If we brought \nup the Defense authorization bill, we could do the things that need to \nbe done to help the victims of Katrina.\n  What, obviously, is the game plan around here is we will wait on the \nDefense authorization bill until we are way down the road. Then people \nwill say you are spending too much time on this and you are bringing up \nmatters that are not in keeping with the defense of this country. I \nthink the defense of this country is right now. What we have seen \nhappening in the gulf indicates that we need our soldiers and marines, \nour military personnel. There are about 60,000 of them down there right \nnow, in those three Gulf States--60,000. The Defense bill is important. \nLet's bring it up.\n  If we brought up that bill, there are some things we could do. We \ncould, for example, introduce legislation to reestablish FEMA at the \nCabinet level so it is no longer the toothless tiger it has become. We \ncould introduce legislation to establish an independent commission to \nstudy what went wrong with Katrina. It is going to happen. There will \nbe an independent commission to study Katrina just like there was an \nindependent commission to study 9/11. The administration fought that \nand fought that, but it came to be and it was good. Congressman \nHamilton and Governor Kean did a wonderful job for the people of \nAmerica and the world with the work they did. We need a similar \nbipartisan commission to find out what took place after the storm hit.\n  There is legislation in which some are interested--including, it is \nmy understanding, Congressional Representatives from Louisiana, and I \nknow I have spoken to Senator Kennedy about this--to have an \nindependent authority for how we are going to spend maybe as much as \n$200 billion, $150 billion, to do what needs to be done as a result of \nthat catastrophe, an independent commission like the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, as an example, so that money is spent in the right way.\n  What about gas prices? Do we need to take a look at that? Do we need \nlegislation to take a look at that? Of course we do. Of course we do. \nIn one quarter, the last quarter, ExxonMobil's profits were up to $8 \nbillion, one quarter net profit; British Petroleum, $6 billion; Shell, \n$5.4 billion; ChevronTexaco, $3.7 billion; Conoco, $3.10 billion--their \nprofits up 55 percent; Chevron profits up 13 percent; Shell up 35 \npercent; British Petroleum, their profits up 37 percent; ExxonMobil up \n32 percent.\n  People are going to fill their vehicles today, and they will wind up \nspending $100 for a tank of gas--one tank. So having the Defense bill \nbrought up would give us an opportunity to do that. I can't imagine why \nwe can't go to the Defense authorization bill--other than the reasons I \njust indicated.\n  There are things we could be doing. The Energy and Water conference, \nwe have been waiting for months to have a conference on that. We can't \ndo that. Why? Because the Senate number is higher than the House \nnumber, so the House fixes that. They just won't let us go to \nconference. Chairman Hobson is not allowing us to do anything because \nour number is bigger than theirs.\n  The American people should understand that part of the Energy and \nWater subcommittee money that we need to spend is for the Corps of \nEngineers. It is here and it is in the doldrums, to say the least. \nNothing is happening. Why can't we go to conference?\n  Also, in that the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the \nWhite House, I think we need to revisit this budget and reconciliation. \nIs it really the time in the history of our country to have, as called \nfor in the documents I have just talked about, $70 billion more in tax \ncuts? That is what we are being asked to go along with.\n  On the night we voted on the budget resolution I read a letter from \nthe head of the Lutheran Church, the Methodist Church, mainline \nProtestant Churches. They said to me: I want you to tell everyone here \nvoting on this--and I read it into the Record; they gave it to me in \nthe form of a letter--that the budget document that you are being asked \nto vote on is ``immoral.'' That is their word, not mine: ``immoral.''\n\n  If it was immoral when we passed it, think about it now. We are going \nto ask for $70 billion more in tax cuts, most of them for the rich, of \ncourse; $35 billion in spending cuts, $10 billion alone for Medicaid. \nIn all the pictures on television and the newspapers you see those \npeople who could not get out of the storm because they had no \nautomobiles, there was no public transportation--they were stuck there. \nThe poorest of the poor have been hit the hardest by Katrina. Shouldn't \nwe consider not cutting Medicaid $10 billion?\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nThat is where that money goes, to the poorest of the poor. We cut \nstudent loans, food stamps--these are cuts to the very programs the \nsurvivors of Katrina need. America can do better.\n  FEMA and other agencies failed these people, in my opinion. The \nSenate must not fail the American people. It is time we get to work. I \nhave given some outlines. We as a minority are happy to work with the \nmajority, but I have given an outline of some of the things I think we \nneed to do. The burden is on the majority to do something about this \nbudget and reconciliation because it is on the conscience of the \nmajority. I have to say: $10 billion cuts in Medicaid? More tax cuts? \nCutting food stamps? Student loans?\n  I also say that we have a burden, an obligation to do something about \nthe military that is sacrificing so much. The little, sparsely \npopulated State of Nevada had 24 soldiers killed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9697-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9697-S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my privilege to join others in \ndiscussing the life and career of the late Chief Justice William \nRehnquist. Chief Justice Rehnquist was only the 16th Chief Justice in \nAmerican history. John Jay was the first, sworn in in October of 1789. \nMany of us had an opportunity to go over and pay our respects, over in \nthe Supreme Court a few moments ago, and had a chance to look at the \nbusts of those Chief Justices.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist filled the role defined for him by our \nFounding Fathers with wisdom and with dignity. Millions of Americans \nhonor him for his legacy of achievement. When I went home last night, I \nnoticed a long line of people waiting to file past the casket and pay \ntheir respects to this wonderful man.\n  I first met the Chief Justice in 1969 here in Washington. At the \ntime, he was Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel. I was a young legislative aide to a Senator named Marlow Cook, \nwho represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Senator Cook was on the \nJudiciary Committee and this was a period in which there were a couple \nof highly contentious Supreme Court nominations. Judge Clement \nHaynsworth of the Fourth Circuit, who was subsequently defeated, and \nDistrict Judge Harold Carlswell from Florida, who was also defeated. So \nPresident Nixon had not only one but two nominations at the Supreme \nCourt defeated.\n  Bill Rehnquist, which is what I called him in those days, was the guy \nwho sort of crafted the speeches and helped us, helped the Republicans \nand as many Democrats who were interested in supporting those two \nnominees--helped us craft the speeches and did the important work of \nhelping us express ourselves. My boss ended up supporting Haynsworth \nand opposing Carlswell, so I was not working with Bill Rehnquist on the \nsecond nomination.\n  He was an extraordinary person: Dedicated, hard-working, the smartest \nlawyer I had ever been around at that point, and even after all these \nyears I would still say he was the smartest lawyer I had ever been \naround; a keen intellect with a very sharp mind. He was also, as others \nhave pointed out and will point out this morning, a kind and personable \nman, which he remained even while rising to the foremost position in \nAmerican jurisprudence.\n  After working for Senator Cook, I returned to Kentucky in January of \n1971, thinking I was sort of through with Washington. Toward the end of \nthe year, to my surprise and pleasure, President Nixon nominated Bill \nRehnquist to be on the Supreme Court. So, on my own nickel, I came back \nto Washington for a month and worked on his confirmation--just as a \nvolunteer, and did odd jobs and helped do whatever was thought to be \nappropriate by those who were officially in charge of his confirmation. \nBut it was a thrill to see him confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  Later, in 1986, when President Reagan elevated Justice Rehnquist to \nthe Chief Justice position, by then I was a Member of this body and, in \nfact, a member of the Judiciary Committee. So that was my second \nopportunity to work on a William Rehnquist nomination to the Supreme \nCourt. Of course, I was proud to be involved in that and very proud to \nvote to confirm him.\n  The Chief Justice served our country with his characteristic wisdom \nand grace. After leading the Court for 19 years, he was the longest-\nserving Chief Justice since 1910. He was only the fifth Chief Justice \nin our Nation's history to have previously served as an Associate \nJustice. He exemplified the highest virtue for a Justice: He entered \neach case with an open mind, free of bias, never prejudging the case \nbefore the decision was made. In fact, some of his decisions over the \nyears surprised observers and proved that he was willing to rethink \nopinions he may have once held. Actually, that is a good thing.\n  He reminded us that judges should be like umpires--never taking \nsides, just fairly applying the rules.\n  He leaves behind him a legacy that will be studied for generations. I \nwould submit that a chief component of that legacy will be his steering \nthe Supreme Court back toward the principle of federalism, which, \nalongside separation of powers, stands as one of the two structural \nprinciples undergirding our Constitution. Chief Justice Rehnquist \nexpressed that view in dissent after dissent in the early years when he \nwas on the Court until, with time, his dissenting views became majority \nones. Because of his clear understanding of the underlying purpose of \nfederalism, he worked to establish a jurisprudence that guards against \nuntrammeled Federal power and helps ensure that decisions that are \npurely local in nature will remain in the hands of the citizens who \nmust, of course, abide by them.\n  The Chief Justice earned a reputation for being a fair and even-\nhanded leader of the High Court. Former Justice William Brennan, who \nwas frequently on the opposite side in cases, said Chief Justice \nRehnquist was ``meticulously fair in assigning opinions.'' He went on \nto say that since Rehnquist's ascension to the Chief Justice position, \n``I can't begin to tell you how much better all of us feel . . . and \nhow fond all of us are of him personally.'' That was Justice Brennan, \nwith whom Justice Rehnquist rarely agreed.\n  In this recent age of many 5-to-4 decisions, it is all the more \nextraordinary that the Chief Justice created such a harmonious court. \nThe late Justice Thurgood Marshall, who served with the Chief Justice \nfrom 1972 to 1991, said simply that William Rehnquist is ``a great \nChief Justice.''\n  As Chief Justice, William Rehnquist was the same honest and upright \nman I had observed when I first met him back in 1969. In his final \nmonths as Chief, he reminded us all once again what it means to serve \nwith dignity and honor, as he persevered through his fight with cancer. \nWho was not moved to see the concept of ``duty'' personified on January \n20, 2005, when, under extraordinary physical duress, he administered \nthe oath of office to the President of the United States?\n  This Nation owes Chief Justice Rehnquist a debt that can never be \nfully repaid. He served his country in combat with the Army Air Corps \nduring World War II, as a law clerk to Associate Justice Robert \nJackson, as an Assistant Attorney General, as Associate Justice, and \nfinally as Chief Justice of the United States. Throughout it all he \nstood for the rule of law and the upholding of the principles that this \nRepublic holds dear. In my opinion, he was the most consequential Chief \nJustice since John Marshall. I repeat: the most consequential Chief \nJustice since John Marshall.\n  Elaine and I extend our sympathies to his family, his daughters Janet \nand Nancy, his son James, his sister Jean, and his nine grandchildren.\n  As miraculous a document as it is, the Constitution is only words on \npaper. It requires men and women of principle to see its meaning and \nspirit made real. William Rehnquist was one of those persons. Our \ngrateful Nation will always remember his heroic service and his \ndevotion to duty until the very end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, let me thank the distinguished \nDemocratic whip for letting me precede him in making this statement.\n  It was with great sadness that I learned of Chief Justice Rehnquist's\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\npassing, and even more sad when I joined the Senate to pay our last \nrespects to him this morning.\n  I first met Bill Rehnquist in 1952. We were both young lawyers here \nin Washington, DC. We each had taken jobs here in Washington after \nfinishing law school and in the course of many months became very good \nfriends. In fact, my first date with my first wife was double-dating \nwith Bill Rehnquist.\n  We had both served in the Army Air Corps during World War II, and we \nwere comrades in the deepest sense of the word. I respected Bill \npersonally then and professionally. He was a law clerk to Supreme Court \nJustice Jackson.\n  He took his responsibilities to the Court and to the American people \nvery seriously. Bill Rehnquist was devoted to the rule of law and to \nour democratic system.\n  In many of our Nation's most turbulent moments, we relied upon Chief \nJustice Rehnquist's commitment to the law to steer us toward calmer \nwaters. History will remember his evenhandedness and his impartiality \nin the face of tough decisions. During the impeachment process, which \nhe chaired in the Senate, the Chief demonstrated his fairness and his \ncommitment to follow precisely our Constitution and the precedents of \nthe past. It was during that time that I once again had the privilege \nof sharing lunches and coffees and just talking off the floor with my \ngreat friend of the past.\n  Bill Rehnquist was a humble and gracious man, as we all know. Among \nhis clerks and among his friends, he was known just as ``the Chief,'' \nand he was guided by the belief that no man is more important than the \nnation or the institution he serves. It was this belief that guided his \nefforts to narrow the concept of judicial activism and restore our \nsystem to its constitutional roots.\n  I didn't always agree with Bill Rehnquist. As a matter of fact, as \nyoung lawyers, we had a lot of arguments. But I knew he was a brilliant \nman, and he proved to be a great administrator for our Supreme Court. \nThose of us who knew the Chief respected his commitment to law and \nvalued his advice and counsel. His friends were from all walks of life. \nHe counted law clerks, Senators, Congressmen, and Presidents among his \nfriends.\n  He embodied the lines in the Rudyard Kipling poem, ``If.'' Bill \nRehnquist could ``walk with kings'' without losing ``the common \ntouch.''\n  Those of you who knew him will miss the Chief's wry sense of humor. \nAs a matter of fact, inspired by a costume from his favorite Gilbert \nand Sullivan operetta, he is the only Justice who added four gold \nstripes to each sleeve of his black Supreme Court robe.\n  He also loved a practical joke. One of my favorite stories is an \nApril Fools' prank played on Chief Justice Warren Burger, with whom I \nalso served at the Department of Justice. Bill put a life-size photo of \nWarren Burger on the front steps of the Supreme Court building with a \nsign asking tourists to pay $1 to get a picture with the Chief Justice. \nRemember, it was April Fools' day. He then drove the Chief Justice by \nthose steps so he could see his reaction to this prank.\n  But he said once to me, ``The Chief Justice brings to the office no \none but himself.'' This may be true, but this Chief Justice leaves \noffice with the gratitude of our entire Nation. You can see it today in \nthose long lines over by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has lost \na great legal mind, the country has lost a devoted public servant, and \nI have lost another good friend.\n  Catherine and I extend our deepest sympathies to Bill's family and \nfriends. He will be missed by all--greatly by me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I know the Senator from Alabama is \nwaiting to speak. I would like to ask him how long he would like to \nspeak so we can set up a time arrangement with the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am thinking 7 to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If it meets with the Chair's approval, I ask unanimous \nconsent that after I finish speaking, the Senator from Alabama speak \nfor 10 minutes and the Senator from California for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, very much. I will try to be brief and to the \npoint.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist was a person I probably disagreed with in \nmost political arguments. I read his opinions, and I realized that we \njust looked at the world in a different way. Yet I liked him. I liked \nhim a lot.\n  I had two direct contacts with him as U.S. Senator, the first as a \nnew Member of Senate and as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nand I received an invitation to come across the street, which is \nunusual, from the Senate to the Supreme Court for lunch. It was with a \nFederal judicial council. I was flattered and accepted the invitation. \nI then started asking the staff: Who are these people? They said: They \nare Federal judges from all across the United States. They gather \ntogether infrequently across the street for lunch in the Supreme Court, \nin a large chamber with the Chief Justice. They have invited you to \ncome and speak to them.\n  Reflecting on my storied legal career as a small-town lawyer in \nSpringfield, IL, and the fact that I didn't set the world on fire in \nlaw school, I wondered why they would ever invite me. Then it dawned on \nme. I was the ranking member on the court administrations subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee which had responsibility for determining the \nsalaries of Federal judges. So they were going to entertain me for \nlunch and pay close attention to all of my views in the hopes that I \nwould listen carefully when they recommended increases in judicial \nsalaries. That is exactly what happened. But the circumstances of that \nmeeting were amazing.\n  It was a large room and a huge table. There were two chairs empty as \nI walked into the room with all of these federal judges in every \ndirection. I sat in one of them. Then we waited quietly, and the door \nof the back room opened and everyone stood as Chief Justice Rehnquist \ncame in to sit next to me. As he sat down, I thought to myself: There \nisn't a single law professor I ever had in school who would ever dream \nI would be sitting next to the Chief Justice, but I am certain my \nmother looking down from heaven thought it was entirely appropriate \nthat her son was sitting next to the Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  The second time was the impeachment trial in the Senate, which was \npresided over by Chief Justice Rehnquist. There is a small room called \nThe President's Room. It is a historic chamber, and people often go in \nthere for quick meetings off the floor. It became the Chief Justice's \noffice when he was here for the impeachment trial. It was a curious \nsetup because as you walked by there, he had a desk that was literally \nsmack dab in the center of the room with the chair behind it, and I do \nnot recall that there was any other furniture in the room. He just kind \nof sat there isolated, like this little island. I would walk by and \nglance in there from time to time.\n  Finally, I got the courage to walk in and talk to him. He dropped \nwhat he was doing and started talking right away. I was impressed. The \nman was entirely approachable, personable, and funny. He had a ton of \nquestions about the Senate because he had been for over 30 years at the \nSupreme Court and the Senate was brand new to him. He asked basic \nquestions and joked about the rollcalls. He said, ``I love it when we \nhave a rollcall, and it will be Bayh `aye' and Snowe `no.' He said, ``I \njust love to listen as you call the roll here in the Senate.''\n  We had a great conversation. He gave me a book he had written about \nthe impeachment process. He agreed to autograph a few things. I really \nliked him a lot personally.\n  I can understand why those who disagreed with him politically still \nthought the world of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He was a man \ndedicated to public service. I respected him so much for that.\n  As others have said, when he showed up in frail health at the second \ninauguration of President George W. Bush on a blustery, cold day to \nadminister the oath, it was a great gesture on his part. It showed his \npersonal commitment to his job as Chief Justice, his love of his \nNation, and his responsibility. We are going to miss him. Very few men \nand women ever get the chance to serve as Chief Justice.\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\n  The Rehnquist Court was a Court which because of his leadership will \nbe remembered for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9699-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to follow up the statement by our \nminority leader, Harry Reid. It is time to get down to business. We \nwill finish this afternoon, after the funeral of Chief Justice \nRehnquist. I hope the Senate will return immediately, come right back \nto the Senate and not waste any time. Let's start moving on important \nlegislation.\n  The Department of Defense authorization bill was pulled from the \ncalendar over 6 weeks ago by the Republican leadership so they could \nbring a bill sponsored by the gun lobby on the immunity of gun dealers \nfrom being sued in a court of law for wrongdoing. It was hard to \nbelieve we would take away from consideration a bill that dealt with \nour troops and our veterans, that tried helping, in the right way, the \nwar in Iraq. We took that off the calendar so we could help a special \ninterest group. Let's get back on the calendar to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. That is something we can start this \nafternoon, and we should. Let's get it done this week, if we do nothing \nelse, to make certain we are responsive to a very real concern we all \nshare.\n  We have lost 1,886 American soldiers, as of today, in Iraq. Over \n14,000 have suffered serious injuries. We need to get back on that \nbill, and then as soon as we finish that, focus on Hurricane Katrina.\n  All are stunned to see on the television each night, and to read in \nthe newspapers, the accounts of the suffering that continues. Some of \nit is not as acute as it was just a few day ago, but consider the \ncircumstances. These poor families were yanked out of their homes--in \nmany cases their homes were destroyed--and now have been cast into \nother communities, in my State and other States, to try to keep it \ntogether while they search the whereabouts of their loved ones, put \ntheir kids in school, try to get a roof over their head, and try to get \nback to a normal life.\n  We need to do our part in Washington, DC, on a bipartisan basis, to \ndeal with it. First, we need to provide the resources. The $10.5 \nbillion from last week will be gone quickly because this is such an \nexpensive undertaking. Senator Harry Reid said yesterday, and I agree \nwith him, let us not underestimate the cost of what this means: $100 \nbillion or $150 billion is not unrealistic when considering the gravity \nof this hurricane and the damage it did. I fear some do not want to \nmouth those words--$100 billion or $150 billion--because they reflect \nthe reality of what this is going to cost.\n  If we face the reality of the cost of Katrina, we are going to have \nto be honest about other decisions. How could we possibly turn to a \nreconciliation bill, another bill we consider in the Senate, and cut \nspending for food stamps, cut spending for Medicaid, the health \ninsurance program for poor in America, in this time of great national \nneed? Yet that is what is planned. How could we conceive of the notion \nof going to a bill that would cut taxes on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, when we are at war with our children losing their lives every \nday, and we are facing Katrina and its aftermath where hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are in distress? How could we turn at that \nmoment and say our highest priority is to give a tax break to wealthy \npeople? That is not what America is all about. That is not what our \nvalues are all about.\n  For those who come to the Senate and speak in terms of their \nreligious commitment, the basic reality is this: If you care for the \nleast among you, you have to show it in your life's work. The Senate \nhas that responsibility as well and more than others who do their work \neach day.\n  Two things come out of this crisis with Katrina. First, we understand \nwhat E.J. Dionne wrote on September 2 of this year in an article for \nthe Washington Post entitled, ``When Government is Good.'' He quoted a \nformer Member of the Senate, Bill Cohen of Maine, who was also a \nDefense Secretary, and what he said was ``Cohen's Law.'' Cohen's Law \nwas this: Government is the enemy until you need a friend.\n  That is what we are learning with Katrina. We certainly learned it \nwith September 11. We have learned it when it comes to the war on \nterrorism. Those who condemn Government and say, Let's keep shutting \ndown agencies and Government employees right and left, have to \nunderstand the day may come, and soon, when we will need the American \nfamily working together as a government to do things that individuals \ncannot accomplish.\n  The second part of this is Hurricane Katrina has opened a door which \nhas remained shut for too long. It is a door which reflects the reality \nof being poor in America. This door is now open 24/7 for all to see \nthrough. The poorest among us in America were the worst victims of \nHurricane Katrina. Many others suffered, too, but as a group the poor \nsuffered the most. We have to be mindful and sensitive to our \nresponsibility to make this a great Nation of opportunity for the least \namong us, as well as those who have been blessed with prosperity and \nwealth. It is important our agenda, in the closing months of this \nsession, reflect that reality as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Boxer completes her remarks, our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Hatch, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, be \nrecognized for remarks on Chief Justice Rehnquist's death.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will share a few personal thoughts \nabout Chief Justice Rehnquist. I came to appreciate Justice Rehnquist \nas a young prosecutor. I was assistant U.S. attorney, tried a lot of \ncases and was involved in a lot of cases and had to read Supreme Court \nopinions on criminal law. I was impressed with his writings. It touched \nme in many ways. I felt he was speaking the truth when other Justices \nwere missing and not understanding the reality of law enforcement in \nAmerica.\n  This was in the mid-1970s, when our crime was increasing at an \nexponential rate. We had double-digit percentage increases in crime in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. In the 1950s, we did not lock the door of our \nhouse, and we left our keys in the car. People did not worry about \ncrime. It became a growing problem. At the same time crime was surging, \nthe Warren Court handcuffed the police and their ability to deal with \nit.\n  Justice Rhenquist, during the Warren Court years, would often write \ndissents. Sometimes he would be the lone dissenter. I distinctly \nremember being in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Mobile, Alabama, \nreading an opinion and calling my colleagues to say: Look at this. At \nleast one Justice understands the reality of crime and law enforcement \nin America.\n  He helped create a different approach to law and order in America. \nInstead of ruling on emotion and politics, he made his decisions based \non the law and facts. In fact, before he left office, cases he was \ndissenting 8 to 1, he was winning a number of them 5 to 4 and 6 to 3. \nWhat an accomplishment to see that happen over a lifetime. I never \nwould have thought it possible. I thought the trends were against that. \nBeing young, I never thought we would see the pendulum swing back, but \nit did, and he played a key role in that.\n  From my observations as a member of the Department of Justice for \nnearly 15 years, as a member, now, of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor 8 years, where I currently chair the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, my humble opinion is Chief Justice Rehnquist \nis one of the greatest chief Justices ever to serve. Senator McConnell \nsaid after John Marshall, but I don't know. I am not sure any have \nserved more ably.\n  He was also a great Associate Justice. He wrote clean, succinct \nopinions that made sense. They were consistent with the law of our \ncountry and our heritage.\n  He came to the Court when the Warren Court was in full bloom and \njudicial activism was at its apex. In case\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nafter case, he was the lone member of that Court to sound the alarm \nabout the dangers that arise when a court detaches itself from a \nprincipled and honest commitment to the Constitution of the United \nStates of America and the laws we passed. He saw the dangers in that, \nand he dissented many times--he joined with the majority many times, \nbut he dissented many times--on matters of great principle in an \nintelligent and effective way.\n  He played a key role in the demise of judicial activism as a dominant \nview of the Court. By ``judicial activism''--I will paraphrase Senator \nHatch's definition of it--it means when a judge allows their personal \nor political views about what is good policy or bad policy to affect \ntheir rulings in a case. It is not faithful to the Constitution when \nyou twist the words of the Constitution or of a statute so they come \nout to mean what you would like them to in order to achieve the result \nthat you prefer in a given case. Justice Rehnquist loved our \nConstitution, the one that we have, the good parts of it and the parts \nhe may not agree with. He loved every section all and respected each \none of them. He followed them and was faithful to them.\n  He understood liberty in America is dependent on order. Look what is \nhappening, so sadly, in New Orleans: police are threatened, doctors and \nnurses could not get out to help or rescue people because order broke \ndown. The Founders of our Republic never doubted the Government and the \nlaw enforcement of the United States of America. The States and \ncounties and cities had to have certain authority to maintain order or \nwe would never have liberty. This extreme commitment to libertarian \nviews can undermine the basic order necessary to allow liberty to \nflourish in our individual capability first. He understood that very \ncritically.\n  An example of the dangers he saw on the Court would be in death \npenalty cases. Chief Justice Rehnquist, as Associate Justice and as \nChief, fully understood the Constitution makes at least eight \nreferences to capital crimes, to not being able to take someone's life \nwithout due process; at least eight references were made in that great \ndocument to the death penalty. How could the Constitution declare the \ndeath penalty was unconstitutional when it absolutely approved it?\n  Two Justices dissented in every single death penalty case, saying \nthey thought it was cruel and unusual punishment. What a weird, \nunprincipled dangerous interpretation of the Constitution. Justice \nRhenquist stood against that tide, often as a lone Associate Justice.\n  Until now, people have come to realize that the Constitution and laws \nof this country allow a State or the Federal Government to have a death \npenalty, if they choose to have it. If you do not like that, take it to \nyour legislative branch. The Constitution does not prohibit it, for \nheaven's sake. The Constitution explicitly authorizes it.\n  He had a good understanding of church and State. I remember Senator \nReid, the distinguished majority leader now, when he was the assistant \nleader under Thomas Daschle during that year when they were in the \nmajority, and the Ninth Circuit struck down the Pledge of Allegiance, \nhe criticized the Ninth Circuit. I have been a big critic of the Ninth \nCircuit, but I remember making remarks at that time saying as big a \ncritic of the Ninth Circuit and as much of a critic of their striking \ndown the Pledge of Allegiance, I have to say many Supreme Court rulings \non separation of church and State are so extreme that could well be \njustified under language of the United States Supreme Court. The \nSupreme Court has given us a very confused jurisprudence on what is a \nlegitimate separation of church and State in America.\n  We got to the point in one case, the Jaffree case from Alabama, the \nSupreme Court, by a 6 to 3 majority, struck down a moment of silence in \na classroom. Justice Rehnquist dissented in that case, as he \nconsistently dissented against some of the confused thinking that was \nthere.\n  If this court had followed Justice Rehnquist's thoughts and opinions \non the question of separation of church and State, we would not have \nthe confusion we have today. We would not have one case where the Ten \nCommandments in Texas are OK and another case in Alabama where the Ten \nCommandments are not OK. What kind of jurisprudence is that? We need to \nget that straight. The Court has failed, in my view, in establishment \nclause jurisprudence. But Chief Justice Rehnquist has been a consistent \nand sound and reasonable voice on how to strike the proper balance. We \nneed to go back and continue to read those opinions and see if we \ncannot make them correct.\n\n  He also was a student of America. He wrote a number of books, grand \ninquests about impeachments, before we had the Clinton impeachment case \nin this body. He wrote a book, ``All The Laws But One,'' that deals \nwith the rule of law in America in a time of crisis, and dealt with the \nCivil War and other times in our country. He was a historian who \nunderstood America, understood our exceptional nature, our commitment \nto law and the Constitution. He understood that deeply. Every day when \nhe went to work, every opinion he ever wrote was consistent with his \nview and respect for America, her heritage, her rule of law, and her \nConstitution.\n  He understood that States have certain powers in our country. He \nunderstood that the Federal Government, through the commerce clause, \nhas broad power, but there are limits to the reach of the commerce \nclause. It does not cover every single matter the United States Senate \nmay desire to legislate on, to the extent that the federal government \ncontrols even simple, discreet actions within a State. He reestablished \na respect for State law and State sovereignty through a number of his \nfederalism opinions.\n  Madam President, we have lost one of the Nation's great Justices, a \nman who respected our Constitution, gave his life to his country, his \nwhole professional career. All of us should be proud of that service \nand honor his memory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9700-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9700-S9703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart. We have \nall watched in horror as the Gulf Coast has been struck by what could \nbe called the worst natural disaster in our history.\n  Over the weekend, Chief Justice Rehnquist, who served our Court and \ncountry with such distinction for 33 years, and showed such bravery in \nthe last months of his life, passed away.\n  We have now lost nearly 2,000 young men and women in Iraq, and we \nstill do not have, in my opinion, a credible plan, a mission, a \ntimetable to achieve success and bring our troops home. Gas prices are \nputting horrible strains on most Americans.\n  There is a tremendous amount of anxiety in America today. I feel it \nwhen I go home to California. We must confront it immediately in the \nSenate, in the House, and, yes, at the White House.\n  With one party controlling the entire Government, there is pressure \nin some quarters to be silent and just let mistakes and misplaced \npriorities take their toll.\n  Well, I do not agree with that mindset. I am going to say what I \nthink. And even more important, I am going to do everything I can with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help get our country moving \nin the right direction again.\n  Lives hang in the balance in this disaster and, God forbid, in the \nnext one. It is difficult to put into words how heartbroken we all are \nfor Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina. Thousands of people have \nlost their lives. Far more have lost their homes, their jobs, their \ncommunities. Brave souls everywhere are still searching for some family \nmembers while trying to keep others alive and hopeful.\n  I even heard a doctor on CNN talking about being forced to make the \nimpossible choice of whom to save and whom to leave behind to die.\n  Yes, the acts of bravery are being celebrated, as they should be--\nneighbor helping neighbor, churches filling in for FEMA, local law \nenforcement putting their own hardships aside to work 24 hours a day \nhelping others.\n  But there are images, such as this one I show here, that leave us in \ntears. It shows a makeshift grave along the road--a makeshift grave. \nSomebody put a sheet over a body, and it looks\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nlike bricks are holding down the sheet. There is a cross on top, and it \nsays: ``Here lies Vera. God help us.'' God help us, indeed. How can \nthis have happened in America? Here we are, the most powerful and \nprosperous country in the world, and our people have to write notes on \nhandmade graves to get attention.\n  Well, words of compassion are not enough. We must show those who have \nsuffered so much that their Government will help them find their \nmissing relatives, and rebuild their lives, homes, and communities.\n  The $10.5 billion we appropriated was an important start but just a \nstart. We should not wait another day to give all the victims of \nKatrina immediate access to Medicaid or to exempt them from the recent \nbankruptcy law. We should not be cutting Medicaid now, and that is \nexactly what is in the budget bill the Republicans are bringing before \nus.\n  We should not wait another day to provide temporary housing for all \nthose displaced, including emergency vouchers. We also should use our \nmilitary bases that are vacant to house people until they are on their \nfeet again.\n  We should not wait another day to make sure that Halliburton, or any \nother company receiving Federal contracts, employs some of the \nestimated 500,000 to 1 million people who are now jobless. Put them to \nwork rebuilding their own communities. You are giving these companies \nFederal contracts. Let them step to the plate and do their share. There \nare two similarities that I see between Iraq and this hurricane. The \nadministration did not have a plan for either, and Halliburton will end \nup making billions of dollars for both.\n  Hurricane Katrina has shown a spotlight on the best and the worst of \nAmerica. We have seen the inspiring courage of the survivors and the \ndedicated men and women working around the clock to help them. We have \nalso seen those who would loot, and take advantage of this tragic \nsituation. We have seen the heroics of the press, which put a spotlight \non the full extent of the tragedy.\n  We have also seen the deadly chasm between the haves and the have-\nnots, with the poorest among us left behind, literally and \nfiguratively, to weather the storm. And, yes, we have seen, in my \nopinion, an unacceptable response from our Federal Government. The \nPresident himself said that, and then he backed away.\n  I know the President has said he will launch an investigation, but it \nis not sufficient for the President to investigate his own \nadministration. Congress must fulfill its oversight responsibility. I \nthank Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for pledging to hold \nhearings on the Government's response to this tragedy.\n  Today, an AP wire story that was just handed to me says, ``The top \nU.S. disaster official''--that is Michael Brown--``waited hours after \nHurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast before he proposed to his \nboss,'' that is Michael Chertoff, ``sending at least 1,000 Homeland \nSecurity workers into the region to support rescuers, internal \ndocuments show.''\n  Quoting further the AP wire story:\n\n       The same day Brown wrote Chertoff, Brown also urged local \n     fire and rescue departments outside Louisiana, Alabama and \n     Mississippi not to send trucks or emergency workers into \n     disaster areas without an explicit request for help from \n     state or local governments.\n\n  We must fulfill our oversight responsibility. I agree with Senator \nClinton that we should also create an independent Katrina commission. \nHurricane Katrina has raised alarming questions about our Nation's \nability to prepare for and respond to disasters.\n\n  Last Thursday, the President told Diane Sawyer that we did anticipate \na serious storm, and I quote him:\n\n       I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees.\n\n  Well, that is unbelievable. All you had to do was look at FEMA's own \nreport in 2001, which listed the three most likely catastrophic \ndisasters our country could face. What were they? A massive earthquake \nin California, a terrorist attack on New York City, and a major \nhurricane hitting New Orleans. All you had to do was look at the \nHouston Chronicle, which predicted this. The New Orleans Times-Picayune \npredicted this. The National Geographic predicted this. There was a 5-\nday simulation in July of 2004 to specifically address a disastrous \nhurricane in New Orleans. The LA Times reported that in late May the \nArmy Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans district formally notified \nWashington that hurricane storm surges could knock out two of the big \npumping stations that keep the city dry.\n  On the day before the tragedy struck, an AP wire story said:\n\n       Experts expect Katrina to turn New Orleans into Atlantis, \n     leaving up to 1 million homeless.\n\n  They did not think the levees would break?\n  And what about the budgets? Despite repeated requests from New \nOrleans for more Federal money to protect the city, the press reported \nthat funding for Corps of Engineers projects in the New Orleans area \nfell by 44 percent between 2001 and 2005. This is unacceptable.\n  Michael Brown should go. He is a nice man. But I agree with Senator \nMikulski, he should go. He should go because he does not even have the \nexperience to do this job. He was the head of an Arabian horsemen's \nassociation. That is not training to step into a disaster the size of \nthe one we have seen.\n  Now, in California, we know how important FEMA is during a disaster. \nAfter the Northridge Earthquake, James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA, was \nout there. We counted on him, and Lord knows how many lives he saved. \nHe knew what he was doing. We built up FEMA during that time, all of us \nworking together. It has now been turned into a shadow of its former \nself.\n  I also agree we ought to make FEMA again an independent agency. \nSenator Byrd tried to do that. He offered an amendment that said: Let's \nwait before we put FEMA under Homeland Security. Twenty-eight of us \nvoted for that. It did not pass. I warned at that time very clearly \nthat this was making me extremely nervous. My quote was:\n\n       Putting the Federal Emergency Management Administration, \n     [FEMA] lock, stock, and barrel, into this new Department I \n     just think is going to be a real problem for us. . . . I am \n     very worried about accountability.\n\n  Now, I do not say this to imply that I knew what was going to happen. \nI did not. But I do have some common sense, and I know you need one \nperson in charge who has the ability, yes, to move mountains.\n  Yesterday, we had a briefing on this up in room 407. We had the whole \nCabinet there. I listened to a lot of good people. I would have \npreferred one person I could hold accountable.\n  There are many more things I am going to do. But I have to say this: \nFor years we tried to get interoperable communications funding--for \nyears. I had a bill. Senator Stabenow had a bill. It got through the \nSenate. It got taken out by the House. We still do not have emergency \nworkers able to talk to one another.\n  So we need to move fast. We need to move fast before the next \ndisaster strikes. Now, we all pray in the Senate we will not have \nanother disaster like this, but we must plan in case we do. That is our \njob. That is our work. We must set aside a lot of other things we are \ngoing to do around here to get this right because we know we are living \nunder the threat of a terrorist attack that could occur in any city in \nthis country. And this is a sad case for us and not one that should be \nemulated.\n  We all have to move forward. And, yes, the people who did not do the \nright thing should not be heading these agencies. In my state of \nCalifornia, we know how it feels to lose your bearings, your home, and \nyour sense of security. I saw it so many times in my congressional \ncareer, in my Senate career. Earthquakes, fires, floods, mud slides; \nyou name it, we have had it. You need strength at the Federal \nGovernment level when these things happen. Look at the city of New \nOrleans, what they tried to do with the police officers. Two police \nofficers committed suicide. They had nothing, and they were trying to \nsecure a city for days.\n  Well, it is hard to look at this, but we have to look at it. We have \nto do it with an independent commission. We have to make sure people \nwho are counting on us get their lives back. And we can do it. This is \nAmerica. But we need to hold people accountable. We need to be credible \nwith our response. The job is a tough one, but we need to do it, and we \nneed to do it soon. We\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\nowe nothing less to the people we represent.\n  Madam President, thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I was also at that meeting last night in \nthe secure room in S. 407. I have to say, I was absolutely blown away \nby how much the Federal Government has mobilized to try and help in the \nGulf region. There is no question that we knew this city was 10 to 12 \nfeet under sea level and that there was bound to be some sort of a \nproblem happen. I think there is plenty of blame to be cast around to \neverybody. The important thing that we ought to be considering is \nsolving the problem and getting that city back on its feet. From what I \nheard last night, the Federal Government is doing everything it \npossibly can. Frankly, I believe every agency, including FEMA, has done \na good job under the circumstances. This has been a catastrophe of \ngreat proportions. There is no question about it. All of the criticism \nin the world is not going to change that.\n  The fact is, we had a number of Cabinet-level officials there, from \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of Labor, and I thought \nthey made a pretty good case. I think we ought to get the job done and \nquit worrying so much about criticizing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, over the weekend, I visited several \nhurricane relief shelters around the State of Texas. Hearing the \nstories from the victims of Katrina firsthand has reminded me that \nwhenever natural disasters occur, we must help those affected recover \nand move on with their lives. But this is no easy task, and the impact \nof Katrina will be felt for many years to come.\n  I know this personally. Growing up in Galveston County, I lived \nthrough Carla in 1961 and other hurricanes. I have never forgotten the \nexperience of driving to my parents' house because we had not heard \nfrom them. Telephone service was out, so we packed our car with water \nand other supplies and drove to their home. As we approached, we saw \nmore and more of the hurricane's destruction. Finally, we reached their \nbattered house, and fortunately found them unharmed.\n  Dealing with disasters has made Texans both strong and compassionate. \nWhenever people encounter adversity, they are forced to make a decision \nabout how to respond. So often, Texans have stood tall, displaying \nvirtue in the heat of the moment. When battered by a hurricane, Texans \nhave increased their resolve, battling the elements to survive. When \nthreatened by funnel clouds, they have reacted with bravery and risked \ntheir lives to save the lives of others. And after the moment of danger \nhas passed, they have showed kindness and generosity in helping \nneighbors get back on their feet.\n  Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans has been covered \nin water, and thousands of people suddenly found themselves homeless \nand with no one to turn to. I am proud of how my State has responded. \nAbout 250,000 Katrina evacuees are in Texas at this time, and more are \nexpected. As many as 100,000 evacuees will be housed in 243 shelters \ndispersed across the State and FEMA officials estimate another 150,000 \nKatrina victims are living in hotels.\n  In the midst of this tragedy, my heart has been warmed by the many \nTexans who opened their arms and their homes to their fellow Americans.\n  Public institutions, many churches and charities, and numerous \nindividuals have provided food, shelter, and money for those escaping \nthe hurricane's devastation.\n  In one story that was particularly touching, a Texas couple who had \njust moved into their new home took their old home off the market in \norder to provide shelter to a family of nine in the months ahead.\n  In another part of Texas, a company has offered about 40 vacant \napartments in a retirement community, plus food, transportation, and \nhousekeeping for no charge. Another Texas company will donate $1 \nmillion to the American Red Cross and will offer rail transportation in \nsupport of hurricane relief and recovery efforts.\n  The Texas Health and Human Services Commission kept many offices open \nthroughout the holiday weekend and has certified more than 50,000 \nLouisiana families for emergency benefits. One Houston office extended \nits Friday hours until 2 a.m. Saturday morning.\n  The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services is providing \nassistance with the placement of Louisiana foster care children, \nincluding 49 children from a New Orleans facility. The agency has \nidentified placements for more children if needed and is working with \nshelters to ensure that any children who have been separated from their \nfamilies receive help quickly.\n  I am also very proud of my own staff, many of whom generously gave up \ntheir holiday weekend to answer phones at the Red Cross.\n  I had a personal experience that was very heartwarming when I talked \nto a woman in the Dallas Convention Center who said her son was in the \nNavy and she wanted to get him a message that she was safe in Houston \nand that his wife and their son were fine. We were able to contact him \non the USS Harry Truman later that night to inform him. He sent back a \nvery long e-mail to his mother which will be delivered to her soon. It \nis important we do these little things to try to help as much as we \ncan, and the Senate stands ready to do that.\n  One woman receiving aid in Texas thanked the workers there and gave \nthem a message to pass along:\n\n       Thank you for everything. God bless.\n\n  She went on to say that if they were ever in New Orleans once it is \nback in order, to please look her up so she could show them some New \nOrleans hospitality. We know New Orleans will recover, and we can't \nwait for that party.\n  To my friends back home in Texas, you repeatedly make me proud and I \nam honored to be your Senator. And to our neighbors along the Gulf of \nMexico, know that Texas and the Nation stand with you. God Bless \nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and all of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, words cannot express the sense of loss \nand hopelessness that many residents are feeling at this time in \nMississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. My family and I send \nprayers and heartfelt condolences to all of those who have lost loved \nones in the wake of this catastrophe.\n  One certainty of every disaster that occurs in the United States and \naround the world is the desire of fellow Americans to help those who \nare in need. Today, as we watch the terrifying developments on our TV \nsets, we know that generous Americans across the country are \ncontributing food, clothing, money, and time to the unfortunate victims \nof this tragedy.\n  The Salvation Army has more than 250 volunteers, employees and others \nprepared to serve up to 500,000 hot meals per day to residents and \nfirst responders in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. They have \nmobilized approximately 100 mobile canteens that provide up to 5,000 \nhot meals per day, and staged two, 54-foot mobile Base Camp kitchens \nthat can provide 20,000 hot meals per day. Salvation Army staff and \nvolunteers are working in shelters and coordinating the distribution of \nsupplies.\n  The American Red Cross is currently providing thousands of \nvolunteers, Red Cross workers and resources to aid victims of Hurricane \nKatrina. The Red Cross has about 485 shelters open in 18 States serving \nmore than 142,000 people. Working with the Southern Baptist Convention, \nthe Adventists, and Second Harvest, the Red Cross is prepared to \nprovide nearly 3.3 million meals each day. More importantly for some, \nthe Red Cross is partnering with local and government entities to \nprovide medical aid and counseling to families. The Red Cross is \nproviding a safe haven for thousands of evacuees in hundreds of Red \nCross shelters around the world.\n  Catholic Charities agencies from around the region are ready to send \ntechnical assistance teams to help the local Catholic Charities in the \nimpacted areas with their response efforts, as well as providing long-\nterm recovery work.\n  I am also thankful for the efforts of charitable organizations in my \nhome State of Pennsylvania. From the moment that disaster struck, \nindividuals, families and organizations across the Commonwealth have \nmade great efforts in assisting those in need. Brother's Brother \nFoundation, BBF, a 47-\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\nyear old Pittsburgh-based international charity, is sending a tractor-\ntrailer full of donations, including 5,000 pairs of new shoes donated \nby CROCS Inc. of Boulder, CO, and new clothing and hygiene items.\n  Fraternal benefit societies have also stepped up to the plate, \nincluding the Loyal Christian Benefit Association headquartered in \nErie, PA, as well as the Knights of Columbus and Thrivent. The Greek \nCatholic Union of the United States, headquarted in Beaver, PA, has \ndonated $15,000 to Catholic Charities, Salvation Army, and American Red \nCross.\n  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, UPMC, is ready to deploy \ntwo helicopters to States hit by the hurricane if emergency management \nofficials ask for them.\n  Additionally, UPMC has offered to treat hurricane patients at its \nPittsburgh hospitals or set up a 250-bed medical facility around the \ndisaster area.\n  Carnegie Mellon University has offered to assist Tulane University in \nNew Orleans in any possible way, which could include CMU taking on \nstudents from Tulane so they do not fall behind in their classwork.\n  The charitable efforts of so many Americans during this crisis is a \nreminder that government should be making laws that support and \nencourage such philanthropy. Legislation such as the bipartisan CARE \nAct benefits a sector that is vital during these times of crisis. The \nestimated $2 billion in food-donation incentives that the CARE Act \nprovides would allow farmers, restaurants and corporations to give more \nof their surplus food to local food banks and soup kitchens. \nAdditionally, individuals would be willing to donate even more if \ncurrent law was more favorable to those who charitably donate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9703-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a good man whom I \nknew well, who was a great judge, the late Chief Justice William \nRehnquist.\n  His service and leadership on the Supreme Court, the principles he \nconsistently followed, and the steady hand with which he guided the \njudiciary make him one of the judiciary's very best.\n  William Hubbs Rehnquist served on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates for 33 years and almost 8 months.\n  He was the eighth longest serving of the Court's 108 members, having \nrecently surpassed the tenure of the legendary Justice Joseph Story.\n  He was the fourth longest serving of the Court's 16 Chief Justices, \nand one of just five individuals to have served as both Associate and \nChief Justice.\n  William Rehnquist's service was a powerful mixture of the personal \nand the professional.\n  He brought a kind of dignified practicality, or perhaps it was \npractical dignity, to what is one of the most formal and respected \nposts in the Federal Government.\n  William Rehnquist was the historian who could play a practical joke, \nthe defender of the judicial institution who played poker with his \ncolleagues.\n  We will miss this scholar and author, who also led an annual \nChristmas carol sing-along for the Court's employees.\n  Yesterday, his former clerks surrounded his casket and carried it \npast his former colleagues into the Court where he lay in repose in a \nplain white pine casket. It was so touching.\n  We were all touched by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor weeping at the \nloss of a man who had been a fellow law student more than 50 years ago \nand was a fellow Justice for the past 24. He was No. 1 in his class; \nshe was No. 3. They were close friends.\n  The respected legal analyst Stuart Taylor writes that one attribute \nof greatness is being esteemed by one's colleagues. Whether his fellow \nJustices voted with him or against him on the cases before the Court, \nthey all cherished and esteemed him.\n  Liberal icons such as Justice William Brennan called Chief Justice \nRehnquist a breath of fresh air.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall called him a great Chief Justice.\n  Justice Lewis Powell said he had a good sense of humor and was both \ngenerous and principled.\n  When President Nixon nominated William Rehnquist to be an Associate \nJustice in 1971, Attorney General John Mitchell said he expected \nJustice Rehnquist to be independent.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, the nominee pledged as his \nfundamental commitment to totally disregard his own personal beliefs \nwhen interpreting and applying the law.\n  Democratic Senator John McClellan of Arkansas, a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, explained in the pages of the New York Times why \nhe supported what he called a distinguished nominee.\n  He said that William Rehnquist would not contribute to the trend \nof pursuing abstract goals driven by ideology rather than law. As both \nAssociate and Chief Justice, William Rehnquist confirmed Senator \nMcClellan's judgment.\n\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist strongly defended the prerogatives of the \njudicial branch. This alone might give pause to those who believe the \njudiciary was already too strong.\n  But he coupled that commitment to institutional vigor with a fidelity \nto constitutional rigor.\n  While insisting that the Court was the primary interpreter of the \nConstitution, he did not join those who said the Constitution's meaning \nebbed and flowed with the latest cultural and political fad.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist understood that we entrust interpretation of \nour laws to unelected judges only because, as he had, they promise to \nkeep their own moral and political viewpoints on the sideline.\n  Over time, by example and leadership, this principle helped him move \nthe Court toward its traditionally modest role within our system of \ngovernment.\n  Commentators and reporters discussing the Chief Justice's legacy \nalmost reflexively use the moniker ``Lone Ranger'' to describe the new \nAssociate Justice Rehnquist.\n  He was sometimes a lonely dissenter on a Court that saw itself as the \nvanguard of social change.\n  In that role, however, he reminded us of the fundamental principles \nthat should guide the judiciary.\n  Judges may not exercise judicial review based on their personal \nopinions, preferences, or agendas. They must take the Constitution as \nthey find it and apply it as it is.\n  As new Justices joined the Court, and Chief Justice Rehnquist \ncontinued articulating and applying such traditional principles, he \nfound himself with more company.\n  While some talk of Chief Justices as able to bring colleagues \ntogether in a particular case, Chief Justice Rehnquist did so, \npatiently and steadily, over the long haul of his entire tenure.\n  In a 1996 address at American University's Washington College of Law, \nChief Justice Rehnquist called judicial independence the ``crown \njewel'' of the American judicial system.\n  He took this seriously on a personal as well as a judicial level.\n  In this last year or so, William Hubbs Rehnquist lived and finished \nlife on this earth in his own independent way.\n  He shared what he wanted to share, when and how he chose to share it.\n  He carried himself with dignity, in a way protecting his privacy \npublicly, if such a thing is possible.\n  He was a good man and a good judge.\n  Our lives, individually as citizens and collectively as a nation, are \nmuch better for him having been among us.\n  I knew him personally. I know what a great man he was, as far as I am \nconcerned. I know what a supreme intellect he was on that Court. I know \nwhat a decent, honorable, honest person he was on that Court. I can \nremember one lunch I had with Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, \nand Justice Kennedy. It was terrific luncheon, filled with intellectual \nrepartee. It was a luncheon that I will never forget. I can remember \nhis smiling from time to time as his colleagues made some of their \npoints. He had this wry sense of humor that I suppose came from the\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\npeople that he was born and raised with in his own State. This is a man \nof tremendous, inestimable talent, intellect, and ability. But he was \nwarm. He was kind. He was decent. The only time I saw any flare for the \nunusual was the stripes on his black robe. That was done tongue in \ncheek, to just kind of lampoon some of the overseriousness some of us \nsometimes have with regard to the Supreme Court.\n  William Rehnquist was a good father. His daughter Janet worked with \nus on my staff for a short time. I think the world of her. She is a \ngood person. The other offspring of Justice Rehnquist are also good \npeople. I knew Justice Rehnquist's wife who preceded him in death. She \nwas a beautiful, lovely human being, to whom he gave great deference. \nThis was a man who counted. This was a Chief Justice who made a \ndifference. This is a person whom I respect and whom I care for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, we remember the life and dedication \nof one of the most influential leaders of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  William H. Rehnquist, 16th Chief Justice of the United States, passed \naway on Saturday, September 3, 2005. A midwesterner, Rehnquist's \nservice to our country dates back to March 1943 when he was drafted to \nthe U.S. Army Air Corps, the equivalent of today's U.S. Air Force. He \nserved in World War II until 1946.\n  After his time in the military, Rehnquist began his academic journey \nunder the G.I. bill at Stanford University, where he earned a \nbachelor's degree, a master's degree, and ultimately graduated first in \nhis class at the Stanford Law School. After clerking for Justice Robert \nH. Jackson, Rehnquist spent the next 16 years in private practice in \nArizona.\n  In 1971, President Nixon nominated William Rehnquist to be an \nAssociate Justice on the Supreme Court. As Associate Justice, Rehnquist \nwas nicknamed the ``Lone Ranger'' for his many lone dissents on the \nnine-member Court.\n  In 1986, President Ronald Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to Chief \nJustice of the United States. In that role, Rehnquist became known for \nhis ability to foster and retain collegiality among Associate Justices \nwith widely differing views on the issues before the Court. He was an \noutstanding leader of the judicial branch of our Government.\n  Those of us in the Senate probably remember him best for his service \nduring the impeachment trial for President Clinton. He presided over \nthat historic event with dignity and decorum.\n  Over the past year, as he battled cancer, Chief Justice Rehnquist was \nas determined and sharp as ever, doing his job faithfully until the day \nthat he passed away.\n  Today, we remember the Chief Justice's passion, dedication, and \nbrilliance. And we also remember his great sense of humor. Bill \nRehnquist will be sorely missed by his family, his friends, and his \ncountry.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \none of our country's greatest judicial leaders, a noble public servant, \nthe 16th Chief Justice of the United States, William Hubbs Rehnquist. \nFor the past 33 years, the last 19 of which as its leader, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist served the Supreme Court with honor, wisdom, and keen \njudgment. His record will be remembered as one of ideological \ndedication and devotion in a court of consensus and collegiality.\n  A native of Milwaukee, WI, William Rehnquist first answered his \ncountry's call to service in World War II by serving in the Army Air \nCorps as a weather observer in North Africa from 1943 to 1946. Upon his \nreturn, he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in political \nscience from Stanford University in 1948, and a master's degree in \ngovernment from Harvard University in 1950. He earned his L.L.B. from \nStanford in 1952, graduating first in his class, a class which included \nhis future Supreme Court colleague Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist's first experience with the Supreme Court \ncame when he clerked for Associate Supreme Court Justice Robert \nJackson. Rehnquist observed during this time at the Court what he would \nlater describe as the ``expansion of federal power at the expense of \nState power.''\n  After his clerkship, Rehnquist moved to Phoenix, AZ, where he \npracticed law in the private sector for more than 15 years. During this \ntime, he became involved in politics; and when President Nixon was \nelected in 1968, Rehnquist was asked to serve as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Three \nyears later, in 1971, President Nixon nominated Rehnquist to replace \nJustice John Marshall Harlan on the United States Supreme Court.\n  From his early years as an Associate Justice through his years as the \nCourt's leader, Chief Justice Rehnquist chartered a course to \nreestablish the important principle of federalism, an integral part of \nour Nation's constitutional structure. In cases such as National League \nof Cities v. Usery in 1976 through U.S. v. Lopez in 1995, his opinions \naimed to protect the role of the States within the Federal system by \nrecognizing that our government is one of enumerated rights and dual \nsovereignty.\n  Though a strong and vigorous advocate for his beliefs, Chief Justice \nRehnquist was always respectful of his colleagues and committed to the \nrule of law, never allowing politics or infighting to threaten his \nCourt. All of us in the Senate got to know Chief Justice Rehnquist when \nhe presided over the impeachment trial of President William Clinton. He \nwas a decisive, but not intrusive arbiter. His insightful observations \nabout the operation of the Senate were both serious and humorous. A \nprofound defender of the Constitution and a staunch protector of \nliberty, Chief Justice Rehnquist has left behind a legacy of \nthoughtfulness and quiet intellect, and will be remembered as one of \nour Nation's greatest judicial leaders.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was sad to hear of Chief Justice \nRehnquist's passing, but I want to share my gratitude for his service. \nHe exceeded all but seven Justices by the length of his 33 years on the \nSupreme Court bench. President Nixon nominated him to be the 100th \nSupreme Court Justice in 1971. Fourteen years later, President Reagan \nnominated him to serve as Chief Justice. In his tenure as Chief \nJustice, he oversaw benchmark cases and events that helped to shape the \nSupreme Court and the country as we know it today. His efficient \nmanagement of the Court and careful interpretation of the Constitution \nprovide a good example for future Chief Justices.\n  He was a very learned man, interested in a wide range of topics and \npleasant to be around. In 1952, he graduated first in his law school \nclass at Stanford. In addition to his law degree, he held master \ndegrees in political science from Stanford and Harvard.\n  He left law school and moved to Washington, DC, to clerk at the \nSupreme Court, a place where he would eventually spend over a third of \nhis life.\n  At times, our lives intersected. During the impeachment trial of \nPresident Clinton, I presided on the Senate floor just before Chief \nJustice Rehnquist took the presiding officer's chair--and then I took \nover each day as he left the chair. I also presided when he was \nescorted out of the chamber following the end of the trial. I enjoyed \nreading his book about civil liberties in wartime and his book about \nthe history of impeachments, which I was fortunate enough to get him to \nsign for me.\n  Now in the wake of his death and one of the worst natural disasters \nin U.S. history, the Senate will soon move to fill the vacancies on the \ncourt. People are going through some hard times in our country. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist knew about hard times.\n  He returned to the bench after being diagnosed and treated for \ncancer. He fought bravely to finish his job and spurned the rumors of \nretirement this summer. He stated that he would ``continue as long as \nhis health permits.'' And he did. I admire him for it.\n  We also must continue to do our job by holding hearings and then \nvoting on the President's nominees to the court. If we keep the \npolitical posturing to a minimum, we should have plenty of time to fill \nthe spot of the man who held it for so long and so well.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today we mourn Chief Justice William H. \nRehnquist, who faithfully served the Supreme Court and our Nation for \n33 years--19 of them as Chief Justice. That tenure made him the fourth-\nlongest serving Chief Justice in the history\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\nof our Nation, surpassed only by Chief Justices Melville Weston Fuller, \nRoger B. Taney, and John Marshall. He was also the fifth longest \nserving Justice in our history. Walter Dellinger, former acting \nSolicitor General in the Clinton administration, has suggested that \nChief Justice Rehnquist will be judged by history as one of the three \nmost influential Chief Justices, together with Marshall and Chief \nJustice Earl Warren. We have truly lost a historic figure.\n  It is with pride, then, that we in Wisconsin claim Justice Rehnquist \nas a native son. He was born in our State, and Wisconsin was his first \nhome. He grew up in Shorewood, a suburb of Milwaukee, and graduated \nfrom Shorewood High School in 1942. Wisconsin must have provided a good \nfoundation for his future; he went on to graduate first in his class \nfrom Stanford Law School and to clerk for former Supreme Court Justice \nRobert H. Jackson, another of the great jurists of the 20th century.\n  I have deep respect for this son of Wisconsin, although I did not \nalways agree with his substantive legal views. Indeed, we are hearing \npraise for Justice Rehnquist from across the political and legal \nspectrum. To be admired and respected despite philosophical differences \nis one of the marks of a truly great man.\n  Justice John Paul Stevens, perhaps Rehnquist's most ideologically \ndistant colleague on the current Court, paid tribute to him on behalf \nof the entire Court on the occasion of Justice Rehnquist's 30th \nanniversary on the bench. Justice Stevens praised him for his \nefficiency, good humor, and absolute impartiality when presiding over \nCourt conferences. That Chief Justice Rehnquist possessed sufficient \nintellectual strength and personal skill to preside over discussions \namong nine of the finest legal minds in the nation and to earn their \nrespect is no small feat, particularly considering the difficulties and \ndissension that have marked discussions and conferences in other eras. \nAll acknowledge that Chief Justice Rehnquist was a devoted and skilled \ncourt administrator, not just for his own highest court but also in his \nrole as guardian of our entire third branch of government, the Federal \njudiciary.\n  In addition to his accomplishments on the Court, Chief Justice \nRehnquist deserves our greatest respect for the dignity and fortitude \nwith which he conducted himself in the last year. Despite the fact that \nhe was clearly suffering from serious illness, he continued to serve \nthe public and the Court. He was an inspiration to all who encounter \nphysical obstacles in carrying out their duties, to all who face the \nchallenges of illness or disability but still want to contribute to \ntheir country or their communities.\n  History will judge whether Chief Justice Rehnquist led the Court in a \ndirection that was good for the country. For now, it is appropriate to \nrecognize his intellect and his service. I have deep respect for \nJustice Rehnquist's integrity, his personal fortitude and his devotion \nto the Court and the entire judicial branch. Wisconsin will miss our \ndistinguished son.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the late Chief \nJustice William H. Rehnquist. The Chief Justice leaves behind a legacy \nas one of the longest serving and most influential members of America's \nhighest Court. America is a better and stronger nation because of his \ndistinguished service on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As many from his generation did, Chief Justice Rehnquist served in \nthe military during World War II. He relied on the GI bill to attend \ncollege after the war and graduated from Stanford law school at the top \nof his class. In 1951 and 1952, Justice Rehnquist served as a U.S. \nSupreme Court law clerk to Justice Robert Jackson, and then went on to \na distinguished career in private legal practice.\n  In 1971, President Nixon nominated Rehnquist to replace John Marshall \nHarlan on the Supreme Court, beginning one of the longest terms of \nservice in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1986, President \nRonald Reagan nominated Justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice. He \nserved in that capacity for over 18 years.\n  Only 16 individuals have served as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Legal scholars identify periods of evolution in American \njurisprudence by the name of the Chief Justice presiding during each \nera. The Rehnquist Court will go down in American history as one of the \nmost important.\n  As an Associate Justice, Rehnquist began coaxing the Court back into \nthe role our Founders envisioned. As Chief Justice, Rehnquist continued \nto gradually pull the Court away from promoting particular social \npolicies and back toward the principles of federalism enshrined in our \nConstitution. By the time he was through, Rehnquist had patiently \nhelped reshape the relationships between our branches of Government and \nthe States.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist deserves enormous credit for returning the \nCourt to its role of analyzing and interpreting the Constitution and \nour laws. History will judge Chief Justice Rehnquist well for the way \nin which he shaped and guided the Supreme Court during his service to \nour Nation.\n  America will miss him.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of the \ngreatest legal minds of our day: Chief Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist, \nwho passed away late Saturday night. His death is a tremendous loss to \nour entire Nation. I join my fellow Americans in both mourning his \npassing and honoring his profound contribution to our country.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist faithfully served the American people on \ntheir Supreme Court for 33 years. Without question, our country owes \nhim a debt of great gratitude.\n  The individual who occupies the center seat on the Supreme Court is \nnot the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but the Chief Justice of \nthe United States--the one person who embodies our national commitment \nto constitutional democracy and to the rule of law. Throughout his \nlife, William Hubbs Rehnquist revered the Supreme Court and the rule of \nlaw as few people have--not only as our Nation's Chief Justice for 19 \nyears, as Associate Justice for 14 years, and as a high Court law \nclerk, but also a student and a scholar of the Supreme Court. Rehnquist \nhas written numerous books on legal history and the Supreme Court--\nincluding: The Supreme Court: How It Was, How It Is; Grand Inquests: \nThe Historic Impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew \nJohnson; All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime; and \nCentennial Crisis: The Disputed Election of 1876.\n  William Hubbs Rehnquist was born October 1, 1924, in Milwaukee, WI. \nHe entered the U.S. Army Air Force and served in World War II from 1943 \nto 1946. Rehnquist obtained his undergraduate degree from Stanford \nUniversity and two master's degrees from Stanford and Harvard \nUniversities. He received his law degree from Stanford, graduating \nfirst in his class. Rehnquist served as a law clerk for Justice Robert \nH. Jackson, then practiced law in Phoenix, Arizona. President Richard \nNixon appointed Rehnquist to serve, first as Assistant Attorney General \nin charge of the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of \nJustice, and then as Associate Justice in 1972. President Ronald Reagan \nnominated him Chief Justice in 1986.\n  The Supreme Court enjoyed renewed admiration under Rehnquist's \nleadership. Guided by Rehnquist's steady hand, the United States Senate \nweathered one of the most difficult and controversial moments in our \nnation's modern history--the impeachment trial of a sitting U.S. \npresident.\n  Rehnquist believed that the best judiciary was a restrained \njudiciary--one that would adhere to the letter of the law--not to the \npersonal policy preferences of its members. Two areas in particular \nstand out in my mind as perhaps the most lasting examples of this \nlegacy.\n  The Rehnquist Court may perhaps best be remembered for the \nrestoration of common sense to our criminal justice system. Many \nAmericans perhaps do not remember the days of the Supreme Court under \nChief Justice Earl Warren. The 16 years under Warren, from 1953 to \n1969, were nothing short of a heyday for criminals in America. Many \nAmericans probably are familiar with the notion of letting a criminal \noff on the basis of a ``technicality.'' This notion originated in the \nyears of the Warren Court. The Supreme Court let countless criminals go \nfree because police officers did not say precisely what the Court \nwanted them to say when they arrested criminals, or because warrants \ndid not say precisely\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nwhat the Court wanted them to say when the police searched criminals. \nIt is no exaggeration to assert that, at that time, the rights of \ncriminals were placed before the rights of victims--not to mention \nbefore the wellbeing of society in general.\n  This period ended when President Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to \nChief Justice. Chief Justice Rehnquist did his level best to return our \nConstitution to its original understanding, an understanding that gives \nlaw enforcement officials the freedom they need to protect society from \ncriminals. Over the last decade, we have witnessed an historic decline \nin violent crime all across America. This is due, in no small part, to \nthe efforts of Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n  The second area, one equally, if not more important than the first, \nwas the effort to restore the federal-state partnership known as \n``federalism'' envisioned by our Founding Fathers. Our Founding Fathers \nbelieved that States and the Federal Government should be equal \npartners. Indeed, it was the view of our Founding Fathers that the \nFederal Government should have limited and enumerated powers, and, in \nfact, the primary authority to legislate should be left to State \ngovernments. I know this might come as a surprise to some, but not all \nwisdom emanates from Washington DC. State governments, after all, are \ncloser to the people than the Federal Government is. Our Founding \nFathers realized this fact.\n  Unfortunately, many Supreme Court Justices did not. Over the years, \nmany of these Justices had interpreted the Constitution to give the \nFederal Government unlimited powers. These Justices characterized \neverything the Federal Government wanted to do as a regulation of \n``interstate commerce.''\n  This was a fiction, of course, but over the years the Federal \nGovernment grew bigger and more powerful, the State governments grew \nsmaller and less powerful, and the American people became less free.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist did his part to stem this tide. He tried to \nstand for our Constitution and the founding vision that not everything \nshould be left to the Federal Government. Although this project is \nstill unfinished, Chief Justice Rehnquist made impressive strides, and \nthere is no question that our Nation is better off today for his \nefforts.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist's passing also reminds us that Supreme Court \nJustices are, after all, human beings--and that they should be treated \nwith civility and respect, not as political pawns. Thus, perhaps the \nbest way that we in the Senate might pay tribute to Chief Justice \nRehnquist's legacy is to put partisanship aside in the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  President Bush has now fittingly nominated one of Rehnquist's former \nlaw clerks, Judge John Roberts, to replace him as Chief Justice. We \nshould do the right thing by Chief Justice Rehnquist and vote on Judge \nRoberts's nomination as expeditiously as possible--and without some of \nthe political posturing that has greeted other well-qualified nominees.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Chief Justice's Rehnquist's family. \nThe Nation suffered a profound loss on Saturday night. I am confident, \nhowever, that we in the Senate will do our part to proceed in a manner \nthat honors the memory of our late Chief Justice and in a manner that \nwould make him proud.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the death of William Hubbs Rehnquist leaves \nus saddened but also grateful for his more than three decades of \nservice to his country as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nincluding 19 years as its Chief Justice.\n  I first met Chief Justice Rehnquist when he was a lawyer in Phoenix. \nHe spent most of the 1950s and 1960s practicing law in our State, and \nraising a family there with his wife, Natalie, who passed away in 1991. \nHe made an annual return to Arizona from 1994 until last year, to teach \na course on Supreme Court history at the University of Arizona College \nof Law, my alma mater.\n  Appointed to his seat by President Nixon in 1972, and elevated to \nChief Justice by President Reagan in 1986, he provided steady \nleadership at the Court through turbulent decades. He showed that one \nman of integrity really can make a difference.\n  He was a conservative whose philosophy did not always carry the day, \nespecially in his early years on the Court. More recently, there has \nbeen greater acceptance of his notion of balance between the authority \nof States and the Federal Government. His decisions helped prevent the \nrights of criminal suspects from being overemphasized to the point that \nlaw enforcement was hampered in doing its job. They curbed the \nGovernment's use of racial quotas, deemed by most Americans to be a \nsquandering of the moral authority of the civil rights movement. They \nreaffirmed the religious freedom clause of the first amendment. They \nupheld restrictions on the practice of abortion, again in keeping with \nthe views of most Americans.\n  On a personal level, William Rehnquist had a quick, dry wit and a \nmanner that was warm and courteous. He was a straight shooter, devoid \nof pretentiousness, yet deeply learned in the law and many other \nthings. The legacy he leaves includes the histories he wrote, namely \nhis four books on the Court and the American legal system: ``The \nSupreme Court: How It Was, How It Is,'' 1987; ``Grand Inquests: The \nHistoric Impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew \nJohnson,'' 1992; ``All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime,'' \n1998; and ``Centennial Crisis: The Disputed Election of 1876,'' 2004.\n  Notice those titles. We had, during his tenure as Chief Justice, a \nPresidential impeachment--over which he presided with a dignity and \ngood sense that were reassuring to all, in and out of the Senate \nChamber. We had a disputed election--in which he led the Court in \ndelivering the U.S. Government and the country from a nightmare of \nlitigation and partisan combat.\n  His death has left mourners even among those who disagreed with him. \nThe liberal law professor Laurence H. Tribe offered words of praise for \nhis brilliance, his honesty, and his calm leadership. He called Chief \nJustice Rehnquist ``a master'' at enabling the Court to ``earn the \nrespect of all who take part in its proceedings or are affected by its \nrulings.'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said he ``was the fairest, most \nefficient boss I have ever had.''\n  The admiration he inspired in people all across the political \nspectrum is due also to the superb job he did as the Federal \njudiciary's top administrator, which is part of the role of Chief \nJustice. He staunchly asserted the independence of the Federal court \nsystem and fought to see that those who worked in it were adequately \ncompensated.\n  William Rehnquist loved his family; he loved the law; he loved \nAmerica and its history; and he loved the Supreme Court as an \ninstitution. The courage and tenacity he showed, despite suffering from \nthyroid cancer, were typical of him. He presided over oral arguments in \nthe spring and continued his work on that group of cases until just \nlast month.\n\n       It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as \n     free, impartial, and independent as the lot of humanity will \n     admit.\n\n  So said the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, which influenced the \nwriting of the U.S. Constitution. William Rehnquist was a free, an \nimpartial, and an independent judge. His combination of strong-\nmindedness and meticulous fairness made him perfect for the position he \nheld. He makes Americans, and especially Arizonans, very proud. We \nmourn his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9706-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9706-S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at times we come to the floor of the \nSenate not to debate policy but to mark the death of fellow Americans. \nI am deeply saddened to note that this is one such occasion.\n  By some estimates, Hurricane Katrina has taken what may be thousands \nof lives throughout the southeastern United States. The storm not only \nended lives but it also displaced hundreds of thousands of our fellow \ncitizens. They have now been scattered throughout the Nation, hoping to \none day return to the homes and lives they were forced to leave behind. \nOur work to help the victims of this national\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\ntragedy has just begun, and Congress must do all that is necessary to \nfund essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9707-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while the Nation's attention is rightly \nfocused on the ongoing tragedy in the South, I would also like to say a \nfew words about the passing of a great American. After a long and \nextraordinary life, William Rehnquist died this past weekend. The 16th \nChief Justice of the United States leaves us with an unmatched legacy \nof service to our Nation.\n  Born 80 years ago in Milwaukee, WI, William Rehnquist lived a truly \nremarkable life. Like many in his generation, he served in World War II \nand was stationed in North Africa. With the support of scholarship \nmoney from the G.I. Bill, Justice Rehnquist attended college at \nStanford University. He then went on to earn his law degree from \nStanford Law School. At law school, the Chief Justice began to \nestablish his reputation as a brilliant legal thinker and an able \nscholar. He graduated at the top of his class, just ahead of Sandra Day \nO'Connor.\n  After clerking for Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, Rehnquist \nmarried his late wife Natalie Cornell and moved to Phoenix, AZ. There, \nJustice Rehnquist and Nan raised their three children--James, Janet, \nand Nancy--while he built a long career as one of Arizona's leading \nattorneys.\n  In 1969, Chief Justice Rehnquist became a public servant as an \nassistant U.S. attorney general. Two years later, he was nominated by \nPresident Nixon to the Supreme Court. After being confirmed by the \nSenate, he took his seat as an Associate Justice of the Court--at 47, \nhe was the Court's youngest member. In 1986, President Reagan nominated \nand the Senate confirmed Justice Rehnquist as the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  During his 33 years on the Court, Justice Rehnquist gained respect \nfor his sharp intellect, his strong sense of fairness, and his profound \ndevotion to the Court and to public service.\n  The Chief Justice's extraordinary legal career was surpassed only by \nthe courage that he showed in his final year of life. During that time, \nhe battled bravely against thyroid cancer. Through radiation and \nchemotherapy treatments, he continued to serve on the Court and stated \nthat he would continue to perform his duties as Chief Justice as long \nas his health permitted. He did just that, with the dignity and \ndedication that characterized his tenure on the Court.\n  William Rehnquist truly was first among equals. May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I speak in honor of Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist. The Chief Justice served this Nation's highest court \nwith distinction and honor for more than three decades, and his career \nin public service started years earlier. Even as he battled cancer over \nthe past year, he continued to be an example of personal strength, \ndignity, and fortitude. I join my colleagues in mourning his passing \nand offering my prayers to his family.\n  The Chief Justice was a staunch defender of the Supreme Court and an \nactive, independent judiciary. He was admired as a warm and helpful \ncolleague, a thoughtful mentor, and an extremely effective \nadministrator of the federal court system. The courts were well cared \nfor under his distinguished leadership.\n  Justice Rehnquist also engaged directly with many of the toughest \nconstitutional controversies of the twentieth century. Although I often \ndisagreed with his decisions, Justice Rehnquist's opinions have been \nthe source of important scholarship and litigation. Like the Chief \nJustice he followed, the late Earl Warren, Justice Rehnquist will be \nremembered as an important historical figure whose legacy will impact \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I knew the Chief Justice only at a distance. As a lawyer and a \nconstitutional law instructor, I was required to wrestle intellectually \nwith his ideas and arguments, and to press my students to divine his \njudicial instincts and motivations. My regret is that I never got to \nknow him personally, or even to join one of his legendary walks around \nthe Capitol or monthly poker games. I know that his warmth and humor \nhave touched many of my colleagues, and he will be missed.\n  Of course, the strength of our constitutional structure--is that it \nis greater than any individual. Each of us plays but a small role in \ndesigning or building or repairing that structure it is greater and \nmore important than any of us. We mourn the passing of Justice \nRehnquist and now look to the future and the important work to be done.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Chief Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist, who was a brilliant jurist, a devoted public \nservant, and a person who shared my love of Vermont.\n  Though most Americans knew Chief Justice Rehnquist for his years of \nservice on the Supreme Court, many Vermonters knew him as a neighbor \nand a friend. Like most who visit our great State, Chief Justice \nRehnquist fell in love with Vermont's natural beauty and rural \ncharacter and purchased a home in Greensboro in 1974.\n  For over 30 years, Chief Justice Rehnquist escaped the humidity and \nstress of Washington every summer in favor of the picturesque \nsurroundings and quiet charm of Caspian Lake. Whether it was playing \ncards, visiting Willey's Store, or worshipping at the Greensboro United \nChurch of Christ, Chief Justice Rehnquist immersed himself in the \ncommunity with a remarkable subtlety and modesty for a man of his \nstature and prominence. The Chief Justice would also share his \nknowledge of history, politics, and the law with community members in a \nlecture that became a much-anticipated summer tradition in Vermont's \nNortheast Kingdom.\n  Each year, before the State of the Union, I would usually have a \nchance to chat with the Chief Justice about his time in Vermont. Amidst \nthe chaos and cameras of the Capitol on such a busy night, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist always found time to reminisce about the summer \nmonths he spent in our State. I always enjoyed these brief discussions \nwith such a kind and engaging man who valued life's simple pleasures so \ndearly.\n  On September 5, the Burlington Free Press, describing the reaction in \nGreensboro to the Chief Justice's passing, wrote:\n\n       It wasn't a dignitary that was mourned; it was a guy who \n     liked to walk everywhere and call people by their first names \n     (and expected them to return the favor). It was a guy who had \n     an affinity for Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bars and \n     Donna Gerow's homemade pumpkin bread.\n\n  As millions of Americans mourn the loss of one of the most \ninfluential people of our time, Vermonters in Greensboro, and around \nCaspian Lake, mourn a good neighbor, a great friend, and a fellow \nVermonter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9707-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9707-S9708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF WILLIAM H.

Madam President, Americans continue to be moved by the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina and its toll on our fellow Americans, \nfrom New Orleans and in the Gulf Coast region, particularly in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The human tragedy has brought out \nthe generosity of the American spirit, as people have opened their \nhomes and pocketbooks to families uprooted by the storm. This is a \ndisaster of Biblical proportions. The dimensions of this tragedy almost \nare beyond human comprehension and the failures by our Government to \nprepare and to respond run deep and wide.\n  Yesterday the President and the White House spokesman proclaimed that \nthe administration would not play the blame game. This is not a game. \nThis is not some schoolyard spat. It is about life and death and, most \nimportant, it is about getting it right the next time.\n  We must be about the work of providing continuing relief to our \ncitizens and rebuilding our communities. But we also cannot delay the \nimportant task of determining what went so gravely wrong, and holding \naccountable those responsible for the tragic failures that Americans \nhave seen so clearly on their televisions and read in their newspapers. \nThe next disaster could be tomorrow. It could be a devastating \nearthquake. It could be a deadly terrorist attack. It could be another \ndestructive storm. We need an immediate and independent assessment of \nwhat went wrong and what we must do to fix it.\n  Any corporation faced with such devastation and incompetence by its \nleadership would have its board and its shareholders demanding an \nindependent assessment of the failures and demanding accountability \nfrom its leadership. It would not be business as usual.\n  The same holds true for the people's Government. The people have a \nright to candor and honesty about the state of their Government's \npreparedness to protect them. The new Department of Homeland Security, \ncreated by this administration, was supposed to protect us. It was \nsupposed to do a better job of keeping us safe. It failed, and more \nthan a million people have been displaced from their homes, a treasured \nAmerican city is a wasteland, thousands have lost their lives, an \neconomy has been shattered with ripple effects all over America. \nCandor, honesty, action--that is what we need. The people have a right \nto know that they will be better protected the next time.\n  Another lesson of this tragedy is that America can ignore the \ndisparities in our society no longer. The powerful winds of this storm \nhave torn away the mask that has hidden from our debates the many \nAmericans who are left out and left behind. We see now in stark relief \nthat so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic \ndisaster. For them any setback becomes a major\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\nobstacle to survival, and a hurricane of this force leaves their lives \nin the balance. These disparities have emerged not out of malice but \nout of indifference, but they are real and we can neglect them no \nlonger.\n  In August, the Census Bureau reported that the poverty rate in \nAmerica is up and has risen for 4 years. It is now 12.7 percent, with \n37 million Americans surviving in poverty. A quarter of all African \nAmericans live in poverty; for Latinos it is 22 percent. One-fifth of \nour children live in poverty, and a tenth of our elderly. Thirty-six \nmillion Americans are hungry or malnourished. A third of our children \nare in families without health insurance. In fact, 45 million Americans \nhave no health insurance at all. And the disparity in incomes has never \nbeen greater, with the rich getting richer and the rest of America, the \npoor and the middle class, falling behind.\n  People in the middle class are having a harder time, too. Already \nthey were struggling to cope with rising gasoline prices, rising \ncollege tuition, and rising costs of health care. Now those affected by \nKatrina have lost everything: Their homes, their cars, their family \nphotos--everything. We cannot be an America of haves and have-nots. We \ncannot be an America of 50 separate, isolated States. As we rebuild the \nGulf Coast, we must also come together to tackle these disparities. We \nmust be a united America, one Nation under God, with liberty and \njustice for all. And when we say all, we mean all.\n  To address this challenge, our Government must respond in ways that \nare as good and compassionate as the American people. We cannot just \nfix the hole in the roof; we need to rebuild the whole foundation.\n  I propose that we create a New Orleans and Gulf Coast Redevelopment \nAuthority, modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority in its heyday. \nWe should invest at least $150 billion, as our Democratic leader Harry \nReid has suggested previously. We should invest it in actions to work \nwith Governors and mayors and citizens and communities to plan, help \nfund, and coordinate for the reconstruction of that damaged area. It \nshould help hire workers to put people back to work rebuilding their \nown communities and helping them get back on their feet again.\n\n  This is a national responsibility. The tragedy affects us all, not \nonly in our hearts, but it affects the national economy and our \nnational security.\n  That is the America we stand for, an America where we treat each \nother with respect, where we address our mistakes and meet our \nchallenges with honesty and candor and immediate action. America \ndeserves no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I do not speak often on the floor of the \nSenate. Frankly, it has been my observation that we have too many \nspeeches and not enough action in this town. But some events are so \nprofound that they demand our reflection. The tragedy along the Gulf \nCoast is such a time.\n  This Sunday will be the fourth anniversary of the terrorist attacks \non September 11, attacks that opened our eyes to the dangerous world we \nlive in, made real the existence of evil, and shook our national \ncomplacency forever.\n  Last week we witnessed a tragedy of equal proportions, not a \nterrorist attack, but an act of nature made more tragic by the \nviolation of the bedrock American value of community and the \nfundamental promise implicit between our Government and our people. Our \nGovernment failed at one of the most basic functions it has, providing \nfor the physical safety of our citizens, and in so doing raised \nquestions about who we are as a people, what makes us special, and \nwhether our leaders understand.\n  I am not going to dwell on the horror of the past week which we as a \nNation witnessed and which the people of the Gulf Coast experienced. \nAmong the horrors, we also witnessed countless episodes of tremendous \nheroism and heartwarming generosity, and we saw Americans rise up to \nplay the role the Government should have played by getting money, food, \nwater, clothes, even opening their homes to complete strangers. That is \nthe best of America.\n  There will be a time for hearings and for factfindings, for \ncommissions. Those investigations must be independent, so we can get to \nthe bottom of what happened and why. And those responsible must be held \naccountable for their mistakes, not promoted or awarded medals.\n  Today, however, I want to talk about something deeper: The breaking \nof a promise between our basic institutions of Government and the \nAmerican people who have created those institutions. The fact is that \nscores, maybe hundreds or thousands of lives were lost, not simply \nbecause people didn't leave or because the levees were not \nstrengthened, but because after the storm our institutions of \nGovernment failed them, and that is not right. Many of us never thought \nwe would live to see the day when tens of thousands of our fellow \ncitizens would be left for nearly a week to fend for themselves without \nfood, without water, and stranded on rooftops.\n  This is a moment where we have to step back and revisit the idea of \nwhat America is all about. People came here because of that idea. They \ncame because of the promise that everyone has an opportunity to aspire \nto something greater, and if you work hard and play by the rules, our \nGovernment will stand up for you if you happen to fall down on your \nluck. What happened last week in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast \nbroke faith with that idea in a profound way.\n  I believe the truth about America today is that our institutions, and \nparticularly this administration, have broken their fundamental promise \nto the people they were elected to serve. It is unfortunate but perhaps \nnot surprising from leaders ideologically hostile to the institutions \nthey lead. The answer to the challenges we confront today cannot be big \ngovernment, but it can also not be no government. And above all it \ncannot be incompetent government. But that is what they have given us.\n\n  What we are seeing in New Orleans is the result of a series of \nmisjudgments and misdirected priorities that have all produced an \nincreasingly tragic result, a people unprotected by their own \nGovernment, a government that no longer embodies our most basic and \nmost precious of values. From soldiers without armor to protect them in \nbattle, to children with no health care to protect them against \ndisease, to corporate employees with no pensions to provide for them in \ntheir elder years, this administration has sown the seeds of \nindifference and division for too long and now we are all reaping the \nwhirlwind.\n  Americans have always prized individuality. It is a part of our \nnational DNA. But America is a community that draws strength from the \nsum of our people and has always known that the total of that sum is \nworth far more than its individual parts.\n  We can only do so much alone. To maximize our freedom, to make the \nmost of our liberties, sometimes we must act together. It is what \nseparates us from the law of the jungle. It is what makes us special \nand different from other countries, too.\n  As a civil rights leader once said, we may have arrived on these \nshores in different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.\n  Last week we were not all in the same boat. There were too many left \nadrift, too many of our boats were left behind. This is not the America \nwe have known for more than 200 years. It is not the America we should \naspire to be. Our Government broke a promise. It did not keep faith \nwith our values. It is time for us to renew that commitment, to make a \nnew promise to the people who went through the horror of last week, and \nto say to each and every American across our great land, we are going \nto work with you to rebuild your city, to give you the tools and the \nresources you need to get back on your feet, that together we are all \nin the same boat and that everyone--everyone--has a place. It will help \nyou and it will strengthen all of us.\n  We must provide funding to school districts that accept displaced \nchildren. We must provide medical assistance for displaced victims \nwithout forcing them to wade through endless redtape. We must rebuild \nand strengthen the levee system in New Orleans as\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\nquickly as humanly possible, which should have been done years ago, so \nthat its people never again will face the calamity of last week. If \nHolland can do it, the little nation of Holland, then so, too, can we.\n  But to accomplish all of this and so much more that remains to be \ndone, it will take leadership, leadership unlike that which has \ncontrolled Washington for these last several years. The times demand \nleaders who understand that the true test of leadership is not how we \naccentuate the differences among us but instead how we reconcile them, \nhow we forge principled consensus, how we find common ground. We need \nleaders who appeal to us to think about something other than narrow \nself-interest but instead focus upon the greater, the better good.\n  The answer to our challenges can be found all around us on this \nfloor. It is written in the motto of the Great Seal of the U.S. Senate. \nE Pluribus Unum: Out of Many, One.\n  It is written on the motto of the great seal of the United States \nSenate, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' Out of Many, One.\n  United, there are no challenges we cannot meet; divided, we will be \nsurrounded by dangers, our potential as a nation unfulfilled.\n  So this Sunday, September 11, let us say a prayer for the victims in \nNew York and for those on the Gulf Coast and, most of all, let us say a \nprayer and ask for a blessing on this great country that we might have \nthe unity and the wisdom and the selflessness to fulfill the full \nmeaning of our creed: ``One nation under God, with liberty and justice \nfor all.''\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham).

Mr. President, I would like to take the next 10 minutes \nto talk about a couple of different items.\n  Not far from where we are today, the body of our late Chief Justice \nhas lain in repose, and a number of us were privileged to go there \nearlier today just to say goodbye and to thank him for his service to \nour country--33 years. That is a long time, more than three decades \nthat he has served us. His love for our country, his love for the law \nand the integrity of our Nation's judiciary system was only surpassed \nby his love for his family and for those with whom he worked.\n  During his time on the Court, he fostered, among other things, real \ncongeniality among the Justices--something that is not easy to do in \nthat forum or, frankly, in this one. In return, he was held in high \nesteem by his colleagues who had called him, among other things, \n``brilliant,'' ``principled,'' ``generous,'' with ``a good sense of \nhumor,'' something we can never have too much of.\n  He demonstrated great personal strength and courage in leading the \nCourt and this country through difficult and contentious times, \ncontinuing his work in the face of ever-daunting health problems that \nwould have set most of us on our backs and far out of the courtroom.\n  There are many judicial hallmarks of his time on the Court. \nThroughout his tenure on the Court, he staunchly supported the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary and our overall governmental \nsystem of checks and balances. We will miss him, but we are grateful \nthat he was here to serve us for as long as he has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9710-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9710-S9711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE RELIEF\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I would also like to talk about the good efforts that are \ngoing on in a number of places around our country to support the relief \neffort to those who have been stricken by Hurricane Katrina. We heard a \nfair amount of questioning about whether the response was adequate, was \ntimely, what we could have done better, what we needed to do better, \nand those are all legitimate questions and they need to be answered in \ntime--some of them now, some of them in the course of the next couple \nof weeks and months.\n  I said to some of my colleagues with whom I was discussing Katrina \nand our response--we were talking about the role of government in a \nsituation such as this--Lincoln had it right about 150 years ago when \nhe said words to the effect that the role of government is to do for \npeople what they cannot do for themselves. That is our role in this \ninstance as well.\n  Not long ago I was in our church, and the focal point of the sermon \nwas the parable from the New Testament about the Good Samaritan and the \nquestion that is asked at the beginning of the parable of the Good \nSamaritan, Who is my neighbor? We go on to be reminded that our \nneighbor is not just the people who live across the street from us in \nWilmington, DE, or in South Carolina. Our neighbor could just as well \nbe a person who lives in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mobile, or any of the \nother places affected.\n  I am inspired by outpouring, not just from government and for us to \ndo our jobs--we are paid literally to help people in instances such as \nthis, and that is the expectation of us, but for a lot of people this \nis not their expectation. People are literally showing their faith by \ntheir deeds. In some cases, people are opening up their homes, opening \nup their military installations, opening up all types of facilities to \nreceive those who have been dislocated, welcoming youngsters to schools \nfar from the schools those kids would normally be attending to make \nsure their education is not disrupted.\n  I think of the folks from my own State, the doctors and nurses, folks \nin our medical operation out of our Delaware Air National Guard. They \nwere literally on the scene today providing services and assistance to \nthose who need it. People are collecting food, people are giving blood, \npeople are giving boatloads of money and, frankly, boatloads more are \nneeded. But it is an inspiring outpouring after a difficult and \ndisappointing beginning.\n  Among the questions I hope we will focus on as we try to decide what \nwent well and what did not go well, what was right, what went right, \nand what we did poorly, is the issue of the levees that surround the \ncity of New Orleans that keep Lake Pontchartrain from pouring into the \ncity of New Orleans. If you look in the dictionary for a definition of \n``city at risk'' if there ever was a Category 3, 4, or 5 hurricane, you \nwould see New Orleans. That is the poster child for this kind of risk. \nWe knew the threat was there. We knew it was a grave threat. We have \nbeen talking about it for years. The people have talked about it for \nyears. The Army Corps of Engineers sought to reinforce the levees.\n  We knew this storm was coming. It is not one that popped up at the \nlast minute. Yet, in spite of that, the work that should have been done \non the levees to strengthen them to sustain this kind of onslaught by \nMother Nature, someone has dropped the ball. I am not interested in \nfinger-pointing or witch hunts. We have to find out where we went \nwrong, why we went wrong, and fix that. If New Orleans is ever to rise \nagain--not from the ashes but from the waters that engulf it today--\nthis is an issue that has to be not only resolved, we have to come up \nwith a solution to make sure we have learned from this very expensive \nlesson.\n  I fear a storm which could have cost tens of billions may cost more \nthan $100 billion to repair the damage, a lot of it from New Orleans. A \nstorm that could have cost us hundreds of lives will probably cost us \nthousands of lives. It did not have to be.\n  The last thing I wish to say is I was encouraged in the presentation \nwe had by some of our Cabinet Secretaries who talked about what the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services is doing, making sure the folks \nwho need medical assistance and Medicaid eligibility, identification, \npeople who need help getting their food stamp allocations, people need \nto receive their unemployment checks--all kinds of things were \ndiscussed, what the Federal Government can do to help people. It was \nencouraging.\n  One of the presenters was the Secretary of the Department of \nTreasury. He talked, as the Presiding Officer may recall, about the \nwork being done to\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\ndefer the payment of taxes. People who normally would have an estimated \ntax payment--personal business maybe--on September 15 will be given \nuntil the end of October to make that payment. They were looking for \nways we, through the Federal Government, could exercise some charity, \nsome consideration for those who were in harm's way and are now in \ndesperate straits to pull their lives back together.\n  I come from a State where we have a lot of banks. We probably have \nmore credit card banks per capita--probably issue half the credit cards \nissued in America. I am empowered to speak on this point. We have a lot \nof financial services companies around the world. They extend credit. \nMost do a great job of extending credit to people through America, the \nNortheast, Midwest, Southwest, and also the Gulf Coast States. Just as \nthe Department of Treasury is trying to find ways to show kindness and \na little consideration to those who are affected in the disaster areas \non the tax side, my hope is our financial services companies which are \ngoing to be benefiting from the implementation of our new bankruptcy \nlaw this fall, this might be a good opportunity for some of them to \nsay--and some of them already are doing this, I should point that out. \nSome financial services companies are saying: We want to help folks in \nthe Southeast United States who have been affected, and here are the \nvariety of ways we will do that. Some are not entirely forgiving \nindebtedness but are providing payment holidays, extending the dates on \nwhich payments are due, and taking away interest and finance charges. \nThat is what we ought to applaud and the behavior we ought to encourage \nothers to undertake.\n  Today, in addition to saying goodbye to our Chief Justice and to \nsaying terrific work by folks from all walks of life to help people in \ndire straights, well done, we say to our financial services companies \naround the country that are trying to find their own ways to reach out \nand help people, God bless you. Good for you. Finally, to say to those \nwho aren't, maybe you would like to join the parade and lend a helping \nhand as well.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Carper pertaining to the introduction of S. 1627 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.''\n  Mr. CARPER.

REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak \nfor three very important reasons. Of course, first is to recognize our \nChief Justice who has just passed, William Rehnquist.\n  Today the Senate paid its respects to the late Justice Rehnquist, \nfiling through the halls of the Supreme Court where he served this \nNation with distinction for more than 33 years.\n  I could not help but remember a conversation I had with Chief Justice \nRehnquist a couple of years ago. I was walking to work and happened to \nrun into him on one of his legendary strolls around the Court. We \ntalked a bit about what was happening in the judicial nomination \nprocess in the Senate. But the specifics of that conversation are \nprobably less important than the style of the conversation. He was \ninformal, approachable, genteel, but certainly direct. And regardless \nof his physical frailty, he had lost none of his interest or his \nability to give a shrewd analysis of the events of the day. If you \nspent any time at all with this very important man, you would feel the \nforce of his great personality.\n  Much has already been written about the legal legacy of Justice \nRehnquist because he was one of the most influential jurists of our \ntime. He anchored and presided over a shift to conservative principles, \nunderscoring in particular the importance of federalism and limitations \non Government. I know some in the conservative community were \ndisappointed that the Supreme Court, on his watch, did not reverse more \nprior left-leaning precedents, but his strong hand was certainly \nobvious in a long series of history-making decisions. William \nRehnquist's impact on jurisprudence was profound and will be felt for \nmany years to come.\n  In his personal life, I know this engaging man had many friends, and \nto all of them, as well as his family, I extend my deepest condolences. \nThe Court has lost a brilliant and fair leader. America has lost a \ngreat public servant. I consider myself fortunate to have had the \nchance to know and be inspired by William Rehnquist.\n  I thank the leader for this opportunity to add one more voice to the \nchorus of tributes from a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9711-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9711-S9712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO DAMON TOBIAS AND GEORGE O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if you serve long enough in the Congress--I \nhad the opportunity to serve 10 years in the House, and now I am into \nmy third term in the Senate--you have a lot of very capable and \nwonderful people who work for you. If you serve long enough, as I have \nmentioned, they not only work for you but sometimes they decide to \nretire. In my situation, in my office, I have two people retiring this \nmonth, and I am going to miss them greatly. I want to speak a few \nmoments about them.\n  First, I talk about Damon Tobias. Damon has been on my staff and \nhandling my budget and tax issues and appropriations issues for a good \nnumber of years. I first met Damon in the House of Representatives when \nhe was on the staff of Congressman Charlie Stenholm of Texas. Damon and \nI and Congressman Stenholm became involved in the balanced budget \namendment movement at a time when deficits were totally out of control, \nand many of us worked to bring them under control. That is when Damon \nand I became friends. Through the 1980s we worked together on this most \nimportant issue.\n  I left the House to come to the Senate, and Damon left the Stenholm \noffice to go to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Later on, 2 years after I \ncame to the Senate, Damon joined my staff in March of 1992. Damon has \ncontinued to work for me over that time, dealing with the balanced \nbudget amendment, dealing with taxes and budget and labor issues, \nimmigration issues. Probably Damon has spent more time, along with me, \ntrying to solve the immigration question for American agriculture and \nfor workers in the American agricultural economy than nearly any other \nissue. Of course, that paramount bill he worked so much on now has \nmajority support in this Senate and a vast coalition of Americans \nbehind it, known as AgJOBS, and it is a legacy of which Damon can be \ntruly proud. He worked on appropriations and small business and \nHispanic issues.\n\n  He and his bride are going to return to his home State of New Mexico \nwhere Damon, I am sure, will proceed to do other things along with \ntaking care of his aging mother. I and my staff are going to miss Damon \nTobias, and I am convinced the Senate will also miss him.\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\n  Mr. President, I now wish to speak about George O'Connor. Many who \nare in the energy field not only here in the Senate but across the \nUnited States know George O'Connor. He has served with me as counsel, \non the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for a good number of \nyears. He came to this city as a lawyer in 1980, working for the Stein, \nMitchell & Mezines law firm as a litigator. He specialized in \nadministrative law litigation before the Federal Trade Commission. He \nbecame a trial attorney for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \nOffice of General Counsel in the Division of Hydroelectric Licensing in \n1982.\n  He worked then as a legal advisor to FERC Commissioner Charles A. \nTrabandt from 1985 until 1993 and was responsible for environmental \nissues associated with energy projects. He returned to the FERC's \nOffice of General Counsel until 1997.\n  In 1998, George joined my staff as a fellow, and it was not long \nbefore I realized I needed his talent on a full-time basis in the area \nof energy and natural resources. In the year 2000, he became directly \ninvolved with me and has worked in that capacity for a tremendous \nnumber of years. I must say that both George and I, at the close of the \nsession for the August recess and the passage of the National Energy \nPolicy Act, saw that as not only a culmination of a great career here \nin the Senate for George O'Connor but a substantial success for myself \nand other members of the Energy Committee who were much involved in \nthat.\n  George has worked a total of 24 years in the Federal Government, and \na total of 8 years in my office. I say, without question, I am going to \nmiss George O'Connor. He is retiring to go downtown to do other things, \nand I am sure he will be back here when we need him helping us with his \nexpertise and his talent. He is well known by all who associate with \nhim as a tough but very fairminded and talented man.\n  I must say that George O'Connor has served my State of Idaho well, \nhas served the Pacific Northwest well, where hydro is still a dominant \nproducer of our electricity, and has served this Nation and the Senate \nwell.\n  My hope for George O'Connor and Damon Tobias is that in their next \nlife, which they are now about to assume, they will do well and be as \nsuccessful in it as they have been as very talented and capable \nstaffers here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9712-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H.

I rise today basically to speak about another issue, and \nthat is a letter which I have received as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and which was sent to the majority leader, the Speaker of the \nHouse, and the chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side by \nthe leadership of the Democratic membership of the Senate and the \nHouse--Congresswoman Pelosi; John Spratt, who is ranking member on the \nHouse Budget Committee on the Democratic side; Senator Reid, who, of \ncourse, is the Democratic leader; and Kent Conrad, who is the ranking \nDemocratic member of the Budget Committee.\n  The letter asks that we indefinitely postpone reconciliation, \nreconciliation being the mechanism by which we address the entitlement \nspending and tax policy here at the Federal level. It is an outgrowth, \nof course, of the budget process.\n  Now, the letter itself, if I can look at it, although I can hardly \nsee it--I wish they would send these letters in larger fonts so those \nof us getting older would not have to take out our glasses to read \nthem. But, in any event, the letter itself is structured in a way to \nassert a number of items, boldly assert items which essentially are \ninaccurate. In fact, the boldness of these inaccuracies is such that it \nwould be humorous if they were not going to, I am sure, become part of \nthe nomenclature of the left in the country and, indeed, be carried \nforth by the echo chambers, such as National Public Radio, which speaks \nfor the left.\n  But their language says this:\n\n       Now is not the time to cut services for our most \n     vulnerable, cut taxes for our most fortunate, and add $35 \n     billion to the deficit.\n\n  That is the basic theme of the letter.\n\n       If allowed to go forward, this bill--\n\n  They are talking about the reconciliation bill--\n\n     would likely cut programs that many victims of Hurricane \n     Katrina will be relying on, including Medicaid, food stamps, \n     and student loans.\n\n  Those two statements are, as I said, boldly inaccurate and reflect a \nfailure to accept history and a failure to look at the specifics of the \nreconciliation bill as it passed the Senate.\n  Now that does not surprise me. I have to admit, and the folks who \nsigned this letter readily admit, they did not vote for the budget when \nit first passed 8 months ago or 7 months ago, however long ago, 6 \nmonths ago. When it first passed, these four individuals and their \ncaucuses strongly opposed putting in place here in the Congress a \nbudget that had fiscal discipline, and they voted against it. So it \nshould not come as a surprise and this letter should not come as a \nsurprise that they are still against it and they still want to \nindefinitely postpone the key mechanisms which will make this budget \neffective.\n  But what is a little surprising is that they would assert such \ninaccuracies in their letter. Let's begin with the tax inaccuracy. They \nmust be ignoring or they must not just look at history. They must not \nlook at the history of the Kennedy tax cuts and the Reagan tax cuts, \nand most recently the George W. Bush tax cuts because one thing we \nproved beyond any reasonable doubt is that when you significantly cut \ntaxes on the productive side of the American economy, you create \neconomic activity, and as a result, you create jobs and you give people \nwork and you create revenues for the Federal Government.\n  The numbers are incontrovertible. In the last 3 years, revenues have \nbeen jumping dramatically relative to the base we hit as a bottom as a \nresult of the recession we experienced as a result of the bubble \nbursting, the Internet bubble of the 1990s, and the effects of 9/11. In \nfact, 2 years ago revenues jumped by 9 percent.\n  This year, revenues are literally going to jump by more than that. \nThe revenue projections for the next few years are projected to \nincrease by 7 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent. And the deficit has \ndropped by over $150 billion from the original estimates purely as a \nresult of economic activity that has been stimulated in large part \nbecause we have reduced the tax burden on the productive side of the \nledger and created an incentive for people to go out and invest. As a \nresult, there is an incentive for people to create jobs.\n  We had some of the best job creation in the history of this country \nover the last 2 years. As a result, people are paying taxes and \nrevenues are going up. It is totally ignored and misrepresented in this \nletter. More specifically, and I think the thing that I find most \nunreasonable about the terms of this letter--or, as I say, most boldly \ninaccurate--is its representation that the reconciliation instructions, \nas they relate to the mandatory accounts, will somehow affect programs \nthat benefit people relative to the problems which we have in the South \ntoday as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth, be more inaccurate, or be more of an attempt to use the \ntrauma and tragedy of Katrina to assert a political agenda here in the \nCongress of the United States, which they have been trying to assert, \nas I said, since they voted against that budget 6 months ago. The two \nhave no substantive relationship, but there is an attempt now to use \nthe political arena to try to link them up.\n  The fact is that the reconciliation instructions in this bill will in \nno way reduce student loans. In fact, the committee which has \njurisdiction over this issue, under the extraordinarily able\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\nleadership of Senator Enzi, is proposing a bill which will expand \nrather aggressively student loans, while saving money for the Federal \ntaxpayer by addressing excesses in the lending community.\n  In fact, the proposal from the HELP Committee will increase Pell \ngrants, will increase the availability of loans to students, and will \nreduce the interest rates on those loans. If we do not go forward with \nreconciliation and use reconciliation as a vehicle to protect this \nhigher education initiative that comes out of the HELP Committee, we \nwill actually end up increasing the costs to students. This letter is \ntotally and obscenely inaccurate on that point.\n  It is equally inaccurate on the issue of pensions. Without \nreconciliation instructions on pensions, we are going to see more and \nmore companies thrown into bankruptcy. As a result, the taxpayers are \ngoing to have to pick up the pension obligations of those companies. \nThe people who benefit from those pensions are going to see their \npensions dramatically reduced because, under the bankruptcy rules, you \ncan significantly cut your pension liability. But if we correct the \npension laws and if we use reconciliation to increase the premium cost \nof the pensions, which will be paid primarily by the corporations, we \nwill be able to save some of the pensions which are now in dire \nstraits.\n  The only way we can do this is probably through reconciliation. So if \nyou don't have reconciliation, you are going to see more companies \ngoing into bankruptcy. You are going to see more pensions being wiped \nout. And you are going to see more employees--who have worked their \nwhole life, invested in their company--find that that pension, which \nthey thought they had, is actually going to be cut, if you follow the \nthought process which is being proposed here by the Democratic \nleadership of the Senate and the House of Representatives and which is \ntotally the opposite of what their language in this letter talks about.\n  It is a total inaccuracy; 180 degrees different from the actual \nlanguage of this letter will occur. People will lose their pensions. \nThe cost to the American taxpayer will go up if we do not have \nreconciliation dealing with pensions.\n  The third area which this language talks about is Medicaid. Let's \ntalk about Medicaid. The reconciliation instructions suggest that we \nreduce the rate of growth in Medicaid over the next 5 years from 41 \npercent to 40 percent. It was originally going to be back to 39 \npercent, but we went from 41 percent to 40 percent, a $10 billion \nreduction in the rate of growth--not in spending increases, in rate of \ngrowth, not a cut, on a $1.3 trillion base. In other words, we are \ngoing to spend $1.3 trillion on Medicaid over the next 5 years. What we \nasked in the budget was that we slow that rate of growth by 1 percent. \nWe let it grow by 40 percent over the next 5 years instead of 41 \npercent or $10 billion.\n  And how was that going to be accomplished? It was going to be \naccomplished in concert with the Governors who are going to get much \nmore flexibility in the way that they deliver the Medicaid services. \nAlmost every Governor who came to us said: We will be able to deliver \nbetter services and cover more people if we get this flexibility than \nif we don't get the flexibility. As a result, we can certainly handle \nthe 1-percent slowing of rate of growth of increase in exchange for \ngetting the flexibility which will give us the capacity to cover more \npeople. Dramatically more people will be covered if we use our \nreconciliation vehicle to change the law so that Governors don't have \nto go through all the hoops they have to go through today in order to \naddress Medicaid, so that we don't have people defrauding the system as \nwe have today but, rather, have a system that is honest and covers \npeople who need to be covered. But you can't get there from here unless \nyou use reconciliation because you can't pass a bill in this Senate \nwith 60 votes. You can't get 60 votes because the party on the other \nside of the aisle simply refuses to do anything constructive in this \narea, and they have talked walked away from the table. So you need \nreconciliation protection. In fact, there will be no services cut.\n  To tie it into Katrina is so gross in its representation as to its \ninaccuracy as to be beyond blatant politics. The simple fact is, the \nreconciliation instructions assume no savings in Medicaid over the next \nyear. All the savings come in years two, three, four, and five. \nObviously, most all the spending for the Katrina situation is going to \noccur in the next year. To tie it into Katrina is absurd.\n  This letter is not surprising because it comes from people who oppose \ndiscipline in the budget to begin with, but its assertions are, even by \nthe standards of politics in this body, bold in their inaccuracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9713-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9713-S9714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to William \nRehnquist, 16th Chief Justice of the United States. That is the title, \nChief Justice of the United States. While the ceremony honoring him \ngoes forward I think it is appropriate that we in this body recognize \nhis incredible service to the Nation. His biography, where he came from \nand what he did, has been spoken of a great deal. What I wanted to \nspeak about is not only that, but also his personal impact on me, one \nthat he wouldn't have known or known about.\n  As a young law student in the early 1980s at the University of \nKansas, I can remember studying constitutional law and other areas \nwhere his opinions came forth. Frequently, in those days he was in the \nminority opinion role.\n  Many of my law school professors would say: Can you believe what this \nguy wrote? I remember reading his opinions and thinking his opinion \nseemed very logical. It seems to me, he believed in holding with the \ngreat traditions of being a nation of the rule of law, not the rule of \nman. The Constitution is a textural document. Chief Justice Rehnquist \nhad a big impact on me in his writings and what he believed we stood \nfor as a nation. He has had a big impact on this Nation, and he will be \nsorely missed.\n  He was genteel in all of his dealings. Even when he presided in the \nSenate over the impeachment trial for President Clinton, he did so in a \nvery stately, gentle fashion. Just his presence was one of a man at \npeace with himself, who knew what he was about, and knew his role and \nhis duty. He fulfilled his duty to the best of his abilities as Chief \nJustice, Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, as presiding over an \nimpeachment trial, and working with clerks.\n  I think one of most telling things for an individual is what the \npeople say that worked for you, and particularly those who worked for \nyou perhaps in a lower capacity. It seems uniform that the clerks for \nChief Justice Rehnquist admired the man while they worked for him. It \nis a tribute to him how well they worked together and how he helped \nform them. There is a great symmetry about this in John Roberts being \nnominated now, as a former clerk of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and now \nnominated to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by his former \nboss. John Roberts is an outstanding nomination to the Chief Justice \nposition. I hope we can move forward with in an expeditious fashion, \ncertainly thorough, but in an expeditious fashion.\n  That is not what we are here today to talk about. Today it is to talk \nabout and to reflect upon an amazing American in William Rehnquist. He \ngrew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, WI. His father was the son of \nSwedish immigrant parents, worked as a paper salesman. His mother was a \nmultilingual professional translator. Shortly after graduation from \nhigh school, Chief Justice Rehnquist enlisted in the Air Force and \nduring World War II served as a weather observer in North Africa. On \ncompletion of his service in the Air Force, the Chief Justice began his \nundergraduate work at Stanford University. Yes, he did it on the GI \nbill.\n  In 1952, Rehnquist graduated first in his class from Stanford Law \nSchool, certainly a monumental accomplishment, an accomplishment of \ngreat discipline. Following law school, he clerked for former Supreme \nCourt Justice Robert Jackson. In 1953, he began work at a law firm in \nPhoenix, and his brilliance was noted by the Nixon Deputy Attorney \nGeneral at that time,\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\nRichard Kleindienst. On October 22, 1971 President Richard Nixon, \nnominated him to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. He \nwas confirmed less than 2 months later, which would be record speed for \nthis body by today's standard.\n  During his time on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist has \ndefended the original text of the Constitution. To a number of people \nthat may seem like a simple task. After all, it is the Constitution. It \nis the basic law of the land. What is there to defend? The law speaks \nfor itself. It is a set of plain words on a clear document that has \nsuch a significant historical place in our hearts and minds. Yet he \ncomes along on a Court at a point in time when a number of people are \nsaying: It is a living document, it can move with the culture, and we \ncan interpret the words more broadly. We can interpret it not by what \nit says, but by what we would like it to say.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist fought against that and fought for the \noriginal text of the Constitution and said it is as it is. This is a \ntextural document. If we want to change it, that is fine, but it is \nchanged by two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate and \nthree-fourths of the States, not by five people on the Court. Those are \nnot his words, but they are the principles he stood for.\n  The role of a Justice on the Supreme Court is to look at the plain \nmeaning and the original text of the Constitution, not at your own \ncultural bias of the moment and what you believe America may need and \ntherefore may be willing to move to.\n  The problem with a living document is that you don't have the rule of \nlaw. You are more of a rule of man. So he defended this proposition of \nthe original text of the Constitution, the intent of the Framers.\n  Certainly, he was a promoter of life. It was in the 1973 dissent in \nRoe v. Wade that then-Associate Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``To reach its \nresult, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the \nFourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to \nthe drafters of the Amendment.''\n  These are the Associate Justice Rehnquist's words. In his early years \nof lonely dissents in cases like Roe, Rehnquist made his mark by \nstanding for constitutional principle over the political preferences of \nan unelected judiciary. With the retirement of Chief Justice Warren \nBurger in 1986, President Reagan then elevated Associate Justice \nRehnquist to the Court's top post, where he served with distinction \nuntil his death.\n  The last 19 years have shown that Chief Justice Rehnquist was a \nterrific choice to lead the Supreme Court. He authored countless \nlandmark decisions and thought-provoking dissents. In carefully \nreasoned opinions, he insisted that the principle of federalism is an \nintegral part of our nation's constitutional structure. He recognized \nthat our Government is one of enumerated rights and dual sovereignty, \nwith certain functions and powers properly left to the States.\n  One example of Chief Justice Rehnquist's commitment to the laws is \nhis opinion in Dickerson v. United States. Although a long-time critic \nof Miranda v. Arizona, Rehnquist nevertheless placed his past position \naside and wrote the opinion in Dickerson, effectively affirming the \nholding of Miranda. He served well. He served nobly, and he served with \ncourage. I might note that even during his recent sickness, he found \nthe strength to do his duty and to serve in office. He found the \nstrength to administer the oath of office to President Bush, to \nconsider the challenging cases that came before the Court.\n  Peggy Noonan wrote of President Bush's inauguration, ``the most \npoignant moment was the manful William Rehnquist, unable to wear a tie \nand making his way down the long marble steps to swear in the \npresident. The continuation of democracy is made possible by such \ngallantry.''\n  While some of his colleagues on the Court disagreed with him at \ntimes, there will there can be no doubt that they admired his strong \nleadership, his likable personality, and his ability to build \nconsensus. That is the noteworthy quality of a gentleman. He served \nwith distinction. He served us well. He carried his course out, and he \nis now at rest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9714-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9714-S9715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECONCILIATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the proposal \nthat a number of us have made--Leader Reid in the Senate, myself, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Leader Pelosi in the House, \nCongressman Spratt, the ranking member of the Budget Committee--to put \noff the reconciliation proposals that flow from the budget resolution.\n  We have just been hit by perhaps the greatest natural calamity in our \nNation's history. We don't know yet how it will rank, but there is \ncertainly a possibility this will be one of the greatest calamities in \nour Nation's history. And that is the reason we sent the letter this \nmorning to Majority Leader Frist and Speaker Hastert, as well as the \nchairmen of the Budget Committees in both the House and the Senate \nrecommending that we suspend those reconciliation instructions that are \npart of the budget resolution.\n  We did that because we don't think what was written then fits the \nfacts now. We have just had a massive disaster. It makes no sense to \npursue the priorities that were part of that budget resolution.\n  This is not a time to be cutting services to the most needy among us. \nThis is not the time to cut food stamps, to cut medical care for the \nindigent, to cut student loans. That is what is in the reconciliation \nprocess. Are we really going to cut Medicaid $10 billion when we have \nhundreds of thousands of people homeless and don't have medical care \nand don't have a home? Are we really going to cut Medicaid in that \ncontext? Are we really going to cut food stamps when there are tens of \nthousands of people displaced, hundreds of thousands of people have had \nto leave their homes, and we are going to cut services for the most \nneedy and, at the same time, cut taxes for the most fortunate among us?\n  Frankly, I did not think the budget resolution made much sense when \nwe passed it. The budget resolution's reconciliation instructions cut \nspending $35 billion and cut taxes $70 billion, so it increased the \ndeficit, on balance, $35 billion when we are facing massive budget \nshortfalls--among the biggest in our history.\n  In fact, the budget that was passed here will increase the debt of \nthe country every year by $600 billion. That is stunning. It is going \nto increase the debt $600 billion. That is before Katrina. Now are we \nreally going to continue down that path? Are we going to continue down \na path that says on an emergency basis cut services to the least among \nus, cut taxes for the wealthiest among us, and run up the debt even \nmore? What sense does this make?\n  It makes no sense to consider those legislative proposals in light of \nthis new reality. It seems to me very clear none of us can know yet the \ncost to the Federal budget of the response to Hurricane Katrina. We \nshould not be rushing through a further reduction in resources the \nFederal Government has available to respond to our Nation's challenges.\n  Katrina is a body blow of stunning proportion. We already passed $10 \nbillion of aid, which we obviously should have done. We are told that \nwe are going to be asked to immediately consider another $51 billion of \naid, which clearly we should do. But that is just the beginning.\n  I have been told that the cost of this disaster to the Federal \nGovernment may well reach $150 billion. So for us to go forward with a \nbudget plan that was written before this catastrophe, and for some to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say, Steady as she goes, just keep \non with that plan, does not make a whole lot of sense.\n  We have just seen a dramatic disaster, a catastrophic disaster. You \ndon't stick with the same old plan when something of this consequence \noccurs. We have to respond, and we do not just respond by doing what we \nwere getting ready to do when we faced a totally different set of \nfacts. Frankly, I don't think it made much sense before this disaster. \nIt makes absolutely no sense after this disaster.\n  Again, let me say to my colleagues, are we really going to cut \nMedicaid\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\nwhen we have hundreds of thousands of people displaced? Are we really \ngoing to cut student loans when we have a whole group of colleges that \nhave been wiped out? Are we really going to cut food stamps when every \nnight we can see on television what is happening to people who have \nlost everything? Are we going to say to them, Sorry, there is no help \nfor you because we had a plan, a reconciliation plan up in Washington, \nand we had to stick to it? Is that really going to be the answer? I \nhope not because the facts have changed. The facts have changed, and \nthe facts require that we change. The facts require that the plan \nchanges, and the facts require we have a new plan and a new approach.\n  I submit to my colleagues this is not the time to cut assistance for \nthose who are the least among us and to cut taxes for those who are the \nwealthiest among us. This is a time for all of us to come together as a \nnation and respond to this disaster with a generous heart. That is my \nbelief of what is required of us at this moment. That is the moral \nimperative at this moment--to respond to this disaster, to help those \nin need, to assist in the rebuilding, to help the sick, to feed the \nhungry. Goodness knows, we can see on our television screens every \nmoment of every day that there are tens of thousands of our fellow \ncitizens who deserve a helping hand. The notion that we just go forward \nwith the plan as written makes absolutely no sense.\n  Here are the images. We can all see them. Here are the homes \nflooded--an absolute unmitigated disaster.\n  I have been asked by the news media about an incident that occurred \nin 2002 before the Senate Budget Committee. I want a chance to review \nthat for the record. I have been asked repeatedly about a series of \nquestions that I asked in 2002 of Mr. Parker.\n  I asked a question in a Budget Committee hearing on February 26, \n2002, of one of the witnesses, Mr. Mike Parker, the Assistant Secretary \nof the Army for Civil Works. He said at that hearing:\n\n       If the corps is limited in what it does for the American \n     people, we will see a negative impact on the people of this \n     country.\n\n  He was talking in testimony that he provided the Budget Committee and \nin response to a series of questions that I asked him.\n  Here is how that conversation went. Assistant Secretary Parker said: \n``That figure we came up with was around $6.4 billion [for Army Corps \nfunding] . . .''\n  I asked him:\n\n       That is what you requested?\n       Assistant Secretary Parker: Yes.\n\n  My question back to him:\n\n       $6.4 billion?\n       Assistant Secretary Parker: Right.\n       Senator Conrad: And you got, on a comparison basis, $4 \n     billion . . . Well, did you think $4 billion was the right \n     number to come to?\n       Assistant Secretary Parker: No. I would have offered that \n     number if I thought it was the right number.\n\n  In other words, what happened was I asked Assistant Secretary Parker \nif the amount of money being requested by the administration for the \nArmy Corps of Engineers was sufficient to deal with the challenges they \nwere facing. He told me, no, they were not sufficient, that they had \nestimated $6.4 billion was needed, but the administration would only \nask for $4 billion. And that is after the previous year's budget was \n$4.6 billion.\n  I also addressed questions to Lieutenant General Robert Flowers, \nChief of Engineers for the Army Corps, who came to testify with \nAssistant Secretary Parker. Here is how that conversation went.\n\n       Let me ask you this. Last year, there was $4.6 billion [in \n     Army Corps funding]. The President cut that by $600 million \n     on a fair comparison basis to $4 billion. What are the \n     implications of those reductions? What will it mean? . . .\n\n  LTG Robert Flowers said:\n\n       With the budget as it stands, we would in fact have to \n     terminate projects . . .\n       Senator Conrad: So you would have no choice but to \n     terminate contracts?\n       Lieutenant General Flowers: Yes, sir. That's correct . . .\n       Senator Conrad: It doesn't sound like it makes much sense \n     to me. Does it make much sense to you, General Flowers, \n     knowing what those projects are? Would it make any sense to \n     you to terminate these projects?\n       Lieutenant General Flowers: Sir, it doesn't.\n\n  Lieutenant General Flowers went on to say:\n\n     . . . I would submit that in combating the war on terrorism \n     and providing homeland security, the work we do in \n     maintaining strategic ports is very vital to the military \n     effort as well as the economy, because 98 percent of our \n     foreign commerce is seaborne.\n\n  My rejoinder:\n\n     . . . So this has got a security issue attached to it.\n\n  Lieutenant General Flowers:\n\n       Sir, I believe it does. We have traditionally, in the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers, I think, contributed to the national \n     defense.\n\n  What happened in these exchanges is very clear. I asked Mr. Parker, \nthe civilian head of the Corps of Engineers, if he was asking for \nenough money. He said he was not. He said the administration had sent \nup a request for $4 billion. He determined what was needed was $6.4 \nbillion, but the administration would not allow him to make that \nrequest.\n  Because of that testimony, Mr. Parker was then fired by the \nadministration. He lost his job.\n  Senator Trent Lott said:\n\n       ``Mike Parker told the truth that the Corps of Engineers \n     budget, as proposed, is insufficient,'' said Senate Minority \n     Leader Trent Lott.\n\n  Newspaper headlines on the firing of the Army Corps Chief in 2002 ran \nthe gamut from the New York Times that said:\n\n       Official Forced to Step Down after Testifying on Budget \n     Cut.\n\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       Corps of Engineers' Civilian Chief Ousted; Parker Resigns \n     after Openly Questioning Bush's Proposed Spending Cuts.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Head of Corps of Engineers is Forced Out after Criticizing \n     Budget Cuts for Agency.\n\n  The Sun Herald of Biloxi, MS:\n\n       Parker Let Go as Army Corps Chief; Honesty Got Him Fired, \n     Some Say.\n\n  The fact is, the funding for the Corps of Engineers was deficient to \ndo the job necessary to protect New Orleans and other cities. It was \nclear at the time. It was testified to by the man who was the head of \nthe Agency, and because he was honest and forthright in questions that \nI put to him, he was removed from his job.\n  That is the factual history of what occurred. And those who removed \nhim because he was honest and forthright about the needs bear serious \nresponsibility, I believe, for what has occurred.\n  All of us now have a special responsibility to reach out and assist \nthose who have been devastated. It should never have happened. None of \nus can know if these funds had been forthcoming at the time that they \nwere clearly needed, and that need was made clear by an appointee of \nthis administration, who was then removed from his position because he \nsaid the funding was inadequate.\n  This calamity requires a response, and the notion that we stick with \nthe plan I do not think will withstand much scrutiny. We are going to \nhave to have a new plan, and as part of that plan we should not be \ncutting the least fortunate among us. We should not be cutting food \nstamps. We should not be cutting the other life lines, whether it is \nmedical assistance or any of the other programs that are now in place \nto assist these people who have been so badly hurt.\n  I do not believe it makes any sense at this moment to cut the \nresources of the Federal Government when we already cannot come close \nto paying our bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to reach out to my \ncolleagues in the Gulf States and to all of the residents of Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Mississippi. The devastation and destruction experienced \nby Florida's neighbors is like nothing this country has ever \nexperienced from a natural disaster.\n  The great State of Florida has had its own recent struggles to \nrecover not only from the four hurricanes we experienced last year but \nfrom two already this year, Dennis, which hit Florida's panhandle, and \nKatrina, which first made landfall in Miami and Dade County before \nmaking its way over the Gulf of Mexico to continue on its path of \ndestruction. As Floridians, we all know well the pain and destruction \nwrought by hurricanes, and we feel a special kinship for our brothers \nand sisters in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. We have a great \nsense of duty to help\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nour neighbors through this difficult time, just as they so selflessly \nhelped us during our time of need last year.\n  We, as a nation, have all begun to appreciate how fragile our very \nexistence is in the face of this incredible force of nature. The loss \nof life and the scope of the destruction are beyond our capacity to \nunderstand. The feeling of isolation, despair, desolation experienced \nby those in the wake of a storm, and their families, is beyond \nconsolation.\n  Having only too recently been the recipient of our own neighbors' \ngood will, comfort, and support in the wake of our own struggles, \nFloridians stand ready to respond in kind. Today the news reports that \nover 25,000 evacuees are expected in central Florida, bringing it close \nto the point of strain on the local resources because of that kind of \nactivity. Thousands of Floridians are already helping. More are asking \nhow they can help. Citizens have contributed to numerous nonprofit \ngroups that in turn are sending truckloads of supplies to hurricane-\ndamaged areas.\n  Our National Guard troops are now stationed in Mississippi, \nLouisiana, and Alabama, providing much needed manpower to the ongoing \nrecovery efforts. Our law enforcement and fire department personnel \nhave sacrificed time with their families so they can be in Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Mississippi providing emergency aid and security. Church \ngroups have offered temporary housing, and schools in Florida have \noffered to take students displaced by the disaster.\n  I am proud of the way Floridians and all Americans have reached out \nin this great time of need for our country. We will continue to help \nour neighbors, continue to keep them in our prayers, and continue to \nmourn the loss of so many of our fellow Americans through such a \npowerful natural disaster.\n  While we certainly cannot avert our eyes and attention from the human \nsuffering, we must also recognize the tremendous outpouring of love, \nsupport, and compassion directed to those who have lost so much. The \nAmerican spirit of unity and survival is reflected in the response to \nthe American Red Cross, the Office of Housing and Employment for the \nDisplaced, the offer of neighboring public universities to accept \nstudents from Louisiana to avoid interruption in their education. These \nall serve to remind us that for all our differences, we are all one \npeople, and we will take care of our own.\n\n  Many have raised legitimate concerns about the level of our \npreparedness as a nation for the disaster, but now is not the time for \nrecrimination. The time for examination and for determining lessons \nlearned will soon come, but for now we must not be distracted from the \nmission of delivering aid and comfort to those who so desperately are \nin need and we must begin the process of rebuilding.\n  The rise of rhetoric will not empty the flood waters, provide relief \nto the living, bury the dead or rebuild our cities. Together we can \nbegin to restore hope to those where hope has been lost. Together we \nmust move forward in good faith as one nation.\n  As we look to the future, we have a responsibility to examine our \ndisaster readiness at every level of Government. When lives are at \nstake, there is no room for territorial or jurisdictional turf wars. We \nmust make certain no lives are lost that might otherwise be saved with \nproper planning, training, and cooperation among Government agencies at \nevery level. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nCongress to be certain that that goal is achieved.\n  Our country has been through very challenging times. We have suffered \nthrough terrorist attacks on our homeland, wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, and most recently Hurricane Katrina and surging oil prices. Yet \nthrough all of this, the American people have moved forward with \noptimism and determination. It is our way.

Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not take a \nmoment to say what a great loss our country has experienced with the \npassing of our Chief Justice William Rehnquist. William Rehnquist was a \nman of deep integrity and honor, a true public servant. He served our \ncountry well, always keeping an eye toward tradition and working to \nbring constitutional reason to the complex questions of our nation. Our \ncountry is better for the guiding hand he placed on the Court. His \nresolute spirit will be missed.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist's leadership brought the Court through three \ndecades of very tumultuous times. September 17 of this year would mark \nthe 29th year of his tenure as Chief Justice. This term exceeds that of \nevery other Chief Justice in our nation's history, with the exception \nof Chief Justice John Marshall, who served for 34 years.\n  He led the judiciary with resolve and a steady hand. He will be \ngreatly missed by his family, his colleagues, the Court, and by a \ngrateful nation.\n  As we turn our attention in the coming weeks to the confirmation \nprocess to consider the President's nominee to serve as the next Chief \nJustice, it would be appropriate to pause and reflect on the service to \nour country provided by this man of exceptional intellect who served \nhis Nation long and faithfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, in expressing my personal \ncondolences and those of my fellow Minnesotans to the family and \nfriends of the former Chief Justice, and I share the sentiments in \nregard to his distinguished service to our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9716-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9716-S9717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HURRICANE KATRINA AND SOARING GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I also want to join with others of my \ncolleagues today who have expressed the concerns, condolences, and \nsympathies to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, which has so horribly \nclaimed so many of our fellow Americans' lives, families and friends, \nhomes, businesses, farms, schools, and entire communities that are the \nworst victims of this unprecedented disaster. Our hearts go out to all \nof them. Our helping hands are being extended and must continue to be \nextended to them.\n  There are millions of other victims of this disaster, Americans \nnationwide whose economic well-being has been harmed by price increases \nand supply or service disruptions.\n  In my State of Minnesota, probably the worst economic damage and \nfinancial hardships have been caused by the skyrocketing prices for \ngasoline and other essential energy supplies. Even before Hurricane \nKatrina, those prices had been increasing sharply. In the 3 months from \nMay 28 to August 28 of this year, the average price of regular unleaded \ngasoline throughout Minnesota has risen from $1.92 a gallon to $2.55 a \ngallon. That is an increase of 63 cents a gallon, a one-third increase \nin just 3 months.\n  Then, in 3 days last week, from August 29 to September 1, the average \ngasoline prices in Minnesota jumped another 46 cents a gallon, \naccording to one Web site that has spot check reports from throughout \nthe State. So in 3 months and 3 days, the average gasoline prices, \naccording to this Web site, in Minnesota, jumped from $1.92 a gallon to \n$3.01 a gallon, a 57-percent increase. That is not as bad as some other \nparts of the country, but it is sure worse than bad enough for \nMinnesota.\n  I know from direct personal experience driving around northern \nMinnesota last week that actual prices were much higher, as high as \n$3.46 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, which was up almost $1 a \ngallon from 2 weeks before. Unfortunately, that up-to-date, accurate \ninformation is not available from the Energy Information Administration \nWeb site, and that is one of the defects that needs to be remedied.\n  Most of Minnesota's oil and gasoline supplies originate from Canada, \ncome in either by gasoline or oil pipelines and then refined within our \nState. So almost all of our price increases for gasoline and other \nenergy products were not directly the result of Katrina's supply \ndisruptions. Rather, they were the result of other people taking \nadvantage of that disaster to take advantage of the people of \nMinnesota.\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\n  Last week, President Bush called it ``price gouging at the gasoline \npump,'' and I agree with the President. President Bush also said that \nthere should be zero tolerance for gasoline price gouging, similar to \nlooting in New Orleans, and I agree with the President on that as well \nbecause price gouging has the same effect as looting or other kinds of \nstealing. It is robbing the people of Minnesota and elsewhere \nthroughout this country by overcharging them for their essential energy \nneeds.\n  Given the similarity of the gasoline price increases throughout \nMinnesota, I think there is a strong possibility of pricing collusion \nby the major oil suppliers and distributors that demands immediate \ninvestigation and, where called for, vigorous prosecution of violators. \nWhat they have done is not only immoral, it is also illegal under \nFederal law.\n  I have written the United States Attorney General and urged him to \nback up the President's strong words with his strong immediate action \nto investigate all indications of price gouging and/or pricing \ncollusion of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, farm fertilizers, \nnatural gas, liquid petroleum gas, home heating oil, ethanol, and any \nand all other oil supplies.\n  At this time, I urge the President to release whatever supplies are \nnecessary from our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to offset the \nloss of oil, gasoline, and other energy supplies resulting from \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Last night, the Secretary of Energy told a number of us in the \nSenate, in a briefing, that gasoline prices have been stabilized. Well, \nwith due respect, Mr. Secretary, I must say they have been stabilized \nfar too high in Minnesota, if, in fact, they have been stabilized at \nall. Thus, whatever has been done so far is not enough. Gasoline prices \nare still unaffordably too high in Minnesota. Other energy prices are \nstill unaffordably too high, and with the cold weather heating season \nsoon upon Minnesotans and other Americans in the United States, it is \nimperative to act now and keep on doing whatever is necessary to get \nenergy prices back down to pre-Katrina levels--which were still too \nhigh--and then deal with that continuing energy price crisis in \nMinnesota and other affected States and continue to do whatever is \nnecessary to get those lower prices.\n\n  In the immediate term, we need to strive for lower energy prices, and \nwe need executive action to prosecute price gouging, price collusion. \nWe also, then, need, as a body of Congress, to do whatever is necessary \nto strengthen Federal legislation to prohibit and prevent this kind of \neconomic looting of our fellow citizens.\n  A couple of my colleagues have announced, just in the last 2 days, \ntheir intentions to introduce legislation. Senator Dorgan of North \nDakota intends to offer windfall profits tax legislation on U.S. oil \ncompanies and other energy suppliers. Senator Cantwell of Washington \nhas indicated her intention to offer legislation that would give the \nPresident additional powers to mitigate price increases in times of \ncrisis.\n  I intend to introduce in the next 2 days, as soon as it is complete, \nlegislation that would prevent and prosecute price gouging in energy \nand other essential commodities. In a nutshell, this legislation would \nmake it illegal in any emergency situation to take advantage of \nconsumers by raising energy prices or other essential commodity prices. \nIt would give the U.S. Attorney General further authority to prosecute \nretail gasoline stations, oil companies, distributors--whoever is found \nto be in violation of this provision. It would require the Energy \nInformation Administration to provide current prices for major \nmetropolitan areas for every State and for our entire Nation on a daily \nbasis so that we can evaluate those price increases so that citizens \ncan know, in perspective, what they are being charged and how it \ncompares with other parts of the country. They can then be our eyes and \nears to report evidence of these rising prices that constitute price \ngouging, as the President said, at the gasoline pump.\n  We have witnessed once again, in the midst of this disaster affecting \nSouthern United States, that such disasters bring out both the best and \nthe worst of human nature. They bring out the best, as we have seen the \ncourageous men and women of the National Guard, the medical personnel, \nand many others who are literally risking their own lives to save the \nlives of others. We have seen the best of human nature in the response \nof millions of Americans from all over the country who have contributed \nwhatever they can and are offering to do more to alleviate this \nsuffering.\n  Here in the Senate last week, and also in the House, we provided an \nadditional $10.5 billion the President requested to continue emergency \noperations. All of us, including those at a meeting last night with a \nnumber of the Cabinet Secretaries, were asking the administration, What \ndo you need us to do? Money? Authorizing legislation? Streamlining \nexisting legislation? Tell us what we need to do in the Senate and \nHouse to expedite in the best possible ways the relief effort that must \ncontinue for months ahead.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic disaster or Republican or \nDemocratic response. It is an American disaster, and it is a response \nof all of us as Americans to our fellow citizens in need.\n  Unfortunately, there is another side to human nature, and that is \nwhat we must also address. It cannot be allowed. It certainly cannot be \nrewarded with profits to those who take advantage of the despair of \ntheir fellow citizens. Some cannot be allowed to cause even further \neconomic hardship, even devastation, especially to those who can least \nafford the prices of energy essentials and other necessities of life. \nThat is where our fellow citizens look to us to stand up on their \nbehalf to prevent, prosecute, and to prohibit this kind of economic \nlooting that the President called price gouging.\n  I support his statement. I urge the U.S. Attorney General to put \naction behind those words, and then I urge my colleagues to join with \nme in passing legislation to prohibit and prevent this from happening \nagain and to prosecute those who are responsible for it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the pleasures I have as a Member of \nCongress, having served in the House and the Senate, is having the \nopportunity to meet people who are special, unique. During the time \nthat I have had in Congress to meet some of these individuals, I have \nin my own frame of reference chosen a number of heroes. One of those \nheroes is a Congressman from the Fifth District of Georgia by the name \nof John Lewis.\n  At home last night, I read Newsweek magazine. I saw an opinion piece \nwritten by my hero, John Lewis. This appeared on page 52 of this week's \nNewsweek magazine, entitled ``Opinion: A Civil-rights Leader Mourns an \nAfrican-American Population Left Behind.''\n  I will read what John Lewis said:\n\n       I was headed to New Orleans as a Freedom Rider in May of \n     1961. It would've been my first visit, but we were arrested \n     in Jackson, Miss., and never made it. In happier times, \n     though, I have been able to visit New Orleans over the years. \n     It's one of my favorite cities, one of the great Southern \n     cities. The people are friendly, warm, helpful. In the old \n     part of the city, there's so much history when you walk down \n     Canal Street or Royal. One of my favorite places is a shop on \n     Royal where they have lots of art posters by African-American \n     artists. After Katrina, there's a loss of the music, the \n     restaurants and the character in addition to the unbelievable \n     loss of lives. Maybe we will never know the number of people \n     who have been lost.\n       It's very painful for me to watch and read about what is \n     happening. I have a sense of righteous indignation. I think \n     all Americans should rise up and speak out. It's not like 9/\n     11 that just happened. We saw this in the making. The media \n     told us for days this storm was coming and for years people \n     have been telling us we need to do something to prepare. It \n     took us so many days to make the full force of the government \n     available afterwards.\n       In 1957, during the crisis in Little Rock and President \n     Dwight Eisenhower--maybe he was reluctant, maybe he had some \n     reservations--but he put the full force of the government \n     behind the decision to desegregate Central High. During the \n     Freedom Rides, President\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\n     John Kennedy didn't hesitate to federalize the National Guard \n     and put the whole city of Montgomery under martial law. It's \n     baffling to me that we didn't have the ability or the will to \n     do something much earlier. We still haven't had the \n     passionate statement that should be made by officials in this \n     administration.\n       It's so glaring that the great majority of people crying \n     out for help are poor, they're black. There's a whole segment \n     of society that's being left behind. When you tell people to \n     evacuate, these people didn't have any way to leave. They \n     didn't have any cars, any SUVs.\n       It's so strange that when we have something like this \n     happening, the president gets two ex-presidents--his father \n     and Bill Clinton--to raise money. What they propose to do is \n     good and I appreciate all the work the private sector and the \n     faith-based community are doing. But when we get ready to go \n     to war, we don't go around soliciting resources with a bucket \n     or an offering plate. We have the courage to come before \n     Congress and debate the issue, authorize money. That's what \n     we need to do here. By next year we'll have spent $400 to 500 \n     billion in Afghanistan and Iraq. That money could be used to \n     help rebuild the lives of people. If we fail to act as a \n     nation, I don't think history will be kind to us.\n       We've got to do more than the $10 billion that Congress \n     appropriated. We need a massive Marshall-type plan to rebuild \n     New Orleans. But in rebuilding we should see this as an \n     opportunity to rebuild urban America. New Orleans could be a \n     model. There must be a commitment of billions and billions of \n     dollars--maybe $50 to 100 billion. I think even in other \n     urban centers, there are people who are just barely existing. \n     We sing the song ``hope is on the way,'' but it's taking a \n     long time before hope arrives. It becomes very discouraging \n     where you see people dying--children, the elderly, the sick--\n     the lack of food and water. I've cried a lot of tears the \n     past few days as I watched television--to see some body lying \n     dead outside the convention center. I went to Somalia in 1992 \n     and I saw little babies dying before my eyes. This reminded \n     me of Somalia. But this is America. We're not a third-world \n     country. This is an embarrassment. It's a shame. It's a \n     national disgrace.\n       John Lewis is the U.S. Congressman from the 5th District of \n     Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Among his many accomplishments, Coach Mattio has \nseen hundreds of his players go on to play football in college and \nthree go on to the National Football League.\n  Coach Mattio has led the Marian Catholic Spartans to a state \nchampionship and a Chicagoland Prep Bowl championship. He has also \nshown consistency, with teams qualifying for the playoffs 16 times and \ncompiling winning records 26 of the last 29 seasons.\n  Coach Mattio's successes have been recognized many times by his \npeers. He was inducted into the Illinois High School Football Coaches \nAssociation Hall of Fame in 1997 as well as the Marian Catholic Alumni \nAssociation Hall of Fame in 1994. He was also named the Frank Leahy \nPrep Coach of the Year in 1994.\n  I congratulate Dave Mattio on his accomplishments as head coach of \nthe Marian Catholic Spartans and wish him many more years of happiness \nand accomplishment, both on and off the football field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9718-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise to speak of Chechnya, a remote part \nof the world where horrific crimes and suffering are occurring every \nday, that has faded from the newspapers and the minds of many of us \nhere.\n  Contrary to the myth perpetrated by the Russian Government that the \nconflict is over and life in Chechnya is returning to normal, the \nRussian military and the militias they support continue to use brutal, \neven barbaric tactics, including extra-judicial executions, arbitrary \ndetention, kidnappings, rape, and torture. Armed opposition forces are \nalso terrifying innocent civilians with their indiscriminate attacks. \nThere seems to be no end to this conflict or to the suffering of the \nChechen people.\n  The Bush administration has been conspicuously silent about what is \nhappening. One can only hope that President Bush has expressed alarm \nabout the atrocities being committed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya in \nhis meetings or conversations with President Putin, but there is no \nindication that if he has it has had any effect.\n  There is certainly no evidence that the administration has exerted \nany real pressure on President Putin to reign in the Russian military, \npresumably because it does not want to jeopardize Russia's support for \nU.S. operations in Iraq and combating international terrorism. But \ncontrary to what the Russian Government and some in the Bush \nadministration insist, the violence in Chechnya has far more to do with \nself-determination than with international terrorism. While acts of \nterrorism by all parties to the conflict remain common, most Chechen \nresistance fighters have taken up arms to seek revenge for the \natrocities and impunity of Russian soldiers.\n  In each of the last 6 years, the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nAct has included a provision to withhold a portion of our assistance to \nthe Russian Government unless the President certifies that \ninternational nongovernmental humanitarian organizations are provided \nfull access to Chechnya. Every year, the Russian Government fails to \ncomply.\n  In the Senate-passed version of the fiscal year 2006 Foreign \nOperations bill, we included $5 million for humanitarian, conflict \nmitigation, relief and recovery assistance for Chechnya, Ingushetia, \nand elsewhere in the North Caucasus region. This funding, in addition \nto the $5 million for this purpose in the fiscal year 2005 \nsupplemental, will provide much needed relief and development \nassistance for civilians caught in the midst of this conflict.\n  But it is essential that this assistance be coupled with a strong \nmessage of concern and condemnation by the administration. The message \nshould be loud and clear that war crimes by the Russian military, and \nby resistance fighters, must stop.\n  It is obvious that despite President Putin's rosy portrayal of the \nsituation, there is no military solution to the Chechnyan conflict. The \nonly hope for resolving it is through a process of demilitarization and \npolitical dialogue, and I suspect that will require the active and \nsustained participation of a credible third party, such as the United \nNations. This is what the United States should be pressing for. It is \nlong past time for the White House to stop giving the Russian \nGovernment a free pass on Chechnya.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9719-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n      THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSIONS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. Cornyn Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of \nthe Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Act of 2005. I want to \nthank Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy and the other cosponsors \nfor working on this legislation in an expedited fashion to respond to \nthe unprecedented challenges facing the judiciary in Louisiana and \nMississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n  We have all witnessed over the past week the heart wrenching agony of \nthose affected and displaced by Hurricane Katrina. An entire city has \nbeen devastated and will face an uphill battle to repair and replace \nthe homes, buildings, and commerce that are so vital to New Orleans. \nAreas in Mississippi face similar challenges. I join all Americans in \nkeeping those affected by this tragedy in our thoughts and prayers \nduring these difficult times.\n  In times like these, the generosity of ordinary Americans emerges and \nshines bright. Once everyday working men and women learned of the \nplight of their Louisiana neighbors they set their lives on hold and \ncommitted themselves to helping those who are less fortunate. I have \nheard reports of citizens and churches from across the country \norganizing fundraising drives, collecting basic necessities for \nevacuees, and even renting U-Haul trucks to deliver those supplies to \nthe needy.\n  I am especially proud of my friends and fellow citizens from Texas. \nTexas has opened its arms, as my State is known to do, and has taken in \nas many evacuees as it can handle. The Astrodome has virtually become a \nsatellite city of New Orleans evacuees. Additionally, Texas residents \nhave opened their homes to take in evacuees to provide some semblance \nof a normal life during their displacement.\n  Congress too will have responsibility. Last week the Congress passed \nan emergency relief bill to provide some immediate assistance to the \narea. And today, with this bill, the Congress continues to identify \ndiscreet, but critical areas, that are affected by the hurricane. And \none of the areas that needs to be addressed is how the judiciary, from \nthe prestigious Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to the Federal district \ncourts, bankruptcy courts and magistrate courts will function during \nthis difficult time.\n  Our democracy depends on a functioning judiciary. The dedication of \nthe men and women of the judiciary--from the trial courts to the \nappellate courts--who daily preside over important and difficult issues \nis essential to our democracy. Current law requires Federal courts to \nconduct business in a few select locations. This legislation makes sure \nthat a Federal court, unable to hold proceedings in its normal location \nbecause of emergency circumstances, may hold court in another area.\n  It is important that as the rebuilding begins in New Orleans and \nother affected areas that our judicial system be open to anyone who may \nneed its assistance. This legislation makes sure that the doors to the \ncourthouse remain open even during catastrophic events.\n  I hope that the Senate and the House pass this legislation \nimmediately and send it to the President as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9719-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9719-S9721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Finally, the bill would extend, terminate, or \n     modify existing authorizations for various water projects and \n     would authorize new programs to develop water resources and \n     protect the environment.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, including \n     adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 728 would cost about $4.1 \n     billion over the 2006-2010 period and an additional $7.6 \n     billion over the 10 years after 2010. (Some construction \n     costs and operations and maintenance would continue or occur \n     after this period.)\n       S. 728 would allow the Corps to spend any proceeds that it \n     collects from grazing fees, shoreline management permit fees, \n     municipal and industrial water supply fees, recreational \n     fees, and leases. In addition, the bill would allow the \n     Federal Government's power marketing administrations (PMAs) \n     to use proceeds from power sales to fund Corps expenses \n     related to hydropower. S. 728 also would convey parcels of \n     land to various nonFederal entities and would forgive the \n     obligation of some local government agencies to pay certain \n     project costs. Finally, the bill would allow the Corps to \n     collect and spend fees collected for training courses and \n     permit processing. CBO estimates that enacting those \n     provisions would increase direct spending by $212 million in \n     2006, $1.1 billion over the 2006-2010 period, and $2.3 \n     billion over the 2006-2015 period. Pursuant to section 407 of \n     H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, \n     Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates that enacting S. 728 would \n     cause an increase in direct spending greater than $5 billion \n     in the 10-year period beginning in 2046. Enacting the bill \n     would not affect revenues.\n       S. 728 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water \n     resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would \n     benefit State, local, and tribal governments, and any costs \n     to those governments to comply with the conditions of this \n     Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily. The bill \n     also would benefit those governments by authorizing \n     additional funds or reducing matching requirements for some \n     specific projects.\n     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 728 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget functions 300 (natural resources and the environment) \n     and 270 (energy).\n\n                                         TABLE 1.

This bill also would modify many existing Corps \n     projects and programs by increasing the amounts authorized to \n     be appropriated to construct or maintain them or by \n     increasing the Federal share of project costs. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary funds, CEO estimates that \n     implementing this bill would cost $4.1 billion over the 2006-\n     2010 period and an additional $7.6 billion over the 10 years \n     after 2010. For ongoing construction costs of previously \n     authorized projects, the Corps received a 2005 appropriation \n     of about $1.8 billion, including funds from the Inland \n     Waterway Trust Fund.\n       For new water projects specified in the bill, the Corps \n     provided CBO with estimates\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\n     of annual budget authority needed to meet design and \n     construction schedules. CBO adjusted those estimates to \n     reflect the impact of anticipated inflation during the time \n     between project authorization and appropriation of \n     construction costs. Estimated outlays are based on historical \n     spending rates for Corps projects.\n       Significant New Authorizations. S. 728 would authorize the \n     Army Corps of Engineers to conduct water resource studies and \n     undertake specified projects and programs for flood control, \n     inland navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental \n     restoration. For example, the bill includes authorizations \n     for enhanced navigation improvements on the Upper Mississippi \n     River at an estimated Federal cost of $1.8 billion and an \n     ecosystem restoration project, also on the Upper \n     Mississippi River, at an estimated Federal cost of $1.6 \n     billion. Another large project authorized by this bill is \n     the Indian River Lagoon project in the Florida Everglades \n     at an estimated Federal cost of $605 million. Construction \n     of those projects would likely take more than 15 years.\n       Deauthorizations. Title VI would withdraw the authority for \n     the Corps to build 58 projects authorized in previous \n     legislation. Based on information from the Corps, however, \n     CBO does not expect that the agency would begin any work \n     (under current law) for most of those projects over the next \n     5 years. Some of those projects do not have a local sponsor \n     to pay nonFederal costs, others do not pass certain tests for \n     economic viability, and still others do not pass certain \n     tests for environmental protection. Consequently, CBO \n     estimates that canceling the authority to build those \n     projects would provide no significant savings over the next \n     several years.\n       Future Corps Appropriations for Operations and Maintenance. \n     As discussed below under ``Direct Spending,'' sections 2019 \n     and 2020 would make about $175 million a year available for \n     operations and maintenance at Corps facilities without \n     further appropriation. In fiscal year 2005, the Corps \n     received an appropriation of about $2 billion for operations \n     and maintenance costs, including funds from the Harbor \n     Maintenance Trust Fund. Enacting this bill could result in a \n     reduction in future appropriations if the Congress chose to \n     reduce total Corps spending below the level appropriated in \n     2005. In lieu of a reduction, however, the Congress could \n     choose to continue Corps funding at current levels to provide \n     funds for the backlog of the agency's maintenance needs. For \n     this estimate, CBO assumes that future Corps appropriations \n     would continue at current levels and that new spending \n     authorized by the bill would be in addition to the current \n     level of agency funding.\n\n                            Direct Spending\n\n       Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 728 would increase direct spending by about \n     $212 million in 2006 and $2.3 billion over the 2006-2015 \n     period. Table 2 presents the direct-spending components of \n     the bill. Most of the direct spending under the bill would \n     stem from provisions to allow for the spending of existing \n     power revenues associated with Corps projects for facility \n     planning, operation, maintenance, and upgrades without \n     further appropriation. Under current law, those and other \n     fees that would be made available for spending are deposited \n     (as setting receipts) to the general fund of the Treasury.\n       Improvement of Water Management at Corps of Engineers \n     Reservoirs. Section 2019 would allow the Corps to spend any \n     proceeds collected from grazing fees, shoreline management \n     permit fees, and municipal and industrial water supply fees. \n     Under the bill, the Corps could spend such funds for \n     operations and maintenance at its facilities. Based on \n     information from the agency, CBO estimates that spending of \n     such receipts would total $21 million in 2006 and 88 million \n     over the 2006-2015 period.\n       Direct Funding of Corps Operations and Maintenance for \n     Hydropower. Section 2020 would allow the Federal power \n     marketing administrations to use proceeds from the sale of \n     electricity to fund Corps expenses related to hydropower \n     functions. Based on information from the PMAs, CBO expects \n     that such direct funding would cost $142 million in 2006 \n     and $1.5 billion over the 2006-2015 period, with \n     additional costs after 2015. Currently, receipts collected \n     by the PMAs for the sale of electricity and related \n     services are deposited in the Treasury. Once such \n     expenditures are directly funded, annual appropriations \n     for the Corps could be reduced by a similar amount, or \n     those funds could be spent on other unfunded Corps \n     priorities.\n       The PMAs are required to set electricity rates at a level \n     that recoups Federal costs. Such costs include expenses \n     specific to maintaining hydropower facilities at Corps \n     projects in addition to joint costs or those allocated \n     between all functions at a project (recreation, \n     environmental, flood control, etc.). This bill would specify \n     that only costs allocated exclusively to electricity \n     production could be funded with sales revenues.\n       Recreational Areas and Project Sites. Section 2004 would \n     authorize spending of receipts from leases and fees at Corps \n     recreational areas for operations and maintenance at \n     recreation areas and project sites. Based on information from \n     the Corps, CBO estimates that enacting this section would \n     cost $41 million in 2006 and $507 million over the 2006-2015 \n     period.\n\n                                                    TABLE 2.

This section would allow \n     the Corps to spend money it collects from leases at \n     recreational areas and project sites without further \n     appropriation on operations and maintenance. Based on \n     information from the Corps, CBO estimates that enacting this \n     section would cost $8 million in 2006 and $98 million over \n     the 2006-2015 period.\n       Spending of Recreation Fees. This section would direct the \n     Corps to establish a new system of recreation fees, including \n     charges for admission to Corps recreation sites and for the \n     use of recreation facilities, visitor centers, equipment, \n     and services. Under the bill, the new fees (which would be \n     based on the value of the admission or service purchased) \n     would replace charges authorized under more restrictive, \n     existing laws. CBO estimates that, once the broader fee \n     authority that would be provided by this section has been \n     fully implemented, Corps offsetting receipts would \n     increase by $12 million a year from the current annual \n     level of about $42 million. (We expect that increases \n     would initially be less because of delays in determining \n     the market value of similar local recreation opportunities \n     and establishing appropriate fee schedules for some \n     recreation sites.) Because all amounts collected under the \n     fee system would be available to the Corps without further \n     appropriation, however, CBO estimates that enacting this \n     provision would have a net cost of $33 million in 2006 and \n     nearly $200 million over the 2006-2010 period. Over the \n     2006-2015, the total increase in net direct spending would \n     be just over $400 million.\n       Various Land Conveyances. S. 728 would authorize the Corps \n     to convey at fair market value 13 acres of land and the \n     structures on the land, including a loading dock with mooring \n     facilities, in Alabama. In addition, S. 728 would authorize \n     the conveyance at fair market value 650 acres of Federal land \n     at the Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina to the \n     State. Based on information from the Corps, CBO estimates \n     that the Federal Government would receive about $7 million in \n     2008 from those sales.\n       The bill also would convey certain Federal land in Alabama, \n     Pennsylvania, Georgia, Oregon, Kansas, and Missouri. CBO \n     estimates that those conveyances would have no significant \n     impact on the Federal budget.\n       Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma. Section 3071 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the city of Edmond, Oklahoma, to pay \n     outstanding interest due on its water storage contract with \n     the Corps. CBO estimates that this provision would result in \n     a loss of receipts of about $8 million in 2006.\n       Waurika Lake Project. Section 3073 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District \n     in\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\n     Oklahoma to pay its outstanding debt related to the \n     construction of a water conveyance project. Because of an \n     accounting error, the Corps inadvertently undercharged the \n     district for costs associated with a land purchase related to \n     the water project in the early 1980's. Under terms of the \n     construction contract, the district is required to pay all \n     costs associated with building the project, including the \n     full cost of the land purchases. CBO estimates that enacting \n     this section would cost less than $200,000 a year over the \n     2006-2015 period.\n       Funding to Process Permits. Section 2017 would make \n     permanent the Corps' current authority to accept and spend \n     funds contributed by private firms to expedite the evaluation \n     of permit applications submitted to the Corps. CBO estimates \n     that the Corps would accept and spend less than $500,000 \n     during each year of this extension and that the net budgetary \n     impact of this provision would be negligible.\n       Training Funds. Section 2003 would allow the Corps to \n     collect and spend fees collected from the private sector for \n     training courses. CBO estimates that the Corps would accept \n     and spend less than $500,000 annually and that the net \n     budgetary impact would be negligible.\n     Estimated Long-Term Direct Spending Effects\n       Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 728 would cause an increase in direct \n     spending greater than $5 billion in the 10-year period \n     beginning in 2046. That estimate assumes that the bill's \n     estimated direct spending cost of $241 million in 2015 would \n     continue to increase over the next 40 years. Specifically, \n     CBO assumes that the Corps' costs for operations and \n     maintenance at PMA projects would increase at the rate of \n     inflation projected for 2015 for this activity about 2.9 \n     percent a year. That inflator reflects a weighted average of \n     pay and nonpay components of Corps operations and maintenance \n     activities. In addition, we assume that Corps collections \n     from grazing, permit, water-use fees, and proceeds from the \n     use of recreationsites would increase more slowly, near the \n     observed historical rates of growth for such collections.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       S. 728 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water \n     resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would \n     benefit State, local, and tribal governments, and any costs \n     to those governments to comply with the conditions of this \n     Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily. The bill \n     also would benefit those governments by authorizing \n     additional funds or reducing matching requirements for some \n     specific projects.\n       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Julie Middleton, Lisa \n     Cash Driskill, Deborah Reis, and Mike Waters; Impact on \n     State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Marjorie Miller; Impact \n     on the Private Sector: Selena Caldera.\n       Estimate Approved By: Peter H.

At the time of filing of the report, the \nstatement was unavailable. The statement has since been received by the \ncommittee. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     S. 864, Nuclear Security Act of 2005, As reported by the \n         Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on July \n         1, 2005\n       Summary\n       S. 864 would amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to \n     establish several new programs designed to protect the \n     nation's nuclear infrastructure. Based on information from \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), CBO estimates that \n     implementing S. 864 would have a gross cost of $10 million in \n     2006 and $64 million over the 2006-2010 period. Under current \n     law, the NRC is authorized to collect fees to offset 90 \n     percent of most of its budget authority provided from the \n     general fund (a portion of funds are provided from the \n     Nuclear Waste Fund) in 2005 and 33 percent for each year \n     after 2005. After accounting for those collections, CBO \n     estimates that S. 864 would have a net cost of $5 million in \n     2006 and $41 million over the 2006-2010 period.\n       S. 864 would impose both intergovernmental and private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA) by requiring expanded security procedures at \n     certain nuclear facilities, new guidelines for tracking spent \n     fuel rods and segments at nuclear power plants, and a \n     mandatory tracking system for radiation sources in the United \n     States. The bill also would impose a private-sector mandate \n     on persons who import and export radiation sources by \n     requiring them to meet new requirements. Finally, the bill \n     would preempt State laws restricting the use and transport of \n     certain firearms and may preempt State regulation of the \n     disposal of certain types of byproduct material by \n     transferring that authority to the NRC. CBO estimates that \n     the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would be below \n     the annual thresholds established in UMRA for \n     intergovernmental mandates ($62 million in 2005, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) and for private-sector mandates ($123 \n     million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation).\n     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 864 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 270 (energy).\n\n \n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       2006     2007     2008     2009     2010\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEvaluation of Security-Response Plans:\n    Estimated Authorization Level..................................  .......        6        6        6       67\n    Estimated Outlays..............................................        5        5        6        6        6\nRadiation Source Tracking System:\n    Estimated Authorization Level..................................        5        6        4        4        4\n    Estimated Outlays..............................................        4        5        4        4        4\nTreatment of Radioactive Byproduct:\n    Estimated Authorization Level..................................        1        6        3        3        3\n    Estimated Outlays..............................................        1        4        3        3        3\nFirearms Use:\n    Estimated Authorization Level..................................        1        0        0        0        0\n    Estimated Outlays..............................................        1        0        0        0        0\n    Gross Changes:\n        Estimated Authorization Level..............................       14       17       12       12       13\n        Estimated Outlays..........................................       10       15       13       13       13\nNRC Fee Collection Offset\\1\\:\n    Estimated Authorization Level..................................       -5       -6       -4       -4       -4\n    Estimated Outlays..............................................       -5       -6       -4       -4       -4\n    Net Changes Under S. 864:                                             10       12        8        8        8\n        Estimated Outlays..........................................        5        9        9        9        8\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Under current law, collections are authorized at declining percentages of the NRC's budget (90 percent in\n  2005 and 33 percent after 2005). To estimate the net change in NRC costs under S. 864, that 33 percent rate\n  was applied to the estimated cost of the programs under S. 864.\nNOTE: Details may not sum to totals because of rounding.\n\n     Basis of Estimate\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be \n     enacted near the start of fiscal year 2006, that the \n     necessary amounts will be appropriated for each year, and \n     that outlays will occur at historical rates for similar \n     programs.\n       S. 864 would require the NRC to update and adopt \n     rulemakings and programs related to security at the nation's \n     nuclear power plants. The bill would set new criteria for \n     preparing and evaluating security response plans at nuclear \n     facilities, require a tracking system for radiation sources, \n     and set requirements for the transport and disposal of \n     radioactive byproduct material, firearms use by certain \n     security personnel, background checks for certain security \n     personnel, and guidelines for tracking the location of spent \n     fuel rods. Under current law, the NRC is authorized to \n     collect annual fees to offset 90 percent of most of its \n     general fund appropriation. When this authority expires at \n     the end of fiscal year 2005, the NRC will be authorized to \n     collect annual user fees from its licensees of up to only 33 \n     percent of its budget.\n       Based on information from the NRC, CBO estimates that \n     implementing S. 864 would have a gross cost of $64 million \n     over the 2006-2010 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts. After accounting for offsetting \n     collections, CBO estimates that S.\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\n     864 would have a net cost of $41 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period.\n\n                 Evaluation of Security-Response Plans\n\n       S. 864 would require the NRC to evaluate the security \n     response plans at designated nuclear facilities at least once \n     every 3 years. The evaluations would simulate the threats \n     that nuclear facilities must be able to defend against. We \n     expect that the NRC would use contractors to conduct mock \n     exercises known as force-on-force. Under S. 864, the NRC \n     also would revise its ``design basis threats'' or the \n     attack scenario nuclear facilities must be capable of \n     defeating. Based on information from the NRC, CBO \n     estimates that the NRC would incur a gross cost of about \n     $5 million in 2006 and $27 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period to revise those requirements.\n\n                    Radiation Source Tracking System\n\n       Under S. 864, the NRC would have to establish a system for \n     tracking radiation sources in the United States that is \n     compatible with the Secretary of Transportation's tracking \n     system of radiation shipments. S. 864 also would establish a \n     task force on radiation source protection and security to \n     recommend measures to protect radiation sources from \n     potential terrorist threats. The bill also would require the \n     National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the \n     industrial, research, and commercial uses for radiation \n     sources. Based on information from the NRC, CBO estimates \n     that this program would have a gross cost of $4 million in \n     2006 and $21 million over the 2006-2010 period.\n\n              Treatment of Radioactive Byproduct Material\n\n       S. 864 would establish regulations for the transport and \n     disposal of radioactive byproduct material and expand the \n     definition of radioactive byproduct material to include \n     naturally occurring or accelerator-produced radioactive \n     material (known as NARM). Under current law, 35 States have \n     entered into agreements with the NRC that authorize them to \n     treat and dispose of certain radioactive byproduct materials, \n     including NARM. S. 864 would require the NRC to prepare a \n     transition plan for States to transfer regulatory authority \n     over NARM byproducts to the NRC. CBO estimates that the NRC \n     would incur a gross cost of $14 million over the 2006-2010 \n     period to oversee disposal of NARM in the 15 States without \n     waste disposal agreements with the NRC. Under the bill, those \n     States may opt to obtain a waiver allowing them to retain \n     oversight of NARM disposal. In that event, NRC costs would be \n     lower.\n\n                   Firearms Use and Background Checks\n\n       S. 864 would authorize the NRC to permit certain security \n     employees at nuclear facilities to use several types of \n     firearms and would establish guidelines for checking the \n     background of those security personnel. Based on information \n     from the NRC, CBO estimates that the one-time cost of \n     establishing those procedures would be about $1 million in \n     2006.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       S. 864 would impose both intergovernmental and private-\n     sector mandates as defined in UMRA by:\n       Increasing costs borne by licensees to pay for fingerprint \n     checks by increasing the number of individuals requiring \n     background checks;\n       Requiring certain nuclear sites to correct any security \n     defects identified during NRC's force-on-force security \n     evaluations;\n       Establishing new guidelines for tracking and controlling \n     individual spent fuel rods and segments by nuclear power \n     plants; and\n       Requiring NRC licensees that possess or transport certain \n     radiation sources to identify those sources and report any \n     loss or change in the location to the NRC.\n       The bill also would impose an additional private-sector \n     mandate on individuals who import and export radiation \n     sources by requiring them to meet new requirements. The bill \n     would impose an additional intergovernmental mandate by \n     preempting State laws restricting the use and transport of \n     certain firearms, and may preempt State regulation of the \n     disposal of certain types of byproduct material by \n     transferring that authority to the NRC. CBO estimates that \n     the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would be below \n     the annual thresholds established in UMRA for \n     intergovernmental mandates ($62 million in 2005, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) and for private-sector mandates ($123 \n     million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation).\n\n                     Requirements on NRC Licensees\n\n       Additional Fee for Background Checks. Section 103 would \n     require fingerprinting of additional individuals connected \n     with nuclear facilities (public and private) as part of \n     criminal background checks done through the U.S. Attorney \n     General's Office. The cost of the government background \n     checks would be borne directly by licensees. The duty to pay \n     the increased cost would be both a private-sector and \n     intergovernmental mandate under UMRA, but because the cost of \n     each background check is small and many persons associated \n     with nuclear facilities have already undergone background \n     checks, CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandate \n     would be small.\n       Security Evaluations. Section 104 would require the NRC to \n     conduct security-response evaluations at certain nuclear \n     facilities. Those evaluations would include force-on-force \n     exercises and would require facilities to remedy any defects. \n     Given that NRC is already conducting those evaluations, CBO \n     estimates that the incremental costs of such legislated \n     requirements would be minimal.\n       New Tracking System for Spent Fuels Rods and Segments. \n     Section 109 would require NRC to establish uniform guidelines \n     for tracking and controlling spent fuel rods and segments at \n     nuclear power plants. Current NRC regulations include similar \n     guidelines for tracking and controlling spent fuel rods and \n     segments, and CBO estimates that any additional cost to NRC \n     licensees resulting from this provision would be minimal.\n       New Tracking System for Radiation Sources. Section 201 \n     would direct the NRC to establish a mandatory tracking system \n     for category 1 and 2 radiation sources (as defined by the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency) in the United States. \n     Category 1 and 2 radiation sources are held by both public \n     and private NRC licensees and are used for medical and \n     industrial purposes. The tracking system would include \n     identification by serial number, reporting of changes in \n     ownership or location of radiation sources, reporting of lost \n     sources, and reporting through a secure Internet connection. \n     According to the NRC, identification of radiation sources \n     already is being done to some extent, and the agency expects \n     to take on most of the cost of creating the tracking \n     system. Based on this information, CBO expects that, while \n     there would be some personnel costs for certain NRC \n     licensees to comply with the monitoring and reporting \n     requirements of the new tracking system, any additional \n     costs would be small.\n\n      Requirements on Importers and Exporters of Radiation Sources\n\n       Section 201 would prohibit the import and export of \n     radiation sources in the United States unless certain \n     requirements are met. The bill would require that exporters \n     of radiation sources verify that the recipient country may \n     receive and possess the radiation source and has the \n     capability to securely manage the source; send notice to the \n     recipient country prior to shipment; and obtain notification \n     upon receipt of the shipment. Importers of radiation sources \n     would be required to prove that they are lawfully authorized \n     by the NRC to receive the radiation source. Those \n     requirements would constitute private-sector mandates under \n     UMRA. However, the costs of those mandates would be small. \n     According to NRC, similar regulations already have been \n     proposed by the agency. An analysis of those proposed \n     regulations by the Office of Management and Budget indicates \n     that the aggregate cost to all importers and exporters would \n     be approximately $130,000 annually.\n\n               Preemptions of State Laws and Regulations\n\n       Authorization of Firearm Possession. Section 102 would \n     preempt State laws restricting the use and transport of \n     certain firearms. That provision would expand existing NRC \n     authority that allows the agency to authorize certain \n     security employees to use and transport several types of \n     firearms, regardless of State or local regulations. Such a \n     preemption would not impose significant costs on State or \n     local governments.\n       Waste Disposal Provisions. Depending on future action by \n     the NRC, section 202 could preempt State regulation of the \n     disposal of certain types of radioactive byproduct material. \n     Specifically, this section of the bill would transfer \n     regulatory authority for the disposal of naturally occurring \n     and accelerator-produced radioactive byproduct material to \n     the NRC. Currently, States have this authority by default \n     because the NRC does not expressly regulate such material. \n     For those States with direct agreements with the NRC \n     (agreement States), the authority to regulate the disposal of \n     NARM would be returned to the State per those agreements. \n     However, in non-agreement States, that authority would remain \n     with the NRC. NRC sources have expressed an intent to \n     maintain the status quo across all States for the disposal of \n     NARM, and therefore, CBO estimates that the costs of this \n     potential preemption would be insignificant.\n     Previous CBO Estimate\n       On April 19, 2005, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     1640, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as ordered reported by \n     the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 13, 2005. \n     S. 864 includes provisions similar to sections 662 through \n     665 of H.R. 1640. The estimated costs for those similar \n     provisions are identical.\n       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Lisa Cash Driskill and \n     Jimin Chung; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Lisa Ramirez-Branum and Ian Rudge; Impact on the Private \n     Sector: Selena Caldera.\n       Estimate Approved By: Peter Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9722-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9722-S9724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NUCLEAR FEES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, section 403 of the Congressional Budget \nand Impoundment Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of \nthe reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, be \nincluded in the report. At the time of filing of the report, the \nstatement was unavailable. The statement has since been received by the \ncommittee. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     S. 858, Nuclear Fees Reauthorization Act of 2005, As ordered \n         reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and \n         Public Works on June 8, 2005\n     Summary\n       CBO estimates that the net cost of implementing S. 858 \n     would be $2 million in fiscal year 2006 and about $10 million \n     over the 2006-2010 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts. Enacting the bill would not affect direct \n     spending or revenues.\n       Under current law, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) \n     is authorized to collect annual fees to offset about 90 \n     percent of its general fund appropriation. If that authority \n     is allowed to expire at the end of fiscal year 2005, the NRC \n     would be authorized to collect only 33 percent of its budget \n     through user fees. S. 858 would extend the NRC's current \n     authority to charge annual fees to offset 90 percent of most \n     of its general fund appropriation through 2011 and also would \n     prohibit amounts appropriated to the NRC for certain \n     specified homeland security activities to be offset with user \n     fees. The fees that NRC collects are classified as offsetting \n     collections (a credit against discretionary spending) because \n     they are explicitly tied to the level of annual discretionary \n     appropriations for the agency.\n       S. 858 also would authorize the NRC to establish several \n     new initiatives with higher education institutions to enhance \n     employee recruitment. The programs would provide support, \n     such as grants, loans, and equipment to higher education \n     institutions for NRC-related curricula, and for scholarships \n     and fellowships to students potentially seeking careers at \n     NRC. S. 858 also would authorize funding for promotional \n     items used in recruitment, reimbursement of travel expenses \n     for students working with the NRC, medical costs of overseas \n     NRC employees, and mentoring, training, and research programs \n     at Hispanic-serving, historically black, and tribally \n     controlled colleges or universities.\n       S. 858 contains both an intergovernmental and private-\n     sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). CBO estimates that the costs of the intergovernmental \n     mandate would not exceed the threshold ($62 million in 2005, \n     adjusted annually for inflation) established in that act. CBO \n     cannot determine whether the costs of the private-sector \n     mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA \n     ($123 million in 2005, adjusted annually for inflation) \n     because UMRA does not specify how CBO should measure the \n     costs of extending an existing mandate. Depending on how they \n     are measured, the costs to the private sector could exceed \n     the threshold.\n     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 858 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 270 (energy).\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   2006    2007    2008    2009    2010\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nHigher Education and Recruitment\n Programs.\n    Estimated Authorization            1       6       6       6       6\n     Level......................\n    Estimated Outlays...........       1       4       5       6       6\nNRC Fee Collection Offset \\1\\.\n    Estimated Authorization\n     Level......................\n    Estimated Outlays...........      -1      -5      -5      -5      -5\nNRC Cost Recovery from\n Government Agencies.\n    Estimated Authorization            2       2       2       2       2\n     Level......................\n    Estimated Outlays...........       2       2       2       2       2\nTotal Net Change in\n Discretionary Spending Under S.\n 858.\n    Estimated Authorization            2       3       3       3       3\n     Level......................\n    Estimated Outlays...........       2       1       2       3      3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Under current law, collections are authorized at declining\n  percentages of the NRC's budget (90 percent in 2005 and 33 percent\n  after 2005). S. 858 would authorize a 90 percent collection for 2006\n  to 2011. To estimate the net change in NRC costs under S. 858, 90\n  percent was applied to the estimated cost of higher education and\n  recruitment programs as authorized by S. 858.\n\n     Basis of Estimate\n       For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be \n     enacted near the start of fiscal year 2006, that the \n     necessary amounts will be appropriated for each year, and \n     that outlays will occur at historical rates.\n       S. 858 would establish new initiatives with higher \n     education institutions and recruitment efforts at the NRC. \n     The bill would make changes to the NRC's authority to collect \n     fees to offset its appropriations. Based on information from \n     the NRC, CBO estimates that the net cost of implementing S. \n     858 would be $2 million in 2006 and about $10 million over \n     the 2006-2010 period. All budget effects of the bill would be \n     subject to appropriation action.\n\n               Higher Education and Recruitment Programs\n\n       S. 858 would establish new NRC programs with colleges and \n     universities to enhance employee recruitment. The programs \n     would provide grants, loans, and equipment to higher \n     education institutions for NRC-related curriculum and \n     scholarships and fellowships to students with prospects of \n     future employment at NRC. S. 858 also would authorize funding \n     for promotional items used in recruitment, travel expenses \n     reimbursement for students working with the NRC, medical cost \n     coverage of overseas NRC employees, and various mentoring, \n     training, and research programs at Hispanic-serving, \n     historically black, and tribally controlled colleges or \n     universities. Based on information from the NRC, CBO \n     estimates that implementing higher education and recruitment \n     programs would have a gross cost of $1 million in 2006 and \n     $22 million over the 2006-2010 period. Under S. 858, the \n     NRC would recover 90 percent of these costs through fees \n     that are credited against its annual appropriations.\n\n                                NRC Fees\n\n       Under current law, the NRC is authorized to offset 90 \n     percent of most of its budget authority in 2005 and 33 \n     percent for each year after 2005. In 2005, the NRC received a \n     gross appropriation from the general fund of $601 million to \n     be offset by an estimated $541 million from the collection of \n     fees. Such fees are classified as offsetting collections a \n     form of discretionary spending. As is the case under current \n     law for 2005, S. 858 would set fee collection at 90 percent \n     of most of the agency's budget authority provided from the \n     general fund (a portion of funds are provided from the \n     Nuclear Waste Fund) for each year from 2006 through 2011. \n     Under S. 858, the NRC also would be prohibited from \n     recovering costs for certain homeland security activities. \n     For example, for 2006, the NRC requested $31 million for \n     homeland security activities that would no longer be offset \n     by user fees under this bill.\n       By continuing to authorize fee collections at 90 percent of \n     NRC's annual general fund appropriation, S. 858 would lead to \n     the collection of approximately $550 million in fees in 2006. \n     In contrast, if that 90 percent fee-collection authority were \n     not extended, the portion of spending recoverable through \n     fees would drop to 33 percent, and the amount of fees \n     collected would fall to about $200 million in 2006. Those \n     estimates assume that NRC funding in 2006 is equal to the \n     amounts provided in 2005 with an adjustment for inflation.\n\n                           NRC Cost Recovery\n\n       Under current law, the NRC collects fees from its private \n     licensees that offset its annual appropriation. Such fee \n     collection includes the cost of issuing licenses to some \n     government agencies. S. 858 would require that government \n     agencies pay their licensing and regulatory activity fees, \n     rather than the private sector.\n       Currently, the NRC charges private licensees about $2 \n     million per year for licenses issued to government agencies. \n     Under S. 858, those license fees would come from appropriated \n     funds rather than the private sector; thus, the government \n     would incur a net cost relative to current law to pay them. \n     We estimate that such additional costs would be $2 million in \n     2006 and $10 million over the 2006-2010 period.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       Under current law, the NRC is authorized to collect annual \n     fees from its licensees (public and private) to offset 90 \n     percent of a major portion of its general fund appropriation. \n     CBO estimates that those collections will amount to an \n     estimated $541 million in fiscal year 2005. Those fee \n     collections include the cost of issuing licenses to some \n     Federal agencies. The NRC's authority to collect that level \n     of fees expires at the end of fiscal year 2005. When that \n     authority expires, the NRC will be authorized to collect \n     annual fees up to only 33 percent of its budget. S. 858 would \n     extend the NRC's current authority to charge annual fees to \n     offset 90 percent of its net appropriation through 2011. The \n     duty to pay such fees would be a mandate as defined in UMRA.\n       The total amount of fees collected under this provision \n     would depend on the level of future appropriations. Assuming \n     appropriations in the amount authorized for 2005, CBO \n     estimates that extending the fees would result in additional \n     collections of more than $300 million in 2006 from industries \n     regulated by the NRC (primarily electric utilities) and \n     similar amounts for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. CBO \n     estimates that most of the annual fees would be paid by \n     private, investor-owned nuclear utilities (less than 5 \n     percent would be paid by nonFederal, publicly owned \n     utilities).\n       In the case of a mandate that has not yet expired, UMRA \n     does not specify whether CBO should measure the cost of the \n     extension relative to the mandate's current costs or assume \n     that the mandate will expire and that it must measure the \n     costs of the mandate's extension as if the requirement were \n     new. Measured against the costs that would\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\n     be incurred if current law remains in place and the annual \n     fee declines, the total cost to the private sector of \n     extending this mandate would be close to $300 million \n     annually, beginning in fiscal year 2006. Measured that way, \n     the cost of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold for \n     the private sector as defined in UMRA. By contrast, measured \n     against the fees paid for fiscal year 2005, the mandate would \n     impose no additional costs on the private sector because the \n     fees under the bill would not differ much from those \n     currently in effect. In any case, CBO estimates that the \n     total costs to State, local, and tribal governments would be \n     small relative to the threshold for intergovernmental \n     mandates.\n       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Lisa Cash Driskill and \n     Jimin Chung; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Lisa Ramirez-Branun; Impact on the Private Sector: Selena \n     Calera.\n       Estimate Approved By: Peter Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9724-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEATH OF MO MOWLAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last month, sadly, Mo Mowlam, Great \nBritain's former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, died after a \nlong and courageous battle with cancer. Mo will long be remembered for \nher leadership at a critical moment in the history of Northern Ireland. \nI first met her when she was a member of the Labour Party and her party \nwas in opposition in Parliament. I was delighted when Prime Minister \nBlair came to power and named her Secretary of State for Northern \nIreland. She was a breath of fresh air and quickly won over nearly \nevery Irish American she met. She was exceedingly effective and was the \nright person for the job at the right time in Northern Ireland. With \nher remarkable abilities, she created the conditions that led to the \nhistoric Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Mo was fair, intelligent, and \nwilling to take risks for peace.\n  On a personal note, my wife, Vicki, and I will always warmly recall \nour visit with Mo, and her husband, Jon Norton, at Hillsborough in \nNorthern Ireland in January 1998.\n  Irish Senator Martin Mansergh, himself a key player in the Northern \nIreland peace process, recently wrote a well-deserved tribute to Mo in \nthe Irish Times, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Aug. 27, 2005]\n\n               Mo Was Willing To Dirty Her Hands for Peace\n\n                          (By Martin Mansergh)\n\n       A first memory of Mo Mowlam is of a young, newly elected MP \n     accompanying, as deputy, the British Labour Party's Northern \n     Ireland spokesman Kevin McNamara to an Anglo-Irish conference \n     in Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire.\n       The British have an inexhaustible belief in country house \n     diplomacy to solve problems like Northern Ireland in an \n     atmosphere cut off from the modem world. Its efficacy was not \n     evident on that occasion.\n       When John Smith died tragically in 1994, Mo Mowlam, a \n     fellow north of England MP, was a principal lieutenant of \n     Tony Blair in his leadership campaign. Her reward in being \n     appointed Northern Ireland spokeswoman marked a shift away \n     from the moderate pro-nationalist stance of McNamara and \n     Labour's formal policy through the 1980s of Irish unity by \n     consent.\n       Whether Labour would ever have been active persuaders for \n     unity is doubtful. That policy was devised as a means of \n     containing pressure from the Labour left for ``troops out'' \n     and British withdrawal. By 1994, after the Downing Street \n     Declaration, Labour adjusted its position to broad \n     bipartisanship with the John Major government, both on \n     constitutional principles and tactics.\n       Mo Mowlam did her homework while in opposition, studying \n     the issues, attending conferences, meeting different parties, \n     and acting as conduit to Tony Blair. Unwilling to open any \n     flank for attack that might endanger election victory, \n     Labour refrained from criticising the Tory mishandling of \n     the peace process which contributed to, even if it was not \n     responsible for, the breakdown of the first ceasefire. \n     Labour kept its powder dry, and by the 1997 general \n     election had become almost as acceptable to unionism as \n     the outgoing Conservative administration.\n       Mo Mowlam became Northern Ireland Secretary of State, and \n     held office during the crucia1 12-month period that began \n     with restoration of the IRA ceasefire in July 1997. With \n     Irish help, Labour worked round the demand for immediate \n     decommissioning that was a roadblock to progress at that \n     stage.\n       She kept her cool in the conference room in July 1997 and \n     gave nothing away when Conor Cruise O'Brien, sitting \n     alongside Robert McCartney on the UKUP delegation, sought \n     formal repudiation of more radical views she had once held on \n     Ireland. Further negotiations at Stormont created conditions \n     of engagement from late September in multi-party talks \n     chaired by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell that included \n     Ulster Unionists, loyalists and Sinn Fein, as well as the \n     SDLP, Alliance and Women's Coalition.\n       As incoming Secretary of State, she made every attempt to \n     be even-handed, and was prepared to be as sympathetic and \n     receptive to unionist as to nationalist and republican views. \n     Her eventual decision to let the Drumcree parade through in \n     1997 (for the last time) was evidence of that.\n       Much of the comment about her focuses more on style than \n     substance. Her casual manner and outspoken language were \n     something that not all British civil servants, used to the \n     traditional patrician style exemplified by Sir Patrick \n     Mayhew, appreciated. The Irish delegation had few problems on \n     that front, though occasionally she made even Ray Burke look \n     fastidious.\n       She was a culture shock to the Ulster Unionist Party, as to \n     some extent was Liz O'Donnell. If Mo Mowlam ended up closer \n     to nationalists, it was because unionists left her little \n     choice, by increasingly refusing to deal substantively with \n     her.\n       They bypassed her with impunity, by constant recourse to No \n     10 Downing Street--if not Tony Blair himself, his diplomatic \n     adviser John Holmes, who provided reassuring continuity for \n     them from John Major's time.\n       Nevertheless, with the help of minister of state Paul \n     Murphy, and partnered on the Irish side by David Andrews, she \n     kept the talks on the road over a difficult eight-month \n     period, even if many strategic negotiations also took place \n     between Downing Street, the NIO, the Taoiseach's Office, \n     Foreign Affairs and Justice. Mo Mowlam made an important and \n     courageous decision to go into the Maze to see loyalist \n     prisoners, when their ceasefire appeared to be collapsing in \n     January 1998, following several murders.\n       Not only did she hold the ring, albeit with difficulty, but \n     it was the moment the British system realised that agreement \n     would only happen if it involved a radical programme to \n     release paramilitary prisoners, however awful their \n     convictions. She well understood that to obtain peace one had \n     to be prepared to get one's hands dirty.\n       In the last hours of the Good Friday negotiations, she sat \n     with the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (and this columnist) \n     listening interminably to some 77 unsatisfied demands by Sinn \n     Fein, all requiring answers, not least to satisfy large \n     backroom teams.\n       While the Government had always striven for agreement \n     bringing everyone present on board, the point had been \n     reached, where, if necessary, continued Government \n     credibility would have required agreement without Sinn Fein \n     (already geared to campaign against changes to Articles 2 and \n     3).\n       Mo Mowlam, like the Taoiseach, favoured retaining a special \n     electoral system, which would, most likely, have secured a \n     place in the Assembly for both the Women's Coalition and the \n     loyalists. The loyalist parties mistakenly believed they did \n     not need such arrangements to stay out of the cold, creating \n     problems to this day.\n       The Good Friday agreement is Britain's finest achievement \n     so far in relation to Ireland. Mo Mowlam is entitled to full \n     credit for her part in that, as the following Labour Party \n     conference affirmed with thunderous applause. It is almost \n     always a mistake for a minister to challenge the prime \n     minister, and she was easily undermined by those who coveted \n     her post for Peter Mandelson. His main positive contribution, \n     in late 1999, was to persuade Ulster Unionists to let the \n     institutions start, however temporarily.\n       Apart from her deserved place in British Labour Party \n     folklore, Mo Mowlam's courage and down-to-earth approach will \n     ensure that she long retains a warm place in the memory of \n     most Irish people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9724-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9724-S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATION OF 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREAT LAKES COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the \nGreat Lakes Commission. The Great Lakes Commission is a bi-national \nagency working to improve the Great Lakes and the region. The \nCommission promotes the orderly and comprehensive development, use and \nconservation of the Great Lakes basin, its tributaries and the St. \nLawrence River. Its members include the eight Great Lakes States, \nIllinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania \nand Wisconsin, with associate member status for the Canadian provinces \nof Quebec and Ontario.\n  Since its establishment in 1955, the Great Lakes Commission has been \na pioneer in applying principles of sustainability to the natural \nresources of the Great Lakes basin and St. Lawrence River. The \nCommission promotes the paired goals of environmental protection and \neconomic improvement and has built its reputation on an integrated and \nobjective approach to public policy issues and opportunities.\n  When the Great Lakes Commission was founded in 1955, the Great Lakes \nregion was about to gain greater regional and economic importance; St.\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\nLawrence Seaway was close to completion. With a greater influx of \ncommercial activity along the waters, there was a collaborative desire \nin the region to form an organization whose task would be to promote \nthe development, use and conservation of the Great Lakes Basin while \nmaking it possible for the States to derive maximum benefit from its \nresources. Additionally, the Commission was to serve as an advisory \nagency of the States and Federal Government. In 1954, at the Great \nLakes Seaway and Water Resources Conference the notion of creating a \nState and provincial compact was discussed. In the following year, the \neight Great Lakes States all passed legislation to establish the \nCommission.\n  Congressional ratification did not come until 1968 after jurisdiction \nover the type of consultation the Commission would be able to provide \nto both the U.S. and Canada had been addressed.\n  Over the years, the Great Lakes Commission has been responsible for \nproviding a unified voice, quality research, and sound advice for the \nGreat Lakes region. Among its accomplishments are the establishments \nthe Great Lakes Regional Water Use Database, the Great Lakes Basin \nProgram for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, the Great Lakes \nInformation Network, the Michigan Water Corps, and Great Lakes St. \nLawrence Mayors' Conference. I would just like to share briefly with my \ncolleagues a bit about these great programs.\n  In 1988, the Great Lakes Regional Water Use Database was one of the \nfirst compilations of its sort. It provides a comprehensive collection \nof information on the region's water use, including reports, charts and \nother publications. Today, it is just one of many database and \nmonitoring programs initiated by the Great Lakes Commission.\n  The Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control \nworks in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EPA \nand the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was created in 1991 to prevent \nfurther soil erosion and sedimentation from damaging the Great Lakes \nwaters by using educational and financial tools. This program has \nalready saved more than 650,000 tons of soil and prevented 487 tons of \nnitrogen and 674 tons of phosphorus from flowing into the waterways.\n  The Great Lakes Information Network is an online database that \ncombines economic, environmental, travel, and educational information \nabout the Great Lakes. It is a premier search engine on information \nregarding the region and has won numerous awards. The Commission's work \nto establish and maintain such a network is invaluable to those who \nneed data and research on the Great Lakes.\n  Recently, the Michigan Clean Water Corps has also joined the long \nlist of successful programs supported by the Great Lakes Commission. \nThe Clean Water Corps was established in 2003 by executive order from \nGovernor Jennifer Granholm to work in partnership with the Huron River \nWatershed Council and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. \nThe goal of the Corps is to provide volunteers with training to monitor \nand distribute information on the water quality of the waters around \nMichigan and to provide educational tools to assist in creating an \ninformed public.\n  In 1987, the Commission brought together the regional mayors to meet \nabout Great Lakes issues for the first time. The Commission helped \npromote the idea that the mayors in the Great Lakes region could unite \nand be a driving political force. This annual conference also provides \na forum for the mayors of the Great Lakes region to share ideas to \naddress the area's problems.\n  These are just a few of the programs that the Great Lakes Commission \noversees and implements. As they continue these initiatives in the \ncoming years, they will also focus more on sustainability and growth.\n  The Great Lakes Commission is vital for the health and future of the \nGreat Lakes. I would like to thank the Great Lakes Commission for the \nwonderful work they have done over the past 50 years and congratulate \nthem on reaching this milestone. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin expressing that appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9725-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               IN REMEMBRANCE OF BENJAMIN AARON BENJAMIN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Benjamin Aaron Benjamin, a great musician \nand teacher, who passed away at the age of 40 on May 22, 2005. Mr. \nBenjamin was well respected in the Detroit community and dedicated his \nlife to sharing the gift of music with others. He will be sorely missed \nby those whose lives he has touched.\n  Benjamin Aaron Benjamin, who learned to play the piano at a very \nyoung age, was born in Stamford, CT on March 8, 1965, to James and \nRebekah Benjamin. He attended the Hart School of Music and was a \nconcert pianist who devoted much of his time to instilling in children \nhis love of music. He founded the Benjamin Conservatory of Music in \n2002 to provide music education to the people of the greater Detroit \narea.\n  He is mourned by his family, former students, and many people across \nmy home State of Michigan. Benjamin is survived by his parents, his \ndaughter, Yasmine, and his seven siblings: James, John, Mark, Richard, \nChandler, Grace, and Myah.\n  This is, indeed, a great loss to all who knew him and to those who \nhave benefitted from his talent and love of music. I know my colleagues \nwill join me in paying tribute to the life and work of Benjamin Aaron \nBenjamin. I hope his family takes comfort in knowing that his legacy \nwill be passed on through the music he loved so much and by the many \nwhose lives have been enriched by his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9725-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9725-S9726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MR.

He passed away on August 6, 2005, at the age of 87, and I \nwould like to take this opportunity to honor his life.\n  A devoted family man, George was married for 61 years to Willine \nEngel Mitnick. Together, they raised two daughters, Ronne Mitnick Hess \nand Karen Mitnick. He and his wife resided in Jasper, AL, until his \npassing.\n  George was born in Hartford, CT, on December 21, 1917, and attended \ncollege at the University of Connecticut. Upon graduation, he enlisted \nin the military and served in World War II. He was a captain in the \n65th Infantry Division in the European Theatre and received two Bronze \nStars for his service.\n  George Mitnick was very devoted to charitable efforts, making \ngenerous contributions in money, time and energy. Some of those \norganizations included United Cerebral Palsy and the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. In addition, much of his \nphilanthropic work was aimed at young people. Both the Mitnick \nFellowship Fund and the Mitnick Wilderness Boot Camp helped youth in \nAlabama.\n  Well known as a business leader, he was a co-founder of Top Dollar \nStores in the 1950s. The company, which expanded to over 250 stores, \nwas acquired by Sav-A-Stop Company, and George served on the company's \nboard of directors and on its executive committee. He also served as a \ndirector of the First National Bank of Jasper and First Commercial \nBankshares.\n  George was very active in civic, professional and political \norganizations. He was committed to making a difference across the State \nof Alabama, dedicating much of his time to community organizations. He \nserved as president of the Alabama Retail Association, the Jasper \nChamber of Commerce and the Jasper Rotary Club. He was instrumental in \nfounding the Walker Area Community Foundation and the Walker College \nCivic Concert Association.\n  He served on a number of boards including the Northwest Alabama \nMental Health Center, the Walker County Association of Retarded \nCitizens, Walker Junior College and Walker Regional Medical Center. He \nwas also very involved in the political process, playing an integral \nrole in Americans for Good Government.\n  Active in the Jewish community in Alabama and across the nation, \nGeorge\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nserved as president of the Temple Emanu-El in Jasper, AL and the Walker \nCounty Lodge of B'nai B'rith. In 2003, he was named ``Man of the Year'' \nby the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he also served \nas a member of the executive board.\n  George Mitnick gave of himself so selflessly to the Jasper community \nand the State of Alabama. We are better off for having him a part of \nour State and our country, and I am fortunate to have known him and \ncalled him a friend. My deepest sympathies are extended to his wife, \nWilline, and his daughters, Karen and Ronne.

HANDY\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege \ntoday to pay tribute to a leader and warrior, General John W. handy, \nCommander, United States Transportation Command, USTRANSCOM, and \nCommander, Air Mobility Command, AMC. General Handy is retiring after \nhonorably serving this great Nation for over 38 years.\n  General Handy was commissioned in the U.S. Air Force in 1967 and \nreceived his pilot wings in 1968. He has accumulated over 5,000 hours \npiloting just about every mobility aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, to \ninclude the C-7A Caribou, the C-130 Hercules, the C-141 Starlifter, the \nC-37 Gulfstream V, the C-9 Nightingale, the KC-10 Extender, and the \nNation's newest mobility airlifter, the C-17 Globemaster III. His \nhands/on performance, sound judgment, and expertise have made him an \nexceptional Air Force leader.\n  General Handy commanded the 21st Air Force at McGuire Air Force Base. \nHe created and commanded AMC's Tanker Airlift Control Center. He also \ncommanded two airlift wings and a maintenance squadron. He previously \nserved as the Director of Operations and Logistics for USTRANSCOM; the \nAir Force's Director of Programs and Evaluations; the Deputy Chief of \nStaff, Installations and Logistics, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, \nWashington, DC; and Vice Chief of Staff, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, \nWashington, D.C. It is clear that General Handy is the preeminent \nmobility and logistics expert in the Department of Defense.\n  In November 2001, General Handy assumed command of USTRANSCOM at \nScott Air Force Base, Illinois, responsible for executing mobility \ncombat operations through three component commands: The Air Force's \nAMC, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, MSC, and the Army's Military \nSurface Deployment and Distribution Command, SDDC. General Handy has \nhad the unique distinction of simultaneously commanding both USTRANSCOM \nand its air component command, AMC. USTRANSCOM provides the \nsynchronized transportation, distribution, and sustainment which \nprojects and maintains our national power. As a global combatant \ncommander, General Handy has made supporting the American warfighter \nhis top priority.\n  Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, USTRANSCOM, under \nGeneral Handy's leadership, has moved over 2.4 million passengers, 6.4 \nmillion short tons of cargo, and 2.8 billion gallons of fuel in support \nof the Global War on Terrorism, including Operation Noble Eagle, \nOperation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. To put this in \nperspective, the passenger movement is equivalent to moving the entire \npopulation of Kansas while the cargo movement is equivalent to moving \nover 70 Washington monuments halfway around the world. General Handy, \nan avid NASCAR racing fan, is fond of stating the amount of fuel moved \ncould run the NEXTEL Cup Series for the next 19,473 years.\n  America truly has a military deployment and distribution system that \nis unmatched anywhere in the world. America's military might moves with \nUSTRANSCOM, but so too does its heart. As quick as we are to defend \nthis great Nation, Americans are just as quick to assist those in need; \nand when we do, we turn to the remarkable capabilities of USTRANSCOM. \nUnder General Handy's command, USTRANSCOM has provided humanitarian \nrelief to hurricane victims in the United States, earthquake victims in \nIran, and tsunami victims in South Asia, just to name a few. The \nmedicines, supplies, equipment, and personnel that USTRANSCOM delivered \nto these and other natural disasters ultimately saved lives and eased \nhuman suffering.\n  In addition to conducting the largest military movement since World \nWar II and providing unparalleled humanitarian relief, General Handy \nhas made it a priority to transform our Nation's deployment and \ndistribution system, ensuring our ability to project national power \nwhere needed with the greatest speed and agility, the highest \nefficiency, and the most reliable level of trust and accuracy. As the \nUSTRANSCOM commander, General Handy actively took on the role of the \ndistribution process owner for DOD, charged with improving efficiency \nand interoperability across the entire DOD supply chain. His initiative \nto develop Joint Deployment and Distribution Operations Centers JDDOCs, \nin each of the regional combatant commands continues to improve combat \ncapability and save valuable resources. Regional combatant commanders \ncan now plug into the DOD supply chain system, track their \nrequirements, and prioritize their actions. The net result is that \ntroops and equipment are now arriving to the battlefield faster and at \nless cost. While meeting the needs of the warfighter, General Handy's \ndistribution process owner improvements have saved almost one-half \nbillion dollars in the global war on terror.\n  General Handy will be the first to tell you he did not accomplish \nthese feats alone. General Handy has led the way in seeking \ncollaborative joint solutions to today's complex combat issues. Those \nwho worked for him and with him, military and civilians from every \nbranch of Service, will miss his leadership and mentorship. They will \nmiss the stories and humor he used to get his message across. In \nCongress, we will miss his straightforward approach and sound counsel. \nThe Nation will miss his devotion to duty, ceaseless drive for \nimprovement, and unwavering support to our warfighters.\n  General Handy will be remembered as the man who brilliantly led our \nNation's mobility forces during the global war on terrorism. I know we \nspeak on behalf of our colleagues and a grateful Nation in saying thank \nyou to General Handy and his wife, Mickey, for their years of service \nand sacrifice. We wish General Handy and his wife, Mickey, all the best \nin future endeavors and pray that those who follow in your footsteps \nmay continue the legacy of unprecedented support to our great Nation. \nGood luck and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9726-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9726-S9727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE MOTHER'S COOKIE COMPANY AND WAMZ-FM RADIO \n                           IN LOUISVILLE, KY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the employees \nof the Mother's Cookie Company and WAMZ-FM Radio in Louisville, KY, for \ntheir commitment to philanthropy through their participation in a \ncharity softball game to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n  The employees from Mother's Cookie Company assembled a team to take \non the WAMZ-FM Hamz softball team. For the past 2 years, this \nLouisville radio station has assembled players to compete against area \nbusinesses willing to provide a location, umpires, and players to raise \nmoney to benefit the St. Jude Children's Hospital. While the team from \nMother's Cookies lost a close game by a score of 7-8, they won big \nraising money for St. Jude's Children's hospital. Their donation of \n$1,264.65 was the largest single game donation generated this season.\n  I believe the employees of these two companies in Louisville are \nexamples of how every American can contribute to the care and \nmaintenance of community by participating in activities that bring \npeople together, and unselfishly dedicating their time and resources to \na worthy cause. Companies that give back to the community and employees \nwho share their time with others form the backbone of the American \neconomy, and are the foundation of a strong neighborhood. The men and \nwomen who work at the Mother's Cookie Company not only took the time to \nraise money for medical research, but also bake more than 60 percent of \nthe Girl Scout cookies in America throughout the year.\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\n  I commend the employees of Mother's Cookie Company and WAMZ-FM Radio \nin Louisville, KY, for their dedication to community service. They are \nan inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky, and I thank them for their \ngenerosity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9727-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INHOFE, from the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1265.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to require local educational agencies and schools to \nimplement integrated pest management systems to minimize the use of \npesticides in schools and to provide parents, guardians, and employees \nwith notice of the use of pesticides in schools, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help protect our children from the harmful health effects of \npesticides. This legislation, a companion bill to Congressman Rush \nHolt's School Environment Protection Act, SEPA, addresses the need for \nStates and local education agencies to protect schoolchildren and \nschool staff from exposure to harmful chemicals in school buildings and \non school grounds.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, children face \nhigher risks than adults from pesticides because their systems are \nstill developing, and therefore not as capable of detoxification. \nPesticide exposure can adversely affect a child's neurological, \nrespiratory, immune, and endocrine systems and has been linked to \nexacerbated asthma symptoms.\n  In July of this year, the Journal of the American Medical Association \nreleased a study which confirmed that pesticide exposure at schools \ncauses acute illnesses in school employees and students. The study \nrecommends that integrated pest management programs, designed to \nrequire less, if any, chemical pesticide application, be used in \nschools to help keep our children safe and healthy.\n  Safe alternatives to the use of dangerous chemical pesticides exist. \nThis bill would require all schools, local education agencies, and \nStates to develop school pest management plans that emphasize these \nsafe alternatives, minimizing health damage from pesticides and \nminimizing economic damage by pests at the same time. This legislation \nwould encourage schools to use techniques that attempt to move away \nfrom chemical pesticides where possible, that are proven to be safe and \neffective, and that involve proper timing and notification of students, \nfamilies, and school employees in cases when pesticides cannot be \navoided.\n  This bill builds the foundation for a strong working relationship \nbetween the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and State and local \nagencies so that they may solve this problem together. The EPA is \ncalled upon to develop guidelines with State and local education \nagencies for school pest management plans. Local education agencies \nwould be required to develop and implement school pest management plans \nthat comply. The EPA would continue to offer program assistance after \nsuch plans are implemented.\n  The Senate passed a similar version of this bill in the 107th \nCongress, but the full Congress has been slow to act. I sincerely hope \nthat Congress finally acts on this important issue. We must take the \nadvice of scientists, especially considering the ever-growing body of \nknowledge concerning the effects of harmful chemicals on children, and \npass the School Environment Protection Act. Children have the right to \nlearn in a healthy atmosphere. Parents and guardians have the right to \nknow whether their children are to be exposed to toxic chemicals and \ntake mitigating steps. I urge all my colleagues to support the School \nEnvironmental Protection Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Environment \n     Protection Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1992, the National Parent Teacher Association passed \n     a resolution calling for the reduced use of pesticides in \n     schools and calling on policymakers to consider all possible \n     alternatives before using any pesticides;\n       (2) the National Education Association and many other \n     national public interest organizations have announced support \n     for reducing or eliminating pesticide use in schools;\n       (3) childhood cancer is continuing to increase at the \n     alarming rate of 1 percent per year;\n       (4) the overall incidence of childhood cancer increased 10 \n     percent between 1974 and 1991, making cancer the leading \n     cause of childhood death from disease;\n       (5) approximately 4,800,000 children in the United States \n     under the age of 18 have asthma, the most common chronic \n     illness in children, and the incidence of asthma is on the \n     rise;\n       (6) children are more susceptible to hazardous impacts from \n     pesticides than are adults;\n       (7) numerous scientific studies have linked both cancer and \n     asthma to pesticide exposure;\n       (8) the Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the \n     use of an integrated pest management system by local \n     educational agencies, which emphasizes nonchemical ways of \n     reducing pests, such as sanitation and maintenance;\n       (9) integrated pest management--\n       (A) promotes nonchemical methods of pest prevention and \n     management using least toxic pesticides after all other \n     methods have been exhausted; and\n       (B) requires a notification process by which each student, \n     parent, guardian, staff member, and teacher shall be notified \n     of a pesticide application;\n       (10) parents and guardians have a right to know that there \n     is an integrated pest management system in their children's \n     schools;\n       (11) an integrated pest management system provides long-\n     term health and economic benefits; and\n       (12) parents and guardians wish to and have a right to be \n     notified in advance of any use of a pesticide in their \n     children's schools.\n\n     SEC. 3. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR SCHOOLS.\n\n       The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating sections 34 and 35 (7 U.S.C. 136x, \n     136y) as sections 35 and 36, respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 33 (7 U.S.C. 136w-8) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 34.

A bill to provide the nonimmigrant spouses and children of \nnonimmigrant aliens who perished in the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks an opportunity to adjust their status to that of an alien \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the September \n11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act and to urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  On September 11, 2001, the world we live in was torn apart. Each of \nus, no matter where we lived, shared in the overwhelming sense of loss \nand grief. We shared our grief with the victims, their loved ones, and \ntheir friends. And each of us joined together in the midst of the \ndevastation to unite as Americans and to show the terrorists that we \nwill not be divided.\n  At that time of grief, we stood together as families, as communities, \nand as one Nation. We were all personally touched by this outrageous \ncrime. And we stood together to show the terrorists that although they \nmight destroy our buildings, they could never destroy the foundation of \nour democracy.\n  Over the years our Nation has matured, and we have become a vast \nmelting pot of cultures and of people, joining together to create the \nAmerica of today that we love and cherish.\n  The terrorists sought to destroy our great Nation and the very values \nupon which our country was built. But they were sorely mistaken. No \nmatter how hard they try, they will never force us to turn our back on \nour values.\n  And that means that we can never turn our back on the victims of the \nterrorist attacks or on their family members. On September 11, almost \nthree thousand people were killed. Many of the victims left behind \nhusbands, wives, sons, and daughters. We cannot turn our back on them. \nWe can not allow these attacks, and the terrorists who perpetrated \nthem, to undercut the love of freedom, justice, and community that \nmakes us who we are.\n  Terrorists did not distinguish non-documented immigrants from \ndocumented immigrants or natural born citizens on September 11. On that \ndate, we were all Americans, attacked by a determined enemy who sought \nto break our spirit and destroy our way of life.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleagues to introduce this \nlegislation, which will provide legal recognition and protection to \nfamily members of non-citizen victims of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks.\n  Many of our immigrant residents lost loved ones that day, and no \nperson who has faced such personal heartache and hardship at the hands \nof terrorists should be forced to face deportation.\n  Moreover, these family members should be permitted to remain here to \nvisit the memorials that are presently being built in New York and \nother locations to honor the victims who perished in the terrorist \nattacks. In many cases, these memorials will be all that husbands, \nwives, and children, have left to remember their loved ones.\n  This bipartisan bill will end deportation procedures, and allow \nhusbands, wives, sons, and daughters of non-citizen victims killed in \nNew York, Pennsylvania and Virginia nearly four years ago to apply for \ngreen cards that will allow them to become permanent legal residents. \nThe act will apply to dependents of the deceased victims of the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as determined by the September 11 \nVictims Compensation Fund.\n  The USA Patriot Act initially allowed many of these individuals to \nstay in the country. However, that provision expired on September 10, \n2002. Moreover, many others were never protected by the Patriot Act \nlegislation. All of these individuals today face the prospect of \ndeportation.\n  Although our government has not moved forward with deportation \nprocedures, the status of these families, who have already been through \nso much, remains uncertain. This Act would provide the permanent relief \nthese families need and deserve.\n  And so I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation and in demonstrating to the spouses and children of the \nnon-citizen victims of September 11 that we are all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1621. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom supplies \nand to expand such deduction to include qualified professional \ndevelopment expenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nteacher tax act of 2005, which I am offering along with my good \nfriends, Senator Warner and Senator Landrieu. Our bill increases to \n$400, and makes permanent, the tax deduction available to teachers who \nincur out-of-pocket expenses to purchase classroom supplies. It would \nalso allow this above-the-line deduction for expenses related to \nprofessional development.\n  This bill builds upon the $250 tax deduction established by \nlegislation we authored in 2001, which became law as part of that \nyear's tax relief package. The Tax relief provided by that bill was \nlater extended through the end of this year.\n  Increasing the deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies is \nwarranted by the facts. So often teachers in Maine, and throughout the \ncountry, spend their own money to improve the classroom experiences of \ntheir students. While many of us are familiar with the National \nEducation Association's estimate that teachers spend, on average, $400 \na year on classroom supplies, other surveys show that they are spending \neven more than that. Indeed, I have spoken to dozens of teachers in my \nhome State who tell me they routinely spend far in excess of the $250 \ndeduction limit--a few even as much as $1,000--on materials they use in \ntheir classrooms. At every school I visit, I find teachers who are \nspending their own money to improve the educational experiences of \ntheir students by supplementing classroom supplies. One such teacher is \nDebra Walker, who teaches kindergarten and first grade in the town of \nMilo, ME. She has taught for more than 25 years. Year after year, she \nspends hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin boards, computer \nsoftware, crayons, construction paper, tissue paper, stamps and \ninkpads. She even donated her own family computer for use by her class. \nShe described it well by saying, ``These are the extras that are needed \nto make learning fun for children and to create a stimulating learning \nenvironment.''\n  Another example is Tyler Nutter, a middle school math and reading \nteacher from North Berwick, ME. After teaching for just two years, \nTyler incurred substantial ``startup'' fees as he built his own \ncollection of needed teaching supplies. In his first years on the job, \nhe spent well over $500 out-of-pocket each year, purchasing books and \nother materials that are essential to his teaching program. This tax \ndeduction is, in Tyler's words, ``a nice recognition of the \ncontributions that many teachers have made.''\n  It is important that this deduction also be available to teachers who \nincur expenses for professional development. While this tax relief \nprovides modest assistance to educators, it is my view that students \nare its ultimate beneficiaries. Studies consistently show that well-\nqualified teachers, and involved parents, are the most important\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\ncontributors to student success. Educators themselves understand just \nhow important professional development is to their ability to make a \npositive impact in the classroom. Teachers in Maine repeatedly tell me \nthat they need, and want, more professional development. But tight \nschool budgets often make funds to support this development impossible \nto get. By making professional development expenses deductible, this \nbill will help teachers take that additional course or pursue that \nadvanced degree that will make them even better at what they love to \ndo.\n  The teacher tax relief we have made available since 2001 is a step in \nthe right direction. Increasing that deduction, and making it \npermanent, would be a small but appropriate means of recognizing our \nteachers for a job well done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support, once again, of \nAmerica's teachers by joining with Senator Collins in introducing the \nTeacher Tax Relief Act of 2005.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked closely for some time now in \nsupport of legislation to provide our teachers with tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of \ntheir profession. In the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nproviding much needed tax relief for our Nations' teachers with passage \nof H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush, \nincluded the Collins-Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 provisions \nthat provided a $250 above the line deduction for educators who incur \nout-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring into the classroom to \nbetter the education of their students. These important provisions \nprovided almost half a billion dollars' worth of tax relief to teachers \nall across America in 2002 and 2003.\n  In the 108th Congress we were able to successfully extend the \nprovisions of the Teacher Tax Relief Act for 2004 and 2005.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $521 out of their \nown pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as pens, \npencils and books. First year teachers spend even more, averaging $701 \na year on classroom expenses.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage by \nproviding a $250 above the line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pocket to better the education of our \nchildren.\n  Accordingly, Senator Collins and I have joined together to take \nanother step forward by introducing the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2005.\n  This legislation will build upon current law in three ways. The \nlegislation will: (1) Increase the above-the-line deduction, as \nPresident Bush has called for, from $250 allowed under current law to \n$400; (2) allow educators to include professional development costs \nwithin that $400 deduction. Under current law, up to $250 is deductible \nbut only for classroom expenses; and (3) make the teacher tax relief \nprovisions in the law permanent. Current law sunsets the Collins/Warner \nprovisions after 2005.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. And, in my view, the Federal \nGovernment should recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make in \ntheir career.\n  The Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2005 is another step forward in \nproviding our educators with the recognition they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 1627. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resources study to evaluate resources along the coastal \nregion of the State of Delaware and to determine the suitability and \nfeasibility of establishing a unit of the National Park System in \nDelaware; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, some folks were looking for a place to go \non summer vacation on the Internet. A lot of people go to national \nparks. A couple of summers ago, my family and I went to Alaska and \nvisited Denali, a national park bigger than my State. We had a \nwonderful time in Alaska. But if you go to the national park Web site, \nyou can find national parks to visit in 49 States. There is one State \nthat has no national park. It is my State.\n  I am reintroducing legislation Senator Biden and I introduced at the \nend of the last Congress. We will reintroduce that so we get our State \non the road to having our own national park and providing people around \nthe country and the world the opportunity to learn about our coastal \nheritage, which included the landing of the first Swedes and Finns when \nthey came to America. They landed in Wilmington, DE, to establish the \ncolony of New Sweden. I don't think the Finns called it that, but the \nSwedes did. We want to have a national park of our own that would \ninclude that discovery, commemorate that discovery.\n  Our bill authorizes the National Park Service to conduct a Special \nResource Study of Delaware's coastal region. This study is the first \nstep toward establishing the first national park in Delaware.\n  Delaware's coastal region is rich in historical sites, parks, and \nwildlife areas. This Special Resource Study will trace the various \nthreads that make up the fabric of Delaware, which are an ideal \nmicrocosm for the tapestry of America. Together, these sites highlight \nthe threads of history, heritage, commerce, and nature. The result \nwould be a national park highlighting America's history, cultural \nheritage, commercial progress and natural beauty.\n  The study would be anchored on Fort Christina and the 7th Street \nPeninsula in Wilmington. It would extend south from there to include \nold New Castle and points along Delaware's coast in Kent and Sussex \nCounties, which have been the location of many significant events \nthroughout America's history.\n  This proposed study will help encapsulate the human and natural \nactivity that has occurred along our coast that has helped create the \nvery fabric of our society.\n  I am confident this study will prove that a national park \nhighlighting Delaware's rich coastal heritage would be a very \nappropriate and fitting addition to the National Park system. Our \nnational park would demonstrate that coastal regions like those found \nin Delaware are a vital part of America's past, present, and future.\n  Delaware is first in so many ways, but it is the only state without a \nnational park. Every year, millions of Americans plan their vacations \naround our nation's national park system. They log onto the Park \nService web site and search for ideas for their family vacations. Right \nnow, that search will turn up nothing for Delaware.

Those trips will be a significant boost to \nour economy and will teach new generations of Americans about \nDelaware's rich cultural heritage.\n  I have described to you today a vision resulting from the hard work \nof many dedicated Delawareans. Today, I take the next step in making \ntheir vision a reality.\n  I believe this is an exciting proposal and one that, when \nincorporated into the National Park System, will become an important \nelement in preserving the wonderful human and natural history presented \nby our coastal region.\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 1629. A bill to provide the President with authority to \ntemporarily freeze the price of gasoline and other refined products; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to give \nthe President the temporary authority to freeze the price of gasoline \nand other petroleum products at their levels just prior to the \ndevastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast of the \nUnited States. This authority would expire once supplies of these \nproducts have been restored to their pre-hurricane levels.\n  Our topmost priority, of course, must be to provide immediate aid \ndirectly to the victims of this immense tragedy. Hundreds of thousands \nof people have been driven from their homes. Thousands may have died. \nThe destruction along the Gulf Coast is extensive, and much of New \nOrleans is still submerged. We must continue to place the highest \npriority on providing food, clothing, and shelter for the people \ndisplaced by the hurricane.\n  At the same time, we must start to take measures to address other \nconsequences of the damage caused by Katrina. Katrina has damaged a \nnumber of oil refineries along the Gulf Coast, knocking out about ten \npercent of our daily gasoline production. Current estimates are that it \nwill take several months before production is restored to pre-hurricane \nlevels.\n  Gasoline prices have skyrocketed in the wake of Katrina. Last Friday, \nthe average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Michigan reached \n$3.13. Today the national average is about $3.05 per gallon. These \nprices are record highs in the United States. Even adjusted for \ninflation, these prices are higher than they were during the energy \ncrises of the 1970s, when high energy prices helped push the economy \ninto a recession.\n  For most people, driving the car each day is not a luxury but a \nnecessity. Millions of Americans depend upon affordable gasoline and \nother petroleum products for essential goods and services, including \ntransportation to and from work, schools, grocery stores, and medical \ncare; home heating oil; jet fuel for the other airlines; and a host of \nother daily needs.\n  Most people cannot drive less to get to work, school, or to buy \ngroceries, so they are forced to pay whatever the oil companies charge \nfor gasoline. In the language of economics, demand for gasoline is \nlargely inelastic. Higher prices will not lead to a reduction in \ndemand, or an increase in speed of repairs, since pre-Katrina \nproduction and profits were already at record levels and were more than \nsufficient to provide a major incentive to speed up repairs.\n  Moreover, the massive and unjustified gasoline price increases of the \nlast week will not bring on more supply--only more profits for oil \ncompanies, as well as severe hardships for millions of Americans. \nHigher prices will not bring on additional supply, in the short term, \nonly more profits for the oil companies and more pain for consumers.\n  I do not favor price controls when the market is working properly. In \na properly functioning market, prices are set by the law of supply and \ndemand.\n  However, in the current situation, we do not have a properly \nfunctioning market. Part of the market infrastructure has been \nphysically destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Price cannot play its normal \nrole under the laws of supply and demand because increasing prices \ncannot produce either an increase in supply short-term or a significant \nreduction in demand. In a largely inelastic market, like our gasoline \nmarkets, where people depend upon gasoline for life's necessities, and \ncannot significantly reduce their consumption, increasing prices in the \naftermath of a disaster serve no function other than to enrich the \nsellers at the expense of the buyers.\n  At a time of national crisis and tragedy, it is unseemly for a few to \ngain huge profits at the expense of everyone else. In the wake of the \nhurricane, millions of Americans are opening their hearts and homes to \naid to the victims of the hurricane. It is unfair for a few to gain \nhuge profits while many others are sacrificing.\n  A frequent comment in recent discussions about the effectiveness of \nprice controls is ``Price controls didn't work in the 1970s.'' However, \nprice controls in the 1970s were imposed for long periods of time, \nseveral years in fact. In the current situation, we are talking about a \nmuch shorter period of freeze--indeed I am urging a temporary freeze \nuntil supplies are restored to pre-hurricane levels. Until then, the \nmarket cannot function properly: supply cannot be increased no matter \nhow high the price. Hence, the experience of the 1970s is not relevant \nto the current situation.\n  Under the bill I am introducing, once the market is restored to its \npre-hurricane condition, the authority in this bill to freeze prices \nwould expire.\n  There is a recent precedent for this action. In 2001, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission imposed price caps on the wholesale price \nof electricity in California and other western markets in times when \ndemand outstripped supply. FERC found the market was ``dysfunctional'' \nunder these circumstances and price controls were necessary to provide \n``just and reasonable'' rates for consumers.\n  President Bush supported FERC's price controls in the California \nelectricity market. In so doing, the President referred to FERC's \naction as a ``market-based mitigation plan'' rather than price \ncontrols. Whatever the name, however, the effect was the same: when \nsupply was inadequate to meet demand, the FERC stepped in to cap prices \nto keep rates just and reasonable.\n  The legislation I am introducing would provide the President with the \nauthority to temporarily freeze the price of gasoline and other refined \nproducts at or below the levels that prevailed before Hurricane Katrina \nhit the Gulf Coast of the United States. This authority would terminate \nwhen the President determines that the domestic supply of refined \npetroleum products meets or exceeds the level of domestic supply before \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hurricane Katrina Emergency \n     Temporary Energy Price Freeze Act of 2005.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The Congress hereby finds that--\n       (1) Hurricane Katrina has caused extensive damage to \n     petroleum production, refining and transportation facilities, \n     and extensive damage to port facilities and electricity \n     generation facilities, causing additional shutdowns of \n     refineries and loss of transportation capacity for petroleum \n     products;\n       (2) the shutdown of refineries and reduction in \n     transportation capacity for petroleum products caused by \n     Hurricane Katrina has led to massive price increases for \n     petroleum products throughout the United States;\n       (3) these massive price increases have caused severe \n     hardships for millions of Americans who depend upon \n     affordable and adequate supplies of gasoline and petroleum \n     products for transportation and other daily necessities; and\n       (4) these massive price increases threaten the availability \n     and affordability of many products in interstate commerce.\n       (b) To address these problems caused by Hurricane Katrina, \n     the President should temporarily freeze the price of gasoline \n     and other petroleum products to reduce the burden on millions \n     of Americans and interstate commerce from rapidly increasing \n     prices of gasoline and other petroleum products.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO FREEZE PRICES.\n\n       (a) The President is authorized to issue such orders and \n     regulations to temporarily freeze wholesale and retail prices \n     of gasoline and other petroleum products at or below the \n     levels prevailing on August 27, 2005. Such orders and \n     regulations may provide for the making of such adjustments as \n     may be necessary to prevent any gross inequities.\n       (b) The President may delegate the performance of any \n     function under this Act to such officers, departments, and \n     agencies of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Whoever willfully violates any order or regulation \n     under this section shall be fined an amount up to three times \n     the amount of the gain from such violation.\n       (b) The President, or any person delegated authority under \n     this Act by the President, shall have authority to seek a \n     temporary or permanent injunction in the proper United States \n     district court to prevent or halt violations of orders or \n     regulations issued under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n       The authority under this Act shall terminate upon a finding \n     by the President that the\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\n     domestic supply of petroleum products meets or exceeds the \n     level of domestic supply as of August 27, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1630. A bill to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nestablish the National Emergency Family Locator System; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to provide some \nassistance to those tens of thousands of Americans who have found \nthemselves in one of the worst nightmares I can imagine--they are \nseparated from their spouses, their children, and their parents. These \nAmericans are struggling to locate their loved ones displaced by the \nhorrors of Hurricane Katrina. They are searching the Astrodome, combing \nthe Internet, hoping that their family members have survived the storm \nand will get in touch with them. A similar plight is faced by those \nvictims who have weathered the storm and want to tell their family and \nfriends that they are okay.\n  I have received dozens of calls to my offices in Illinois from \nconstituents asking my caseworkers to help them locate their relatives \nlost in the Gulf Coast. Greta from Chicago was looking for her Aunt \nPerra Lee. John from Romeoville was looking for his children and \ngrandchildren in Biloxi. The calls kept coming, but my staff could only \npoint these constituents to various nonprofit organizations doing their \nbest to provide locator services. There was no centralized Federal \nGovernment system in place to deal with this issue. Such a system \nshould be in place.\n  The government must provide these people with a means to let their \nfamilies know that they are out of harm's way. Various non-profit \norganizations and news services have done a stellar job at using the \nInternet to connect displaced people with their families. Our \ngovernment, through the Department of Homeland Security, should \nsynthesize the best aspects of these services, so that after an \nemergency, displaced individuals can call one phone number or go to one \nwebsite, and post their location and condition. Family members and law \nenforcement officials should be able use this same secure, centralized \nsystem to check the status of missing loved ones.\n  I am introducing a bill--the National Emergency Family Locator System \nAct that will instruct the Department of Homeland Security to create \nsuch a system. I hope that the next time our country experiences a \ndisaster like Katrina, this system will provide worried families with \nsome sense of relief.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follow:\n\n                                S. 1630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Emergency Family \n     Locator Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n       (2) Emergency.--The term ``emergency'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     5122).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security.\n       (4) System.--The term ``System'' means the National \n     Emergency Family Locator System established under section \n     3(a).\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL EMERGENCY FAMILY LOCATOR SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish within \n     the Department the National Family Locator System.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the System are--\n       (1) to enable individuals displaced by an emergency to \n     provide to the Department the name and location of the \n     displaced individuals and any other relevant information \n     using the telephone, the Internet, and other means determined \n     to be appropriate by the Secretary; and\n       (2) to enable the Department--\n       (A) to compile the information collected under paragraph \n     (1); and\n       (B) to provide the information collected and compiled under \n     the System to the family members of the displaced individuals \n     and law enforcement officials.\n       (c) Considerations.--In establishing the System under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall take into account and, to \n     the maximum extent practicable, incorporate into the System--\n       (1) intermediary-based locator systems such as the National \n     Next of Kin Registry; and\n       (2) information from existing family locator databases, \n     such as the Family News Network of the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/07/senate-section/article/S9737-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9737-S9738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 234--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF WILLIAM H.
