Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2611, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2611) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 4064, to amend title 4, United States \n     Code, to declare English as the national language of the \n     United States and to promote the patriotic integration of \n     prospective U.S. citizens.\n\n\n               Recognition of the Acting Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are on the immigration bill. We have a \nlineup of amendments which we are anxious to take up. We have a \nconsiderable number of amendments pending on both sides of the aisle. \nOur lead amendment is the one to be offered by Senator Kennedy. The \namendment has now been reviewed, and I think it may be necessary to \nhave a little extra time, which ought not to pose a problem since the \nvote will not occur until 10 o'clock. But Senator Cornyn would like 10 \nminutes of time, and Senator Kyl may want a little time, so my \nsuggestion would be that, if the Senator from Massachusetts wants to \nstart the debate, that would be agreeable. It is his amendment, \nobviously. We would then turn to Senator Cornyn for 10 minutes.\n  I would like to put other Senators on notice that we want to proceed \nwith the other amendments. Senator Inhofe is next in line, then Senator \nAkaka, Senator Ensign, Senator Nelson, Senator Vitter, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Kyl, and Senator Chambliss. It would be appreciated if those \nSenators would come here at least 15 minutes ahead of the anticipated \ntime their amendment will come up so that we could move right along and \nnot lose floor time.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we look forward to this. What was, then, \nthe time allocation requested? Is it 25, 10, 10, 5? Is that what the \nSenator suggested?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Ten for Senator Cornyn, ten for Senator Kyl, and I would \nlike five.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So that is 25.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I think we would get 15.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we just received word that Senator Dorgan \nwants 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Have we added all that up?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Suppose we divide the time equally.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the agreement, it is 20 minutes, \nequally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the two managers want \nthat modified. Rather than 20 minutes on this amendment, it will be 55 \nminutes, the time evenly divided between now and 10. I ask unanimous \nconsent for that modification.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is acceptable.\n  Mr. REID. No second-degree amendments would be in order?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Agreed.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Time \nis equally divided between now and 10 a.m, and there will be no second-\ndegree amendments.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if Senator Cornyn would like to begin the \ndebate, I yield 10 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, less than 24 hours after the Senate voted \nto protect American workers and to put them first when it comes to \ncompetition for jobs in this country, the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas now offered an amendment that would literally gut the amendment \nthat was adopted yesterday and put American workers in the back seat \nand foreign workers who wanted to come here and participate in a guest \nworker program in the front seat.\n  President Bush has spoken time and time again about a guest worker \nprogram that matches willing workers with willing employers. But \nSenator Kennedy's amendment would do nothing of the kind. It would \nallow people\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nto come to the United States and to self-petition without having an \nemployer sponsor their petition, and it would not require proof that an \nAmerican citizen is unavailable to perform that type of job.\n  Yesterday, the Senate--wisely, in my view--changed the underlying \nbill to require that American workers be put first before a guest \nworker could be provided a job and that, under the provisions of this \nbill, No. 1, they had to identify a job so they would not be here \nunemployed; and No. 2, that job first be offered to qualified American \nworkers. Then, in that event no American workers were found available \nto perform that job, of course the guest worker provisions of the bill \nwould kick in.\n  To make matters worse, the Kennedy amendment would allow an alien who \nhas worked a total of less than 40 days in the United States--yes, that \nis about 6 days a year--to obtain a green card. That employment, 1 day \nout of every 60, could be self-employment. For some, that track record \nof employment should be sufficient evidence that the worker is \ninvaluable to the American economy. What that means is that up to \n200,000 unskilled workers a year would be eligible for a green card, \nirrespective of economic conditions, irrespective of whether that \nworker has actually been employed for the preceding 4 years and, most \nimportantly, irrespective of whether there are unemployed U.S. workers \navailable to fill those jobs.\n  Senator Kennedy had suggested that, by requiring an employer to \ndetermine that a qualified worker is not available, that would somehow \nsubject foreign workers to exploitation. But let me be clear: Worker \nexploitation and abuse will not be tolerated under our laws and should \nnot be tolerated under any circumstances. This amendment has nothing to \ndo with protecting foreign workers against exploitation. What it has \neverything to do with is whether we are protecting American workers \nfirst.\n  With that, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I opposed the amendment from the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas yesterday because I believe there ought to be an opportunity \nfor the immigrant himself or herself to file the petition. The \namendment now pending by Senator Kennedy would leave it optional, leave \nthe alternative: to be filed by the employer or to be filed by the \nimmigrant. The vote yesterday was 50 to 48, and I was tempted to move \nto reconsider--I would have to change my vote to do that--but decided \nin the alternative that we would discuss the subject today with a \ndifferent amendment.\n  The issue of not having the immigrant subject to the control of the \nemployer is an important one, to see to it that the immigrant is \ntreated fairly. When the Senator from Texas seeks to be sure the \nimmigrant has a job so that the employer has to make the application \nand the job will not be taken from some other American, I can \nunderstand his point. But I think there is a higher value in not having \nthe immigrant subject to the control of the employer, where there may \nbe coercion and pressure as to the amount of compensation or as to \nworking conditions, notwithstanding any other provision of law. There \nis ample protection that citizenship will not be granted, or the \nprocess will not move forward, because the Kennedy amendment simply \ngives the immigrant the right to file a petition. After the petition \nand the efforts are made to get into the citizenship line, it will be \nevaluated by the appropriate authorities. I think the concerns Senator \nCornyn has in mind will be met.\n  I notice Senator Dorgan has come to the floor, and time has been \nreserved for Senator Dorgan--10 minutes. I yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the discussion this morning is once again \non a subject called guest workers. I don't happen to think we ought to \nhave a guest worker provision in this legislation. The discussion now \nis, if it exists in the legislation, what are the conditions under \nwhich guest workers can petition for citizenship, and so on and so \nforth. I hope we are not done with the question of whether there should \nbe so-called guest workers or, as some call it, future flow, the soft-\nsounding words. They could call it tourism for all that matters.\n  What this is about is grafting onto this bill to deal with the \nquestion of illegal immigrants coming into this country--because we \nhave quotas, and those who come in illegally are a pretty serious \nproblem, the 11 million or 12 million people we think are here \nillegally--this is grafting onto this bill that deals with illegal \nimmigration a proposal that people who live outside this country and \nhave not come to this country before now are to come into this country \nas so-called guest workers or future flow. What are those people going \nto do? They are going to come into this country and they are going to \nwork. It is as if the 11 million or 12 million are not enough, we need \nmore.\n  The original proposition by the President was an unlimited number. \nThe original proposition in the bill brought to the floor of the Senate \nwas 400,000 a year, plus a 20-percent escalator. I tried to knock that \nout, and my amendment got clobbered, so I was unsuccessful. My \ncolleague from New Mexico took the 400,000 down to 200,000. Actually, \nthe substitute bill took it down to 325,000, then down to 200,000. \nHowever you calculate it, we are talking about millions of people who \ndo not live in this country, who live outside of this country, who will \ncome into this country for the purpose of taking jobs.\n  Here is the strategy. The strategy in the country these days, and it \nis a strategy embraced on the floor of this Chamber, is to export good \njobs and import cheap labor. I don't hear any discussion on the floor \nof this Senate about American workers--none. You can go to the \nnewspapers and see a discussion. You can see the headlines about \nAmerican workers who are losing their jobs because their employers are \nmoving the jobs to China or Bangladesh or Indonesia or Sri Lanka; and \nyes, some of those Americans are finding other jobs, and the headlines \nalso tell us those jobs pay less than the jobs we used to have. We lost \n3 million to 4 million jobs in just the last 4 or 5 years.\n  Alan Blinder, a very respectable mainstream economist, former Vice \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has just written a piece and \nsaid this: This issue of exporting American jobs even as there is this \nurge to import cheap labor--he said this about exporting American \njobs--he said there are 42 to 54 million American jobs subject to \noffshoring.\n  He said 41 to 54 million American jobs are subject to being moved out \nof this country in search of cheaper labor--at 33 cents an hour in \nChina, perhaps Indonesia, Sri Lanka, wherever they would move to. He \nsaid that not all of the 40 million to 50 million jobs will leave this \ncountry by employers, not all will be moved out of this country by \nemployers, but even those who stay are subject to the competition of \nlower wages abroad. Therefore, there will be lower wages, less health \ncare, less benefits, and less retirement benefits.\n  That future for the American worker on one side, and on the other \nside we have this urge to import cheap labor.\n  Where does that urge come from? My understanding is the price the \nChamber of Commerce requires to support this bill is that there be \nadditional guest workers attached to it.\n  What is the purpose of that? That is the purpose of bringing in the \nback door folks who are willing to assume the bottom-end jobs.\n  The President and others say these are jobs the American people will \nnot take. I don't think that is the case at all. They may not want to \ntake them at current wages, at the bottom of the economic scale. We \nhaven't changed the minimum wage for nearly 9 years. This Congress will \nnot change the minimum wage. The President doesn't support it. If we \nchange the minimum wage and perhaps pay what the jobs are worth at the \nlower economic level, at the bottom of the economic ladder, perhaps \nthen we wouldn't need to import cheap labor. This is about importing \ncheap labor on the back side. That is what guest workers is all about. \nI know they call it ``future flow'' and guest workers. It is not about \nmaking 11 million to 12 million people legal\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nwho are already here illegally. But more needs to be done. Allowing \npeople who would normally be illegal and stamping them as ``legal'' is \nkind of a ``let's pretend'' approach.\n  I understand the Senate has already voted on my amendment, and I lost \npretty handily, as a matter of fact. But I think there is more to do on \nthis. The bill is still open for amendment. For example, we have a so-\ncalled guest worker provision which says let's pretend that illegal \nimmigration is legal immigration. Should we have that provision that \nlasts forever and is permanent, or should we sunset it after a few \nyears and have a real honest study by people who might evaluate how \nmany Americans are losing their jobs as a result of this back door, \ncheap labor coming as replacement workers?\n  How many Americans are losing their jobs? I see very little \ndiscussion on the floor of this Senate in this debate about immigration \nwhich, after all, is all about jobs, among other things. I see very \nlittle discussion and Members standing up on the floor of the Senate \nsaying: Let us wonder what this means to American workers. What does it \nmean to the steel worker? What does it mean to the punch press \noperator, to the fabricator or how about the farmer? What does it mean \nto manufacturing? Very few people are talking about American workers. \nIt is all about immigration and how many additional guest workers we \ncan bring into this country under this piece of legislation.\n  My understanding is that we will be on this bill for another week. \nThat will give us time to revisit this so-called guest worker provision \nand see if we can write a piece of legislation--yes--which deals \nsensitively, without diminishing the dignity and worth of others who \nhave been here some long while. Some have been here for 25 years. Some \nimmigrants came here many years ago. They have children and \ngrandchildren here. I don't want to, in any way, diminish their worth \nor their dignity or their value. We should deal with them in a way that \nis sensitive.\n  I don't think this Senate should jump on the notion advanced by \nbusiness interests and the Chamber and others that we don't have enough \ncheap labor in this country, and we need to bring more through the back \ndoor as we are exporting good jobs abroad.\n  You talk about a recipe for economic trouble ahead, probably not for \nthe people who wear blue suits in the morning and wear neckties all day \nand have jobs such as Senators and Congressmen. I do not know of \nanybody in this Chamber who has lost a job because their job was \noutsourced. Nobody here has lost their job because their job has been \noutsourced. It is other folks--folks working on the manufacturing line \nsomeplace, and they are called up one day and are told: You know what, \nour entire company is leaving. We are going to China because you can \nproduce an Etch A Sketch in China for much less money. But the jobs \nhave gone to China. Etch A Sketch is one example of hundreds of \nexamples of jobs that go to China.\n  Those are the folks who pay the price. Those are the folks who have \nthe burden of this sort of new economy. The ``world is flat'' economy--\nmove American jobs to China. The other folks who stay here, the folks \nwho work at the bottom rung of the economic ladder, struggling to \nadvance and pay their bills and take care of their families, they are \nnow told: By the way, we also need to not just export jobs, but we need \nto import cheap labor.\n  I think is a recipe for disaster for this country. I don't think it \nworks.\n  Our country became a great country and a world economic power because \nwe built a burgeoning middle class, and that middle class had good jobs \nthat paid well. There is no social program in this country as important \nas the good job that pays well, which allows people to work and take \ncare of their families. There is no social program as important as \nthat. These good jobs are shrinking away. You can go through the entire \nlist, industry after industry, telling workers: We are going to move \nyour job elsewhere, and we are going to shrink the jobs that remain \nhere to $8 or $10 an hour. And by the way, what we would like to do is \nbring people through the back door whom we might be able to employ for \n$6 or $7 an hour.\n  That is the construct which is occurring throughout the country \ntoday, and I think it is fundamentally wrong.\n  My hope is we continue these discussions about guest workers. We will \nhave other opportunities to offer amendments. I will have some, and \nperhaps we can get back to where we should be and that is dealing with \nthe central question of our country's border; protect us first against \nterrorism; and, second, to enforce the quotas we have that allow people \nto come into this country legally. We have quotas with which we \naccomplish that. Seal this country's border so we have border \nprotection and an orderly flow of people in and out of this country; \nand, second, enforce standards against employers that routinely and \nknowingly hire illegal workers.\n  I was here when we passed Simpson-Mazzoli. In fact, I went back and \nreread some of the debate on the floor of the Senate and House.\n\n  What was said was we are fixing immigration. Back then, there really \nwas amnesty. Amnesty was given to a good number of millions of illegal \nimmigrants. We said to employers: Don't you dare hire illegal workers. \nIf people come into this country illegally to take Americans' jobs, \ndon't you dare hire them. If you do, you will be subject to fines and \npenalties that are significant.\n  Guess what. There has been no enforcement at all. Last year, one \ncompany was subject to enforcement action in the entire United States \nof America; the year before, three companies in the entire United \nStates. The message implies Katy bar the door; hire illegals if you \nlike; pay substandard wages because they are illegal; don't worry, \nnobody is going to look; nobody is going to fine you; and nobody is \ngoing to enforce the law.\n  That is why this entire thing has failed. Twenty years later, we have \nthe same language. You can change the names and it is the same \nlanguage--going to get tough, going to fix this issue.\n  The fact is, if we don't decide, first, to secure our borders and, \nsecond, to have real sanctions against those who want to hire illegal \nimmigrants for substandard wages, this will not work. All we are doing \nis playing let's pretend. We play that often around here. It is not \ngoing to work.\n  What we ought to do is stare truth in the eye on this issue and \ndecide that we are going to do what is necessary to evaluate what the \nimmigration issue is, how to fix it and go about the business of doing \nit. Instead, there is all this energy to see not only how we deal with \nthe immigration issue but how we add a new guest worker program to \nbring people into this country who otherwise would be illegal and how \ndo we bring new people into this country to take the jobs that American \nworkers need. That doesn't make much sense to me, and it is not a \nproposition that I can support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire as to the regular order and the \ntime agreement reached on the next few amendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time agreement on the next two \namendments? The Senator is informed there is no time agreement on the \nnext amendments. The time agreement is on the current amendment, but no \nfurther amendments are subject to a time agreement.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And the vote will take place at 10 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This vote will take place at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the next amendment coming up will be the \namendment we refer to as the English national language amendment. Since \nthere is some time right now, unless someone else wants the floor, I \ncan discuss what it is all about.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is equally divided on the current \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I inquire, is someone requesting time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have until 10 o'clock, and that time is divided.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 12 minutes left for the majority \nand 17 minutes remaining for the majority.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wants to speak for a few minutes, we can \narrange that. I will withhold.\n  Mr. INHOFE. As I understand it, on our side there is 17 minutes \nremaining, is that correct, and I can use a few minutes?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we split the time between 9 and 10 \no'clock, but it was on the pending amendment. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has yet to call up the amendment. The only speakers who \nhave been heard have been in opposition to the amendment, but the \namendment has not yet itself been called up.\n  I want to make sure the balance of the time reserved is still \npreserved so we do not lose an opportunity to respond to the debate by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The current order is the vote will take \nplace at 10 o'clock, but the time between then and now is roughly 16 \nminutes for the majority and 12 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I ask unanimous consent we defer the vote at 10 \nclock until 10:05?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for that generous offer. I will not \nmake any comments at this time and will wait until our amendment is up. \nWe will discuss it then.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4066\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     and Mr. McCain, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4066.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the conditions under which an H-2C nonimmigrant may \n                    apply for adjustment of status)\n\n       On page 295, after line 16 insert the following:\n\n     or\n       ``(iv) the Secretary of Labor determines and certifies that \n     there are not sufficient United States workers who are able, \n     willing, qualified, and available to fill the position in \n     which the alien is, or will be, employed; and\n       ``(v) the alien submits at least 2 documents to establish \n     current employment, as follows:\n\n       ``(I) Records maintained by the Social Security \n     Administration.\n       ``(II) Records maintained by the alien's employer, such as \n     pay stubs, time sheets, or employment work verification.\n       ``(III) Records maintained by the Internal Revenue Service.\n       ``(IV) Records maintained by any other government agency, \n     such as worker compensation records, disability records, or \n     business licensing records.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls 11 minutes 45 seconds, \nand the majority controls 15 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 11 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, yesterday the Senate voted to \neliminate the H-2C immigrant's ability to self-petition for green cards \nafter 4 years. I believe that vote was a mistake because it will have a \ndevastating effect not just for temporary workers but for all workers \nand, basically, for all Americans.\n  The amendment we offer today would correct the mistake and take the \ngood language from the Cornyn amendment to improve the underlying bill. \nThis amendment will require that the Labor Department certify that no \nU.S. worker will be displaced by H-2C workers when they adjust to \npermanent status, as the Cornyn amendment requires. This amendment also \nrestores the ability of H-2C workers to obtain a green card without \nbeing dependent on the generosity of the employers.\n  The self-petition feature of our temporary worker program is \ninnovative and essential to workers' rights. All Americans lose if it \nis eliminated from the bill.\n  The reason temporary worker programs failed in the past, going back \nto the time of the Bracero Program, is because they did not protect \nworkers' rights. For this new program to work without harming U.S. \nworkers, H-2C workers must have the full set of rights. That is why our \nbill includes extensive labor protections for temporary workers.\n  Effectively, then, at the time after the 4 years, the individual will \nbe able to make the petition for the green card, and they will also \nhave to have a certification by the Department of Labor that there is \nno American able and willing to perform that job. There will have to be \nthat kind of a finding. The self-petition gives that worker some rights \nand respect as an employee instead of being subject to the dangers we \nhave seen in the past of exploitation by an employer that knows that \nworker can never get a chance to have a petition and can never get on \nthe path for a green card without the employer giving the thumbs-up \nsignal.\n  When that power relationship between the employer and the employee \nexists, we have seen exploitation in terms of wages, working \nconditions, and other unfortunate problems with regard to women.\n  This seems to be a solid compromise. It takes the framework of the \nCornyn amendment, but it will also ensure that these petitioners are \ngoing to have to demonstrate there is that gap in terms of the labor \nmarket that they are able to fill and that there is not someone out \nthere in the American labor market prepared to take that job. It seems \nto me to be a very important principle, a very concrete proposal, one I \nhope we can have accepted this morning.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Kennedy is proposing \nguts the worker protection amendment agreed to by the Senate yesterday. \nIt would do so by allowing workers to self-petition for legal permanent \nresidency if they produce some documents which might indicate they are \ncurrently employed, but they will be necessarily retrospective in \nnature. In other words, you do not have a document necessarily that \nshows you are employed today or will be employed tomorrow. You may have \na pay stub from the last week or the last month. So there is no way to \ndetermine whether the individuals who are self-petitioning, under this \nproposal by the Senator from Massachusetts, are actually going to be \nworking.\n  No. 2, if they are working, there is no protection for American \nworkers--first, that the Secretary of Labor certify that there were no \nsufficient U.S. workers willing, able, and qualified to perform those \njobs.\n  If the proponents of this bill are serious when they say that certain \nprovisions are needed because immigrants will do work that Americans \nwon't do, then they should support the amendment agreed to yesterday \nand vote against the amendment that has been proposed this morning.\n  President Bush, again, has said the concept of a temporary worker \nprogram is to provide additional legal workforce for jobs that there \nare not enough Americans to perform. Yet this proposed amendment simply \nsidesteps that requirement entirely.\n  It further represents a shell game insofar as it would only require \nthose workers in this country during an initial 4-year period to work \nabout 6 days a year in order to obtain a green card.\n  This is about truth in advertising. If, in fact, the bill is going to \nrepresent something even close to what we have been told the purpose of \nit is, as represented, we need to make sure the actual language of the \nbill conforms to that and not pull a fast one on the American people by \ntaking away the\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nvery protection for American workers that the proponents of this bill \nhave said are an important part of their legislation.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 3 minutes for the membership, if they have a \nchance to review the amendment.\n  On page 1, second paragraph:\n\n       The Secretary of Labor determines and certifies that there \n     are not sufficient United States workers who are able, \n     willing, qualified, and available to fill the position in \n     which the alien is, or will be employed. . . .\n\n  So the Secretary of Labor has to make the certification that they \nwill not be replacing an American worker.\n  Then, how are they going to be able to give the assurance they have \nhad the 4 years that are included in the first paragraph, that ``the \nalien has maintained such nonimmigrant status in the United States for \na cumulative period of not less than 4 years of employment''?\n  These are listed and include: records maintained by Social Security, \nrecords maintained by the employer, employment work verification, \nrecords maintained by the Internal Revenue Service, records maintained \nby other government agencies.\n  What we are saying, in the four different categories, those \ncategories are government-held records or the employer-held records, \nnot the employee-held records.\n  I don't know how it could be much clearer exactly what this amendment \ndoes. It is very clear. It is the certification that there is no \nAmerican that is able, willing, and qualified. And to be able to prove \nit, there are government-held records or employer-held records, not the \npetitioner's records, not his stubs, but government-held records.\n  We have tried to craft this in a way which is going to be fair. We \nare not interested in people trying to ``jimmy'' the system. We have \nhad too much of that in the past.\n  I get back to the final theme. This legislation tries to learn from \npast experience. In 1986, we had amnesty but there was supposed to be \ntough employer sanctions if they hired unemployed. We had vast \nindustries that produced fake identification cards. The system never \nfunctioned. It never worked.\n  What we have tried to do is avoid that. We have a tamper-proof card. \nWe will have vigorous employment. But, also, to learn the lessons of \nthe Bracero Program, we are not going to have the exploitation of these \nworkers by their employers. That is what we do when we deny the \nopportunity of an employee ever to be able to make a petition. We say \nyou have to be in there for 4 years, with solid record of employment, \nsolid record of achievement, solid record of commitment to work. Then \nyou can make your petition. You have to meet that requirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 13 minutes remaining, and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I rise in support of this amendment. It is an important \namendment.\n  I point out that I appreciate very much the efforts of Senator Cornyn \nand Senator Kyl to have a respectful debate on this issue. We have \nhonestly held views, and I am very appreciative of the level of this \ndebate and our discussion not only in the Senate but in the cloakroom \nas we have worked out a number of differences we have had in a mutual \neffort to come up with legislation which is appropriate to the future \nof America.\n  The language in the amendment is identical to what we passed last \nnight, only this amendment adds an additional paragraph giving the \nalien more of an opportunity to prove their current work status. If we \nallow people to gain permanent residency, we want them to be hard-\nworking, upstanding individuals. The amendment allows illegal \nimmigrants to prove, through the use of valid government documents--we \nwould be more than happy to define ``valid government documents'' more \ncarefully in report language or in additional amendments--they should \nhave, we believe, an opportunity with secure, government-issued \ndocuments that they can prove they are eligible.\n  This is an important right they should be given. It releases them \nfrom the possibility of the bondage of an employer who would like to \nkeep them in the status of which they are. That would only apply to a \nfew, but this is a necessary addition.\n  The original Cornyn-Kyl amendment does not mandate that the employer \nattest they will employ this individual in the future, only that they \nemploy them currently. This is an important amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification that the \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Arizona have made. This \nlanguage has been somewhat fluid, and now I have it in front of me. I \nthink I understand it, and I think I understand what the differences \nare between our two arguments.\n  Basically, it does retain a certification requirement by the \nDepartment of Labor. But the one who decides what the job requirements \nare and whether the foreign worker actually meets those job \nrequirements is the worker him or herself and not an employer. This is, \nI believe, insufficient to protect American workers because, \nessentially, the foreign worker is the judge of his own abilities and \nalso the judge of the job requirement for which the Department of Labor \nis supposed to certify there are not sufficient Americans available to \nperform. I think it bears, if not the same, I would say similar defects \nto the original underlying bill that was amended yesterday to reinsert \nAmerican worker protections.\n  Let me speak a minute or two about the nature of what this position \nis. We are now talking, as Senator Dorgan said, about the so-called \nfuture flow, people who are not here yet. This has been described as a \nguest worker program. Senator Kyl and I will be offering an alternative \nto this so-called guest worker program which we describe as a temporary \nworker program because I believe this guest worker program is misnamed, \nmischaracterized, and is in no sense a guest worker program. That is \nbecause when you invite guests into your home, you expect at some point \nthey might actually leave.\n  Under this guest worker program, as designed, that never happens. It \ninvites as many as 200,000 individuals a year, under the Bingaman \namendment, who can then come into the United States and work for a \nperiod of 4 years, and then, under the approach by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, self-petition for legal permanent residency and then get \nin line for American citizenship without regard to whether the American \neconomy is in a boom or a bust. In times when the economy is very flat \nor when we are in recession, it is much more likely that American \nworkers are going to be competing with foreign workers admitted under \nthis so-called guest worker program.\n  I do believe calling this a guest worker program, when in fact it is \na path to a legal permanent residency and citizenship, is a misnomer. \nIn addition to damaging the prospects of American workers during times \nwhen our economy is not doing well and when there are not a lot of jobs \navailable, it also hurts countries such as Mexico and Central American \ncountries that have seen a massive exodus of their hard-working \ncitizens to the United States, never to return.\n  What we need to do, for the benefit of America as well as the benefit \nof countries such as Mexico and those in Central America, is to \nreinstate this historical notion of circular migration; in other words, \ncreate a framework where people can come to the United States, qualify \nto work for a period of time, and then return home with the savings and \nskills they have acquired working in the United States.\n  A person who works at even modest pay in the United States under a \ntemporary worker program can, in many\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\ninstances, go back home and live like a king in some of these \ncountries, where their money goes a lot further and where their \ninvestment in a home or a small business will thereby create \nopportunity not just for them but also other citizens in those other \ncountries.\n  I believe if we are ever going to narrow the gap between \nopportunities available in countries such as Mexico and those in \nCentral America and South America and other countries--which is the \nbasic reason why people leave to come to the United States, to find \njobs and work, and we all understand why--we need to find some way of \nreinstating this pattern of circular migration so people do maintain \ntheir contacts and ties with their country and their culture and their \nfamily because otherwise we will never be able to satisfactorily \naddress this phenomenon of illegal immigration, no matter what kind of \ncaps we put on it, no matter how many folks we put on the border, no \nmatter whether we build an actual wall or a virtual wall.\n  Unless we find some way of reducing the development gap between \ncountries that are the net exporters of human labor and a country such \nas America, which is the importer of human labor from all over the \nworld, we are never going to get to the bottom of this problem.\n  So that is another reason why I believe this amendment should be \ndefeated. We will have further discussion later on transforming, I \nhope, the so-called guest worker program to a true temporary worker \nprogram and reinstating circular migration in a way that both benefits \nAmerica and benefits those countries from which those workers come.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have tried to point out this will be a \njudgment decision that will be made by the Secretary of Labor as to \nwhether there is an American fit, willing, and able. And if there is, \nthey cannot petition.\n  Now, the Senator says: Well, it is all then up to the employee. But \nthe idea of the whole guest worker is the employer. Why is it good for \nthe employer, who is going to go out and petition and say: Look, I need \nsomeone to come work for me. They advertise for 45 days. Then they find \nout they have someone from overseas who will do that. So the employer \nis the one who is petitioning there. Didn't have any problem with that.\n  Now, when we get into the situation after 4 years, they can make the \npetition on this, if there is a vacancy, according to this proposal, \nbut if there is not a green card available, they do not get it. They \nmight have to wait a year. They might have to indicate 2 years. This is \nnot automatic. There are only a certain number of green cards that are \navailable under this category. They may wait 1 year. They may have to \nwait 2 years. So it is much more difficult. This is still weighted far \nagainst the worker than the employer.\n  What we were always trying to do in the development of the \nlegislation is to have balance and fairness in terms of the authority \nand responsibility and the legality on this. I think what we have \noffered addresses what I understood to be the Senator's concern; that \nis, that there are going to be American workers out there when this \nperson is getting a green card. Therefore, it is going to be adverse to \nthe American workers. We say, if there is one, they don't get it. That \nis decided by the Secretary of Labor. And they have to be able to prove \ntheir work history through documents and records that are either held \nby the Government or by the employer. It seems to me that is about as \nlock safe and secure as you can have in this business. I would hope we \nwould accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  There is 7 minutes remaining in opposition to the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the amendment that was adopted yesterday is a \ngood amendment. I would hate to see us undo what we did yesterday with \nthe Kennedy amendment. Therefore, I rise in opposition to it.\n  What we are talking about is self-petitioning by an illegal immigrant \nfor permanent legal status in the United States--a green card--to be \nhere for the rest of their life. The circumstances in the past for that \nhad always been that either a family member petitioned you in under the \nlaw or an employer petitioned you in because he had a job for you.\n  The concept of self-petitioning is a new one in the law in this \ncontext. One of the reasons why that is critical is we are trying to \nassure that while a job may have existed for somebody in the past or \neven exists today, that job may not be available forever. The concept \nof temporary workers is just that, that when there is a job available \nfor that worker, then the worker has a temporary visa to fulfill that \njob. When that jobs goes away, and there is no longer work in that \nparticular area, then the individual's visa would expire, and it would \nnot be reissued until, once again, the work is available. That is the \nwhole concept of ``temporary.''\n  That concept is eliminated or destroyed with a part of the Kennedy \namendment. The first part of the Kennedy amendment does provide for the \nDepartment of Labor to make a determination about employment conditions \nand whether jobs are available in a particular area. But then there is \nthe word ``or'' written in at the end of section III(i). The second way \nthe alien can petition is by simply submitting documents for current \nemployment; in other words, the alien shows that he currently has a \njob. That is fine for a temporary permit. It is not fine for permanent \nlegal status.\n  What you are allowing the individual to do is to say: I have a job \ntoday temporarily, and with that I am going to petition for the right--\nand the law would then allow the individual to acquire permanent status \nin the United States, which then can lead to citizenship. The whole \npoint of temporary permits, as I said, is they reflect the economic \nconditions for the length of the permit or the visa.\n  Under the bill Senator Cornyn and I have, we have 2-year visas. What \nthe President has proposed is a 3-year visa. The bottom line is, it \nshould be no longer than necessary to ensure that if economic \nconditions change and the jobs are no longer available, that the visa \nwould expire, the individual would return home and would not get \nanother visa to come here for temporary work until the job has opened \nup again.\n  So the fact that an individual can prove he has a job today or that \nhe had a job yesterday has nothing whatsoever to do with the \navailability of employment in the future. That is the fatal flaw of \nthis amendment.\n  There needs to be an assurance that when we are talking about \npermanent legal residence, there will be a job available for that \nperson in the future, not just that the individual has a job today. So \nthat is a fatal flaw in the Kennedy amendment. I do not know whether it \nis deliberately intended. I suspect the point is to undercut the effect \nof the amendment we adopted yesterday, which is a worker protection \namendment.\n  The bottom line that Senator Cornyn is trying to assure is that if an \nAmerican has a job, that job is not undercut by somebody coming here \ntoday who would be able to stay here forever and, therefore, compete \nwith the American for the job.\n  So I think we should stick with the worker protection amendment we \nadopted yesterday and not agree to the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, is it correct we have 3 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, where we have come from since yesterday \nafternoon is, we had a basic bill that provided no protection for \nAmerican workers because it allowed foreign workers to self-petition \nwithout a job, without any type of certification there were no \nAmericans available to fill the job, and we then adopted an amendment \nthat would install some worker protections by requiring both of those \nthings: that, No. 1, there is a job available; and, No. 2, there are \nnot sufficient Americans to fill that type of job.\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\n  Now, under the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts, we have \ngone from no worker protection to what I would call illusory worker \nprotection--illusory worker protection--because this puts the decision \nto define the job requirements in the hands of the foreign worker. It \nalso puts in the hands of the foreign worker--the self-interested \nindividual, by the way, who is going to be staying or leaving depending \non whether they meet these requirements--it puts in that foreign \nworker's hands the total and unilateral determination of what the job \nrequirements are and, No. 2, whether that same foreign worker meets \nthose job requirements; whereas, for everyone else in America, it is \nthe employer who determines whether the prospective employee meets the \njob requirements.\n  The last thing I would say is, for every other category of visa, \nworker visa in America, under our naturalization and immigration \nsystem, there has to be some form of employer sponsorship. And this \ndeviates from that pattern which I believe is important, and this \nrepresents an unprecedented break with that in a way that I think \ndamages the prospects of American workers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, following this vote, the next scheduled \namendment is by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe. There are \nnegotiations in trying to work it out. They are supposedly very close. \nSo we are not sure whether we will have Senator Inhofe's amendment and \na side-by-side laid down. We will try to determine that while the vote \nis on.\n  If they are table to work it out--or immediately following that, we \nwill go to the amendment by Senator Akaka. We are going to try to work \nout time agreements so we can move the bill along on all of them.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, we are going to enforce the rules \nstrictly to 15 minutes and 5 so we can move the bill along.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that we \nare going to have our executive meeting in the President's Room. We had \nplanned to have an executive meeting at 9 o'clock this morning, but \nthen when the hearing on General Hayden was moved by the Intelligence \nCommittee from 10 to 9:30, we could not have that meeting, so we are \ngoing to have it in the President's Room immediately following this \nvote.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time having expired on debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 129 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4066) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are trying to move along. I see my \ncolleague and friend behind me, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, who has been here patiently waiting to address the Senate on this \nissue generally. That might work, as we are just trying to reaffirm the \nlanguage on this Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, may I ask the Senator from West \nVirginia how long he would like?\n  Mr. BYRD. Probably 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, that is entirely acceptable. I announce \nthat following Senator Byrd we will be going to the Inhofe amendment. I \nunderstand they are very close on an agreement. If that agreement is \nreached, then I would like to move--although I am not asking consent \nfor that now--to a 20-minute time agreement, if an agreement is \nreached, equally divided. If it is not reached, we will have side-by-\nside amendments. I alert Members as to what the schedule will be.\n  Following that, Senator Akaka is next in line, and we are considering \na time agreement there, also.\n  I have been asked when the next vote will occur. I think we can move \nthe bill most expeditiously if we continue to take up the amendments \none at a time, but after the first votes bring all the Senators in to \nstack the votes. We will have a better idea as to when we will stack \nthe votes when we have a better idea as to how many votes we will have.\n  Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee is meeting in executive session in \nthe President's Room, so I ask Judiciary Committee members to go to \nthat meeting.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Inhofe amendment is enormously \nimportant. It is complicated. Members on both sides, including the \nauthor of the amendment, are working in good faith to try to work this \nout. To my knowledge, it has not been worked out. Hopefully, after 25 \nminutes we will be able to tell the Senate whether it is worked out, \nwhether we will have to have side-by-side amendments. But at this time, \nwe will not enter into a short time agreement.\n  Hopefully, as we have been making progress in other areas, we will \nhave a chance to do that in this area as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today the Senate finds itself considering \nyet another amnesty for illegal aliens. After the defeat of a similar \namnesty proposal last month, I had hoped that the Senate had seen the \nlast of these efforts. I had hoped that the Senate, when given the time \nto consider the overwhelming opposition of the American people to \namnesty, would pass a clean border security bill like the House did \nwithout amnesty, without a guest worker program, and without an \nincrease in the annual allotment of permanent immigrant visas.\n  Sadly, the Senate is embarking on a path that contradicts everything \nwe know--everything we know--about the position of the American people \non this issue. It is an unpopular approach. It is the wrong approach.\n  The other night in his address to the Nation, the President endorsed \nthe Senate amnesty plan to award U.S. citizenship to illegal aliens, \nand he announced the deployment of up to 6,000 guardsmen to the U.S. \nborder with Mexico. The deployment of U.S. troops is intended to \nsuggest an urgency about gaining control of the border that has been \nmissing for many years, even since the September 11 attacks. \nNevertheless, I have my doubts and concerns.\n  Guardsmen have been sent overseas two times, even three times--no, \neven\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nfour times--and have come home fatigued and stressed out. They have \nbeen forced to sell businesses and to endure financial hardships \nbecause of their long absences.\n  Just a few months ago, the White House proposed to cut the National \nGuard by nearly 18,000 soldiers. The adjutants general of many States \nare reporting that they were not involved in discussions about the \ndeployment of the Guard to our borders. So what assurances are there \nthat sending troops to the border won't hamper our ability to respond \nto the floods in New England, another Hurricane Katrina, or another \nnatural disaster?\n  The National Guard might be able to lend support to our border \nsecurity, but that role must not be at the expense of the thousands of \ncommunities around the country that also depend on our Guard should \ndisasters strike those towns or counties.\n  Press reports indicate that the Guard men and women will not be \nempowered to arrest aliens who attempt to cross our borders. I cannot \nhelp but wonder if this move to detail guardsmen to our borders is a \npolitical stunt to look tough at the expense of the brave citizen-\nsoldiers who serve in the Guard.\n  The President would not have to call out the National Guard to secure \nthe borders if he had supported even some--even some--of the nine--\nnine, nine--separate amendments that I have offered since September 11 \nto hire and train more Border Patrol agents. If these amendments had \nbeen adopted--I say, if they had been adopted--the law enforcement \nagents would be in place right now helping to secure the borders.\n  Instead, the administration has consistently opposed these efforts as \nunnecessary and extraneous spending, saying that those funds would \nexpand the size of Government. When I included $400 million in the \nfiscal year 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for border security, \nthe President refused to spend it saying:\n\n       I made my opposition clear . . . We'll spend none of it.\n\n  That is what he said. That is what the President said. He said:\n\n       I made my opposition clear . . . We'll spend none of it.\n\n  As recently as last September, on a party-line vote, the majority \ndefeated an Obey-Byrd-Sabo motion in conference on the fiscal year 2006 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill to add $100 million for border \nsecurity. The administration opposed--yes, you heard me correctly--the \nadministration opposed the Byrd-Craig amendment to the fiscal year 2005 \nsupplemental appropriations bill to add $389 million for, what? For \nborder security--border security. Fortunately, the amendment was \napproved and subsequently, despite administration opposition, the \nconferees approved $274 million. And as a result, there are now 500 \nmore Border Patrol agents, 218 more immigration agents and \ninvestigators, and 1,950 more detention beds in place helping to secure \nour borders.\n  I will support any realistic effort to secure our borders, but I have \nto question the sincerity behind sham attempts that accomplish a token \npresence which only impose further hardship on our National Guard and \nmay put communities at risk from natural disasters.\n  The sense of urgency that comes with deploying the National Guard is \nbelied by the administration's consistent opposition to providing the \nnecessary resources that our border security agencies need to do their \njob. Last month, I joined Senator Gregg in offering an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for Iraq to provide $1.9 billion for \nthe Border Patrol to hire the agents and secure the equipment that they \nneed to better secure the border. The President has threatened to veto \nthe supplemental bill. It is difficult to believe that the President \nwould oppose funding our border agencies sufficiently to do the job \nthey were created to do, but that is the situation.\n  Immigration enforcement in our country remains a decidedly half-\nhearted effort. The administration claims to strengthen border security \nin one area, and then completely undermines it in another with amnesty \nproposals. That dangerous inconsistency is at the root of my opposition \nto the misguided amnesty proposal before the Senate.\n  I oppose this amnesty bill. I oppose it absolutely. I oppose it \nunequivocally. I oppose this effort to waive the rules for lawbreakers \nand to legalize the unlawful actions of undocumented workers and the \nbusinesses that illegally employ them.\n  Amnesties are the dark underbelly of our immigration process. They \ntarnish the magnanimous promise enshrined on the base of the Statue of \nLiberty. Amnesties undermine that great egalitarian and American \nprinciple that the law should apply equally and should apply fairly to \neveryone. Amnesties perniciously decree that the law shall apply to \nsome but not to all.\n  This bill would create a separate set of immigration laws for those \nwho choose not to follow the regular process that everybody else had to \ngo through. It is a slap in the face to every immigrant who had to wait \nabroad to come to American shores, and to every immigrant who had to \nstruggle and work to become a U.S. citizen.\n  It is a false promise to the many tens of millions of immigrants who \nwould be authorized to settle in the United States under this bill with \nthe infrastructure of our Nation--our schools, our health care system, \nour transportation and energy networks--increasingly unable to absorb \nthis untenable surge in the population. Many employers are more than \nwilling to take advantage of the cheap labor that this bill would \nprovide, but the responsibility would fall on the Nation as a whole to \nmake the public investments necessary to ensure that these workers do \nnot fall into a state of poverty once they have arrived. We have our \nown problems to address without having to assume this additional burden \nto help American businesses find cheaper labor.\n  Amnesties beget more illegal immigration--hurtful, destructive \nillegal immigration. They encourage other undocumented aliens to \ncircumvent our immigration process in the hope that they, too, can \nachieve temporary worker status. Amnesties sanction the exploitation of \nillegal foreign labor by U.S. businesses and encourage other businesses \nto hire cheap and illegal labor in order to compete.\n  President Reagan signed his amnesty proposal into law in 1986. At the \ntime, I supported amnesty based on the same promises that we hear \ntoday; namely, that legalizing undocumented workers and increasing \nenforcement would stem the flow of illegal immigration. It didn't work \nthen; it won't work today. The 1986 amnesty failed miserably. After \n1986, the illegal immigrant population more than quadrupled from 2.7 \nmillion aliens to 4 million aliens in 1996, to 8 million aliens in \n2000, to an estimated 12 million illegal aliens today.\n  In that time, the Congress continued to enact amnesty after amnesty, \nwaiving the Immigration Act for lawbreakers. The result is always the \nsame: For every group of illegal aliens granted amnesty, a bigger group \nenters the country hoping to be similarly rewarded. This bill \nencourages individuals on both sides of the border to flout the law. It \nis a congressional pardon for lawbreakers--both for illegal aliens and \nthe unscrupulous employers who hire them.\n\n  What is backward about the pending bill is that it would actually \nexpand benefits to illegal aliens rather than curtail them. It \nauthorizes illegal aliens to work in the country. It grants illegal \naliens a path to citizenship. It pardons employers who illegally employ \nunauthorized workers. It even repeals provisions in current law \ndesigned to deny cheaper, in-State tuition rates to illegal aliens.\n  The pending bill is an invitation to immigrants and employers alike \nto violate our immigration laws and to get away with it. Amnesties are \ndangerous proposals. Amnesties open routes to legal status for aliens \nhoping to circumvent the regular security checks. By allowing illegal \naliens to adjust their status in the country, we allow them to bypass \nState Department checks normally done overseas through the visa and \nconsular process. One need only look to the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing, where one of the terrorist leaders had legalized his status \nthrough an amnesty, to know the dangers of these kinds of proposals.\n  Our immigration system is already plagued with funding and staffing \nproblems. It is overwhelmed on the borders,\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nin the interior, and in its processing of immigration applications. It \nonly took 19 temporary visa holders to slip through the system to \nunleash the horror of the September 11 attacks, and the pending \nproposal would shove many tens of millions of legal and illegal \naliens--many of whom have never gone through a background check--\nthrough our border security system over the next decade, in effect, \nflooding a bureaucracy that is already drowning.\n  It is a recipe for disaster, and 6,000 National Guardsmen without the \npower to enforce our immigration laws and arrest illegal aliens are not \ngoing to make the difference between success and failure. Our Nation's \nexperience shows that amnesties do not--do not--work. They encourage \nillegal immigration. They open our borders to terrorists. Our \nexperience shows that we cannot play games with our border security or \nAmerican lives could be lost.\n  I will oppose this amnesty bill, and I urge my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4064, as Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified \nwith the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4064), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 295, line 22, strike ``the alien--'' and all that \n     follows through page 296, line 5, and insert ``the alien \n     meets the requirements of section 312.''.\n       On page 352, line 3, strike ``either--'' and all that \n     follows through line 15, and insert ``meets the requirements \n     of section 312(a) (relating to English proficiency and \n     understanding of United States history and Government).''.\n       On page 614, after line 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 766.

Under United States law (8 U.S.C. 1423(a)), lawful \n     permanent residents of the United States who have immigrated \n     from foreign countries must, among other requirements, \n     demonstrate an understanding of the English language, United \n     States history and Government, to become citizens of the \n     United States.\n       b. The Department of Homeland Security is currently \n     conducting a review of the testing process used to ensure \n     prospective United States citizens demonstrate said knowledge \n     of the English language and United States history and \n     government for the purpose of redesigning said test.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section only, the \n     following words are defined:\n       (1) Key documents.--The term ``key documents'' means the \n     documents that established or explained the foundational \n     principles of democracy in the United States, including the \n     United States Constitution and the amendments to the \n     Constitution (particularly the Bill of Rights), the \n     Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, and the \n     Emancipation Proclamation.\n       (2) Key events.--The term ``key events'' means the critical \n     turning points in the history of the United States (including \n     the American Revolution, the Civil War, the world wars of the \n     twentieth century, the civil rights movement, and the major \n     court decisions and legislation) that contributed to \n     extending the promise of democracy in American life.\n       (3) Key ideas.--The term ``key ideas'' means the ideas that \n     shaped the democratic institutions and heritage of the United \n     States, including the notion of equal justice under the law, \n     freedom, individualism, human rights, and a belief in \n     progress.\n       (4) Key persons.--The term ``key persons'' means the men \n     and women who led the United States as founding fathers, \n     elected officials, scientists, inventors, pioneers, advocates \n     of equal rights, entrepreneurs, and artists.\n       (c) Goals for Citizenship Test Redesign.--The Department of \n     Homeland Security shall establish as goals of the testing \n     process designed to comply with provisions of [8 U.S.C. \n     1423(a)] that prospective citizens:\n       a. demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the English \n     language for usage in everyday life;\n       b. demonstrate an understanding of American common values \n     and traditions, including the principles of the Constitution \n     of the United States, the Pledge of Allegiance, respect for \n     the flag of the United States, the National Anthem, and \n     voting in public elections;\n       c. demonstrate an understanding of the history of the \n     United States, including the key events, key persons, key \n     ideas, and key documents that shaped the institutions and \n     democratic heritage of the United States;\n       d. demonstrate an attachment to the principles of the \n     Constitution of the United States and the well being and \n     happiness of the people of the United States; and\n       e. demonstrate an understanding of the rights and \n     responsibilities of citizenship in the United States.\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall implement changes to the testing process designed to \n     ensure compliance with [8 U.S.C. 1423(a)] not later than \n     January 1, 2008.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors several Senators, including the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and Senators Alexander and Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is, I believe, a very significant \namendment. We have had an opportunity to talk to people who had \nproblems. In addition to making English the national language, we also \nunify some of the applications in terms of legalized immigrants.\n  I have had the honor of speaking at naturalization ceremonies. It is \na very warm thing to know that these people come in and do it the legal \nway, the right way; wherein they have to, and they do, learn the \nlanguage. We have some language in here that Senator Alexander had \nsuggested that I think makes this a better bill, and I think Senator \nKyl and Senator Sessions also have this language. So it goes beyond \nthat.\n  Basically, what it does is it recognizes the practical reality of the \nrole of English as our national language. It states explicitly that \nEnglish is our national language, providing English a status in law \nthat it has not had before. It clarifies that there is no entitlement \nto receive Federal documents and services in languages other than \nEnglish. It declares that any rights of a person and services or \nmaterials in languages other than English must be authorized or \nprovided by law. It recognizes the decades of unbroken court opinions \nthat civil rights laws protecting against national origin and \ndiscrimination do not create rights to Government services and \nmaterials in languages other than English, and establishes enhanced \ngoals of the DHS as redesigned. This is what I talked about in trying \nto make those more uniform.\n  I think Senator Alexander wants to make a few comments. I would only \nsay that this is something that is more significant probably to the \nAmerican people than it is inside this Chamber. I know there is \nopposition to this. There are some people who don't believe that \nEnglish should be our national language. If you look at some of the \nrecent polling data, such as the Zogby poll in 2006, it found 84 \npercent of Americans, including 77 percent of Hispanics, believed that \nEnglish should be the national language of Government\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\noperations. A poll of 91 percent of foreign-born Latino immigrants \nagreed that learning English is essential to succeeding in accordance \nwith the United States, according to the 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation \npoll.\n  Also, we heard the other day, when President Bush made his very \neloquent statement, he said:\n\n       An ability to speak and write the English language, English \n     allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening grocery \n     stores, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life \n     of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of \n     their own.\n\n  So I believe this is something very significant that we are doing \ntoday that people have talked about now for four decades that I know \nof, and I believe it should be popular.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to compliment the Senator from \nOklahoma for his work, for bringing it to the Senate floor, and for \ndoing something I think is very important and that I think unifies us.\n  What are some of the things that do unify us? Well, our language \nunifies us. Senator Alexander, who will speak in a moment, was \nresponsible also for working with Senator Inhofe to include provisions \nin this amendment that help us to recognize the importance of English \nin our country and the importance--not just for our new immigrants but \nfor all Americans--of speaking this language that is our national \nlanguage. So an amendment that recognizes that it is our national \nlanguage is very positive for both immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.\n  I would also like to make a point about what this amendment is not. \nThis is not an English-only amendment. That is an important point. We \ndo speak a lot of different languages in this country, but English is \nour national language, and I think we can all agree on those great \nprinciples.\n  So this expression by the Senate is an important one, and I \ncompliment all of those who helped to work on it, and for bringing it \nto the Senate floor I thank Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Arizona, \nwho was very instrumental in coming up with some good language that \nmade this a better piece of legislation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Frist be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his good work \nbecause we are now a Nation of people of different faiths, different \nskill sets, different backgrounds, different colors of skin, and \ndifferent nationalities. Where we once were apart, now we have become \nAmericans. The thing that makes this country effective is being able to \ncommunicate with one another in a common language. I think that is an \nideal of America that is important. I think any Nation, historically, \nthat has divisions based on language, begins to have a lot of \ncomplications and problems. So I am pleased that Senator Alexander and \nSenator Inhofe have worked hard on this, that they have come up with \nlanguage that also includes more extensive training and learning on \nbehalf of new citizens about what it means to be an American. No one \nhas been more articulate over the years on this than Senator Alexander.\n  I offered an amendment on it and worked with Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Alexander and others, and we have reached a common accord with \nan amendment I think everyone can support that will help unify us as a \nNation and make sure we are one people, all Americans, adhering to the \nhighest ideals of this great country.\n  Senator Inhofe, thank you for your work and, Senator Alexander, I \nappreciate your leadership also.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank Senator Sessions for the contributions he has \nmade. You and Senator Alexander have both made contributions, and I \nthink it would be appropriate for me to yield some time to Senator \nAlexander because he can articulate some of the other areas that we are \naddressing here, other than English as the national language.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see the manager of the bill. I \nwonder if it would be appropriate for me to go ahead for about 10 \nminutes on the Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee has been a leader in this field going back to his days as the \nSecretary of Education and Governor. Ten minutes would be fine. I think \nthat is acceptable to Senator Alexander.\n\n  I would like to remind Senators we are trying to move the bill along. \nThe next Senator in line is Senator Akaka, and I think we are likely to \nbe ready for Senator Akaka very briefly. If he could come to the floor, \nwe could move ahead with his amendment. I thank the Chair, and I yield \nto Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, could I be notified when I have 60 \nseconds left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think Senator Inhofe, the Senator from Oklahoma, has \nbeen looking at the original motto of the United States which is above \nthe Presiding Officer's chair: e pluribus unum, ``one out of many,'' in \nour antecedent language of Latin because he has done a very good job, I \nthink, of helping to say what the body as a whole would like to say, \nand I hope this is something all Senators can agree on.\n  Here is what the Inhofe amendment, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor, does. No. 1, it states the obvious: that English is the \nnational language of the United States. But in so stating, it does not \nprevent those who are today receiving Government services in other \nlanguages from continuing to do so. We can have those discussions at \nanother time.\n  The second thing it does is it adopts an idea that has been suggested \nby Senator Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, on another occasion during \nthe debate on this bill; that for those immigrants who are currently in \nthe country illegally but who may be able to adjust to a legal status \nunder the way this bill is finally written, it establishes a clear \nEnglish language requirement for them to become lawful permanent \nresidents.\n  The third thing it does is it establishes clear goals for the tests \nthat immigrants take to become new American citizens, so that they know \nEnglish, our common language, and so that they know American history. \nThat test is currently being redesigned by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. In doing so, this part of the Inhofe amendment picks up \nlanguage that had been offered before by Senator Reid and by me, and by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Dodd, as we worked to create summer \nacademies for outstanding students and teachers of American history.\n  It should surprise no one that the Senate would pass a resolution \nstating that our national language is English. I can remember being at \nan education meeting in Rochester in the late 1990s, when someone \nasked: What is the rationale for common schools? And Albert Shanker, \nthe late president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the \npublic schools, the common schools of America were created to help \nlargely immigrant children learn reading and writing and English and \nmathematics with the hope they would go home and teach their parents.\n  So for a long time, we have tried to help new citizens learn our \ncommon language so we can speak to one another, and that has been \nEnglish. Since 1906, our naturalization laws have required new citizens \nto know English and be able to pass tests in English.\n  The Senate, at the beginning of the immigration debate, put a value \non the English language by approving an amendment that said that the \nfederal government would offer $500 grants paid for out of visa fees by \nthose who are legally here, who are seeking to become prospective \ncitizens. In other words, we want to help people learn English.\n  That same amendment said that if you become fluent in English, we \nwill cut a year off the time you have to wait to become a lawful, new \ncitizen from 5 years to 4 years.\n  I remember when I was Education Secretary for this country 15 years \nago, when I went to the Southwest United States and someone told me: \nWell, you will probably find a lot of people who\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nobject to learning English. But I found just the reverse. I found a lot \nof men and women in the Southwest United States who were upset with me \nbecause they didn't have enough help to learn English. They wanted to \nlearn the national language, the common language of the United States.\n  The Inhofe amendment is in that spirit. I have always believed that \nthe luckiest children in our country are those who speak more than one \nlanguage, whether it is Spanish or Chinese--which, after Spanish, is \nthe next most widely spoken language in our country--but that one of \nthose languages must be English, and children should learn it as \nquickly as is practical.\n  The second part of the Inhofe amendment should not surprise anyone \nbecause it incorporates language Senator Sessions had offered to try to \nmake certain that the U.S. history test that new immigrants take if \nthey wish to become citizens is a good test and includes the key \ndocuments and key events and key ideas of our founding documents. As I \nmentioned, that has broad support on both sides of the aisle here, with \nthe Democratic leader, as well as the Republican leader, Senator \nSessions, Senator Kyl, and others, having been involved in that.\n  Finally, it should be no surprise that the Senate, in the middle of a \ndebate on a very important subject, finds talking about our common \nlanguage, our national language, English, an important matter, and \ntalking about U.S. history an important matter. In many ways, there is \nnothing more important to discuss if we are talking about immigration \nbecause the greatest accomplishment of our country is not our \ndiversity, even though that is a magnificent part of our country. It is \nthat we have taken all that diversity and molded it into one nation on \nsomething other than race and ancestry.\n  We have this enormous advantage in the world today, an advantage \nFrance and Germany don't have. People have a hard time thinking of how \nto become German, how to become French, how to become Italian, how to \nbecome Chinese, how to become Japanese. But if you come to this country \nand you want to become a citizen, you must become an American and you \nmust learn our common language. That is a part of it, and it has been \nfor 200 years.\n  The greatest, most practical limit on the number of new immigrants \nwho can come to our country is our ability to assimilate them into our \nculture to help them become Americans.\n  The Inhofe amendment is a very carefully constructed amendment to try \nto make sure that we are heard properly in this country. We value every \nlanguage. We value every ancestry. We value every background that is \nhere. It is what makes our country so special. I, for one, hope our \nchildren grow up speaking more than one language. But we need to be \nable to speak with one another, and we need to understand those \nprinciples which we debate here in the Senate. Just look at this debate \non immigration. We are debating four great principles with which we all \nagree, but we apply them in different ways. They are the rule of law; \nthey are laissez faire, about our free market system; they are equal \nopportunity, giving everybody a fair chance at the starting line; and e \npluribus unum, the idea that we are one nation from many.\n  This amendment is as important as any amendment which is being \noffered because it helps take our magnificent diversity and make it \nsomething even more magnificent. It recognizes that only a few things \nunite us: our principles, found in our founding documents, and our \ncommon language. We are proud of where we have come from, where our \nancestors have come from, but to make this land of immigrants truly one \ncountry, we must have and honor our national language, our common \nlanguage, and that language is English.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I do appreciate as always the very eloquent \nSenator from Tennessee giving the historic perspective. I think it is \nimportant to understand that virtually every President throughout the \nhistory of America has made statements to that effect. Teddy Roosevelt \nsaid in a speech:\n\n       We must also learn one language and that language is \n     English.\n\n  President Clinton said in his speech in 1999, in talking about \nimmigrants:\n\n       New immigrants have a responsibility to enter the \n     mainstream of American life. That means learning English and \n     learning about our democratic system of government.\n\n  We heard just the other day in a speech given by our President that \nit is necessary in order to unify us and to leave all the obstacles \nthat are out there.\n  I thank not just the obvious ones who have been speaking already, but \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham have been a very important part in \nmaking changes, along with Senator Alexander and the occupant of the \nchair, the junior Senator from Florida.\n  At this time, I would like to hear from Senator Graham. I yield to \nhim whatever time he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, just to put this debate in perspective for \nmyself and myself alone, I wish I could speak an additional language. \nIt would make me a better person. I think I would enjoy that \nexperience. I know enough German just to be dangerous. I lived 4\\1/2\\ \nyears in Germany, and I picked up a little of the language, but I was \nalways somewhat embarrassed that all my German friends probably spoke \nbetter English than I, and several other languages. It would be great \nfor our country if our young people could learn additional languages \nbecause we live in a global economy and a global world, and it would \nmake America a better place.\n  However, what makes America a special place and what is the key to \nsuccess in America, from an economic and social perspective, is to \nmaster or be competent in the English language. While I personally \nwould like to be able to speak another language--I think it would make \nme a better person, it would change my life for the better--when it \ncomes to our Nation, it is important that we focus as a nation on those \nthings which unify us, and our common language is English. We need to \nunderstand that and promote that because if you are coming to America \nor you are here now, your life will be tremendously enhanced if you are \nfluent in the English language. Opportunities will exist for you that \nwill not exist otherwise.\n  I know there are many people in this body from different places in \nthe world, and some have parents or grandparents who came here not \nspeaking a word of English. Some may have died not speaking a word of \nEnglish, and their lives were just as valuable as anybody else's life, \nbut we are trying, as a Government to make a policy statement here--it \nis a policy statement--but not change the law at the same time.\n  The goal of this amendment is to say English is the national language \nof the United States. That is true. I would encourage every American to \nlearn another language, get your kids enrolled in taking Spanish or \nsome other language because they will be more successful in a global \neconomy. From an individual level, we would be better off if every \nAmerican could master additional languages other than English. But from \na national perspective, to make sure we maintain our national unity and \nour common sense of being one nation, it is important that we emphasize \nthe need to assimilate into America by mastering the English language. \nSenator Inhofe is making a statement that needs to be made. I \ncongratulate him.\n  What does this amendment do, and what is it intended to do? This \namendment says:\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the national language of the \n     United States of America.\n\n  That is a good policy statement. From an individual perspective, we \nshould learn as many languages as possible, but from a national \nperspective, we need to promote assimilation in our society. The best \nway to assimilate into our society is not to abandon your native tongue \nbut to also learn English.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I certainly will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to first commend the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. He and I have spoken in the well here on the floor \nabout this issue. I am trying, as he is, to understand this issue from \nanother's point of\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nview because I am a lucky person. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry. When her parents came to this country from Lithuania, they did \nnot speak English. My mother spoke both Lithuanian and English, and as \na young girl was an interpreter in court so immigrant families could \nhave justice even if they didn't understand English very well. My \nmother spoke both languages, but I speak only English.\n  The Spanish language has become an important symbol for so many \npeople in this country. It reflects on their heritage. It is a source \nof pride. They are proud to be Americans, but they are equally proud to \nhave a heritage they can point to.\n  I look at the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. I can't \nquarrel with his beginning sentence where he says:\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the national language of the \n     United States of America.\n\n  That strikes me as a statement of fact. English is our language. \nSuccess in America depends on a command of English. If you speak only \nSpanish, your horizons are very limited.\n  But what troubles me, and I am still wrestling with it, and I think \nthe Senator from South Carolina is as well, is the rest of the \namendment. What happens in the situation where a person is here legally \nin the United States but has limited English language skills--what \nhappens when that person, legally here, goes into a courtroom, goes in \nto vote, goes before law enforcement agencies? What kind of guarantee \ncan we give that the person will be treated fairly? Because just as \nEnglish is at the root of who we are as Americans, so is the concept of \nfairness.\n  I am trying to find the balance. I think the Senator from South \nCarolina is looking for that same balance. I would like to ask the \nSenator to reflect on whether we are being careful in the language of \nthis amendment. Are we going too far? Are we going to find people who \nare poor, people with limited language skills, who will not receive the \nkind of treatment and fairness we really take pride in as Americans?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be glad to answer. That is a great question. Here \nis the way I view what we are trying to do. Please, others, speak up.\n  Even though we are trying, in this amendment, to promote the idea \nthat English is the national language and the Government of the United \nStates shall preserve and enhance the role of English as the national \nlanguage of the United States of America, there is something else we \nare trying to avoid doing. The truth is that a variety of Government \nservices are authorized and provided by law in languages other than \nEnglish. That decision has been made in the Voting Rights Act. There \nare a bunch of incidences in our law through court decisions, statutory \nschemes, maybe regulatory schemes, that would authorize a service to be \nprovided by the U.S. Government in a language other than English. My \ngoal is to make sure, in trying to bring us together, focusing on \nEnglish as an essential part of who we are, not to disturb that legal \nsetting.\n  So if in the example of the Senator of someone who is needing \ntranslation in court because they are not competent in the language, \nthe English language, and they can't understand the proceedings--if a \njudge determines that or there is a statute which requires that person \nbe provided translation, interpreting services, nothing in this \namendment would override that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator to yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator point to me in a current situation where \na Government service is being offered and explained in a language in \naddition to English--and that is usually the case.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There will be English and then another language. And in \nmy home State of Illinois, that language might be Polish, incidentally, \nor the Filipino dialect of Tagalog, for example, that might be the \ncase.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator point to a single circumstance where he \nthinks there is an injustice in providing that alternative language \ninstruction, an injustice that requires us to change the law of the \nUnited States of America?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield so I can answer this question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Go ahead.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, if you look at the second page of the bill, \nit provides:\n\n       Unless otherwise authorized or provided by law. . . .\n\n  So we have that set up for exceptions that are already in law.\n  Now, the Court Interpreters Act was passed in 1978. They did not, \nprior to that time--there was a problem that corrected. That act, the \nCourt Interpreters Act, protects already existing constitutional rights \nsuch as the 6th amendment, the right to confront witnesses speaking \nagainst you, and the 5th amendment and 14th amendment and due process. \nThe United States--I think it was in Negron v. New York. That is a \nFederal case which is often cited to support the right to an \ninterpreter in Federal and State proceedings. So it is Federal and \nState proceedings. I believe that exception takes care of the problem \nyou have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know whether to direct my question to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, who I believe has the floor at this time, or to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. What is happening on the floor of the Senate \nis getting dangerously close to a debate, which hardly ever happens. \nAnd I ask those on C-SPAN to turn up the volume. This may turn out to \nbe a debate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's go back to the original question and incorporate it \ninto the answer. The Senator asked me if I know of a case where the \nAmerican Government provides a service in some language other than \nEnglish that I find unjustified? The answer is overwhelmingly no. We do \nprovide, at the Federal level, bilingual ballots and other services \noutside of English for a reason, and I think those reasons are good.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma gave an example. I believe it is a Federal \nstatute that makes sure that due process rights of people not \nsufficiently trained in understanding English are preserved. At some \npoint in time--in 1978 or whenever it was--Congress came along and \nsaid: There will be services provided in a language other than English \nin a court setting. Not only do I think that is just, but I want to \npreserve it.\n  Here is the ultimate answer to the Senator's question. If there is an \nexample of an injustice in the Senator's mind as an individual Senator, \nwhere the Government of our country is providing a service not in \nEnglish, this will not remedy that injustice.\n  That is what I am trying to say. Passing this amendment, voting for \nthis amendment will not remedy that injustice. If you find one, you \nwould have to come to the floor of the Senate and introduce a bill--a \nregulation--because this does not do that.\n  What Senator Inhofe said is absolutely right. The reason I am going \nto vote for this is because I think it tries to unite us without taking \noff the table exceptions to English or services provided other than \nEnglish. It doesn't disturb the legal situation in this country by a \nstatute, regulation, court decree or an Executive order conferring \nrights of people to receive services other than English. If I thought \nit did, I wouldn't vote for it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion, I wish there were a way to engage the Senator from Oklahoma \nbecause it is his amendment, and I would like to hear his response. I \nhold in my hand a publication from the Department of Justice which you \ncan find on the Web site. I invite my colleagues to go to the Web site. \nThey can read this official publication from the Department of Justice, \nand this is what they will learn. It is entitled, ``Know Your Rights.''\n\n       Do you have trouble with English? Are you unable to speak, \n     read, write, or understand English well? If so, you are \n     limited in English proficiency. Federal agencies and \n     organizations which get money from the Federal Government \n     have to take reasonable steps to help people who have trouble \n     with English. Sometimes when a government agency or \n     organization does not help you because you are limited in \n     English proficiency, they violate the law. This is called \n     ``national origin discrimination.''\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       There is a Federal law that protects your civil rights. The \n     law is called ``Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.''\n\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n\n  It goes on with examples of possible discrimination. If you come to a \nhospital and you have limited English proficiency, they are supposed to \nbe able to try to help you understand what your rights are and treat \nyou.\n  Are we changing that? Will the Inhofe amendment change that? If it \ndoesn't, why are we enacting this? If this is law which we are \ncomfortable with and will live with--and it is currently law in the \nUnited States--why are we trying to change it? If we are eliminating \nthis protection which is currently in the law, recognized by the \nDepartment of Justice, why are we eliminating it?\n  That is my question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will give the Senator my answer and then \nyield to anyone. I know we need to wrap this up.\n  In my opinion, the phrase, ``unless otherwise authorized or provided \nby law,'' we would preserve that service. Simply stated, that language \nto me is intended to make sure that whatever service is provided in a \nlanguage other than English, our Federal Government is not disturbed. \nIf you want to disturb it, you would have to come back and do something \nelse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that is not the case, what does this add? What does it \nchange? What does it bring to the law that isn't currently in the law?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I suggest why I think we need to do this and why I \nsupport Senator Inhofe. We have gone through a great debate in this \ncountry, which is long overdue. What does it mean to be an American? \nAnd what role unites us and what divides us? I think it is time for \nthis body to say two things: We will continue to provide services other \nthan English out of a sense of justice and fairness, and we are not \ngoing to disturb that because I think there is a goal for that in our \nsociety.\n  But as we debate how to assimilate 11 million people, we need to make \nit clear that it is the policy of our Government not to change the law \nbut is the goal of our Government to enhance our common language, \nEnglish. To me, that is a good thing to say because when the \ndemonstrations are in the streets with Mexican flags, they have the \nright to fly any flag, but some of us have to respond to that. I am \nsupporting the bill, but I am not going to sit on the sidelines and \nwatch demonstrations that destroy national unity. I am trying to bring \nus all together, and I want the individuals who are here and \nundocumented to be documented by taking civics classes and taking an \nEnglish proficiency exam.\n  Why do we ask them to do that? Why is that part of the pathway to \ncitizenship? We all know if they don't become proficient in English, \nthey will never achieve their own individual value and will be hurting \nour country. And we are trying to reinforce that without doing it in a \nway that would deny services already provided in languages other than \nEnglish. That is why it is important to me. That is why I will vote for \nit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on scheduling, we have not been able to \nwork out an agreement on the Inhofe amendment.\n  The Ensign amendment is about to go. We are trying to juggle \nschedules with one Senator going to a graduation and another Senator \ngoing to Florida. And if we can structure our schedules to have 12:30 \nvotes, we can have two votes at 12:30, if the Senator from Nevada would \nbe agreeable to a time limit between now and 12:30 equally divided. We \nwill then be in position to vote on the Kennedy amendment. We will be \nin a position to vote on the Ensign amendment at 12:30. If we have the \nconsent of Senator Inhofe--I have already discussed it with him \ninformally--to set aside his amendment, the plan is to have a vote on \nthe Inhofe amendment this afternoon. That will give time for others to \nhave a side-by-side. That is how I would like to proceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to cooperate and have cooperated \nwith the Senator. I think it is premature to establish a time on the \nEnsign amendment. I don't think it will be an undue period of time. But \nit would be difficult now to agree to a specific time. I hope we would \nbe able to agree after a while. I welcome the chance to continue this. \nI think this discussion has been enormously valuable and helpful. We \ncan proceed in whatever way the leader wants to proceed. Right now, we \nwould not be in a position to agree to a 1-hour time limitation on the \nEnsign amendment, half an hour on each side. But we will well work to \ntry to get a reasonable time, if that is the decision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest we proceed with the Ensign \namendment. I agree. The discussion with Senator Graham, Senator Inhofe, \nand Senator Durbin was very productive. Perhaps we could continue the \ndiscussion on an informal basis as we try to come to an agreement on \nlanguage but meanwhile proceed to the Ensign amendment with the \nprospect of a vote around 12:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3985\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3985.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce document fraud, prevent identity theft, and \npreserve the integrity of the Social Security system, by ensuring that \n  persons who receive an adjustment of status under this bill are not \n   able to receive Social Security benefits as a result of unlawful \n                               activity)\n\n       Insert in the appropriate place:\n\n     SEC.   . PRECLUSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS PRIOR TO \n                   ENUMERATION.\n\n       (a) Insured Status.--Section 214 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 414) is amended by adding at the end, the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no quarter of \n     coverage shall be credited for purposes of this section if, \n     with respect to any individual who is assigned a social \n     security account number on or after the date of enactment of \n     the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, such \n     quarter of coverage is earned prior to the year in which such \n     social security account number is assigned.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to any \n     quarter of coverage earned by an individual who, at such time \n     such quarter of coverage is earned, satisfies the criterion \n     specified in subsection (c)(2).''.\n       (b) Benefit Computation.--Section 215(e) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 415(e)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (1);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end a new paragraph as follows:\n       ``(3) in computing the average indexed monthly earnings of \n     an individual who is assigned a social security account \n     number on or after the date of enactment of the Comprehensive \n     Immigration Reform Act of 2006, there shall not be counted \n     any wages or self-employment income for which no quarter of \n     coverage may be credited to such individual as a result of \n     the application of section 214(d).''.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this bill we are debating today, the \nimmigration bill, will place a significant cost on the American \ntaxpayers. I am particularly concerned that the provisions of this bill \nwill impose a heavy strain on our social security system. That concern \nis why I am offering amendment number 3985.\n  The American public needs to understands what this bill would do. If \nenacted, it would allow the immigrants who receive amnesty to qualify \nfor social security based on work performed prior to their amnesty. It \nallows people to qualify for social security based on work they did \nwhile they were illegally present in the United States and illegally \nworking in the United States. Let me repeat that.\n  People who broke the law to come here and broke the law to work here \ncan benefit from their conduct to collect social security. This bill is \nthe pathway that allows that.\n  In some cases, illegal immigrants may have stolen an American \ncitizen's identity. They may have stolen an American's social security \nnumber to fraudulently work. But it is that illegal conduct and \nfraudulent work that they will be allowed to use to qualify for social \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n  Does this bill punish the people who stole an American citizen's \nidentity? No, it does not. It rewards them. Does this bill consider the \nimpact that the crime of identify theft had on the victim whose social \nsecurity number was stolen? No, it does not. This bill gives them the \nfull benefit of citizenship, with respect to social security benefits \nand rewards criminal conduct without any consideration for the victim.\n  There have been many media reports recently about illegal immigrants \nstealing Americans' social security numbers. To understand the \npotential scope of this problem, you have to un1erstand that every year \nemployers are advised that nearly 800,000 employees do not have valid, \nI matching social security numbers. In too many cases, the number used \nbelongs to someone else. And so, for a moment, I want the Senate to \nstop. I want my colleagues to think. And to consider the impact this \ntheft and fraud has on the victims.\n  Rarely, does the Senate ever really consider the impact that crime \nhas on the victim. Today Should be different. And so I am going to take \na few moments to share with my colleagues a few of the stories of the \nvictims of identity theft. In order to protect their privacy, I will \nonly use the victim's first name.\n  Identify theft by illegal aliens has created many problems for \nAmericans. Sometimes those problems involve the Internal Revenue \nService. For example, Audra has been a stay-at-home mom since 2000. \nOver the last 3 years, the IRS has accused her of owing $1 million in \nback taxes. This is a picture of the first letter she received from the \nIRS saying she owed back taxes. Since that first letter, she has \nreceived many more.\n  Her story is clear. She has not worked in 6 years. Yet the IRS says \nshe owes taxes for working the last three years. What she first thought \nwas a mistake, later became clear. It was a case of identity theft. Her \nsocial security number was being used by at least 218 illegal \nimmigrants, mostly in Texas, to obtain jobs.\n  Audra has obtained copies of the 218 W-2s that were used in 2004 by \nillegal immigrants using her Social Security number. This is a picture \nof the stack of those W-2s. In Audra's own words, she said, ``It was so \noverwhelming I couldn't be frustrated--I was just completely beyond \nthat.'' She filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Her \nfile at the Federal Trade Commission is very thick. Here is a picture \nof many of the documents in her file on this chart.\n  Identity theft by illegal immigrants has made it hard for some \nAmericans to find a job of their own. When my staff spoke to Audra, she \nexplained to them that she was not able to find a job of her own \nbecause of the theft of her Social Security number. This is a photo of \nthe letter Audra received denying her employment because she is \nactually already employed by that same employer. Obviously, she is not, \nbut someone else with her Social Security number is employed at that \nplace of employment.\n  Audra is not the only American affected in this way. A few years ago, \na woman named Linda applied for a job at a chain retailer, but her job \napplication was turned down. Why? Because her potential employer told \nher that she was already working for that very same retailer. She, of \ncourse, knew better. She could not get a job because someone else had \nstolen her identity. Without knowing it, the thief also stole the job \nshe could have been hired to do.\n  That is not what America should be about. People who want to work \nshould be able to work. Identity theft by illegal immigrants has \ndamaged many Americans' credit, making it hard for them to buy the \nbasic necessities. In some cases, the victims of identity theft are \ndenied social service benefits such as unemployment because records \nshow they already have a job even though they are not working. In some \ncases, government records show they have many jobs all across the \ncountry.\n  I want to tell my colleagues about Caleb, who works in northern \nNevada. He lives there with his wife and two children. Caleb is \nactually one of my constituents. This is a picture of Caleb and his \ndaughter at the kitchen table. Caleb works hard as a construction \nworker to take care of his family. In December of 2003, Caleb was \nunable to find work because of the seasonal difficulties northern \nNevada's construction industry faces. So Caleb applied for unemployment \nbenefits. He was denied unemployment benefits. Why? Because he was told \nhe was already working as a landscaper in Las Vegas. Many of my \ncolleagues are probably not aware of the geography of Nevada. I am \npretty confident that Caleb was not living in Reno and working in Las \nVegas because that would mean he would have over a 1,000-mile commute \nevery single day. Caleb and his wife contacted the employer of the \nidentity thief. They learned that the person who used his Social \nSecurity number had previously given the employer at least 10 different \nSocial Security numbers, and that person's resident alien card had \nexpired.\n  In this picture, Caleb has many of the documents, including a copy of \nthe expired resident alien card used by the person who stole his \nidentity.\n  Not only does identity theft by illegal immigrants create problems \nfor adults, it is also creates problems for young children, children \nwho will likely have to deal with the consequences of someone stealing \ntheir Social Security number well into adulthood.\n  For example, Kelly's daughter is quite ambitious. Based on where she \nlives, and on where she works, she drives 80 miles each day to work at \na steakhouse. I am sure her parents were surprised to learn about her \ncommute since she does not even have a driver's license yet. In fact, \nKelly's daughter has gotten off to quite an early start in life in the \nwork world--considering she is only 5 years of age. Her Social Security \nnumber was being used by an illegal immigrant to work.\n  Stories like this are all too common. Many Southwest States such as \nUtah and Arizona, and even my home State of Nevada, have experienced a \ncrime spree involving illegal immigrants using stolen identities of \nchildren. In one case in Utah, a child apparently owns a cleaning \ncompany and works as a prep cook at two restaurants in Salt Lake City. \nThat is a lot of responsibility, especially for an 8-year-old boy. \nAnother boy from Salt Lake City supposedly works for an express air \nfreight company, quite an important job for an 11-year-old.\n  These stories are shocking. It is clear that illegal immigrants are \npurchasing false papers and using stolen Social Security numbers to \nobtain jobs. They are victimizing hard-working Americans, Americans who \nwant to work. They are also victimizing these young children. The \ncurrent Social Security policy and this bill will only make matters \nworse by granting benefits to those who are working here illegally.\n  I am offering an amendment to correct this problem. My amendment will \nhelp reduce this kind of document fraud. My amendment will also \npreserve the integrity of the Social Security system by ensuring that \npeople are not able to receive Social Security benefits based on their \nprior unlawful activity.\n  I will explain my amendment to the American people and to the Senate. \nUnder current law, individuals who work in the United States illegally \nand later obtain legal employment status can use their illegal work \nhistory to qualify for benefits. For example, if an illegal immigrant \nworks in the United States for 9 years, and then receives legal status \nunder this bill, the immigrant would qualify for full Social Security \nbenefits after just 1 year of legal work. Essentially, the illegal \nimmigrants can go back to the Social Security Administration and ask \nthem for credit for his or her illegal work.\n  What is important to understand is that in order to go back to the \nSocial Security system, the illegal immigrant must get legal status in \nsome way. This bill is an avenue that gives them that legal status. \nThis bill opens the door for illegal immigrants to get Social Security \nbased on their illegal work history. My amendment closes that door.\n  I know some of my colleagues may argue that the illegal immigrants \npaid into the system, and as a result they should be able to collect \nbenefits based on paying into the system. To those colleagues who feel \nthat way, I say this: First, the crime of identity theft and Social \nSecurity fraud are not victimless crimes. The victims of these crimes \nare American citizens and legal immigrants. My staff has spoken to\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nsome of these victims. Some victims' Social Security records are such a \nmess that the Social Security Administration has wiped out all of the \nwork history from the victim's account. That is the only way they \nbelieved they could get a handle on the fraud associated with these \nfolks' accounts. By wiping out all work history, the victim's own legal \nwork history is also deleted. Basically, the victims is forced to start \nover to qualify for future Social Security benefits.\n\n  The Social Security Administration advised the victim that the \nvictim's records are so bad that their only option was to erase the \nvictim's work history. The victims can rebuild their accounts if they \ncan produce their old W-2s. How many people in America can produce \nthem? Some, maybe. If you are like me, and keep records forever, you \nwill not have a problem. But for most Americans, who do not keep their \npast W-2s and old records, it will be impossible to prove their work \nhistory. As a result, some victims end up losing their ability to \ncollect their Social Security based on their own legal work history.\n  At the same time, this bill would open the door to give Social \nSecurity benefits based on illegal work history. If Members oppose this \namendment, Members are saying they want to reward illegal conduct with \nSocial Security benefits while American citizens cannot collect their \nrightly earned benefits. This is simply unfair. That is not what \nAmerica is about.\n  Second, Social Security is a system based on expectancy. For the \nillegal immigrants who paid into the system using a stolen Social \nSecurity card, they never did so thinking they would earn a retirement \nbenefit. They did so, and I don't blame them, simply to get a job. They \ncould not have possibly ever envisioned we would pass this bill in the \nSenate. They could not ever have thought that the Senate would let them \ngo back and petition for Social Security benefits. They never had a \nreasonable expectation we would do this and, as a result, that they \nwould be able to receive those benefits in the first place.\n  Third, for the vast majority of perpetrators who engaged in this kind \nof identity theft, the only way they would ever be able to petition the \nSocial Security Administration is if we pass this bill. It is \nreasonable to oppose, as a condition to amnesty, a requirement that the \npeople receiving amnesty give up or surrender their rights to petition \nfor Social Security benefits for their previous illegal work.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the message the Senate is sending to \nthe victims if we do not agree to my amendment. The victim has already \npaid a heavy price. If the Senate does not agree to my amendment, the \ngovernment will be saying: We reward the criminal and want to continue \nto punish the victim.\n  We will also be inviting future fraud. How, you might ask? If my \namendment is not agreed to, there will be no way, none, for the Social \nSecurity Administration to determine who actually did the work \nassociated with a particular Social Security number. If my amendment is \nnot agreed to, this bill will create an incentive for people to engage \nin a second kind of fraud, one that is based on fraudulent use of W-2s \nto petition for illegal work credit. There would be no way for the \nSocial Security Administration to give proper credit for that work if \nmore than one person petitions for that credit.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the burden this will place on the \nSocial Security Administration itself. As of 2003, there were 255 \nmillion records in the Earnings Suspense File. That file is where \nSocial Security places records when the name and social security number \nthat is used do not match. How can the Social Security Administration \nprocess tens of millions of petitions to receive credit for illegally \nperformed work? Without my amendment, the Social Security \nAdministration will be inundated with petitions with no way to know how \nto handle them.\n  The promise of Social Security is for citizens and legal residents of \nthe United States. Social Security was not intended for individuals who \nenter our country illegally, purchase fraudulent green cards and \ndocumentation on the black market, and use them to get jobs. It is \nwrong to allow people who have broken our laws to receive such a \nreward, especially when such activity places such a heavy toll on \nvictims.\n  We should not now reward individuals who have knowingly engaged in \nillegal activity. We should not adopt a policy that will reward this \nillegal behavior while at the same time continuing to subject the \ninnocent to further victimization. Rewarding illegal behavior is \ninsulting to those immigrants who have played by the rules to qualify \nfor benefits. It is also insulting to hard-working Americans who are \npaying into the Social Security system.\n  My amendment allows immigrants to begin accumulating credit to \nqualify for Social Security only after they have been assigned a valid \nSocial Security number. It does not allow illegal immigrants to receive \ncredit for their past illegal work. This approach is responsible and it \nis common sense. Especially when it comes to how the Social Security \nAdministration will function.\n  I hope one of the principles we can reach consensus on is that \nillegal behavior should not be rewarded at the expense of victimizing \nAmerican citizens. I cannot go home to Nevada and tell the people we \nallowed Social Security benefits to go to people who have worked in the \nUnited States illegally, especially when Nevadans are too often the \nvictims of this kind of crime.\n  Mr. President, I will close now by making one additional observation. \nUnder current law, it is a felony to steal and use somebody's Social \nSecurity number. Under this bill, we are waiving that felony. That, in \nand of itself, is amnesty for the crime of identity theft. I do not \nthink that the Senate should go beyond granting amnesty for criminal \nidentity theft. It is one thing to say that the perpetrator of the \ncrime cannot be prosecuted for that felony, but it is quite another to \nallow the perpetrator to collect Social Security benefits. It is \nfundamentally unfair to do both when there are victims, like the ones I \nhave talked about today.\n  So I hope people will see the common sense of this amendment and \nwill, in a bipartisan fashion, overwhelmingly adopt this amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, identity fraud is a major problem, a \nmajor issue in this country, and it ought to be dealt with. We ought to \ndo whatever is necessary to make sure we are going to deal with this \nissue. I think most of us have seen the various national publications \nand magazines talking about identity fraud. It is there with the use of \ncredit cards. We have it on telephone calling. We have it for \npurchasing over the Internet, obtaining access of financial records, \nand with individuals making illegal withdrawals.\n  All of that is bad and wrong and violates the law, and we ought to \ndeal with that. But we are talking about individuals who are not \ninvolved in identity fraud and have paid into the Social Security fund. \nShould they have that payment they have made into the fund denied to \nthem? So I am with the Senator from Nevada in trying to deal with \nidentity fraud, but I separate myself from him when he says all illegal \nimmigrants are involved in the identity fraud and, therefore, they \nshould not get credit for what they have paid in in terms of Social \nSecurity.\n  Now, who are we talking about? Basically, we are talking about \nindividuals who have the opportunity to try to earn their position, the \nopportunity to be an American citizen, who have to pay a fine, have to \ngo to the end of the line for those who are coming into the United \nStates currently, who have to demonstrate they have paid all of their \ntaxes, who have to demonstrate they have been free from violating the \nlaw. There are all of those conditions that are set up. But once they \nhave achieved all of those conditions, then they have the possibility \nof citizenship 11 years from now.\n  So the issue is, should they be denied the credits they have paid \ninto Social Security? The Senator from Nevada thinks they should.\n  Well, first of all, who are these people? First of all, his proposal \nwould deprive, for example, widows and surviving children of needed \nSocial Security benefits, even if the widows and children are U.S. \nborn. We will have circumstances where the children are American \ncitizens. The widows might be American citizens.\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n  Now, let's say this individual regularizes their position and has \npaid into Social Security. If that person dies, their survivors would \nbe eligible for survivor benefits, but not under the Ensign amendment. \nIt is interesting, some 85 percent of immigrant-headed households \ninclude at least one U.S. citizen. Under the Ensign proposal, citizen \nchildren may not be eligible for survivor benefits if their parents had \ngained legal status or even citizenship but die before they gained the \n40 hours of coverage.\n  The Ensign amendment effectively would deprive the immigrants who \nhave become legal residents of the right to receive Social Security \ncredits for the payroll tax payments they made on the work they \nperformed when they were undocumented. Some do now.\n  The 1986 act permitted 3 million people--they received the amnesty. \nThat was amnesty. We did not move ahead in terms of the enforcement \nagainst the undocumented afterwards. But that was amnesty. Now they are \nable to receive the benefits today. We are going to say to them, we are \nevidently going to cut you off from being able to get any credit \nbecause I don't see in the Ensign amendment where they are going to \nrespect their position.\n  It is important to focus on who would be hurt by this highly punitive \nproposal. Only immigrants who have attained legal status are eligible \nto receive Social Security. So everyone this amendment would affect \nwill be legal residents under the terms of the bill. Many of them will \neven be citizens by the time they apply for Social Security. Those are \nthe hard-working men and women this amendment seeks to penalize.\n  Those are the individuals who really want to be Americans, be part of \nthe American family. They are going to have to pay the penalty, pay \ntheir back taxes, abide by all of the laws, continue to believe in \ntheir faith. And then they will have the opportunity to go to the end \nof the line. And then, in 11 years, they will be able to achieve \ncitizenship. They will be working during this period of time.\n  They are paying into Social Security. And, finally, when they become \ncitizens--11 years from now--the Ensign amendment is going to say: \nWell, all right, you paid. You have waited your turn. You paid the \npenalties all the way along. But you are not going to be able to \nbenefit from paying into Social Security because of identity fraud. \nWell, I have difficulty assuming that all of those who have paid into \nSocial Security have been a part of identity fraud.\n  Before this bill passed, these workers were undocumented. But once in \nthe country, they complied with the rules of the workplace and paid \nSocial Security taxes on their earnings. Their payroll tax payments and \nthe matching contributions of their employers were paid to the Social \nSecurity Administration on a timely basis. Those dollars are sitting in \nan account at the Social Security Administration today. Social Security \nhas a record of receiving these payments. There is no dispute about \nthat.\n\n  The issue raised by this amendment is whether these workers should be \ngiven credit in Social Security for the hard-earned dollars they paid \ninto the system. Shouldn't the payroll tax payments they made count \ntoward determining the level of retirement benefits and disability \nbenefits they have earned when they reach retirement age or become \ndisabled?\n  Now, the amount of benefits a worker receives depends on how many \nyears the individual worked and how much payroll tax he or she paid in. \nI believe it would be terribly wrong to arbitrarily deny these hard-\nworking men and women credit for all the payroll tax dollars they paid \ninto Social Security on the wages they earned. But that is exactly what \nthe Ensign amendment would do.\n  Most undocumented workers do pay Social Security taxes. Stephen Goss, \nSocial Security's chief actuary, estimates that ``about three-quarters \nof other-than-legal immigrants pay payroll taxes''--three-quarters of \nthem.\n  The amounts paid in by them are substantial. Payments into the Social \nSecurity system by undocumented workers total $7 billion a year. \nUnfortunately, most of these workers do not have genuine Social \nSecurity numbers, so the money goes into what they call the Social \nSecurity Administration's earnings suspense file. This money is \nidentified by the employer who submitted it but not by the individual \nworker it belongs to.\n  Each year, Social Security identifies approximately 130,000 employers \nwho submitted W-2s that cannot be matched to a worker. So the \nundocumented immigrants account for the vast majority of the funds in \nthe suspense file. The unidentified W-2s closely track their geographic \ndistribution and types of employment to that which undocumented workers \ntypically hold. According to an analysis by the GAO, three of the \ncategories of business with the largest numbers of inaccurate W-2s were \nrestaurants, construction companies, and farm operations.\n  In order to get credit for the payroll taxes he paid in when he was \nundocumented, a worker would have to prove how much he paid in while \nworking for a particular employer and when it was paid. The burden of \nproof would be on the worker, and the worker would only receive credit \nfor payments that the Social Security Administration could verify.\n  Whatever rules and regulations Social Security established, we are \nfor. They ought to be accurate. They ought to be tough. They ought to \nbe fair. But we are not prepared to say that every individual who paid \nin, who is now in the process, over this 11 years--here, they are \npaying in. I want to be a citizen. I am paying my fine. I paid my back \ntaxes. My sons have joined the military serving in Afghanistan. We are \ngoing to church every single week. And I am paying into Social \nSecurity. I wait 11 years, and I finally become a citizen. Under the \nEnsign amendment, no, no, you are not going to receive any of that. You \nare not going to receive a cent of that.\n  So we are all for Social Security establishing whatever requirements \nare necessary to ensure the integrity of the fund and the accuracy of \nthe work effort by individuals. But I think the only reason for the \nEnsign amendment is to deny the legal residents the Social Security \nbenefits they have earned and paid for. Their money sits in the Social \nSecurity Administration waiting to be matched with an eligible \nbeneficiary. Once those workers establish eligibility, how, in all \nfairness, can we deny them credit for their past contributions?\n  This legislation before the Senate sets out a difficult process for \nundocumented workers seeking to become legal residents. Most of them \nhave very little money. Yet the legislation will require them to pay \nthousands in fines and fees. It would be wrong to deny them credit for \nthe Social Security tax dollars they have paid from their often meager \nwages.\n  Once these workers are legal residents, if they become disabled, \nshouldn't they be entitled to receive disability benefits based on the \npayroll taxes they contributed to Social Security? And if they die \nprematurely, leaving minor children, shouldn't those children--who in \nmany instances are American children--shouldn't those American children \nbe eligible to receive survivor benefits based on the payroll taxes \nthey contributed to Social Security? And when, after a lifetime of hard \nwork, they reach retirement age, shouldn't they be able to receive a \nretirement benefit based on all the years of payroll tax payments they \ncontributed to Social Security?\n  This is not a handout. This is not welfare. Social Security is an \nearned benefit. If these immigrant workers earned it, they should \nreceive it like everyone else. The Ensign amendment would take their \nhard-earned money and give them nothing in return. That is not the way \nAmerica operates.\n  Allowing these workers to receive the Social Security benefits they \nhave earned not only helps them, it serves the interests of the larger \nAmerican community. They are living amongst us. As I say, many of the \nchildren were born here. If they cannot rely on the Social Security \nbenefits they have earned when they become elderly or disabled, on what \nsource of support will they rely? Certainly, the people of this great \nNation would not leave them destitute. We all benefit when the earned \nbenefits of Social Security are there for those in need.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire as to whether we might be \nset now to enter into a time agreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been here on the floor since the \nSenator started, and in response, I would be glad to inquire of those \nwho are interested. I think there are some members of the Finance \nCommittee who are interested in this amendment and want to be heard \nsince it deals with the Finance Committee jurisdiction. So I will \ninquire and report back to the floor manager.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Lugar has come to the floor and \nwould, jointly with me, request a few minutes as in morning business to \nintroduce legislation.\n  Would the Senator from Nevada be willing to yield for--how long do \nyou require, I ask Senator Lugar?\n  Mr. LUGAR. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, could I spend 5 \nminutes responding to a couple things, and then I would be willing to \nyield to the Senator for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. SPECTER. By all means. I will yield to Senator Ensign. And I ask \nunanimous consent that then Senator Lugar and I be recognized for 5 \nminutes each to introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Just to respond to a couple of things the Senator from \nMassachusetts talked about, that section 614 and a provision in section \n601 in this legislation on page 395 would ensure that aliens who \nreceived legal status, amnesty, whatever you want to call it, cannot be \nprosecuted for document fraud. He said they weren't receiving amnesty. \nIf there was a felony they were committing, and now they can't be \nprosecuted, that sounds like amnesty to me.\n  A couple other points he brought up: Legal aliens who were here and \nwho overstayed their visas have a legal Social Security number. They \nare paying into the system with a legal Social Security number. Even \nthough they are here illegally, they would still be able to collect \nbenefits.\n  Another point I want to address that the Senator from Massachusetts \nbrought up concerned the Social Security Administration. These illegal \nworkers would come to them and petition for the benefits, and they \nwould have to prove that they actually worked where they worked, they \npaid in the taxes, and things like that. Let's try to think about the \nburden that this would place on the Social Security Administration \nitself.\n  Currently, there are 255 million earning suspense files. Those are \nthe ones where the Social Security number and the work don't match, 255 \nmillion. Try to imagine how many of these are going to come forward \nwith the Social Security Administration where people are trying to \nprove something to gain benefits. They are going to be overwhelmed. \nWhat is that going to do to the normal processing for people who have \nproblems with their Social Security benefits? All of us have case \nworkers back in our States who deal with seniors who have legitimate \nSocial Security problems. Sometimes there are mistakes made. We have \nhad people who have actually received a letter where the Social \nSecurity Administration told them that they had died. It was kind of a \nsurprise to them. But they called us, and we were able to bring them \nback to life. We jokingly refer to these cases as Lazarus cases. It is \na situation where they need speedy help. If the Social Security \nAdministration is burdened with all of these millions of potential \ncases, it just boggles the mind how people could be against this \namendment.\n  The next point I want to make is that the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid that this illegal immigrant who is now legalized or regularized, \nwhatever term you want to put on it, cannot go to the Social Security \nAdministration, and they have to prove with documents. We have seen the \nkind of fraudulent documents used in the country today. These documents \nare not that difficult to produce, to defraud. There is a great \nincentive for them to do that. Once again, it will be an extra burden \non the Social Security Administration trying to prove or disprove \nwhether these documents are real.\n  The last point I want to make, the Senator said the people they are \nregularizing in this bill have to pay a fine. They have to pay back \ntaxes. We have heard that over and over again: They have to pay back \nincome taxes. They don't have to pay back Social Security taxes, the \nFICA taxes they didn't pay, only the income taxes. So let's be \ncompletely open and honest about what this bill does and about what my \namendment seeks to correct.\n  When we are considering this amendment, we absolutely must consider \nwhat it is going to do to the Social Security Administration, what it \nis going to do to the trust fund and, mostly, what it is going to do to \nthe victims. Rewarding illegal behavior while we are not taking care of \nthe victims in the United States fundamentally is unfair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes be allotted to \nSenator Dodd after Senator Lugar and I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lugar, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Shumer and Mr. \nSessions pertaining to the introduction of S. 2831 are located in \ntoday's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint \nResolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have tried to move along this position \nof the Ensign amendment, looking for a time agreement. Senator Sessions \nhas asked for 5 minutes. If other Senators want to debate this \namendment, I ask them to come to the floor. If there is no time \nagreement and there are no people to debate, I will move to table the \namendment so we can get the bill moving.\n  I now yield to Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, regarding the Ensign amendment, I will \nsay a few things. No. 1, Social Security is a benefit this country \nprovides to American citizens and people lawfully in this country. That \nis what it is about, the benefit. For the most part, people get more \nout of it than they put into it. That is one reason it is going \nbankrupt.\n  The people covered by Senator Ensign's amendment have done a number \nof things that are illegal. They have come into the country illegally \nor they would not be here, or they would be legal and would be not \ncovered by his amendment. They have worked in the country without \nauthorization, and you are not allowed to work in this country if you \nare not here legally. So they have committed a second illegal act. In \nthe course of working in this country, they may have submitted forged, \nfalse, stolen, or bogus Social Security numbers--a separate crime, if \nyou examine the U.S. Code. Maybe they have even broken other laws.\n  As Senator Ensign pointed out, so many of these numbers are other \npeople's numbers, seizing their identity and causing all kinds of \nconfusion and disruption in their lives.\n  Under the language of the bill, not only do they get protection from \nprosecution for violation of these laws, they would be given the \nbenefits of Social Security. Although he clearly makes--properly so--an \nexemption for those who came into the country legally under a visa, got \na legal Social Security number but overstayed, at least they had a \nlegitimate Social Security number.\n  Mr. President, I had an opportunity, for strange reasons, in my \ncareer as a prosecutor and as a private lawyer to deal with contracts \nbased on illegality. I had a situation in which a client--a young man--\nwas sued by a home builder on the note that he signed to the home \nbuilder. The reason he signed that note was the home builder loaned him \nthe downpayment to buy a house. The mortgage and the Federal act \nrequired that the deposit or downpayment be your own money or you could \nnot fund it by a mortgage. The builder was in on the deal. He was there \nat the closing of the loan. He got the big check, so when it came to \nsuing on\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nthat note, I defended the client and said the court had no jurisdiction \nover the case. There is a principle of law--in our English American \ntradition--founded on fraud, stating that a contract founded on \nillegality cannot be enforced in court.\n  So that person who comes into our country illegally and submits a \nfalse Social Security number has no legal right to expect to ever \ncollect on that amount. Also, in addition to legally not having a right \nto that, they have no moral right to that. To have a moral right to \ncome to court, you ought to have clean hands. You should be a person \nthat is legitimately here and then you can make a legitimate claim. I \nsee no reason these persons who come here in order to work and, as a \ncost of doing business, accept and sign up for Social Security without \nany expectation whatsoever that they would ever draw those Social \nSecurity benefits, should now be awarded by this legislation that would \nallow them to get it. They would say they paid into it, so they are \nentitled to it. Not so, in my opinion.\n  I see how you can make this remark, but I think we are too far down \nthe road of an entitlement mentality. This whole bill contemplates \npeople having an entitlement to come to America, to bring in their \nparents and children, and they are entitled to have them ultimately be \non Medicare and go to hospitals and be treated, even though they are \nnot properly here.\n  We need to clarify our thinking. We are a great nation, a nation of \nlaws. Let's think this through. That is all I am saying. I submit to my \ncolleagues that the process by which an immigrant who comes here \nillegally, works illegally, and illegally submits a false, bogus, \nfraudulent Social Security number as a price to get the job and be \npaid, that is no entitlement to claim that money--not legally because \nit is founded on a false claim and a false premise, and not morally \nbecause they knew they weren't entitled to it when they came. They knew \nthey were here illegally and they never expected to receive it.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada has proposed an amendment that is \nimportant. It asks us to think, for a change, in this body about what \nit is going to do, and what it will do to our Nation's bottom line and \nwith regard to the message we send regarding whether we are serious \nthat people should follow the law.\n  We need to quit rewarding unlawful conduct. Unlawful conduct should \nhave penalties and should result in detriments, not benefits. That is \nwhat we are saying. If we don't get that straight in this debate, \nwhatever new laws we pass about immigration, whatever new policies we \nset, how much of a joke will they be? Will they be the same joke, the \nsame mockery of law that we have had for 20 years since the last \namnesty we issued? That is what the American people are asking us to \ndo. Let's create a system that actually works.\n  Sometimes you have to make decisions. Somebody who came here \nillegally and worked illegally and submitted an illegal Social Security \nnumber is not entitled to draw on the Treasury of the United States. I \nthank the chairman and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator McCain is asking for some time. \nIt is my hope that we can move ahead with either a time agreement or a \nvote on the Ensign amendment, but now I yield to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Ensign \namendment. Under current law, undocumented immigrants are ineligible \nfor Social Security benefits which I think is entirely appropriate. But \nwe all know that millions of undocumented immigrants pay Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes for years and sometimes decades while they \nwork to contribute to our economy.\n  According to Stephen Goss, the Social Security Administration's chief \nactuary, three-quarters of illegal immigrants pay payroll taxes. These \npayments generate approximately $8.5 billion in Social Security and \nMedicare taxes each year. In fact, according to a 2005 New York Times \narticle, the Social Security Administration records these payments in a \nso-called earnings suspense file, which grew by $189 billion in the \n1990s and continues to grow by over $50 billion each year, generating \nup to $7 billion in Social Security tax revenue and about $1.5 billion \nin Medicare taxes. According to the article, most of these payments \ncome from illegal immigrants.\n  The Ensign amendment would undermine the work of these people by \npreventing lawfully present immigrant workers from claiming Social \nSecurity benefits that they earned before they were authorized to work \nin our country. If this amendment is enacted, the nest egg that these \nimmigrants have worked hard for would be taken from them and their \nfamilies.\n  It pains me to disagree with my good friend from Nevada on this \nmatter, but I believe the amendment is wrong. It is fundamentally \nunfair to collect taxes from these workers and then disqualify the \ntaxes paid once the workers achieve legal taxes. I believe instead of \nsupporting the amendment, we should stand for the principle that people \nwho worked and paid into the Social Security system for years should be \nable to depend on their retirement income to which they contributed.\n  The amendment compounds the unfairness by ignoring the underlying \nlegislation that already calls for payment of all back taxes and a \n$2,000 fine. So what we are asking the immigrants to do is pay all back \ntaxes and, at the same time, forgo the taxes they already paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is fundamentally unfair.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As soon as I finish my statement, I will be glad to yield \nto my friend from Nevada.\n  I point out to my colleagues a recent Los Angeles Times article that \nindicates tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants are already \nlining up to pay current and back taxes. They want to do that because \nthey want to play by the rules. So we are going to tell them there is \none set of rules for them to pay their back taxes, but the taxes they \nhave already paid they will receive no benefits for.\n  What about the fiscal consequences of the amendment? I submit that if \nSocial Security is not available in the future for immigrants, that \nwhen they retire or become disabled, then State and local governments \nand potentially the Federal Government will be forced to absorb \nsignificant costs as the Federal Government has refused to provide \nservices and supports paid for by tax dollars of millions of legal \nimmigrants. This amendment would simply continue this trend.\n  The Senator from Nevada has argued that his amendment is about \ncombating identity theft and that the bill before us says identity \ntheft is OK. That is inaccurate. I don't know one Member of the Senate \nwho would say: I support identity theft. Not one. In fact, the Senate \nCommerce Committee has been working to approve legislation, which I \nhave cosponsored, to combat this egregious crime.\n  Identity theft is a serious issue. In fact, the highest rate of \nidentity theft occurs in the State of Arizona. It happened to me and my \nwife. But this immigration bill isn't drafted to comprehensively \naddress identity theft, and the amendment before us isn't going to do a \nthing to fix this problem. Maybe we should add the Commerce Committee \nlegislation to the bill. I assume other Members may not be agreeable to \ndoing that, but I stand ready to work with the Senator from Nevada, and \nI suspect the Senator from Massachusetts would be willing to join us in \npushing legislation to combat identity theft in a meaningful, \ncomprehensive way.\n  Now I will be glad to respond to any question the Senator from Nevada \nmight have. I understand the patience of our manager is somewhat \nlimited. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will hear from Senator Ensign in a \nmoment on his amendment. If there are no other speakers desiring \nrecognition to speak on this amendment, at the conclusion of Senator \nEnsign's comments, I intend to move to table.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask my colleague for a couple minutes, if \nI may.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To speak on the amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. In relation to matters before us on this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. DODD. Four minutes.\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree. I yield to Senator Ensign for some comments and \nthen to Senator Dodd, and if no other speakers appear, I am going to \nmove to table.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to ask my friend from Arizona a \ncouple of questions about the bill and about my amendment in \nparticular. The bill does not require that the people whose status is \nadjusted pay all back taxes. The bill only requires that people pay any \nback income taxes. There is no mention of FICA taxes in the bill. Is \nthe Senator aware of that distinction?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is aware of that. When their employer pays \nthem, the taxes are withheld.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. First, if the alien is self-employed, that is not \ncorrect. Remember, the employer pays half and sends in those funds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As is true of anyone else who works in the United States.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is correct. But the bottom line is if they owe back \nFICA taxes under this bill, they do not have to pay those back taxes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The intent of the amendment is that they must pay and the \nlegislation--I will be glad to state--must pay all backs taxes, a-l-l.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I have another question for my friend from Arizona. Is he \naware that it is a felony to use someone's Social Security number?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Under this legislation, we forgive that felony. We grant \namnesty for that felony.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under this legislation, we allow the illegal immigrants a \npath to citizenship which, if they are convicted of felonies or \nmisdemeanors, according to an amendment, then they would be ineligible \nto embark on that path to earn citizenship.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Right. But, Mr. President, in Sections 601 and 614 of the \nlegislation, it actually ensures that aliens who receive legal status \ncannot be prosecuted for document fraud, including the false use of \nSocial Security numbers. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is aware that when people come here \nillegally, obviously, they do not have citizenship, so, therefore, any \nSocial Security number they use, whether it belongs to someone else or \nis entirely invented, is not valid. But I also know, if I can complete \nmy answer to my friend, their taxes, part of their earnings are going \ninto the Social Security fund, and that is a fact that it is theirs and \ntheir employers.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona that \nmany people are paying into the system. They paid into the system with \nno expectation of getting social security's benefit because they didn't \nknow we would be enacting a bill like this. They paid into the system \nsimply because that was the price to pay to get a job in the United \nStates. The immigrant knew they were using an illegal Social Security \nnumber but without regards of the impact of the victim. I have reviewed \ncase after case related to identity theft and Social Security fraud. \nThese cases are occurring all over the United States. In every case, in \nevery State, where someone's Social Security number was stolen by an \nillegal immigrant to use to find work, the victim's credit history is \ndestroyed. Sometimes their work history is too. Earlier I talked about \nCaleb, a gentleman in Nevada. The illegal immigrant who used Caleb's \nSocial Security number was not trying to harm that person but he did. \nCaleb applied for unemployment but couldn't get it because the agency \nsaid he was working when, in fact, he wasn't. He lives in Reno. They \nsaid he was working in Las Vegas. It was an illegal immigrant using his \nSocial Security number in Las Vegas.\n  I never said this amendment is going to prevent identity theft. What \nI have said is that it is not right for somebody to steal somebody \nelse's identity--granted for the noble purpose of getting a job--and \nreward the theft by giving work credit that counts towards Social \nSecurity. We should consider the victims who are forced to deal with \nthe terrible consequences of the crime.\n  I will make two other points. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nsupports this amendment. One of the reasons the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee supports this amendment is because the Social Security \nAdministration will not be able to make determinations with respect to \nthe earnings suspense files that the Senator from Arizona referenced. \nAs of 2003, there were 255 million instances where the social security \nnumber did not match the name given the employer. This bill will \nlegalize those who are in the workforce today--the 7 million or so in \nthe workforce out of the 12 million who are in the country. The effect \nof this amnesty over the next 10 years, will require the Social \nSecurity Administration to hire nearly an additional 2,000 employees to \nhandle the cases of people who worked illegally, received amnesty under \nthis bill, and are now applying for this benefit. A benefit they earned \nillegally.\n  Point No. 2 is, it is going to cost $1.7 billion in administrative \ncosts--$1.7 billion in administrative costs. It does not include any \nfuture costs in benefits that the United States will have to pay. Some \nmay say that the immigrants will have earned the benefit. But the \nSenate does not even know what amnesty will cost. The cost estimates \nfor these policies are not known. My amendment is absolutely the right \nthing to do. Illegal immigrants did not expect to ever receive this \nbenefit. They were using somebody's Social Security number or a made up \none. They did so to get a job. I can appreciate that. I appreciate \nsomebody trying to come to this country to better themselves. I don't \nbelieve we should reward the conduct of identity theft by giving people \nthe right to claim the work history for purposes of Social Security.\n  Our Social Security trust fund is already in trouble. We all know \nthat. This will further put the Social Security trust fund in trouble. \nThe costs could be potentially huge. We don't even know that in this \nbill. That is why I think we should adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, of course, they didn't \nexpect to receive benefits they had to pay into the system because they \nwere here illegally. The whole thrust of this legislation is to give \nthem not only Social Security benefits but, as importantly, the \nprotections under the law, as they now live in the shadows and are \nexploited and mistreated in many cases. Of course, they didn't expect \nto. That is why we are going through this process of letting them earn \ncitizenship.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Nevada will let you earn \ncitizenship, but what you have paid into a system, you will not only \nnot receive the benefits but on top of that is a $2,000 fine.\n  This is not about administrative costs. The fact is that each year \nthe Social Security trust fund continues to grow by $50 billion, \ngenerating up to $7 billion in Social Security tax revenue and about \n$1.5 billion in Medicare taxes. So as to the Senator's argument that \nthis could cost money administratively--yes. But the fact is that when \nthese people came here, of course, they accepted--because they came \nhere illegally and broke our laws--of course, they accepted the fact \nthat they probably wouldn't get Social Security or Medicare or \nprotection of our laws against exploitation and mistreatment and all of \nthe protections that citizens have. We are trying to give them a path \nto earn that. Yet under the Senator's amendment, they would be \nineligible for the same benefit of citizenship which we, under this \nlegislation, are trying to make them earn.\n\n  I apologize to the Senator from Pennsylvania for taking additional \ntime, and I understand the pressing time issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is next in line to speak for \n4 minutes, as agreed.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman very much. I just want \nto make some brief comments, if I may, not about the matter of this \namendment right before us, but about a vote that occurred yesterday \nregarding the construction of the fence along the southern border. I \nwas 1 of 16 people who voted against that amendment, and I wanted to \ntake a minute or so to explain my concerns.\n  Primarily, my concern is because the decision to place this fence \ndown here without any other additional consultation with local \ncommunities in the United States or with our neighbors to the south is \nsomething that worries me. There are implications of that. I firmly \nbelieve that any discussion\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nabout immigration policy must begin with border security. If there is a \nfailure to do that, I don't think you have much of an audience.\n  My concern is if we unilaterally do this without seeking the \ncooperation of the communities involved and the Nation next to us that \nwe are dealing with primarily on this issue, we may have absolutely the \nopposite effect. In fact, there are implications of this decision. So \nat some point, in consultation with the managers of this bill, I may \noffer an amendment that would require some consultation with the U.S. \ncommunities involved, as well as with the Mexican Government, so that \nwe are not unilaterally placing a fence here.\n  Believe me when I tell you this. I have spent a lot of time in this \nregion, as my colleagues know. There will be political implications. \nThere is a national election in Mexico in about 6 weeks, and I will \nguarantee this issue will be a major issue in that debate. And who wins \nthose elections will have a huge implication in terms of how much \ncooperation we get on dealing with immigration policy. My colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator Cornyn, and I spent a weekend with our colleagues \nfrom Mexico about 4 months ago. To their credit, the Mexican Congress, \nalong with all five Presidential candidates, adopted unanimously in \ntheir legislation provisions regarding immigration policies. At the \nvery top of those lists were border security issues.\n  That had never happened before, Mr. President. It was a major change \nin how Mexico is looking at immigration policy.\n  My hope is, as we talk about matters we think are important for \nsecuring our borders, we will do so in consultation with our neighbors. \nI am not suggesting we give them veto power, but if you are going to \nput up a fence of some 3 to 1,000 miles long, first of all, there is a \nquestion of whether that will work, but I guarantee you it will not \nwork if we don't have the cooperation of the very government we are \nseeking cooperation from, if we impose this fence without dealing with \nthem, talking with them, asking their advice, working with them. That \nis true among neighbors in communities as well as nations that are \nneighbors.\n  So my hope is we can draft some language that would be endorsed and \nsupported unanimously. It would certainly then cause me to have a very \ndifferent attitude about the vote yesterday. But I caution my \ncolleagues. I know the frustration levels. I understand the frustration \nof the communities along these border areas, but we are not going to \nsucceed with this policy if we don't have a neighbor to the south that \nis going to work with us.\n  So while it is frustrating, and certainly Mexico has not been as \ncooperative as they should have been over the years, I think that has \nchanged and we ought to encourage that change rather than take a step \nbackwards. So again, at an appropriate time, we could try to craft some \nlanguage that would at least encourage the kind of cooperation we are \ngoing to have to have if we are going to succeed with the kind of \nborder security issues that are included in the bill.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for giving me a few minutes to \nexplain my concerns.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe there are no other speakers on \nthe other side. I heard there would be no objection to a motion to \ntable, not that I need permission to move to table. We have the Inhofe \namendment pending. I very much want to get a vote on the Inhofe \namendment this afternoon. So we can either come to a time agreement to \nfinish debate or if there are side-by-sides that have been prepared so \nthat we could move ahead there.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the President said: Every human being has \ndignity and value, no matter what their citizenship papers say. I \nbelieve this amendment is antithetical to that sentiment.\n  Senator Ensign has proposed an amendment antithetical to the \nsentiments that the President expressed, and which most Americans \nshare. Americans understand that for years there are undocumented \nworkers who have tried to follow our laws and be good neighbors and \ngood citizens, and have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund. Many \ndo not yet have Social Security numbers but they and their American \nemployers have paid in their contributions. Once that person \nregularizes his or her status, and as they proceed down the path to \nearned citizenship, they should have the benefit after having followed \nthe law and made those contributions. Americans understand fairness. \nThat is fairness. We should not steal their funds or empty their Social \nSecurity accounts. That is not fair. It does not reward their hard work \nor their financial contributions. It violates the trust that underlies \nthe Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Senator Ensign proposes to change existing law to prohibit an \nindividual from gaining the benefit of any contributions made while the \nindividual was in an undocumented status. I oppose this amendment and \nbelieve it is wrong.\n  Under current law, immigrants who have paid Social Security while in \nan undocumented status may gain the benefit of all of their \ncontributions once they gain legal status and become eligible to \ncollect Social Security benefits. They paid in and they should be \nentitled to the benefits they have earned. The whole purpose of the \npath to citizenship program in the bill is to encourage people to \nbecome lawful, productive citizens. Penalizing these people is unfair, \nespecially since under the law they are not only working hard and \ncontributing to the Social Security Trust Fund, but also working hard \nto achieve legal status and earned citizenship. Hard work is rewarded \nin the country, not penalized. Following the law and advancing on the \npath toward earned citizenship should be encouraged, not punished.\n  For example, the children of an undocumented worker who has worked \nfor 20 years and who has paid into the system would be denied all \nSocial Security benefits if their parent dies before becoming a legal \nresident or citizen. Even though the children are citizens, they would \nbe denied the benefit their parent worked many years and contributed to \nearn. Not only is this unfair, but it risks encouraging others in \nsimilar situations to stay in the shadows and not to pay into the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. This will also have the effect of shifting \nburdens to the States and local communities and away from the Social \nSecurity safety net. I am confident that Vermonters and all Americans \nunderstand fairness. They understand respecting other people and \nrespecting their contributions in terms of work and Social Security \npayments. They will not want to steal those contributions and benefits \nand deny fairness to lawful immigrants and their families.\n  They also understand that if the Republican-controlled Senate is \nprepared to take these Social Security funds today, the risk increases \nthat their Social Security funds could be targeted tomorrow. After all, \nthe Social Security Trust Fund is already being used to mask the \ndeficit. As it becomes harder and harder to pay for tax breaks for \nmillionaires and rising gas prices and lucrative Government contracts, \nsome will be tempted to use money diverted from the Social Security \nTrust Fund. The President has already proposed draining the Crime \nVictims Trust Fund. We should maintain these trust funds for the \npurposes for which Congress created them and keep them safe. We should \nrespect the contributions that people make to these trust funds and not \nlook for excuses to start denying legal residents and citizens the \nbenefits they have been promised.\n  Let us not take a giant misstep that we will surely regret. If we are \ngoing to encourage and support a path to citizenship for many people \nunder this bill, we must do so in a way that ensures independence and \nsecurity once that journey is completed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the Ensign amendment, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 130 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have come to an agreement on sequence.\n  I ask unanimous consent we proceed next to Senator Akaka; thereafter, \nwe proceed to Senator Vitter under a time agreement for 45 minutes; and \nthe time from 2:40 to 4 o'clock be set aside for the Inhofe amendment, \nwhere the expectation is there will be side-by-side amendments, side-\nby-side for the Inhofe amendment, until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, if there is \noffered side-by-side, that would be voted on after the Inhofe amendment \nat 4 o'clock. So there is an hour and a half allocated time for debate \non the Inhofe amendment, and as I understand, there would be \napproximately 45 minutes evenly divided.\n  I thought Senator Akaka's amendment was agreeable or acceptable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Akaka would like 25 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will take half an hour for Senator \nAkaka's amendment. We will give him 25 minutes of that time. Senator \nKennedy and I will take the remaining 5 minutes to accept it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that under all the time \nallocated, as outlined, the time goes beyond 2:40 before proceeding to \nthe Inhofe amendment. The time would go to approximately 2:45.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could suggest, why don't we vote at 4:15. That \ngives 45 minutes to Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair will clarify or summarize the \nunanimous consent: The proposed unanimous consent agreement would move \nthe Senate to the Akaka amendment first, with half an hour total, 25 \nminutes to Senator Akaka, and 5 minutes to split between the floor \nmanagers of the debate. Next is the Vitter amendment, with a total of \n45 minutes equally divided. Then we proceed from 2:45 to 4:15 to the \nInhofe amendment, with a possibility of a Democratic side-by-side \namendment.\n  Is that the summary of the unanimous consent proposal?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask consent for that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Without any second degrees to Vitter and Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proposal would exclude second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And for clarification, there would be a vote on the \nInhofe amendment at 4:15; is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I further ask consent that following the \nsequencing already discussed, we take up an amendment from the Senator \nfrom New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized for 25 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4029\n\n  Mr. Akaka. Mr. President, I call up amendment 4029 to S. 2611 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 4029.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To grant the children of Filipino World War II veterans \n     special immigrant status for purposes of family reunification)\n\n       On page 345, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 509. CHILDREN OF FILIPINO WORLD WAR II VETERANS.\n\n       Section 201(b)(1) (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(1)), as amended by \n     sections 505 and 508, is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(J) Aliens who are eligible for a visa under paragraph \n     (1) or (3) of section 203(a) and are the children of a \n     citizen of the United States who was naturalized pursuant to \n     section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (8 U.S.C. 1440 \n     note).''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Murray and Cantwell be \nadded as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it has long been evident that our \nimmigration system needs reform. The debate on immigration has been a \nlong time in coming, and I am pleased that this body is moving forward \non this important topic in such a comprehensive fashion. For our work \non immigration to be truly comprehensive, however, we must address \nthose issues that have received less attention in the debate as well as \nthe front page issues.\n  My amendment is regarding one of those issues that has not received \nwidespread attention but is of great importance. As a World War II \nveteran, this amendment is important to me personally, to Filipino-\nAmericans, and to veterans. My amendment would grant the children of \nFilipino World War II veterans special immigrant status for the purpose \nof family reunification. Making this small change to our nation's \nimmigration policy would go a long way toward making our immigration \nlaws more just, and I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Before I begin a discussion on the specifics of my amendment, I would \nfirst like to thank my dear friend and colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Daniel Inouye, for cosponsoring this amendment. In the \n101st Congress, Senator Inouye authored section 405 of the Immigration \nAct of 1990, which provided for the naturalization of Filipino World \nWar II veterans. Senator Inouye has a long history of being involved in \nthis important effort and it is an honor to have his support on my \namendment today. In addition, Representative Ed Case has introduced a \nsimilar bill, H.R. 901, in the House of Representatives.\n  To understand the significance of this amendment, it is important to \nfirst provide some background about the historical circumstances that \ngot us where we are today.\n  On the basis of 1934 legislation enacted prior to Philippine \nindependence, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a 1941 \nexecutive order. Through this order, President Roosevelt invoked his \nauthority to ``call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\nUnited States, . . . all of the organized military forces of the \nGovernment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.'' This order drafted \nover 200,000 Filipino citizens into the United States military. Under \nthe command of General Douglas MacArthur, Filipino soldiers fought \nalongside American soldiers in the defense of our country.\n  Throughout the course of World War II, these Filipino soldiers proved \nthemselves to be courageous and honorable as they helped the United \nStates fulfill its mission. There was no question when they were \nfighting that they would be treated the same as American troops. For \nexample, Filipino soldiers fought side-by-side with American soldiers \nin the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor. When Bataan fell \nand the Bataan Death March began, Filipino soldiers were forced to \nmarch more than a hundred kilometers from Bataan to Tarlac along with \ntheir American comrades. Filipino soldiers faced hardships in \nconcentration camps, and they endured 4 years of occupation by the \nJapanese. In every sense, Filipino soldiers proved their allegiance to \nour country through thick and thin.\n  These Filipino soldiers are war heroes, and they deserve to be \nhonored as such. They served active duty service on behalf of the U.S. \nmilitary, which should qualify them for the same benefits as other \nveterans of active duty. Congress betrayed these veterans by enacting \nthe First Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act in 1946, \nwhich included a rider that conditioned an appropriation of $200 \nmillion, for the benefit of the postwar Philippine Army, on the basis \nthat service in the Commonwealth Army should not be deemed to have been \nservice in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Commonwealth Army members were those called into the service of the \nU.S. Armed Forces for the Far East. These members served between July \n26, 1941, and June 30, 1946. Similarly, Congress enacted the Second \nSupplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, which provided that \nservice in the New Philippine Scouts was not deemed service in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  New Philippine Scouts were Filipino citizens who served with the U.S. \nArmed Forces with the consent of the Philippine Government. They served \nbetween October 6, 1945, and June 30, 1947.\n  This generation of veterans is predominantly in their eighties. Of \nthe 200,000 Filipino veterans that served in WWII, there are close to \n49,000 left. Some of these veterans receive U.S. benefits, some do not. \nBy 2010, it is estimated that the population will have dwindled to \n20,000.\n  With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1990, the courage of the \nmany Filipino soldiers who fought alongside our troops during World War \nII was finally recognized by our Government, and Filipino veterans were \noffered the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship. According to the \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service, about 15,000 Filipino \nveterans live in the U.S. and became citizens between 1991 and 1995 \nunder the authority of the Immigration Act of 1990. Between that time, \nabout 11,000 veterans who live in the Philippines were successfully \nnaturalized. These thousands of Filipino veterans clearly wished to \nspend their golden years in the United States, and I am pleased that \nthe 1990 Immigration reform efforts offered them the opportunity to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, the offer did not extend to the adult sons and \ndaughters of these veterans. As a result, the brave Filipino veterans \nwho fought on behalf of America, and who now live in America and \ncontinue to contribute to America, must do so alone. Due to a backlog \nin the issuing of visas, many of the children of these veterans have \nwaited more than 20 years before they were able to obtain an immigrant \nvisa. Unfortunately, many more are still waiting.\n  It is no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is facing significant backlogs. \nHowever, it is not as widely known that prospective family-sponsored \nimmigrants from the Philippines have the most substantial waiting times \nin the world before a visa is scheduled to become available to them. \nWhat this means, is that these honorable Filipino veterans who faced \nnumerous dangers to defend this Nation now face the prospect of \nspending the last years of their lives without the comfort and care of \ntheir families.\n  It is a shameful disgrace that the sons and daughters of these brave \nsoldiers are now last in line to become citizens of our country. This \nis no way to honor Filipino soldiers who bravely fought on the front \nlines with American soldiers during World War II.\n\n  As a World War II veteran myself, I am proud to have answered my \nnation's call to active duty. During my time of active service, I was \ndriven by a love for my country, and I was comforted by the love of my \nfamily. The support that a soldier's family offers during military \nservice is an invaluable buoy to a soldier's spirit.\n  A family's role in caring and supporting for a soldier becomes even \nmore important after active military service is completed. I was lucky \nto be surrounded by my family after my service. My heart goes out to \nthose who were separated from their family for years and years due to \nbureaucratic backlogs.\n  As the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have seen firsthand the difficulties that veterans can face \nwhen readjusting to civilian life after serving in a war. For many \nveterans, the difficulty of returning to a home that has changed while \nat war is eased by being surrounded by the familiar faces of loved \nones. While that window of opportunity has unfortunately passed for our \nWorld War II Filipino veterans, there are still many important ways \nthat families enrich the lives of veterans after the initial \nreadjustment phase. Being surrounded by the love and care of family, \nespecially for World War II veterans facing their twilight years, \noffers a special source of support.\n  Action on this issue is long overdue, and it would be very meaningful \nfor the Senate to pass my amendment during debate on the immigration \nbill. As you may know, Filipino Americans are celebrating their \ncentennial this year. Late last year, the Senate accepted by UC S. Res. \n333, a resolution to recognize the centennial of sustained immigration \nfrom the Philippines to the United States, and acknowledge the \ncontributions of the Filipino-American community to our country over \nthe last century.\n  The Filipino-American community has grown and thrived over the last \nhundred years. Today, Filipino-Americans are the third largest ethnic \ngroup in the State of Hawaii and represent one of the fastest growing \nimmigration groups in the country. Filipinos have made contributions to \nevery segment of our community, ranging from politics and sports, to \nmedicine, the military and business. One of the foremost issues for \nFilipino Americans is our Nation's commitment to Filipino veterans, and \npassing my amendment would be a significant way to honor Filipino \nveterans during a historic year for the Filipino American community.\n  Over the years, I have listened to the stories of countless Filipino \nWorld War II veterans who have been separated from their families and \nwho are patiently waiting in line. Every veteran has a unique story to \ntell, but those Filipino World War II veterans who have not yet been \nreunited with their family members share a universal bond of heartache.\n  Another important commonality among Filipino World War II veterans is \nhope. Those Filipino World War II veterans still separated from their \nfamilies are hopeful that we will use this opportunity to rectify the \nunjust oversight in current law. The poignant truth behind this matter \nis that if we don't act now, we may not have another opportunity.\n  This weekend I am participating in the first annual ``A Time of \nRemembrance'' event, which honors the families of the American fallen. \nFamily members from all 50 States will come to the National Mall at \nnoon this Sunday, May 21, 2006, to recognize the important \ncontributions our fallen heroes have made on behalf of America. I am \nproud to take part in this event, which points out the very real ways \nthat families are impacted when soldiers courageously leave their \nfamily and fight to defend freedom. For those World War II veterans who \nare still with us, this event points to the importance of honoring them \nnow, before it is too late.\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n  Let us prove those wrong who say that we are waiting until enough \nveterans die before we right this injustice. These veterans have been \nwaiting for 60 years to have their benefits reinstated. Unfortunately, \nour efforts to provide them with the benefits they were promised, the \nbenefits they fought for, have been unsuccessful because opponents have \ncited the payment of such benefits as too costly.\n  The Filipino Veterans from World War II have already made extreme \nsacrifices. They should not be forced to endure the further sacrifice \nof life without their loved ones. It is time that the United States \nfulfill its responsibility to these veterans. The least we could do is \nhelp to unite these aging veterans with their families. We are a nation \nthat keeps its word . . . not a nation that uses people for our own \npurposes and then casts them aside.\n  Ensuring that our World War II Filipino Veterans can enjoy and be \nsupported by their family members in their twilight years is a simple \nyet profound way of honoring these war heroes.\n  My amendment has received strong support from Filipino veterans, the \nFilipino-American community, and the Asian-American community. The \nJapanese American Citizens League, the Organization of Chinese \nAmericans, and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center have all \nendorsed my amendment. In addition, the American Coalition for Filipino \nVeterans, which represents over 4,000 Filipino Veterans across the \ncountry, has wholeheartedly endorsed my amendment with a letter of \nsupport that states:\n\n       S. Amdt. 2049 will be a timely benefit to address the \n     veterans' loneliness and will provide them with a partial \n     measure of U.S. veterans recognition that they were unjustly \n     denied in 1946.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            American Coalition for\n\n\n                                      Filipino Veterans, Inc.,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 18, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of 4,000 members of our \n     national advocacy organization, we highly commend your \n     leadership in introducing S. Amdt 4029 to grant special \n     immigrant status to children of Filipino WWII veterans for \n     the purpose of family reunification.\n       It is high time for our elderly Filipino American heroes to \n     have their children join them in their twilight years in the \n     U.S.A. These Filipino veterans served the U.S. Army. They as \n     U.S. citizens now deserve to be treated as full Americans.\n       Sadly, their children with Approved immigration petitions \n     have been patiently waiting for more than dozen years.\n       S. Amdt 4029 will be a timely benefit to address the \n     veterans' loneliness and will provide them with a partial \n     measure of U.S. veterans recognition that they were unjustly \n     denied in 1946.\n       Please count on our leaders and members. They will gladly \n     assist you and your colleagues to win priority issuance of \n     immigrant visas to sons and daughters of Filipino American \n     WWII veterans.\n       We hope and pray your legislation will be passed into law.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                                     Eric Lachica,\n                                               Executive Director,\n  Mr. AKAKA. My amendment has received a letter of support from the \nAsian American Justice Center. I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the letter from the Asian American Justice Center to be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Asian American Justice Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: The Asian American Justice Center writes in \n     strong support of S. Amdt. 4029 to S. 2611, the Comprehensive \n     Immigration Reform Act of 2006. This important amendment, \n     introduced by Senators Akaka and Inouye, would allow the sons \n     and daughters of the naturalized Filipino veterans who fought \n     for the United States during World War II to finally reunite \n     with their aging parents in the United States.\n       Approximately 200,000 Filipino soldiers fought for the U.S. \n     during World War II. They were promised U.S. citizenship as a \n     condition of their service to our country, but that promise \n     was retroactively withdrawn in 1946. To address this \n     injustice, Congress belated granted U.S. citizenship to these \n     veterans as a part of the Immigration Act of 1990.\n       However, it did not grant citizenship to the children of \n     these veterans, thereby causing many of these families to be \n     separated. A long immigration backlog developed hence these \n     veterans petitioned for their sons and daughters to immigrate \n     to the U.S. This has not only negatively impacted the \n     veterans and their families, but also other Filipinos who are \n     caught in the same backlog. The Philippines have the worst \n     immigration backlogs in the world. A U.S. citizen parent who \n     is petitioning for his or her unmarried son or daughter must \n     wait approximately 14 years before they can immigrate to the \n     U.S. If the son or daughter is married, they must wait \n     roughly 18 years. The Akaka-Inouye amendment would address \n     this problem by allowing the sons and daughters of the U.S. \n     citizen veterans to immigrate to the U.S. without being \n     subject to numerical limitations.\n       Of the 200,000 Filipino soldiers who fought for the U.S., \n     only approximately 49,000 remain alive, and they are \n     predominantly in their 80's. They have served our country \n     well. They deserve to be reunited with their sons and \n     daughters after years, sometimes even decades, of waiting. \n     Please support the Akaka-Inouye amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Karen K. Narasaki,\n                                 President and Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to honor their valiant \ncontributions to our Nation by supporting my amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Akaka in support of \nhis amendment that grants immigrant visas for alien children of \nFilipino veterans of World War II, who were naturalized pursuant to \nsection 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990, a measure which I authored \nin the 101st Congress.\n  In recognition of Filipino veterans' contributions during World War \nII, the Congress, in March of 1942, amended the Nationality Act of \n1940, and granted Filipino veterans the privilege of becoming United \nStates citizens. The law expired on December 31, 1946. However, many \nFilipino veterans were denied the opportunity to apply for \nnaturalization under this act because of an executive decision to \nremove the naturalization examiner from the Philippines for a 9-month \nperiod. The 9-month absence of a naturalization examiner was the basis \nof numerous lawsuits filed by Filipino World War II veterans. On July \n17, 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Filipino World War II \nveterans had no statutory rights to citizenship under the expired \nprovisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. Section 405 of the \nImmigration Act of 1990 was enacted to make naturalization available to \nthose Filipino World War II veterans whose military service during the \nliberation of the Philippines rendered them deserving of United States \ncitizenship. Approximately 25,000 veterans took advantage of the \nnaturalization provision which expired in February 1995.\n  Unfortunately, the 1990 Act did not confer naturalization to the \nchildren of Filipino World War II veterans. Accordingly, they are \nenduring decades of family separation due to the long waiting periods \nunder the numerical limit on immigrant visas for alien children of \ncitizens of the United States. Many of these veterans are in their \ntwilight years, and declining in health. They long to see their sons \nand daughters.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored, let us not turn our back \non those who sacrificed so much. Let us show our appreciation to these \ngallant Filipino men and women who stood in harm's way with our \nAmerican soldiers, and who fought the common enemy during World War II \nby granting their children a special immigrant status to immigrate and \nreunify with their aging parents who have made sacrifices for this \ncounty.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment, there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note that under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, there is 5 minutes to be split between the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Does the Senator wish to yield that time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes. Then I will yield \nback the time. And then I think we will be prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator for \nraising this issue. He has been a constant\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nadvocate for the families he has spoken about today. And he has \ncommunicated with us in the Immigration Committee on so many different \noccasions about the fairness and the importance of the family \nunifications and the uniqueness of service that so many of these \nparents were involved in at a very difficult and challenging time \nduring World War II.\n  So the Senator from Hawaii deserves great credit for bringing this to \nthe attention of us in the Senate. I speak for the Senator from \nPennsylvania, who urges the acceptance of this amendment. This will \nhelp provide some very important family reunification. It is entirely \nwarranted and entirely justified.\n  We thank the Senator for bringing this issue again to our attention \nand for his continued advocacy on this issue. We will do everything we \npossibly can to make sure this is carried at the conference as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4029) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, under our unanimous consent agreement, it \nis now time for the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana under a time agreement of 45 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3964\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3964.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3964.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the burden of proof requirements for purposes of \n                         adjustment of status)\n\n       Beginning on page 350, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through ``inference.'' on page 351, line 1, and insert the \n     following:\n\n       ``(II) Other documents.--An alien who is unable to submit a \n     document described in subclause (I) may satisfy the \n     requirement in clause (i) by submitting to the Secretary at \n     least 2 other types of reliable documents that provide \n     evidence of employment for each required period of \n     employment, including--\n\n       ``(aa) bank records;\n       ``(bb) business records;\n       ``(cc) sworn affidavits from non-relatives who have direct \n     knowledge of the alien's work, including the name, address, \n     and phone number of the affiant, the nature and duration of \n     the relationship between the affiant and the alien, and other \n     verification information; or\n       ``(dd) remittance records.\n       ``(v) Burden of proof.--An alien applying for adjustment of \n     status under this subsection has the burden of proving by a \n     preponderance of the evidence that the alien has satisfied \n     the employment requirements in clause (i).\n       On page 374, line 22, insert after ``work'' the following: \n     ``, including the name, address, and phone number of the \n     affiant, the nature and duration of the relationship between \n     the affiant and the alien, and other verification \n     information''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor I briefly \nbegan to explain the purpose of this amendment. As was clear from \nyesterday's debate, I have grave and serious hesitations with many \nparts of this bill. One of those hesitations is about the huge \nloopholes and encouragements for fraud that exist in the bill in many \ndifferent sections.\n  We are very good on the Senate floor in debating, tossing around \nideas, general concepts, broad principles, but I fear we are often very \nbad at really looking at the details of a proposal and walking through \nhow it is going to work in the real world and in practice or, perhaps \nit is more appropriate to say, how it is not going to work. Again, this \nbill is a glaring example of that.\n  Amendment No. 3964 does not correct all of those deficiencies. It \ndoes not close all of the loopholes to which I generally refer. It does \nnot end all of that invitation to fraud. But it does do it in two \nsignificant respects which may be among the most significant examples \nof that in the bill. Let me explain what those are.\n  Both of the issues my amendment addresses come under section 601. The \nfirst has to do with how an illegal immigrant proves that he has been \nin the country for over 5 years. Why is this important? The underlying \nbill deals with illegal immigrants in the country now by putting them \nin one of three categories: if you have been in the country over 5 \nyears, if you have been in the country between 2 and 5 years, and if \nyou have been in the country less than 2 years. The consequence of \nbeing put in one of these categories versus the others is significant; \nyou are treated differently. Over 5 years is the best category to be in \nfrom the viewpoint of the illegal immigrant by far because that is the \nmost guaranteed and automatic and clear path to citizenship. Between 2 \nand 5 years is the next best scenario. That also has a path to \ncitizenship. Less than 2 years is by far the least attractive category. \nThat is all fine and good, to make these distinctions and to have \ndifferent consequences for people who fall into these different \ncategories. Maybe that makes sense. But it is important to understand \nwhat proof an illegal immigrant needs to offer to be put in one \ncategory versus another.\n  One might assume--and certainly the American public watching the \ndebate might assume--with the significance of these three categories, \nhow they color the entire picture of the pathway for that illegal \nimmigrant--clear, objective documentary evidence is going to be \nrequired to go into the best category versus the second best versus the \nworst. That would be a pretty good assumption because these categories \nare important and lead to different consequences.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case. In the underlying bill, the \nillegal immigrant can present all sorts of things to be put in the best \ncategory. And one of the things he can present, if he says he doesn't \nhave any of the others, is a simple statement that he himself signs.\n  So at the end of the day, we are making all of these very important \ndistinctions between has the person been in the country over 5 years or \nbetween 2 and 5 years or under 2 years, but when it comes down to the \nactual workings of how this will operate in the real world, all that \nperson has to do is write out a fairly simple statement--``I have been \nhere for over 5 years''--sign his name to it, and under the details of \nthe bill that is good enough. To me, that makes a mockery of the entire \nsystem that is being proposed. That makes an open invitation for fraud. \nWhy would a person who is in an admittedly difficult and strenuous, \nstressful, even desperate situation, why would a person put himself in \ncategory B or category C when all he has to do is sign a piece of paper \nto get in the best category, the clearest route to citizenship, \ncategory A? It makes no sense. Of course, a lot of folks in that \ndesperate situation will do exactly that. This is a loophole, an \ninvitation to fraud which we need to close.\n  Under a similar provision of the bill, also in section 601, there is \na similar glaring loophole and open invitation to fraud in terms of the \ntype of evidence that a person may present to get in the second \ncategory, being in the country between 2 and 5 years. I don't know why \nthis is so much an issue because if I were the person, I would \nimmediately rush to the best category, sign a simple piece of paper, \nand have the clearest route to citizenship. But still, in the evidence \naccepted in category B, between 2 and 5 years, a person can supply a \nsimple statement, a piece of paper signed by a nonrelative third party. \nAgain, the requirements for that are so loose, it is a glaring loophole \nand an open invitation to fraud.\n  If this system is to have any meaning, if these distinctions in terms \nof\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nhow long a person has been in the country are to have any significance, \nif this plan is to have any hope of working in practice, rather than \njust being something pretty to talk about on the floor of the Senate, \nwe need to close these loopholes. We need to end these outright \ninvitations for fraud. That is what my amendment would do in important \nrespects.\n  To summarize, my amendment would do five specific things that would \nclose these loopholes, shut down these very wide open invitations to \nfraud.\n  No. 1, it would strike the language allowing an alien to prove \nemployment history by providing a self-signed, sworn declaration; in \nother words, nothing more than a piece of paper that he himself signs.\n  No. 2, it would require that sworn affidavits from nonrelatives who \nhave direct knowledge of the alien's work--and that is a phrase in the \nunderlying bill--can be corroborated by the Secretary of Department of \nHomeland Security and should include contact information of the \naffiant, the name, the address, the phone number, the nature and \nduration of the relationship, so that the Department has some hope, \nsome ability of looking into this declaration, cross-examining the \naffiant to determine if this is trustworthy and if this declaration is \ntruthful.\n  No. 3, the amendment would make the types of ``other documents'' \nprovided to prove work history the same for those illegal aliens who \nhave been living in the United States over 5 years and for between 2 \nand 5 years. So there would be uniformity, and we would be talking \nabout objective documentary evidence.\n  No. 4, the amendment would strike the provision stating that Congress \nbelieves the Department of Homeland Security should ``recognize and \ntake into account the difficulties encountered by aliens in obtaining \nevidence of employment'' because of their illegal status. That quote is \nin the underlying bill, that the Department must ``recognize and take \ninto account the difficulties encountered by aliens in obtaining \nevidence of employment.'' In other words, the bill itself is telling \nthe Department: Let it slide. Anything that is stated, you virtually \nhave to accept. That is ridiculous, and we would remove that directive \nfrom the bill.\n\n  And No. 5, the amendment would clarify that the alien has the burden \nof proving his or her employment history by ``a preponderance of the \nevidence.'' It is very reasonable, and, in fact, there is no other \nworkable way to do it, to put the burden of proof on the illegal alien \nto prove the amount of time he has been in the country. Any lesser \nburden of proof, any other way of going about it will be a glaring \nloophole and an open invitation for fraud.\n  Let me underscore the general thrust of my amendment. It goes to some \nof my broad concerns about the bill. We are very good, all of us, both \nparties in the Senate, in making arguments, talking about broad values, \noutlining generalities, and talking about how a new system of laws \nshould work. In my opinion, we are very bad, almost always, at actually \ndesigning a concrete system and paying attention in excruciating detail \nto the words we pass into law to make sure that system can actually \nwork in the real world and not simply be unworkable beyond being able \nto be administered full of glaring loopholes, full of invitations to \nfraud. I believe this bill, unfortunately, is an example of that. I \nbelieve in many aspects, including many that are not covered by our \namendment, this is going to prove very unworkable in the real world and \nbe wide open with loopholes you can drive a truck through, with open \ninvitations for fraud. My amendment simply highlights perhaps the two \nmost obvious or egregious examples of that and tries to close those \nloopholes, close down those open invitations for fraud.\n  With that, I am happy to hear from Members who would like to debate \nthe amendment pro or con.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the amendment, on page \n350, you strike lines 8 through the rest of the page; am I correct?\n  Mr. VITTER. I don't have that in front of me. If you could read me \nthe lines.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, this is on the intent of Congress, the basic kind \nof understanding, the intent of Congress be interpreted in a manner \nthat recognizes the difficulties encountered by the alien in obtaining \nevidence. As I understand, you strike that. And then you strike the \nburden of proof provisions through the top of 351, once the burden is \nmet, the burden shall shift to the Secretary of Homeland Security. So \nthose provisions are dropped. The essence of your amendment is to \ntighten up verification in terms of the applicant.\n  Mr. VITTER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And that is effectively the purpose of the amendment. In \nyour description and in the language, you talk about bank records, \nbusiness records, sworn affidavits from nonrelatives who have direct \nknowledge of the alien's work, including name, address, phone number of \nthe affiant, the nature and duration of relationship. You also talk \nabout remittance records and that the burden is on the alien applying \nfor the adjustment, the burden of proving by a preponderance of \nevidence that he has satisfied the employment requirements.\n  Mr. VITTER. The Senator is correct on all of that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am going to urge that we accept that amendment. We \nwant to make sure, those of us who support this proposal, that we are \ngoing to reach those people who are defined in the legislation. And we \nwant to make sure that it is accurate.\n  We are not interested in people gaming the system or in the identity \ntheft problems and other kinds of challenges and false documents. We \nhave made a very strong effort because if we have that and we lack the \nverification of information and lack the verification in terms of the \nindividual and we are going to have continued forgery of documents, \nthis is going to be a disaster. But we have given strong emphasis in \nterms of legality and veracity, and we are going to have the biometric \nidentification cards. We are going to try to do this correctly and by \nthe book, so to speak.\n  The Senator has redrafted provisions we had in the legislation to \nensure the applicant is going to provide the best information and that \nthe best information has to be reliable and dependable in order to be \nable to participate in the system. I think it is useful and valuable. \nAt the appropriate time, I will urge our colleagues to accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt that we have to have \nappropriate evidence in order to establish the criteria for moving \nahead on the path to citizenship. I believe the Senator from Louisiana \nhas structured a realistic amendment and made improvements to the bill. \nWe are prepared to accept it on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for their encouraging and supportive \nwords. Obviously, I welcome that. Obviously, I welcome this amendment \nbeing adopted.\n  Without taking away anything from that statement, I simply add that, \nunfortunately, while these are very important cases we have identified \nin the bill that highlight these problems, these are not the only \ncases. Unfortunately, I think they are an example of the general nature \nin which many aspects of the bill were drafted.\n  In a spirit of working toward the end all of us have said we fully \nsupport, I encourage all of the Members intimately involved in \ncontinuing to draft the bill, including if a bill should go to \nconference--and I will certainly include the Senators from Pennsylvania \nand Massachusetts--to continue to identify those problem areas in the \nbill language. I hope this amendment will be adopted and we will have \naddressed two of them. I will continue identifying more. I am \nencouraged by the comments that they will join us in that endeavor as \nthis work product moves on.\n  With that, I am prepared to yield back my time if we can proceed to \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are ready for a voice vote on \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (no. 3964) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have concluded the Vitter amendment a \nlittle earlier than expected. It would be appropriate now to proceed \nwith the debate on the Inhofe amendment, with the prospect of later \nhaving a side-by-side. I urge my colleagues who wish to be heard on \nthat subject to come to the floor so we can proceed.\n  Mr. President, while we are awaiting speakers to arrive on the Inhofe \namendment and since we have concluded the Vitter amendment early, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are now going to the Inhofe amendment \nNo. 4064. It is my understanding that we have between now and 4:15, \nwith the time equally divided on my amendment and an alternative \namendment that is proposed by Senator Salazar, and I would ask if that \nis correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An amendment has not yet been proposed by the \nSenator from Colorado. However, the time between now and 4:15 is \nallocated to the Inhofe amendment and any Democratic amendment which \nmight be proposed as an alternative.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair for that clarification. It could very \nwell be, and it is my understanding that some others do have an \nalternative that they want to have considered.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that has been with us for a long \ntime. Due to the great history that is very often presented to this \nChamber by the occupier of the chair, we went back into history and saw \nthat for hundreds of years we have been trying, many of us, as our \nforefathers tried, to make English the national language. The last time \nwe had a vote was 1983. In 1983, there was a--I don't remember who the \nauthor was at the time, but it was before I even came to the House. But \nthat was 23 years ago. So 23 years it has taken now to get a vote on \nthis issue.\n  Ours is a very simple amendment. It is very straightforward. We have \nperfected it by adding things that the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Alabama have asked for, and \nwe think as a result of that, we have a bill that is actually better \nthan ours was when it first started.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I thank the Senator for his cooperation. I think \nwe have had a very valuable dialogue, and the Senator from Oklahoma has \nmade some important concessions. But I would like to make sure that, \nfor the Record, I understand the intent and language of the amendment \nwhich he currently offers.\n  Has the Senator changed the version which referenced section 161: \n``Declaration of official language,'' which shows on page 2 of the \namendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that was changed. It was actually written up--they \nwrote the word ``national'' in the wrong place. It is, ``Declaration of \nnational language.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. May I ask the Senator if he would tell me \nwhether it is his intention to in any way diminish any rights that \ncurrently exist under the laws of the United States of America which \nwould provide individuals with materials or services in a language \nother than English?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it is very appropriate the Senator \nasks that question. We have had a chance to discuss that at some length \nwith a large number of people, and I have stood pretty fast to my \nbelief. Now, keep in mind I am one of the few people around here who is \nnot a lawyer, and therefore sometimes that puts me in a better position \nto understand the law than some of my lawyer friends. But I would say \nthat when we write down, ``unless otherwise authorized or provided by \nlaw, no person has a right, entitlement, claim,'' et cetera, in the \nbill, which is the form of the bill that you have seen and that we have \nall been working on, so my feeling is that language takes care of any \nproblem within the existing law that is on the books.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield, then----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me ask if it would be all right, if \nyou have a number of questions--I don't mind yielding, but I would just \nas soon yield on your time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Fine. Mr. President, I would like to have the time for \nthe questions and answers count against me.\n  So would the Senator say for the Record, is it your intention by this \namendment to diminish any existing rights under the law of the United \nStates relative to services or materials provided by the Government of \nthe United States in any language other than English?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would respond by saying I think the \nstatement stands by itself, speaks for itself. It says, ``unless \notherwise authorized or provided by law.'' We are a country of laws, \nand if there is anything that is inconsistent, that is an exception \nunder section 162.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, that is the problem. \nThis is what it comes down to. This is an easy question to answer: Yes, \nit is not my intention to diminish any rights under the law given to \nany person for services or materials provided by the Government of the \nUnited States in any language other than English. If the Senator said \nyes to that question, it would put a lot of people at ease.\n  But let me tell you what I am afraid is at stake. In the language \nwhich the legal staff has prepared, I am afraid there is more to it. It \nis apparent that at least some believe you are going further than what \nyou have indicated; that you are trying to diminish existing rights of \nthe law. That is troubling because the rights under law that we are \ntalking about are rights that are over 40 years old, dating back to the \n1964 Civil Rights Act. And if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to make a \nstatement of policy that English is the language of the United States \nand it is a common and unifying language, then he will have 100 votes \nin the Senate. It will be an important statement. But when he goes on \nand adds this other language, this amendment raises questions.\n  I just gave the Senator a chance to clarify the rest of his language, \nand he didn't want to do it. I am afraid that is where we are going to \nhave a parting of the ways.\n  I think it is valuable for us to establish that the English language \nis common and unifying in America and that success depends on it, and I \nbelieve that. As I have said many times on the Senate floor, I am the \nson of an immigrant. My mother came to this country; her parents \nstruggled to learn English. She spoke both English and Lithuanian. I \nspeak only English today. My life experience is not much different than \nmost.\n  We had a recent survey that found an interesting statistic. The Pew \nHispanic Center documents that about 80 percent of third generation \nLatinos in the United States speak English as their dominant language. \nExactly zero percent speak Spanish as their dominant language. \nIt suggests that what happened in my family is happening with most \nimmigrant families.\n\n  So they know the obvious: Success in this country depends on \nmastering and speaking English. So if the Senator wanted to make that \nstatement, that English is our common and unifying language in this \ncountry, we would join him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I still have my time, and I would like to say this: When \nI asked him straightforwardly a question as to whether he wanted to \ndiminish the rights of anyone in this country currently under law, \nwhich would include Presidential Executive Orders, I might say to the \nSenator and his legal staff, if he wants to diminish those, he would \nnot give me an affirmative answer which I think would satisfy many on \nthis side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield back to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first of all say no, it is not my \nintent, nor is it the intent of this amendment, to do that. This \namendment is pretty straightforward. It does say ``unless otherwise \nauthorized or provided by law.'' What that says to me is if there are \nsome of these privileges out there that you believe are not in the law, \nthen I would not be addressing those. I think what you are talking \nabout is a matter of law, but I don't know that. I would rather say if \nit is a matter of law, we are providing an exception. And I guess I \nwould ask you the question, since I now have the floor, do you believe \nthat some of these rights are entitlements?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know whose time this counts \nagainst.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I said earlier, this is dangerously \nclose to debate in the Senate, and I am glad we are doing it. My \nfeeling is this: When you say: What are you entitled to? Well, we are \nentitled to be protected from discrimination. That is an entitlement to \nevery American. We are entitled to be protected from discrimination. \nAnd the 1964 Civil Rights Act says one of the things you cannot be \ndiscriminated against is your national origin, where you were born. We \nsay in America, no, you cannot be discriminated against based on \nnational origin. And based on that provision in the Civil Rights Act, \nwe will provide, when it comes to essential services, appropriate \nlanguage assistance to help those who are availing themselves of the \nservices.\n  As I said earlier, in Chicago, that may be Polish or a Filipino \ndialect. But basically what we have said is, yes, you are entitled not \nto be discriminated against.\n  Now, if the Senator wants to wipe away that entitlement, he should \nmake it clear. But I am not sure that he wants to. If he does, I hope \nhe will say so.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, no. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, it is \ncertainly not our intention. And I think what the Senator is saying is \nthat language and national origin are the same when, in fact, I am not \nsaying that language and national origin are the same.\n  Let me go ahead and try to respond, even though I am speaking to \nlawyers and I am not one, with some court cases that I think might \nclarify things for all of us.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, would my friend from Oklahoma yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me hold off yielding until I get \nthrough with what I am about to say. I was going to mention these this \nmorning, but I would like to go ahead and say where I believe we are \ntoday in responding to the question that has already been asked. I \nthink it speaks for itself, but let me see after reading these cases \nwhether you agree with that or not.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, again, if I may ask a question of my \nfriend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I would rather wait until I am through, but go \nahead.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. This is not on the substance----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized to ask \na question.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, what I would like to do as we move \nforward in this discussion is also lay down the amendment that I have \nwhich I believe accomplishes the objectives which have been articulated \nby the Senator from Oklahoma and, hopefully, after the Inhofe \nstatement, I can lay down my proposed amendment which I think addresses \nsome of the questions we are talking about on the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding--we talked about \nthis before the Senator came in--that we will have two amendments that \nwe will be talking about: the Salazar amendment and the Inhofe \namendment. They will be side by side. There will be a vote at 4:15. \nThat vote will take place on my amendment first and then on the Salazar \namendment, is my understanding.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to get into \nsome of the legal background. For the legal analysis, let me start by \nmentioning Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld who was the author of the seminal \nFundamental Legal Conceptions, a powerful and enduring analysis of the \nnature of rights and the implications of liberty. Hohfeld noted that \nrights correlate to duties. A has a duty to B if B has a right against \nA. If A has no duty, that means B has no right and A has liberty, are \nthe terms that he used. Such Hohfeldian analysis applies here.\n  My amendment makes clear that nobody has a right or entitlement to \nsue the Federal workers or the Federal Government for services or \nmaterials in languages other than English. In Hohfeldian terms, the \nFederal Government has no duty to provide services or materials in \nlanguages other than English, but the Federal Government is free to do \nso. In other words, they are not compelled to do it, but they may do \nit, they have the authority to do that.\n  The question has been asked: How does this amendment affect the X \nprogram? Will the Federal Government be free to offer X service or \nmaterial in Y language? The answer is, yes, the Federal Government is \nat liberty to offer, can offer, X services or whatever the program is, \nin whatever language seems to be appropriate, but the Federal \nGovernment only has the duty to offer X services and Y language if a \nstatute creates that right.\n  In other words, we are talking about English as the national \nlanguage. We are talking about certain exceptions that are written into \nlaw, and we have said on page 2 that I have read several times, \n``unless otherwise authorized or provided by law.''\n  That means there are many cases where that would be the case. Again, \nsuch examples exist, such as the Voting Rights Act, which provides for \nbilingual ballots, and the Court Interpreters Act of 1978, which \nprovides for translation services in the Federal courts.\n  Prior to 1978, there was no such act, and that was not the case. This \ndoes not change the decision in the change in law that took place in \n1978.\n  For over 30 years, the courts have ruled uniformly and consistently \non these matters, of providing services and materials in languages \nother than English. Federal courts have rejected attempts to equate a \nperson's language with their national origin in dozens of court cases. \nThis is what I referred to. It seems to me perhaps the other side is \ntrying to say they are one and the same.\n  But the Federal courts have rejected the attempts to equate a \nperson's language with their national origin in dozens of court cases \nand court decisions going back more than 30 years. Therefore, any \nexpansion of the concept of national origin to encompass a theory \nrepeatedly rejected by the Federal courts must come explicitly from \nCongress. It must be a law. It must be something that Congress proposes \nand passes and not be imposed by a flawed or arbitrary interpretation \nof the law. Today the Senate is stating that there is no right, \nentitlement or claim to services and materials in any language other \nthan English. That is assuming we pass our amendment.\n  I will mention just three of the long, unbroken line of court cases \nspanning over 30 years.\n  In 1983 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined in Soberal-\nPerez v. Heckler, which the Supreme Court let stand, that there is no \nright to government forms in languages other than English.\n  In 1994 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined in Toure v. \nU.S. that there is no right to government deportation notices in \nlanguages other than English.\n  The most recent United States Supreme Court case in this area is \nSandoval v. Alexander, the Alabama driver's license case. Justice \nScalia wrote the decision in Sandoval in 2001.\n  The Supreme Court in Sandoval rejected the equation of language and \nnational origin.\n  Indeed, the Federal courts have repeatedly considered and rejected \njust this equation of the failure to provide foreign language services \nand materials with a violation of the prohibition against national \norigin discrimination.\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\n  There is no support in the legislative history or judicial \ninterpretations of title VI for the right or entitlement to Federal \nGovernment services or materials in languages other than English. \nExecutive Order 13166 purported to interpret title VI, but it was \nwritten before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval.\n  This amendment now clarifies in Federal statute the line of cases \nculminating in the United States Supreme Court decision in the Sandoval \ncase. Here we are making clear that there is no legal basis for \nExecutive Order 13166 that purported to direct services and materials \nin languages other than English. I state it again clearly: There shall \nbe no right or entitlement to services or materials in languages other \nthan English.\n  I ask unanimous consent additional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          Legislative History\n\n       The legislative history does not support a language-based \n     definition of national origin. The Supreme Court has noted \n     that the legislative history concerning the meaning of \n     national origin, even under statutory law, is ``quite \n     meager.'' Espinoz v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88 (1973). \n     Nevertheless, ``[t]he terms `national origin' and `ancestry' \n     were considered synonymous.'' 414 U.S. at 89. During debate \n     on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Representative Roosevelt \n     stated: ``May I just make very clear that `national origin' \n     means national. It means the country from which you or your \n     forebears came from. You may come from Poland, \n     Czechoslovakia, England, France, or any other country.'' 110 \n     Cong. Rec. 2,549 (1964).\n       The Supreme Court supports that assessment: ``[t]he term \n     `national origin' on its face refers to the country where a \n     person was born, or, more broadly, the country from which his \n     or her ancestors came.'' Esoinoza, 414 U.S. at 88; see also, \n     Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, 840 F.2d 667, 672-73 (9th Cir. \n     1988) (persons of Serbian national origin are members of a \n     protected class under Title VII).\n\n\n                              Case History\n\n       Federal courts have rejected attempts to equate a person's \n     language with their national origin in dozens of court \n     decisions going back thirty years. Therefore any expansion of \n     the concept of national origin to encompass a theory \n     repeatedly rejected by federal courts must come explicitly \n     from Congress, and not be imposed by a flawed and arbitrary \n     interpretation of the law.\n       The Supreme Court has never held that the language a person \n     chooses to speak can be equated to the person's national \n     origin. Though this issue was briefed and discussed in \n     Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), the Court did not \n     make a holding on this question. ``Petitioner argues that \n     Spanish-language ability bears a close relation to ethnicity, \n     and that, as a result, it violates the Equal Protection \n     Clause. . . . We need not address that argument here.'' 500 \n     U.S. at 360. The Circuits, on the other hand, have rejected \n     such an equation. See, e.g., Soberal-Perez v. Heckler, 717 \n     F.2d at 41: ``A classification is implicitly made, but it is \n     on the basis of language, i.e., English-speaking versus non-\n     English speaking individuals, and not on the basis of race, \n     religion or national origin. Language, by itself, does not \n     identify members of a suspect class.''\n       See, also, Toure v. United States, 24 F.3d at 446 \n     (affirming Soberal-Perez and rejecting request for \n     multilingual forfeiture notices). ``A policy involving an \n     English requirement, without more, does not establish \n     discrimination based on race or national origin.'' ``An v. \n     General Am. Life Ins. Co., 872 F.2d 426 (9th Cir. 1989) \n     (table).\n       The oldest administrative interpretation linking language \n     and national origin is the EEOC's arbitrary presumption \n     against English language workplace rules. 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1606.7. The Supreme Court has never reviewed those \n     purely administrative interpretations. But many other courts \n     have reviewed the EEOC guidelines and have rejected them and \n     their underlying equation of language and national origin. \n     See, e.g., Garcia v. Spun-Steak, 998 F.2d 1480, 1489-90 (9th \n     Cir. 1993), cert. den. 512 U.S. 1228 (1994) (EEOC Guidelines \n     equating language and national origin were ultra vires); \n     Vasquez v. McAllen Bag & Supply Co., 660 F.2d 686 (5th Cir. \n     1981)(upholding English-on-the-job rule for non-English-\n     speaking truck drivers); Garcia v. Rush-Presbyterian St. \n     Luke's Medical Center, 660 F.2d 1217, 1222 (7th Cir. \n     1981)(upholding hiring practices requiring English \n     proficiency); Long v. First Union Corp., 894 F. Supp. 933, \n     941 (E.D. Virginia, 1995)(``there is nothing in Title VII \n     which protects or provides that an employee has a right to \n     speak his or her native tongue while on the job.''), \n     affirmed, 86 F.3d 1151 (4th Cir. 1996).\n       A few cases indicate that if the language policy is a \n     pretext for intentional discrimination, a language-related \n     rule might violate national origin rules. In addition, two \n     recent lower court decisions have adopted the EEOC's \n     interpretation equating language and national origin. See, \n     e.g., EEOC v. Synchro-Start Products, 29 F.Supp.2d 911, 915 \n     n. 10 (N.D. Illinois, 1999)(on advice of law clerk, Judge \n     Shadur was ``staking out a legal position that has not been \n     espoused by any appellate court.''); EEOC v. Premier Operator \n     Services, 113 F.Supp.2d 1066 (N.D. Texas, 2000) (Magistrate \n     Judge Stickney, rejecting appellate cases against EEOC \n     Guidelines and relying on Synchro-Start Products and Judge \n     Reinhardt's dissent from denial of rehearing en bane in Spun \n     Steak, found disparate treatment of Hispanic employees in the \n     promulgation of an English-workplace rule; the defendant \n     company was bankrupt and did not present a defense).\n       But almost all cases, including all Circuit decisions, have \n     rejected the equation of language and national origin. See, \n     e.g., Gloor, 618 F.2d at 270 (``The EEO Act does not support \n     an interpretation that equates the language an employee \n     prefers to use with his national origin.''); Nazarova v.

Mr. President, I know we can get bogged down. I suspect \nthe reason this particular amendment that has been proposed numerous \ntimes in the past but not in the last 23 years, and that it is going to \nget bogged down on a lot of technical questions, is that perhaps some \npeople do not want this amendment, so they come up with all kinds of \ntechnical reasons to oppose it. But what we are doing is declaring--we \nare making a declaration--that English is the national language for the \nUnited States of America.\n  We are taking the exceptions, for example, the Court Interpreters \nAct. Before the Court Interpreters Act passed in 1978, defendants did \nnot have a right to an interpreter. It was up to the Court's \ndiscretion. The Court Interpreters Act protects already existing \nconstitutional rights such as in the sixth amendment, the fifth \namendment, the 14th amendment, amendments on due process. It is very \nimportant to know that is one of the many exceptions that is written \ninto law. It is a very important exception.\n  You also have some exceptions found in the Voting Rights Act. \nSomebody mentioned this morning some disaster could take place in \nCalifornia, a tsunami or something such as that, and when the eviction \nnotices come, obviously, if you are addressing Chinatown, it would be \nin Chinese. We know that. That protection is there.\n  I believe we have covered the legitimate concerns that are out there. \nI know there are some people who do not want this to happen who are \ngoing to vote against this. I understand that. That is what this is all \nabout. It has been 23 years since we had an opportunity to vote for it \nor against it. Those of you who want to vote against it, you are going \nto have your opportunity at 4:15 today. In the meantime I agree with \nthe Presidents--almost every President of the United States going back \nlong before Teddy Roosevelt. One of the things he said is, ``We must \nalso learn one language and that language is English.'' As we remember, \nPresident Bill Clinton in his State of the Union Message in 1999 got a \nstanding ovation when he said that our new immigrants have a \nresponsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That means \nlearning English and learning about our Democratic system of \ngovernment.\n  I agree with that. I didn't agree with everything that President \nClinton said, but I certainly was one who stood and applauded during \nthat State of the Union Message in 1999.\n  I think other Presidents have done the same thing as recently as a \nfew days ago, when our President said that an ability to speak and \nwrite the English language, English allows newcomers to go from picking \ncrops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to renting offices, \nfrom a life of low-paying jobs to a diplomat career and a home of their \nown.\n  This is an opportunity. We look at people who come to this country \nand, oddly enough, those individuals that I have spent many hours \nwith--I say to my good friend from Colorado that when I was mayor of \nTulsa, we had never had any kind of recognition of our Latin \npopulation. Yet I knew it was a very large population. I would say to \nyou, at that time I used to be a commercial pilot in Mexico and I \nactually spoke the language fairly well at that time. It has been many \nyears, 25, 30 years, I guess. But when I became a mayor I said: I know \naround here we are very rich in history and have a talented bunch of \npeople who have come here and are good citizens of our city of Tulsa. \nSo I formed the Hispanic Commission of the city of Tulsa. This may or \nmay not surprise you. Some of them were kind of in hiding, not even \nrecognizing that they were Hispanics, and they came out. We had the \nCinco de Mayo and all the celebrations there. It is probably the most \npopular thing that has ever been done in the city of Tulsa.\n  I went back and talked to these people. I said: Do you agree with the \npolling data that shows very clearly that Hispanics want to have \nEnglish as the national language? And they said yes. This is a group I \nhave been dealing with since 1978.\n  I think it may be someone's impression that certain extremist \ngroups--and I am sure there are some extremist groups that have a large \nnumber of Latinos in them. They may be offended. They may not want to \nhave this. That is fine. Let them exercise their influence on every \nvoter, each of the 100 Members of this body. That is the way the system \nworks.\n  But I will say this. Jumping from the ones I know and the ones I have \nhad experience with back in my city of Tulsa, the Hispanic population \nis very proud of the fact that they are going to learn English, and it \nshould be our national language. As recently as 2 months ago, a Zogby \npoll, in March of 2006, found that 84 percent of Americans, including \n77 percent of the Hispanics, believe English should be the official \nlanguage of Government operations. In 2002, the Kaiser Family \nFoundation poll--which I don't think anyone is going to question--found \n91 percent of the foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning \nEnglish is essential to succeeding in the United States. In 2002, there \nis also a Carnegie/Public Agenda poll that found by a more than 2-to-1 \nmargin, immigrants themselves say that the United States should expect \nnew immigrants to learn English.\n\n  My favorite poll is this one. In 2004, the National Council of LaRaza \nfound that 97 percent--strongly 86.4 percent or somewhat 10.9 percent--\nagreed that the ability to speak English is important to succeed in \nthis country. That is a no-brainer. We all know that. There is not a \ncountry you go to where that is not true.\n  I would say this. There are 50 other countries around the world today \nthat have English as their national language. In these countries, they \nexpect you, when you come to their country, to learn English. But if \nyou go to another country, if it is Italy or France or any other \ncountry, you are expected to be able to communicate in their language.\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\n  In 1988, G. Lawrence Research showed 87 percent favored English as an \nofficial language with only 8 percent opposed and 5 percent not sure. \nThat was 1988. Very consistent; about the same numbers. A 1996, \nnational survey by Luntz Research asked, ``Do you think English should \nbe made the official language of the United States?'' and 86 percent of \nAmericans supported making English the official language and only 12 \npercent opposed and only 2 unsure. That was 1996.\n  In 2000, Public Opinion Strategies, showed 84 percent favored English \nas the official language, with only 12 percent opposed and 4 percent \nnot sure.\n  In 2004 another Zogby poll, that was a different one than the one I \nquoted, but 92 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of Democrats, and 76 \npercent of Independents favored making English the national language. \nAgain, that was a March poll of Zogby. It is consistent throughout.\n  You have some things working here. You have everybody wanting it, \nincluding the Latin community. You have more than half the States, 27 \nof the 50 States--27 States have accepted English as an official \nlanguage, including Colorado, I might add, I say to my good friend from \nColorado. Let's see where Illinois is. Yes, Illinois. You don't have a \nproblem in Illinois. You already have it as a State concept that has \nbeen accepted.\n  So if you have 27 States, you have 51 other nations accepting English \nas the national language, you have all the polling data showing this is \nwhat people want, you have an exception made so no one is going to lose \nanything by doing it this way, then I can only come to the conclusion \nthat you don't want it as the national language.\n  That is fine. That is good. If that is the case, we are going to have \na vote at 4:15 and make that determination.\n  Before I yield, let me ask how our time is coming along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 30 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I'll take it on my time. The Senator made it clear. He \nhas two parts of this amendment. The first part is, frankly, an easy \npart. Is English the common, unifying language of our Nation? The \nanswer is yes. His conclusion is that you can't succeed in America \nwithout being English proficient. If that's his amendment, that vote \nwould be 100 to nothing.\n  It is the second part, the part you called the technical arguments, \nthat we find troublesome. You said, in the course of explaining the \namendment, that you didn't want to take away any existing rights of \npeople in law, in courtrooms, for example, or going to vote, and I'm \nglad to hear that. But I want to ask you directly: Do you want to \ndiminish any of the rights currently available to those living in our \ncountry under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits \ndiscrimination based on national origin?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Do I personally want that? No, I don't. This amendment \ndoesn't do that because it makes those exceptions because what you are \nreferring to is the law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask you expressly and specifically, because you \ndid refer to this. This was Executive Order 13166, issued by President \nClinton, which implemented the same title of the Civil Rights Act that \nI referred to. The Executive Order said that agencies of our Government \nhad to make efforts to provide their services and materials to people \nwith limited English proficiency.\n  Is it your intention with your amendment to, in any way, diminish the \nresponsibilities and rights created by Executive Order 13166?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding, I say to the Senator from \nIllinois, that the courts already have had some interpretations of that \nwhich perhaps are not the same as you are stating right now. What the \ncourts have interpreted I stand behind because that means it is law. \nThat is according to my amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So will the Senator accept an amendment to his amendment \nwhich says that:\n\n       Nothing herein shall diminish or expand any existing rights \n     under the law of the United States relative to services or \n     materials provided by the Government of the United States in \n     any language other than English?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. You will have an opportunity to have that in your side-\nby-side amendment that will be voted on after mine. My answer is no \nbecause we have already massaged this language. A lot of people are \nsupporting this. If I start changing things now, as you well know, they \nare going to start peeling off, and I won't have the support I have \nright now. We will have an opportunity to vote on my amendment. Then we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on whatever language you decide to put \nin, in your amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I agree that English is the common language of our Nation. \nEveryone should learn it, just as I believe everyone should learn other \nlanguages and more about the world around them. But I must oppose the \nInhofe amendment because it does not merely encourage learning the \nEnglish language. I am concerned that this amendment will have far-\nreaching consequences and eliminate the rights of many Americans.\n  First of all, the Inhofe amendment is unnecessary. English is the de \nfacto official language of the United States. In fact, according to the \n2000 census, only 9.3 percent of Americans speak both their native \nlanguage and another language fluently.\n  Second, the Inhofe amendment is divisive. The sponsors of the \namendment claim that this is needed to promote national unity. However, \nour common language is not what unifies this country. It is our common \nbelief in freedom and justice. The first amendment to the Constitution \nensures that we have the freedom of speech. We are free to speak in all \nlanguages--not just English. For those individuals who do not speak \nEnglish, this amendment would deny U.S. citizens with limited English \nproficiency basic rights. For example, our country was founded on the \nbelief that the people of this country hold the power--they are the \ncheck on our Government. However, limiting services to the English \nlanguage could deny people the right to exercise this power and receive \nessential Government services.\n  Moreover, children growing up in homes that speak languages other \nthan English will feel stigmatized. As a young child, I was discouraged \nfrom speaking Hawaiian because I was told that it would not allow me to \nsucceed in the Western world. My parents lived through the overthrow of \nthe Kingdom of Hawaii and endured the aftermath as a time when all \nthings Hawaiian, including language, which they both spoke fluently, \nhula, customs, and traditions, were viewed as negative. I, therefore, \nwas discouraged from speaking the language and practicing Hawaiian \ncustoms and traditions. I remember as a young child sneaking to listen \nto my parents so that I could maintain my ability to understand the \nHawaiian language. My experience mirrors that of my generation of \nHawaiians.\n  This is the same problem facing bilingual education. There is a push \nto stop the learning of other languages when individuals are young, \nwhen it is much easier to learn another language, but then we tell \nthose same people that it is essential that they learn another language \nto preserve our national security. This is contradictory.\n  Third, the amendment sends the wrong message to our heritage \ncommunities. After the terrorist attacks of \n9/11, we sought out these individuals to help with our translation \nefforts; however, now we are telling them that we do not value their \nlanguage enough to provide them with essential services in their \nlanguages. The ability to speak a foreign language is critical to our \nnational security, and we should not discourage that in any way.\n  Fourth, the Inhofe amendment could prohibit the Government from \nproviding emergency services in other languages or providing critical \nhealth and safety materials to non-English speakers since such programs \nmay not be required by law. People's lives might be endangered by this \namendment.\n  Finally, I worry that the very strength of our democracy is \nthreatened by this amendment. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 2703, a bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Importantly, S. \n2703 will continue to require bilingual voting assistance. Unless every \ncitizen has access to the\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\npolls and can understand the language on their voting ballot, our \ndemocracy is not as strong as it could be.\n  We want immigrants and individuals from all over the world to learn \nabout the United States and what defines us. I think our basic freedoms \nare what define us. To limit the ability of non-English speakers to \nknow about the United States and experience and observe the freedoms on \nwhich this country was founded, would be a disservice to the United \nStates. Actions speak louder than words, no matter the language. I urge \nmy colleagues to act to oppose the Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment introduced \nby my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  I firmly believe a common language promotes unity among citizens and \nfosters greater communication. Establishing a national language would \nsave the Government the expensive and time-consuming task of preparing \ndocuments in many languages.\n  A recent Zogby poll showed 84 percent of our population believes that \nEnglish should be the official language of our Government. Twenty-seven \nU.S. States have already made English the official language, including \nLouisiana which agreed to it as a condition of statehood. My home State \nof Wyoming made English the official language of the State in 1996. \nFifty-one nations also have English as their official language, but the \nUnited States does not. It is time that we have a clear statement on \nour national language.\n  This amendment also addresses the important issue of English \nproficiency for new citizens. On May 15, 2006, President Bush addressed \nthe Nation about the needed reform of our current immigration \nsituation. He stressed the positive role that the English language has \nfor new citizens. Many improvements need to be made to the current \nprocess that our new citizens go through. I am pleased that this \namendment creates a set of goals for updates to the new citizen exam. \nSome of the goals are demonstration of sufficient understanding of \nEnglish usage in everyday life and an understanding of American common \nvalues. These common values include the principles of our U.S. \nConstitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, the National Anthem, and the \nsignificance of our American flag. The goals will help new citizens \nbetter understand our Nation and become productive members of our \nsociety.\n  Senator Inhofe's amendment is a good strong statement in support of \nEnglish as our national language and the importance of sharing this \ncommon value with new citizens. I have worked on legislation that would \nestablish English as the official language of the U.S. Government \nduring my service in the Senate and in the Wyoming State Legislature, \nand I encourage all Senators to support this important amendment to the \nimmigration reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4073\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself and \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Reid, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4073.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision:\n\n     SEC. 161. DECLARATION OF ENGLISH.\n\n       English is the common and unifying language of the United \n     States that helps provide unity for the people of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 162. PRESERVING AND ENHANCING THE ROLE OF THE ENGLISH \n                   LANGUAGE.\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the common and unifying \n     language of America. Nothing herein shall diminish or expand \n     any existing rights under the law of the United States \n     relative to services or materials provided by the government \n     of the United States in any language other than English.\n       For the purposes of this section, law is defined as \n     including provisions of the U.S. Code, the U.S. Constitution, \n     controlling judicial decisions, regulations, and Presidential \n     Executive Orders.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for title \n     4, United States Code, is amended by adding at the Language \n     of Government of the United States.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me first say that the amendment I send to the desk is sponsored \nas well by Senators Reid, Durbin, Bingaman, and Kennedy.\n  I would first like to start by reading the amendment in its basic \nentirety. I think that it reflects what it is we are talking about in \nthe Chamber this afternoon. My amendment reads as follows:\n\n       English is the common and unifying language of the United \n     States that helps provide unity for the people of the United \n     States.\n       The government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as a common and unifying language \n     of America. Nothing herein shall diminish or expand any \n     existing rights under the law of the United States relative \n     to services or materials provided by the Government of the \n     United States in any language other than English.\n\n  That is the essential and substantive part of the amendment which we \nare sponsoring today.\n  As I start to speak about this amendment, I want to say this \namendment is a unifying amendment because it speaks to the common \nlanguage of America. It unifies us from whatever particular language or \nbackground we come from.\n  It is my hope that when we complete this debate today we could have \n100 Senators standing up in support of this amendment.\n  Let me say, for me--as we have approached this debate over \nimmigration and as we approach this debate over official English and \nother aspects of amendments that have been offered by my friend from \nOklahoma--it has been also a time for me to reflect back to the history \nof America and to the history of my own family in this country. My \nfamily came in and founded the city of Santa Fe in 1598, 408 years ago. \nAnd the language that is still the language of my home--the language \nstill spoken on our ranch 110 miles north of Santa Fe--is still the \nspoken language from the 12th and 13th centuries. It is a very old \nlanguage.\n  I remember during those days when I was a young man going to school \nin the 1960s in Conejos County, in the southern part of Colorado, those \nwho spoke Spanish in our school were punished because of the fact they \nspoke Spanish. I remember seeing the incident where young people would \nhave their mouths washed out with soap because of the fact they \nhappened to be speaking a language other than English in the public \nschool. I have seen these kinds of incidents through a lifetime of \npersonal experience.\n  I think those kinds of incidents and those kinds of experiences run \ncounter to what America is all about. America becomes richer and \nstronger because of our diversity. We have learned through the hard \ntimes of history that America is stronger when it stands together, when \nwe find those issues that unite us as opposed to those issues that \ndivide us.\n  We found those issues that divided us in the Civil War and over half \na million Americans died in that war. We found those issues that \ndivided us in the era of segregation that led to Brown v. Board of \nEducation and led to the Civil Rights Act of the 1960s. Those acts were \nintended to bring us together as a country.\n  My fear is that the proposal which has been presented by my good \nfriend from Oklahoma will serve to divide this country and not unite \nthe country.\n  That is why the amendment I have offered, along with my colleagues, \nis intended to be an amendment that says we believe the English \nlanguage is the common language of the United States and that it is a \nunifying language of the United States and we stand behind that \nlanguage as the common language of America.\n  Let me also make a couple of observations regarding Senator Inhofe's \namendment.\n  First, when you read the language itself and read the technical \nlanguage of it, you have to ask yourself the question: Why is that \nlanguage there?\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nYou can read in the second part of the second page of his amendment \nessentially the language that says ``no official will communicate, \nprovide services, or provide materials in any language other than \nEnglish.''\n  I know there have been exceptions written into the language to try to \naccommodate times and places where the language other than English \nmight have to be spoken.\n  We have to ask the question: Why is the language written the way it \nis which says it is in these narrow, tailored exceptions where we will \nmake the exception that a language other than English can be spoken?\n  It causes me concern because I am not exactly sure what that means. \nIf I am a public official working in law enforcement for one of our \nFederal agencies, if I work for the U.S. Postal Service, or wherever I \nmight work in any agency of the Federal Government, I might read the \nlanguage that says officials cannot communicate or provide materials in \na language other than English. As someone who might not be a lawyer but \na public servant serving within the Federal Government, it might give \nme a signal--and I think it would--and lots of our Federal employees \nthe signal that perhaps providing services to the citizens of the \nUnited States in a language other than English is wrong and violative \nof the rule of law.\n\n  They will not have the opportunity that we have had today to go \nthrough the fine review of this legislation in the way that we have, \nand even after having gone through that fine review of this language \nthere are still many of us who have questions as to how this proposed \namendment will take away rights from the people of America.\n  As I was listening to my friend from Oklahoma speak about the \nimportance of this amendment, one of the things he said is that he \nthought it was important that we stand together in opposing national \norigin discrimination. For sure, we can all agree in this Chamber that \nwe are not to discriminate against someone because they happen to be \nIrish or French or if they happen to be of Mexican descent, whatever it \nis; we stand united in this country's belief in the proposition that we \noppose any kind of discrimination based on national origin. Yet, it \nseems to me, from what I was hearing from my friend from Oklahoma, that \nthe same thing does not apply with respect to language discrimination; \nif you happen to speak a language other than English, or if you happen, \nperhaps, to have an accent that indicates you may be of a native tongue \nthat is other than English, that perhaps discrimination on the basis of \nlanguage then would be sanctioned under our law in America. That is not \nthe American way. The American way is to say that we are a stronger \ncountry when we recognize the differences among us, when we tolerate \nthose who are different among us, and that we create a much stronger \ncountry when we stand together.\n  I believe the amendment which Senator Inhofe has proposed will create \ndivision within the country. I think it is putting a finger on a \nproblem that does not exist today.\n  The statistics which Senator Inhofe cited, which are also cited by \nthe National Council for Larussa, indicates that most Americans, \nincluding most Hispanics, speak English. The National Council for \nLarussa cites a GAO study in which it was consistently found that U.S. \nGovernment documents are printed in English only. In fact, less than 1 \npercent of U.S. Government documents are published in any language \nother than English.\n  They also found that the English language is not under attack in our \ncountry. In the U.S. census findings, they found that 92 percent of \nAmericans had no difficulty speaking English. We also found in poll \nafter poll that immigrants in America come because they want to learn \nEnglish. They want to learn English. They want to assimilate into our \nsociety because they know that English is, in fact, a keystone to \nopportunity.\n  The Inhofe amendment does nothing in terms of including or \nencouraging people to move forward and learn the English language. We \nare already a country that speaks English. Senator Inhofe's amendment \ndoes not do anything with respect to moving the English language \nacquisition forward.\n  Let me finally say that it is true there are many States that have \nmade English their official language. I believe that English being made \nthe official language is also a matter of States rights. It is true \nthat in my State of Colorado, as well as in other States, English has \nbeen adopted as the official language of those particular States. I \nbelieve we ought to leave it to the States; let the States decide we \nare a Federal system. I think States ought to decide the way we ought \nto go with respect to dealing with this issue.\n  Let me conclude by saying the amendment which I have proposed, along \nwith my colleagues, Senators Reid, Durbin and Bingaman, is an amendment \nthat would unify America and not divide our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the amendment which \nwe have offered and oppose the Inhofe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from \nTennessee requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, first, let me say to my friend from \nColorado that if we were to take all 100 of us who are in the Senate, \nsome of whose families have been here for a while, none of us, I would \njudge, have families who have been in the United States for longer than \nSenator Salazar's family--for 11, 12, or 13 generations. It is a source \nof great pride to serve with him.\n  He and I discussed this amendment. I understand his passion and \nfeeling about it. But what I would like to do in a few minutes is take \nexactly the opposite view from the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nbecause I do not see how the United States of America can be unified \nunless we have a national language. That is all this is about. The \nInhofe amendment is not an official English amendment. It is not an \namendment to declare English the official language of the United \nStates, which 27 States have done. It does not require that all \ngovernment documents even be printed in English. It could have done \nthat, but it doesn't.\n  It simply says English is the national language of the United States, \nperiod. That is the first thing it says. Then it has a provision that \ntalks about the importance of encouraging the learning and \nunderstanding of English.\n  Then it has a provision which, the way I read it, says that nothing \nprevents the government from rendering services in languages other than \nEnglish.\n  That would mean that in a whole variety of areas where the Congress \nlast made a decision--whether it is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, the Bilingual Education Act of 1967, the \nprovision that Senator Robert Kennedy put into the law recognizing the \nunusual circumstances of Puerto Ricans who moved from Puerto Rico to \none of the 50 States--or an Executive order by any President, this \namendment wouldn't change any of that. That is the whole point of the \namendment. It is just to say this is our national language.\n  Then it says that someone does not have the right to sue to get \nservices in another language unless it is provided by law. It doesn't \ndiminish a right already established by law.\n  It does one other important thing. It draws on the beginnings of an \namendment by Senator Sessions about the citizenship requirements that \nhave been in our citizenship process. It seeks to make those stronger.\n\n  Senator Sessions is not the only one in this Senate interested in \nthat. There is probably no one in this Senate more interested in that \nthan the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, who is not \nonly interested in American history, but his family has a place in it.\n  We have worked together in a variety of ways to try to get a clearer \nunderstanding of U.S. history among our children, among our citizens--\nnot because we want to punish them, but because we have such a unique \nand diverse country that it is critical that we all understand these \ncommon unifying principles which come from our history, including what \nwe are debating today: rule of law, equal opportunity, laissez-faire, E \npluribus unum. We are not pro-immigrant or anti-immigrant;\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nwe just have four principles on which we all agree, and we are trying \nto put them together into a bill. Those are the things which unite us \nas a country, along with one other thing, and that is our common \nnational language.\n  The second part of the Inhofe amendment has in it language to help \nimprove the citizenship exam that legal immigrants take to become \ncitizens, of which 514,000 did last year. It is good language, language \nwhich was in the legislation Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid, and I \nworked on with many others a couple of years ago to help create summer \nacademies for outstanding teachers and students of American history. We \ntried to define the history we were talking about in the sense of key \nideas, key documents such as the Declaration of Independence, the place \nfrom which come our unified principles.\n  Here are the differences between the amendment from the Senator from \nColorado and the Senator from Oklahoma. There are four differences. It \nis important for colleagues to understand.\n  Senator Inhofe's amendment declares that English shall be the \nnational language. The Senator from Colorado has taken out the word \n``national.'' He does not want it to say that. He says ``common and \nunifying'' language. I prefer the wording of the Inhofe amendment \nbecause while English is our common language, it is more than that. It \nis the common language of a number of countries, but English is also \npart of our national identity. It is part of our blood. It is part of \nour spirit. It is part of what we are. It is our national language. \nThat is one difference.\n  No. 2, the Salazar amendment does not include the provision that is \nin the Inhofe amendment that says that for all those people here \nillegally who may become lawful and put on a path to citizenship, which \nis the goal of the sponsors, it says those persons must learn English. \nThe Inhofe amendment strengthens that requirement. Currently, in the \nunderlying bill, it simply says they must be enrolled in school to \nlearn English, and the Inhofe amendment strikes that, so those persons \nhave to learn English in order to be here lawfully. That is very \nimportant.\n  This large number of 10 million or so people who are here illegally \nis the source of most of the problems in this debate. If we are not \ngoing to send them all home, which almost no one thinks will happen, \nthen we either have to put them on a path to citizenship or lock in 10 \nmillion people in the United States who pledge allegiance permanently \nto another flag, which is something we have never done before. The \nInhofe amendment is preferable because it helps make it easier for \nthose 10 million to learn our national language. Those are two \ndifferences.\n  The third difference is the Salazar amendment completely takes out \nthe excellent work Senator Inhofe and Senator Sessions did, much of the \nlanguage having been borrowed from work that Senator Kennedy, Senator \nReid, I and others worked on, which tried to improve the citizenship \ntest. This may not be an intention of the Salazar amendment, but it \ndoes it. It takes out the language that says the test should mention \nthe key documents, such as the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the \nEmancipation Proclamation, and key events such as the American \nRevolution, the Civil War, the world wars, the civil rights movement, \nand the key ideas and key persons.\n  Why is that important? Because we are not a nation based on race, we \nare not a nation based on ancestors; we are a fragile idea based upon a \nfew principles and our national common language. So I prefer an \namendment that has those provisions in there. That is the third reason.\n  The fourth, as I read it, suggests that Executive orders issued by \nthe President are just like statutes. Constitutional lawyers would have \na problem with that.\n  A vote for the Inhofe amendment is a vote to say English is our \nnational language. It is a vote to say that those who may not be here \nlegally, but who eventually may be determined legal by this legislation \nunder some process, should learn English on their way to citizenship. \nAnd finally, the amendment includes a very good section that helps to \ndefine the key ideas and events of our history for citizenship.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Would my friend from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would be happy to if we can do that on your time.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I would be happy to do so on my time. Through the Chair, \nI ask the manager.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. He is asking the question, and he wants to answer the \nquestion on our time. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, through the Chair, I say to my friend \nfrom Tennessee, there was an Executive order issued on limited English \nproficiency and the importance of reaching out to people who are \nlimited English proficient so they could recognize and understand the \nlanguage of the Government, an Executive order dated August 11, 2000.\n  Is the Senator's reading of the Inhofe amendment that it would \nessentially eviscerate the Executive order issued by then-President \nClinton concerning limited English proficiency?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The answer to my friend from Colorado is no. The \nelection of a new President might change an Executive order if the new \nPresident modified or changed the Executive order. My understanding of \nSenator Inhofe's amendment, and he can speak for himself, is he does \nnot seek to change any right now granted to anyone.\n  We can have a good debate about whether there ought to be bilingual \nballots. In my opinion, I don't think there should be because you have \nto be a citizen to vote and you have to demonstrate an eight grade \nunderstanding of English to be a citizen. But that is in the law and is \nnot affected by this and neither would an Executive order.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I say to my friend from Tennessee, not too long ago in \nthe Senate, we entered into a debate concerning the nomination of \nAttorney General Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States. \nThere were Members of this Senate who came to the Senate and spoke \neloquently in Spanish about why he should be confirmed, including \nSenator Martinez. Would the Inhofe amendment make it illegal for that \nkind of activity to occur in the Senate?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Colorado, that \nis a preposterous question for what we are talking about and not really \na suitable question for a serious proposal.\n  This is a simple proposal which declares that English is the national \nlanguage of the United States and that the Government of the United \nStates should do whatever it can to encourage that. It does not change \nany right that anyone has today. It also includes a strengthening of \nthe citizenship test. Anyone who understands the founding documents \nknows that liberty is at the front of our unifying principles. Any \ncitizen has a right to speak in Spanish. A Senator, of course, does as \nwell. This has nothing to do with inhibiting anyone's rights. It just \ndeclares that, unlike Switzerland, unlike Canada, unlike Belgium, we \nhave a common national language that is part of our identity. We do not \nwant to be based on race. We do not want to be based on ancestry. We \nwant to be unified by a few things--the unifying principles and our \nnational common language.\n  So the answer is, of course not.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, in response to the colloquy I am having \nwith my friend from Tennessee, it seems to me this language could be \nread that Senator Inhofe has proposed to say that because we are a \nGovernment Chamber, since we do not have a law that proactively says--\nor a rule of the Senate--that you can speak a language other than \nEnglish here, perhaps when we were speaking about Attorney General \nGonzales, we would have been in violation of this exact provision if it \nstays in the same language.\n  To continue my question to the Senator, my friend from Tennessee, it \nwas not at all our intention in the drafting of the amendment to take \naway any of the requirements we have for people who come here under \nthis immigration proposal to learn English or to go through the civics \ncourses which are required now for the legislation that has been \nincluded in here. So it is my view that the Senator has misread the \namendment we have supported.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could have 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The differences I see in the two amendments are, No. \n1, the Salazar amendment says no to making English our national \nlanguage. It uses another description. No. 2, it says no to the \nrequirement that immigrants who are illegally here and who may be put \non a path to citizenship should learn English before they go on that \npath to citizenship. And it says no to the provisions in the Inhofe \namendment which improve the citizenship test, requiring those who \nbecome citizens to learn the key events, key documents, key ideas of \nour history.\n  The Inhofe amendment is well within the mainstream of 90 to 95 \npercent of the thinking of the American people. It is a valuable \ncontribution. It is a restrained proposal. It does not seek to change \nany existing right that someone might have to receive services from the \nGovernment in some other language.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the minority leader has several \nspeakers who want to speak. I also know that virtually everyone on our \nside is wanting to stay with the 4:15 vote.\n  What I would like to do, of course, is encourage the minority leader \nto use his leader time if necessary but go ahead and allow anyone on \nthe other side to use time at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy.\n  I have been trying to figure out what is, in my mind, objectionable \nto the Inhofe amendment. I think it comes down to a very basic point; \nthat is, the Inhofe amendment, the language, the operative language of \nthe Inhofe amendment, is:\n\n       . . . no person has a right, entitlement or claim to have \n     the Government of the United States or any of its officials \n     or representatives act, communicate, perform or provide \n     services, or provide materials in any language other than \n     English.\n\n  That is the operative provision. And then it says there are \n``exceptions.'' The exceptions are where we have specifically written \nlaws which allow that or which provide for the providing of information \nor communication in a language other than English.\n  Why is that objectionable? It is objectionable to me because it is \ndirectly contrary to the constitution of my State, the thrust of the \nconstitution of my State.\n  When New Mexico came into the Union in 1912, we had many more people \nin my State speaking Spanish than we had speaking English. People were \nvery concerned that the right of individuals in the State to speak \neither language would be preserved and that no one be discriminated \nagainst by virtue of their inability to speak English.\n  We wrote a provision in our constitution which says that the right of \nany citizen of the State to vote, to hold office, or to sit upon juries \nshall never be restricted, abridged, or impaired on account of \nreligion, race, language, color, inability to speak, read, or write the \nEnglish or the Spanish language except as may otherwise be provided in \nthe constitution. So the presumption is directly opposite to the Inhofe \namendment.\n  The general rule in my State and in my State's constitution is that \npeople shall not in any way be discriminated against in their dealings \nwith the Government by virtue of their inability to speak English. And \nthe Inhofe amendment says that the general rule is people have no right \nto speak any language or communicate with their Government in any \nlanguage other than English unless we write a law saying they can. I \nthink that is an unfortunate change in emphasis and change in the law, \nwhich I cannot support.\n\n  Obviously, we have many court cases. And, I gather, under one of the \nexceptions to the general rule that the Inhofe amendment contains, this \nmight be covered. But it has been well recognized, I believe, in our \ncourts for a very long time that it is a denial of due process to non-\nEnglish-speaking persons if they are denied services and communication \nand interpretation in their own language when they are in criminal \nproceedings.\n  We have a provision, again, in my own State constitution which I \nthink is pretty close on this issue. It says: In all criminal \nprosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend \nhimself in person, and by counsel, to demand the nature and cause of \nthe accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to \nhave the charges and testimony interpreted to him, and in a language \nthat he understands.\n  Now, I know there is a Federal law that says the same kind of thing \ntoday. So it falls under one of the exceptions that is provided for in \nthe Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. You mentioned several things. I believe the last one you \nmentioned was covered in the Court Interpreters Act of 1978. It does \nallow you to have that, and it is actually written into law.\n  I would also suggest that these are already in law. This is not \nsomething that has to be done.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Right.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Those protections are specifically exempted on page 2.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time and indicate I \nsaid that very thing. I am not disagreeing with the Senator from \nOklahoma. He has pointed out there are legal provisions that make an \nexception to his general rule, and the exception in this case is that \nyou are entitled to have the Government provide interpretation when you \nare accused of a crime and you are trying to defend yourself in court.\n  All I am saying is, why are we writing into law a general rule that \nyou are not entitled to communicate with your Government or have your \nGovernment communicate with you in any language other than English, \nexcept where we provide for it? I think that is a mistake. It is \ndirectly contrary to what my own State constitution does. It is \ndirectly contrary to the sentiment behind my State constitution.\n  We have the Native American Languages Act where Congress specifically \nfound that there is convincing evidence that student achievement and \nperformance and community and school pride and educational opportunity \nare tied to respect for the first language of the child or the student. \nAnd we talk there about that Native American languages shall not be \nrestricted in any public proceeding.\n  Well, you can say: OK, now, we have already written a law that \nprotects the rights of Native American languages to be used in public \nproceedings. So that is not a problem.\n  I do not know that I want to have to have this Congress write a law \nto cover every circumstance that might arise where an American wants to \ncommunicate with his or her Government in some language other than \nEnglish. I think it is a bad precedent for us. I think it is contrary \nto the history of my State. It is certainly contrary to that.\n  I hope very much we will resist this amendment. I think this is a \nnonproblem. I do not know why we are spending most of the day debating \nan issue of this type, except to say to people who do not speak \nEnglish: You are not going to be entitled to the full rights that other \ncitizens are entitled to.\n  Clearly, that is true economically. We all know that. We all know you \ncannot succeed economically in this country in a full way unless you \ncan speak English, and probably speak English with adequate \nproficiency. But I do not think as a legal matter we need to be writing \nstatutes into the Federal law that say if you are not speaking English, \nyou are entitled to fewer rights, you are entitled to fewer legal \nrights than other citizens are, and we want to remind you of it.\n  In fact, as to this amendment, it is very interesting, because it \nsays: Look, even if you fall under one of these exceptions--this \ninterpreter's exception or the Native American exception; the language \nwhere we have written a specific law--it says, if exceptions are made, \nthat does not create a legal entitlement to additional services in that \nlanguage or any language other than English.\n  So we are saying: Look, the general rule is, you have to speak to \nyour Government and communicate with your Government in English. We \nacknowledge there are exceptions where we will allow you to use other \nlanguages, or the Government will agree to communicate with you in \nother languages, but\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nwe are going to be specific about what those are. But let's also remind \nyou--this last sentence says--by making an exception and allowing you \nto have an interpretation into a language you can understand, we are \nnot giving you a legal entitlement. We are not, in any way, committing \nourselves to do anything more.\n  I do not know that is a very welcoming message to all these \nimmigrants we are welcoming into our country as part of this \nlegislation. I think my State is a State that has a great tradition of \ncooperation between the Native American community, the Hispanic \ncommunity, and the Anglo community. And we have been able to maintain \nthat sense of cooperation by respecting each other's languages, by \nrespecting the right of each person, each group, to use his or her \nlanguage in whatever way they feel is appropriate. I believe this \namendment by Senator Inhofe would change that dynamic substantially. So \nI hope my colleagues will agree with me, will oppose this amendment, \nwill support the Salazar amendment, and then I hope we can get on with \nmore substantive matters.\n  There are a great many substantive matters involved with this \nimmigration bill. This is an enormous, complex piece of legislation \nwhich we ought to be trying to understand and deal with separate from \nthis discussion about English as the national language.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in consultation with the floor manager--\nthis has been a good, important, and constructive debate--we need a few \nmore minutes. And we asked the floor manager----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me go ahead and respond.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask consent to get the time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the manager has \nagreed to allow 45 more minutes for the other side; is that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is acceptable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 45 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, one request I would have, if the Senator \nwould yield for a moment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when Senator Salazar wants to make a \ncorrection, I have a correction to make at the same time. We could do \nthat right now, if you want to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4073, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe modified with the change that is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4073), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision:\n\n     SEC. 161. DECLARATION OF ENGLISH.\n\n       English is the common and unifying language of the United \n     States that helps provide unity for the people of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 162. PRESERVING AND ENHANCING THE ROLE OF THE ENGLISH \n                   LANGUAGE.\n\n       The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the common and unifying \n     language of America. Nothing herein shall diminish or expand \n     any existing rights under the law of the United States \n     relative to services or materials provided by the Government \n     of the United States in any language other than English.\n       For the purposes of this section, law is defined as \n     including provisions of the U.S. Code, the U.S. Constitution, \n     controlling judicial decisions, regulations, and controlling \n     Presidential Executive Orders.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for title \n     4, United States Code, is amended by adding at the Language \n     of Government of the United States.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4064, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment on page 2, to change the word ``official'' to the word \n``national.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4064), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 295, line 22, strike ``the alien--'' and all that \n     follows through page 296, line 5, and insert ``the alien \n     meets the requirements of section 312.''.\n       On page 352, line 3, strike ``either--'' and all that \n     follows through line 15, and insert ``meets the requirements \n     of section 312(a) (relating to English proficiency and \n     understanding of United States history and Government).''.\n       On page 614, after line 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 766. ENGLISH AS NATIONAL LANGUAGE\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 4, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n                ``CHAPTER 6--LANGUAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\n``Sec.\n``161.

The Department of Homeland Security is currently \n     conducting a review of the testing process used to ensure \n     prospective United States citizens demonstrate said knowledge \n     of the English language and United States history and \n     government for the purpose of redesigning said test.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section only, the \n     following words are defined:\n       (1) Key documents.--The term ``key documents'' means the \n     documents that established or explained the foundational \n     principles of democracy in the United States, including the \n     United States Constitution and the amendments to the \n     Constitution (particularly the Bill of Rights) the \n     Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, and the \n     Emancipation Proclamation.\n       (2) Key events.--The term ``key events'' means the critical \n     turning points in the history of the United States (including \n     the American Revolution, the Civil War, the world wars of the \n     twentieth century, the civil rights movement, and the major \n     court decisions and legislation) that contributed to \n     extending the promise of democracy in American life.\n       (3) Key ideas.--The term ``key ideas'' means the ideas that \n     shaped the democratic institutions and heritage of the United \n     States, including the notion of equal justice under the law, \n     freedom, individualism, human rights, and a belief in \n     progress.\n       (4) Key persons.--The term ``key persons'' means the men \n     and women who led the United States as founding fathers, \n     elected officials, scientists, inventors, pioneers, advocates \n     of equal rights, entrepreneurs, and artists.\n       (c) Goals for Citizenship Test Redesign.--The Department of \n     Homeland Security shall establish as goals of the testing \n     process designed to comply with provisions of [8 U.S.C. 1423 \n     (a)] that prospective citizens:\n       (1) Demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the English \n     language for usage in everyday life;\n       (2) Demonstrate an understanding of American common values \n     and traditions, including the principles of the Constitution \n     of the United States, the Pledge of Allegiance, respect for \n     the flag of the United States, the National Anthem, and \n     voting in public elections;\n       (3) Demonstrate an understanding of the history of the \n     United States including the key events, key persons, key \n     ideas, and key documents that shaped the institutions and \n     democratic heritage of the United States;\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n       (4) Demonstrate an attachment to the principles of the \n     Constitution of the United States and the well being and \n     happiness of the people of the United States; and\n       (5) Demonstrate an understanding of the rights and \n     responsibilities of citizenship in the United States.\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall implement changes to the testing process designed to \n     ensure compliance with [8 U.S.C. 1423 (a)] not later than \n     January 1, 2008.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken several times in the course \nof this debate about my belief that immigrants should learn the English \nlanguage. In my experience, most new Americans want to learn our \nlanguage and make efforts to do so as quickly as possible. The bill \nthat we are debating calls for immigrants to learn English as one of \nthe several steps they must take before they can earn citizenship.\n  We can all agree that English should be the common language of the \nUnited States, but by making English the ``national'' language, the \nInhofe amendment goes too far. The amendment was modified to remove a \nban on publishing official documents in any language but English. That \nwas a good correction. In many local communities and States it may well \nbe useful and helpful for the government to reach out to language \nminorities. Greater participation and information are good and \nappropriate steps communities should be striving for. We should not be \nmandating artificial and shortsighted restrictions on State and local \ngovernment.\n  I regret, however, that the amendment continues to include language \nthat strongly discourages the use of other languages to inform \nresidents and continues to treat those who speak another language as \nsecond-class citizens. We would do better to recognize our diversity \nand provide greater opportunities to those for whom English is a second \nlanguage to become more fluent.\n  My mother spoke Italian as a child and learned English when she went \nto school. My wife grew up in a family that spoke French. She began \nspeaking English when she started going to school. Both were helped \nthroughout their lives by being completely and totally bilingual as a \nresult.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we are trying \nto find out how much time the Senator wants.\n  Ten minutes, does that work?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, I will have a total amount of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, information is vital and sometimes lives \ndepend on it. Is it not in the interests of all Americans to have every \nmember of our society as well-informed on matters of health, safety and \nour democracy as possible? Do we really want to restrict government \npublications and communications, such as those on disaster \npreparedness, public health concerns, if there is an avian flu \npandemic, to English only? We have recently seen the extensive and \neffective reach of Spanish radio in this country. Would we not want to \nemploy that resource in a crisis? Do we really want to tie our hands \nand require Congress to pass a special statute every time health and \nsafety materials, for example, would be useful?\n  We already have statutes that call for bilingual election materials \nto assist language minorities in accordance with our commitment to \nmaking participation in voting fair and meaningful. We know that there \nare many circumstances in which effective access to information \nrequires communications in many ways and many languages.\n  Would it not have been useful for the President to try to sell and \nexplain the Medicare drug benefit plan with all its complications and \npermutations in many languages in order to reach the most possible \nbeneficiaries? Do we really intend to require such obviously beneficial \nactions to need a special statutory authorization? Should we review \nagency requirements to take warnings in languages other than English \noff our airlines and automobiles and dangerous equipment? Are we going \nto stop providing court translators and require all court proceedings, \nwhich are themselves official government proceedings, to occur in \nEnglish, only to the detriment of fairness and justice?\n  Are we going to go back into the Congressional Record and scrub the \nstatements of Senators Martinez and others who have used Spanish here \non the floor? If I recall correctly, the Senator from Oklahoma has \nspoken on this floor in Spanish. Would this amendment make his use of \nSpanish illegal--or does the Constitution's ``speech and debate'' \nclause mean that the rule that he is asking us to adopt applies to \neveryone else but not to Senators?\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee is on the Senate floor. \nIt was only a few weeks ago that we worked together to adopt the \nAlexander amendment to S. 2454, the immigration bill we debated in \nApril. The text of Senator Alexander's amendment is included in S. \n2611, the bill before us now. The Alexander amendment created a grant \nprogram to promote the integration of immigrants into our democracy by \nteaching civics, history and the English language.\n  That is the right approach for America to take. The Inhofe amendment \ntakes the opposite approach, the wrong approach and has the effect of \nstigmatizing those who grew up where Spanish or Chinese or other great \nlanguages were spoken. It risks driving a wedge between communities. \nThis is contrary to our values and what we should be seeking to \naccomplish with this important legislation.\n  I recognize that not every State is like my home State of Vermont, \nwhere the majority of residents speak English. Even in my State, \nhowever, there are many families who first came to America speaking \nonly French. My parents-in-law became proud American citizens. They \nspoke French at home, and that was the first language of my wife. My \ngrandparents emigrated from Italy speaking Italian. That was the first \nlanguage of my mother until she went to school. We are proud of that.\n  In prior generations, we welcomed large groups of Irish, Italians, \nEastern Europeans, and in recent years, immigrants and refugees from \nAfrica, Asia and many other parts of the world. I wish my French was \nbetter. I wish my Latin was more polished. I wish I knew more than a \nfew words and phrases in Chinese and Spanish.\n  On Monday night, the President spoke eloquently about the need to \nhelp newcomers assimilate and embrace our common identity. He spoke of \ncivility and respect for others and said that Americans are bound \ntogether by our shared ideals. These are the messages we must send to \nthe American people, not the divisive message of the Inhofe amendment.\n  I look around this Senate Chamber and engraved in the wall behind the \nelevated desk and chair of the President of the Senate are the words \n``E Pluribus Unum.'' Every school child is taught that expression, \n``out of many, one'' and what it means to our shared value of being the \nUnited States of America. It points to an important value from our \nhistory and today. It points to our struggle to become a nation of many \npeople, of many States, and of many faiths. What is wrong with our \nusing Latin, as we traditionally have and expressing our unity?\n  Latin expressions mark our official currency and the reverse of the \nGreat Seal of the United States. The phrases ``annuit coeptis'' and \n``novus ordo seclorum'' are part of the official symbols of the United \nStates. These expressions are traced back to Virgil and a line from his \ninstruction for farmers, which seeks the favor of God or Providence for \nour great endeavor to create a nation unlike any that had come before. \nThe second Latin phrase is another allusion to Virgil and notes our \nseeking a new order.\n  Our incorporation of languages other than English does not stop \nthere. Take a look at the flag of Connecticut with the phrase ``Qui \ntranstulit sustinet''; the flag for Idaho that includes the phrase \n``Esto perpetua''; the Kansas flag that includes the phrase ``ad astra \nper aspera''; the Maine flag that includes ``Dirigo''; the \nMassachusetts flag that includes the phrase ``Ense petit placidam sub \nlibertate quietem''; the Michigan flag includes not only ``e pluribus \nunum'' but also ``Circumspice,'' ``Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam'' and \n``Tuebor''; the Missouri flag includes the phrase ``Salus populi \nsuprema lex esto''; the flag of New York includes the expression \n``Excelsior''; the Virginia flag includes the\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\nphrase ``Sic semper tyrannis''; the flag of West Virginia includes the \nphrase ``Montani semper liberi''; and the Wisconsin flag also includes \nthe phrase ``e pluribus unum.''\n  I see the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nMinnesota, and I thought I would include the flag from his own State. \nThe flag of Minnesota includes a French language phrase befitting its \nhistory, ``L'etoile du Nord.''\n  Do we in this Senate mean to demand that the States change their \nState flags and State mottos to eliminate Latin and French? Do we \nreally mean to frown on their use? Or is it only Spanish, a language \nderived from Latin that we wish to denigrate? In that case, I remind \nthe Senate that the State of Montana includes on its flag the phrase \n``oro y plata,'' a Spanish phrase that serves as the State motto ``gold \nand silver.''\n  I remember how silly we looked a couple of years ago when some in the \nHouse demanded that French fries be renamed ``freedom fries.'' Does \nthis prohibition apply to Roman numerals, such as those included on the \nflag of Missouri? Does this body intend to embark down that road? I \nhope not, I pray not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I think those who have been listening to this debate understand what \nthis discussion is all about. On the one hand, we have the amendment of \nthe Senator from Colorado, which is effectively a way to unite all of \nus, and on the other hand, we have the Inhofe amendment that is a way \nthat is going to divide us. The language couldn't be clearer. From the \nSalazar amendment:\n\n       English is the common and unifying language that helps \n     provide unity for the people of the United States.\n\n  It is clear.\n\n       Preserving and enhancing the role of the English language. \n     The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the common and unifying \n     language of America.\n\n  On the other hand, we have the Inhofe amendment that has the \nstatement:\n\n       Unless otherwise offered or provided by law, no person has \n     a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the \n     United States or any of its officials or representatives act, \n     communicate, perform or provide services, or provide \n     materials in any language other than English.\n\n  We have had a debate about how that applies or whether it doesn't \napply, and we have had a rather mixed debate.\n  I would be impressed if the Inhofe amendment had provided some \nresources to help those who are limited English speaking to be able to \nlearn English. In the immigration legislation before the Senate, we \nhave the requirement that no person, except otherwise provided in this \ntitle, can be naturalized upon their application without understanding \nthe English language, including the ability to read, write or speak the \nEnglish language. That is what we have said. That is underlined. That \nis what we are committed to.\n\n  Now we have this amendment which is effectively a limiting one.\n  In Albuquerque, NM, Catholic Charities reports 1,000 people on their \nwaiting list and a waiting time of 12 months to learn English. Is there \nanything in the Inhofe amendment that will help those people? No, there \nis not. In my hometown of Boston, there are 16,000 adults on the ESL \nlist waiting to learn English. It is 2 to 3 years. Anything in the \nInhofe amendment to help those people who want to learn English? No. \nThere is nothing. In Phoenix, AZ, in the Rio Solado community, over \n1,000 are waiting 18 months. The list goes on. In New York, 12,000 are \nwaiting. All of these individuals are waiting to study English. But \ndoes their amendment do anything about that? No. We can't help people \nto get to the point where English is their language.\n  What did the 9/11 Commission say. It said we lacked sufficient \ntranslators. It also had a provision in the 9/11 Commission report that \nwe ought to give emphasis to other languages and that that was in our \nnational security interest. It is on page 415, developing a stronger \nlanguage program with high standards. Do you think that is consistent \nwith the Inhofe amendment? Of course, it is not consistent with the \nInhofe amendment.\n  We have outlined the requirements in this legislation that have to be \nmet. It is very clear that an understanding of the English language, \nthe ability to read and write and to speak, that is the requirement, a \nrestatement of the importance of developing and keeping consistent with \na common and unifying language, which is English. I don't understand \nthose who say that English is a part of our national identity. Is that \nmore a part of our national identity than our common commitment to \nliberty or fairness or decency or opportunity? Are we going to say we \nare the only ones who own those? Other countries don't own those \nvalues; it just belongs to the United States?\n  The Salazar amendment states effectively and well what we as a nation \nare committed to. It deserves to be supported. It defines English as \nthe common and unifying language, guarantees that nothing shall \ndiminish existing rights relative to services and materials in a \nlanguage other than English. I urge my colleagues to reject the Inhofe \namendment and support the Salazar amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator from California could hold off for a \nminute, I think we have heard some very eloquent statements in \nopposition to an amendment that doesn't exist. We could stand up and \ntalk about the flags of the different States. This has nothing to do \nwith that. Yes, I have made probably five speeches on the floor in \nSpanish. Every time we did, I had to go up and put it down in English \nfor the Record. I don't mind that. This has nothing to do with that. As \nfar as there being nothing in here encouraging people, if you look at \nsection 767, this is encouraging people and helping people to learn the \nEnglish language, a concept that 90 percent of Hispanics in America \nwant. I just hope that anyone listening realizes that these are \nexcellent arguments, but they have nothing to do with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I have spoken about \nthis amendment. As I said to him when he first decided to offer it, is \nthere any question in anybody's mind that in America we speak English, \nthat that is the language of the country? If you ask any person in this \ncountry, they will say English. If you ask any foreigner, they will say \nEnglish. So the question is: Why do we have to say that English is the \nlanguage that we speak in America? Are we that insecure about \nourselves? Of course, it is. We are a nation of many who proudly keep \ntheir own culture. But, of course, English is our language.\n  If we have to say that it is your language, fine with me. Fine, I \nhave no problem with it. In other words, if there are those who believe \nwe have to now tell people what they already know, fine. But I want to \ndo it in a way that unites us, not in a way that sets up some \nunintended consequences. Even though my friend from Oklahoma would not \nagree that there are unintended consequences, I think there are. For \nexample, he said he made five speeches on the floor of the Senate in \nSpanish. And he went and he translated them so they appeared in \nEnglish. Did he go over and did he dub in the videotapes? Because the \nvideotapes will show the speech in Spanish. Is he breaking the rule \nthen by not going up and hiring someone to dub in his words? What if \nthere is an outbreak of a pandemic and it is moving quickly and there \nis no Federal law saying that you have to let people know in a series \nof different languages to protect our people and we didn't have time?\n  What if there is a terrorist attack, God forbid, and we are not even \nhere, and we need to spread the word and there is no law, and we can't \ncome in to pass a law. What is going to happen then? And as my friend \nfrom Vermont said: Are we going to have to take the State flags out \nfrom an exhibit in the basement because many of them have slogans in \nLatin? There are unintended consequences.\n  I know my friend tried hard to get us all to unify, but I have to \nsay, if that\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nwas what he wanted to do, Senator Salazar has put together an excellent \namendment. English is the common and unifying language of the United \nStates that helps provide unity for the people of the United States. \nThat is a beautiful statement. It says that English is our common \nlanguage. But he doesn't set up an issue in his amendment, which I have \nread very carefully, that can have the unintended consequence of coming \nback to bite us. His particular amendment unifies us. I thank the \nSenator for that very much, coming from a State that has great \ndiversity, the great State of California. I thank him for his hard \nwork.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, again, it is a beautiful statement in \nopposition to an amendment that doesn't exist. When the Senator from \nCalifornia talks about emergencies and an emergency evacuation, I \npreviously used the example of California because I suspected she might \nbe coming down. That is, if there is an evacuation or some emergency, \nit can be done in Chinese so Chinatown can all evacuate. That is not a \nproblem.\n  Yet when I spoke on the floor in Spanish, the only reason I had to \ntranslate it is because that is one of the rules of the Senate. It has \nnothing to do with this bill. That would not be affected in any way.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina 8 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is a debate which you wonder why you \nare having it the more we talk about it. How did we get here from where \nwe started?\n  Let me suggest that what Senator Inhofe was trying to do here is \nimportant. Senator Bingaman, my good friend from New Mexico--I disagree \nwith him that this is not that big a deal in terms of its importance to \nthe bill or the debate. I think it is a very important part of the \ndebate. I appreciate Senator Inhofe putting it on the floor of the \nSenate. We will talk about what I think the amendment does and does not \ndo. Let's talk about why it is important to the debate.\n  One thing we have to remember is that the underlying bill that came \nout of Judiciary, the McCain-Kennedy concept as changed by Hagel-\nMartinez, which I support and I think is a good solution for a real \nproblem for America, has as one of the provisions that if you will come \nout of the shadows and you raise your hand and say: Here I am, I am \nundocumented, the bill allows you a path to citizenship with several \nrequirements before you can ever apply for citizenship. One of those \nrequirements is that you come out of the shadows, and for a 6-year \nperiod you can work here, and you have to pay a $2,000 fine. I think \nthat is fair. I don't think that is being oppressive. That is making \npeople pay for violating the law. It is a punishment that is consistent \nwith a nonviolent offense.\n  Another condition is that you must learn English. Why did we make \nthat a condition of coming out of the shadows? I think Senator Kennedy \nand every other person on that side of the aisle--the Democratic side \nof the aisle--understands that to require an illegal immigrant to learn \nEnglish is not unfair. If we thought it was unfair, we should not have \nput it in the bill. Why did we put it in the bill? We realize as a body \nthe best you can do for people coming out of the shadows is challenge \nthem and help them learn English so they can be value added to our \ncountry and they can survive in our economy.\n  It is true that the Inhofe amendment doesn't provide any resources, \nnor does the Salazar amendment. The reason neither one provides \nresources to learn English is that we have already done that with my \ngood friend, Senator Alexander from Tennessee. We put a requirement on \nthe undocumented illegal immigrant to learn English but in a true \nAmerican fashion. We have put some resources--a $500 grant--on the \ntable which will help meet that obligation.\n  Here is the important point. If you fail to pass the English \nproficiency exam, you will be deported. Under the bill, if you fail to \npass the English proficiency exam--and I am probably the worst advocate \nin the country for the English language--you can be deported. That is \nnot unfair. That is not too hard. That is just. So if you are willing \nto make everybody come forward and learn English, and if they fail you \nare going to deport them, why can we not say as a body that the \nGovernment of the United States shall preserve and enhance the role of \nEnglish as the national language of the United States of America? If we \nare willing to deport people for failing to learn English, surely we \nshould stand behind the concept as a nation that it is in our best \ninterest for people to learn English.\n  Now, as to the unintended consequences, I have looked at this all \nday, and I am of the belief that this amendment, as written, preserves \nevery legal opportunity avenue available for the Federal Government to \ninteract with the people of the United States by issuing forms and \ndocuments in languages other than English. The purpose is to say \npublicly that English is our national language and that the Government \nshall preserve and enhance the role of English without having the legal \nconsequence of rolling back laws that are already on the books that \nallow the Government to interact with its people, provide services in \nother languages. That is why the term ``unless otherwise authorized or \nprovided by law'' is there. That means, simply put, if there is a law \non the books--a case decision, a regulation, an Executive order, you \nname the source of law--or a constitutional provision that would allow \nthe Federal Government to interact with its people in a language other \nthan English, it is not affected by this amendment, nor does it prevent \nin the future the Government expanding those services in a language \nother than English. It says, also, there is no entitlement to a service \nfrom the Federal Government in a language other than English, unless \nauthorized by law. That is just a simple, commonsense concept.\n  We do business in this country at the Federal level. We have programs \nat the Federal level that allow languages other than English to be \nutilized, including the Voting Rights Act, which allows bilingual \nballots, and the Court Interpreters Act of 1978, which provides for \ntranslations or interpretations of other languages in Federal court. \nThere are a lot of laws that allow the Federal Government to provide \nservices in languages other than English, and this amendment protects \nthose laws; it doesn't change their status at all.\n\n  Now, to read this amendment to say that some State flag has to be \nchanged--I will be honest with you, that is not even an honest, fair \ninterpretation of the words as printed on the paper. It is not the \nintent of anyone. It is something being said that is not rationally \nrelated to the words or the intent of the author or the way the bill \nworks. We are trying to preserve whatever legal rights there are to do \nbusiness in languages other than English that are in existence today, \nand maybe tomorrow, and we are trying to reinforce the role that \nEnglish is our national language. If we don't do that, if we back off \nof that concept, what signal are we sending to the people we are \nwilling to deport if they fail to learn English?\n  We cannot have it both ways. We need to take a strong stand for a \ncouple of principles. If you want to assimilate into American society, \nit is important that you learn English. How have we stood for that \nprinciple? If you come out of the shadows and you fail the English \nexam, you are going to get deported. We are giving people money to help \nthem pass that exam, but we are not going to waive the requirement that \nyou learn English to be assimilated for the 11 million undocumented \nworkers. I think it would help everybody in this country if the Senate \nwent on record and said that the policy of this Government will be to \npreserve and enhance the role of English in our society, and do it in \nsuch a way that understands that speaking other languages, having a \ndifferent culture, is not a bad thing but a good thing. There is \nnothing in this amendment, in my opinion, that does away with any laws \nthat already exist or might exist in the future for a language other \nthan English.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Inhofe language in this amendment\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\ncontains two basic parts. In the first part, we can talk about changing \na word or two, but we all basically agree on it. We basically agree \nthat to be successful in America, you must speak English. I imagine \nthere are people on the margins of our society who survive without a \ncommand of English, but that is where they will remain. It is rare that \na person in America reaches a level of success without a mastery of \nEnglish. As I go about the State of Illinois and the city of Chicago, \nwhere so many people speak many different languages, it is well \nunderstood that learning English is the first step toward becoming an \nAmerican and becoming successful in America. We don't argue about that.\n  There are different ways to characterize English as our language. I \nlike the characterization of my colleague, Senator Salazar, who \ncharacterizes English as ``our common and unifying language.'' It is \nthat; it is our common and unifying language. Senator Inhofe uses the \nwords ``our national language.'' But when you get down to it, there is \nno argument here about the basic premise. We agree on the basic \npremise. It is not as if it is just in America. We know that the \nlanguage of aviation around the world is English. We know that the \ncommon universal language in most places on the Internet is English. \nThat is a fact. So when it comes to the first part of Senator Inhofe's \namendment and that first part of Senator Salazar's amendment, there is \nno dispute. If the debate ended there, we would have voted a long time \nago. But that is not where the debate ends. Senator Inhofe added \nseveral sentences beyond that, which now take us into a legal thicket.\n  He argues that these are technical issues. They are not technical \nissues. They are issues about a person's basic rights in America. They \nare issues that really emanate from landmark legislation, such as the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. This is not a technicality; it is the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. People literally fought and bled and died for the \npassage of civil rights legislation. Before we casually cast aside some \npart of the protection of that law, we should think about it long and \nhard.\n  I look at the language Senator Inhofe brings to the floor and, on its \nface, it appears to be easy to accept:\n\n       Unless otherwise authorized or provided by law, no person \n     has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of \n     the United States or any of its officials or representatives \n     act, communicate, perform, or provide services or provide \n     materials in any language other than English.\n\n  You would think if it is not authorized by law, that means the \nGovernment cannot communicate or provide materials in any language \nother than English. How could that possibly come up? Well, let's take \none illustration. I happened to be on the floor the day that Senator \nInhofe of Oklahoma came to the floor in the midst of a debate on a \njudicial nominee, Miguel Estrada. The date was November 12, 2003. \nSenator Inhofe came to the floor and gave his remarks to the Senate in \nSpanish. I was impressed. He is proficient in Spanish, and I respect \nhis skills in that language, which I do not share. I didn't understand \nwhat he said, but I respected him for being confident enough to come to \nthe floor and express himself in the Spanish language. And then what \nhappened was that the Congressional Record, which is printed every day \nfrom our proceedings, included Senator Inhofe's speech in Spanish and \nhis translation in English. They are both part of the Record.\n  But wait. Had Senator Inhofe's amendment been in effect then--the one \nhe wants us to vote for today--it would have been illegal for our \ngovernment to print the Congressional Record with Senator Inhofe's \nspeech in Spanish. There is no statute which creates the right of any \nMember to come to the floor and speak in any language. Oh, it happens. \nNobody objects to it. They do their best to print those speeches, but \nthere is no law authorizing it. So, if Senator Inhofe's amendment had \npassed at that time, the speech which he delivered on the floor in \nSpanish, would not have been allowed to be printed and published by the \nGovernment in the Congressional Record. Is that what we want to \nachieve? Is that our goal?\n\n  Let me give you another practical example. Near this U.S. Capitol is \nthe famous Potomac River. The Washington Post ran a story 6 months ago. \nIt said that drowning deaths on the Potomac River were down \ndramatically. Last year, for the first time in 15 years, no one drowned \nin the Potomac in the Washington area. Park Rangers believe they know \nwhy: their new signs that warn swimmers and fishermen about the river's \nstrong current and undertow. The new signs are printed in English and \nin Spanish, the native languages of many new immigrants who use the \nriver to relax with their families or to fish. The Park Service posted \nthe bilingual signs after they noticed that many recent drowning \nvictims were also recent immigrants. So, is making this political \nstatement in the Inhofe amendment so important that we wouldn't want to \nprovide safety for those who are using the Potomac River? It was \nconsidered to be a sensible, rational thing to do: print the sign in \nboth languages so people will be warned of the danger.\n  You have heard the arguments here about the potential of avian flu. \nWouldn't we want any dangers relative to avian flu or some other \nepidemic to be shared in enough languages so that we all would be \nprotected? Yet what Senator Inhofe has done is to create an obstacle \nfor those who are trying to achieve public safety and public health.\n  Why do we need to do this? Why do we need to change the laws of \nAmerica? I don't think we do. I think instead we have an option which \nis much better.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to yield on your time if you have a \nquestion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't have time. We were very generous in giving you \ntime, I would remind you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will yield for a colloquy for 1 minute, \nand then I see that the minority leader is here.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, where in this bill does it say you can't \nput those signs up, or where does it say in this bill that my speech \nthat I made in Spanish would not be able to be included in the \nCongressional Record?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator asked that question \nbecause that is exactly the point of what I am saying. It is because of \nyour language in the amendment that states, ``Unless authorized or \nprovided by law,'' bilingual printing cannot be done, and it would be \nillegal.\n  We have done some quick research but there is no statute we have \nfound which says that when Members give speeches on the floor in \nforeign languages, the government shall print that speech in the \nforeign language in the Congressional Record. It isn't there. There is \nno authorization in law for the printing of your remarks in Spanish. \nAnd you tell us in the language of your amendment that if not \nauthorized by law, it cannot be done; it is illegal.\n  The point I am making is that the Senator started with a very \npositive and important premise, that English is our common and unifying \nlanguage and that it should be preserved and enhanced by our \nGovernment. But the amendment then went too far. I think I know why. I \nbelieve what he is really aiming for is an Executive Order by President \nClinton. Some on his side want to get rid of that. They don't like that \nExecutive Order because that Executive Order, which is now being \nfollowed by our Government as law, says that when it comes to basic \nFederal services, we will help people who have limited proficiency in \nEnglish understand their rights and understand their responsibilities. \nI think that is reasonable. I believe perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma \nsees it the other way.\n  I see my leader is here on the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the gentleman will yield, colloquy goes two ways. Let \nme just respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, but it is \nmy time. I will conclude by saying that in this situation, I urge my \ncolleagues to take a close look at these amendments. I hope they will \nconsider that the Salazar amendment is really the more positive \nstatement that protects the rights of all Americans. It respects our \ncultures, but it also makes it clear that we have one common and \nunifying language in this country, and that is English.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just one comment.\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I request that the minority leader not use \nleadership time since he now has 45 more minutes than we have, but that \nis just a request.\n  I would say this: We have a very short period of time to wind up. I \nwould have to say that all of these ridiculous examples, such as the \none the Senator from Illinois just came up with and the flag examples, \nhave nothing to do with this amendment. It might be some other \namendment that was referred to. This merely recognizes and declares \nEnglish to be our national language. We have exceptions for anything \nthat is in there in law or would refer to anything else that is \naccepted.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask, how much time do we have \nremaining?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 9 seconds remaining.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, English is today, as I speak, the language \nof America. In spite of the fact that in Nevada, we have the beautiful \nSierra Nevada mountains; in Las Vegas, the meadows. In one of our \ncounties, White Pine County, 200 miles from Las Vegas, Ely, a longtime \nmining community, I can remember going there to the Slav festival and \nbeing taken to the graveyard because in the days of early Kennecott, \nthey had a section in that graveyard for Greeks, for Slavs, for \nItalians.\n  Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. Things have \nchanged around the world. If a person wanted to join the Foreign \nService, whether they were in England, the United States, or any \ncountry in South America, to be in the diplomatic corps of their \ncountry, they had to learn French. That was the language of diplomacy. \nNot anymore. It is English. The language used in diplomatic relations \naround the world is English.\n  If I am a pilot and I am flying into National Airport, the air \ntraffic controller is speaking English. If I am a pilot and am flying \ninto Lima, Peru, the air traffic controller speaks English. If I am a \npilot flying into Moscow, the air traffic controller in Moscow speaks \nEnglish. The language of flying is English. It applies to every country \nin the world where they have an airport and they have air traffic \ncontrollers. English is the language, and my distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, knows that. He himself has flown around the \nworld as a pilot.\n  I have affection for my friend from Oklahoma, but I have the greatest \ndisagreement with him on this amendment. While the intent may not be \nthere, I really believe this amendment is racist. I think it is \ndirected basically to people who speak Spanish.\n  I have three sons who speak Spanish--fluent Spanish. One of them \nlived in Argentina for a couple of years, one lived in Ecuador, one \nlived in Spain. They speak fluent Spanish. I am very proud of these \nyoung men. They have acted as interpreters for me when I do radio \nprograms that are in Spanish. I can remember once being so frustrated. \nI was a guest in a hotel. I had locked myself out of my room. There was \na lady pushing the cart, and I told her I would like to get back in my \nroom. She did not know what I was saying. She could not converse with \nme in Spanish. So as luck would have it, here comes one of my sons. The \nminute he spoke to her in Spanish, her whole demeanor changed. She \nbecame a different person because, through my son, we could \ncommunicate.\n  I have a young man who works for me, an American citizen, of course, \nFrederico. Frederico comes from Puerto Rico. We were talking today \nafter this amendment had been laid down, and Frederico said it wasn't \nlong ago--and these were his words--that a cleaning lady, a janitor, \nwas buying a home here in Washington, DC. She had been an American \ncitizen for 10 years, doing her best to become part of society. She was \nvery concerned, though. She was buying a home. Maybe by some standards \nthe home wasn't much, but to her, it was her first home. She was so \nfrightened. She had papers; she couldn't understand them. She asked \nFrederico if he would help her, and he did that. She was able to buy \nthe home.\n  He also told me that he became ill--very sick. He didn't know what \nwas wrong with him. He speaks Spanish, and I don't think I would \nembarrass Frederico in saying that even today--he is well educated, a \nlongtime citizen--he still speaks with an accent, a Hispanic accent, \nfor want of a better description. He speaks good English with a slight \naccent. He was so sick. He didn't know what was wrong with him, and he \nwas afraid, when he went to the hospital, the emergency room, he was \nafraid that he couldn't communicate to the health care workers what was \nwrong with him, and he asked: Is there anybody here who speaks Spanish? \nAnd there was--one of the nurses--and he was able to communicate. He \nfelt better and the emergency room personnel felt better because he \ncould explain to them what was wrong.\n  I believe this amendment cuts the heart out of public health and \npublic safety. I gave you the example of the emergency room. I don't \nknow all of the reasons that the Executive order was issued by the \nPresident. I think one reason is because of public health. It is so \nimportant for us, English speakers only, that when someone goes to get \nhelp and they are sick, that they are able to tell the health care \npersonnel everything they need to know because it is important to me \nif, for example, it is a communicable disease.\n  So I believe we have to understand that this amendment would hurt \npublic health badly. We need people to be able to take their children, \nwhen they are sick, to a facility, whether it is for mumps that is \ngoing around now or whether, Heaven forbid, it is avian flu at some \nlater time.\n  I have served in the Congress of the United States with Jim Inhofe \nfor many years, and we disagree on issues on occasion. But even though \nI believe this amendment is unfair, I don't in any way suggest that Jim \nInhofe is a racist. I don't believe that at all. I just believe that \nthis amendment has, with some people, that connotation--not that he is \na racist but that the amendment is. So I want to make sure the record \nis spread with the fact that I have only the strongest, as I indicated \nearly on, affection for Jim Inhofe, the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Public safety. Mr. President, one of the earmarks I got a number of \nyears ago in our appropriations bill was for the Las Vegas Metropolitan \nPolice Department because they needed police officers who were fluent \nin Spanish. Why? Because we have a large influx of Spanish speakers \ncoming to southern Nevada, and the sheriff of Clark County believed he \ncould do a better job with law enforcement if he had people who could \ncommunicate. And that is true. That worked out very well. I believe \nfunding for police could be affected by this amendment if it passes.\n  Domestic violence is a perfect example. There is a lot of domestic \nviolence, and we need people who can speak the language that people \nunderstand.\n  Reporting crimes--it is so important that law enforcement has the \nability to understand when people report crimes. In Nevada, 6 percent \nof the population is Asian American. We have now in Las Vegas a very \nlarge, burgeoning Chinese-American community. One of my former \nemployees went from here to the district attorney's office and is now \nworking for a private individual and/or company, building a big hotel \nin what we call Las Vegas Chinatown.\n  I have been there. A lot of people there are not real good at \nspeaking English. We have to do everything we can, whether people speak \nChinese or whether they speak Spanish, to have them assimilated into \nour society. It is good for all of us. One of my concerns is that this \nwill turn us back in the wrong direction.\n  I have said before, my wife is Jewish. Her father was born in Russia. \nHe learned to speak English as a little boy. He spoke good English. His \nparents didn't. We know what happened in years past. I have heard \nSenator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, state on \nmany occasions that there were signs in his State of Vermont: No \nCatholics or Italians need apply for jobs. We know that applied to \npeople who emigrated from Germany.\n  I think this turns us in the wrong direction. I think we should make \nsure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to \nsomebody who can speak Spanish. I think what I did, to get a little \nextra money there for the metropolitan police department so we could \nhave people who were fluent\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nin Spanish, I think that is the right way to go. I am not too sure this \namendment wouldn't stop that, or certainly slow it down.\n  Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. We want people \nto integrate, to learn English, but they need tools to do this no \nmatter what their native language. This amendment takes some of those \ntools away, and we need all of those tools.\n  The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is \nEnglish as a second language. This will slow that down. This amendment \nimpacts English speakers, reporting of crimes, reporting of diseases, \ninvolvement in commerce. Next, is it going to impact upon the right to \nvote?\n  This amendment is divisive. We should be here to unify our country, \nnot divide it by ethnicity or language differences. I rise in strong \nopposition to this amendment. Everyone who speaks with an accent knows \nthat they need to learn English as fast as they can. Success in America \nmeans the ability to speak English. That is the way it is now. We don't \nneed this amendment. Speaking English is critical to the functioning of \nanyone in our country. It is the language of our Government, of our \nNation, and as I have indicated before, air traffic controllers and \ndiplomacy. This amendment, I believe, is unconstitutional. It raises \nserious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their \nrights.\n  This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of Federal \nlaw, I believe, that guarantee the right of non-English-speaking \nstudents to learn English in our public schools. Does this amendment \napply to a Presidential order, an Executive order? Does it apply to a \ncity ordinance? A county ordinance? A State statute? What does it apply \nto? Federal law.\n  This amendment conflicts with provisions of Federal law that require \nlanguage materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas \nof non-English languages, where there is evidence of educational \ndiscrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration \nturnout.\n  One of the problems we are having all over America is children \ndropping out of school. This amendment will not help that. Do we \nbenefit by children dropping out of school? Of course not. Don't we \nwant high voter turnout? Don't we want people to vote? This is going to \nslow that down, people asking to register to vote.\n  There has been substantial evidence of harassment, intimidation, even \nviolence against language minority voters. This provision makes a \nblatant violation of the 14th and 15th amendments and criminal \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act more likely to occur. Look at \nhistory. In Nevada, Chinese who came over to build the railroads, the \ntranscontinental railroad, were treated like animals. There were laws \npassed, State laws, county ordinances, local ordinances promulgated \nagainst the Chinese. Those laws which were discriminatory did not help \nour country. They hurt our country. This amendment is not going to help \nour country, it is going to hurt our country.\n  By the very terms of this amendment, persons accused of crimes would \nbe denied the ability, I believe, to receive information material in \ntheir native language to assist in their own defense. This clearly \nviolates the due process clause of the fifth amendment of our \nConstitution.\n  I have talked about public health. This amendment will stand in the \nway of efforts made to facilitate the transmission of vital information \nnecessary for the receipt of health care and public safety, including \ninformed consent by non-English-speaking patients.\n  Doctors need this. Health care workers need this. This undermines our \nNation's public health and safety.\n  The foregoing things I have talked about are not exclusive. There are \nmany more areas, public service and public safety, that will be \nnegatively impacted by this amendment, hurting all Americans in the \nprocess. I hope we all support civic integration, but this amendment is \nnot the way to do it.\n  Why don't we spend more money so we can educate more people who want \nto learn English? We are short of money. We have programs that are cut \nevery day. That is the way it is in Nevada and around the country. That \nis where we should be directing our efforts. That brings people \ntogether. That is good for all of us. This does not bring people \ntogether. It makes it far more likely that we will end up with civic \nexclusion, including the denial of rights they should have to millions \nof U.S. citizens.\n  I hope we reject this amendment. It is bad policy. It is un-American. \nIt turns back the clock on the substantial gains that language minority \ncitizens have made. I hope that there will be a resounding vote against \nthis.\n  I have no problem going home today and telling the people of the \nState of Nevada: English is the language of America. We are not going \nto change that with this amendment. This is divisive, it is mean \nspirited. I think it is the wrong way to go.\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my appreciation to the manager \nof the bill and Senator Inhofe for giving me extra time. We had not \nenough time over here, and it was gracious of him to allow us the extra \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President may I inquire as to how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 12 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. How much is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 8 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid and state his \neloquence today, in terms of pointing out issues and concerns with \nrespect to the Inhofe amendment, is very much appreciated.\n  I want to reiterate to my colleagues on the floor of the Senate today \nthat I am asking for your support for an amendment that will unify \nAmerica, that will say that English is in fact the language of the land \nand that we will work to make sure English is the common language of \nAmerica. I am also here to ask my colleagues to vote against the \namendment of Senator Inhofe because I am concerned about the unintended \nconsequences that will flow from the proposal which Senator Inhofe has \noffered.\n  Let me say there can be no doubt at all that English is, in fact, the \nunifying language of America. In my own State of Colorado, as I look at \nsome of the statistics on the number of people who are waiting in long \nlines to learn English, it is an incredibly long line. In the five-\ncounty Denver-Metro area, adult ESL programs working with the \nDepartment of Education have 5,000 people enrolled in those programs. \nThey have a waiting list that is up to 2 months, because there are so \nmany people in the Denver metropolitan area who want to learn English.\n  This debate is not about the endangerment of English in America \ntoday. People in America understand that we conduct our business in \nEnglish, that we are conducting our business in the Senate today in \nEnglish. The people of America understand that the keystone to \nopportunity is learning the English language, and you need not look any \nfurther than the number of people who are enrolled in educational \nclasses, trying to learn English to know they understand that very \nfact.\n  The concern with the amendment of Senator Inhofe is that you are \ngoing to have unintended consequences that will flow from the language \nof the amendment. Many of my colleagues have spoken about those \nunintended consequences. I want to focus on one particular aspect of \nthat which I find to be very un-American and that is the fact that when \nyou allow for discrimination to occur on the basis of national origin, \non the basis of race, on the basis of gender, on the basis of language, \nthat we are taking a step backward in the progress that America has \nmade. None of us wants to revisit what has happened in the history of \nAmerica as we have moved forward as a nation to become a much more \ninclusive nation and a nation that celebrates the diversity that makes \nus a strong nation. None of us wants to revisit the latter half of the \nlast century, when segregation was sanctioned under the law until 1954, \nand until the Civil Rights Act. None of us want to move back into those \ndark days of American history.\n  Yet the fact remains today we still have some of that discrimination \nthat exists in our society. We have example\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nafter example, personal examples we can cite about people who have been \nthe victims of language discrimination. When we elevate one language, \nin the manner that Senator Inhofe has attempted to do in his amendment, \nabove every other language, what will happen as an unintended \nconsequence of his amendment is that you will usher in, in my judgment, \na new era of language discrimination in America. I do not believe that \nushering in a new era of language discrimination in America is \nsomething that will be helpful to us as we struggle in this 21st \ncentury to make sure that we maintain the strongest America, the \nstrongest Nation possible in our world.\n  I ask people, those of you who are concerned about language \ndiscrimination in America, to vote against the amendment of Senator \nInhofe on that point.\n  Let me conclude by saying that the amendment we have proposed today \ntalks about the importance of English and the importance of unifying \nAmerica through the English language. I believe we can work together. I \nbelieve that will require the immigrants to whom we are trying to \naddress the immigration reform package to learn English. It is \nimportant that they learn English.\n  As I conclude my portion of this discussion, I think back to a mother \nand a father who in the 1940s were part of that greatest of generations \nfighting for the freedom of America--a father in World War II as a \nsoldier, and a mother at the age of 20 speaking Spanish but coming to \nWashington to work in the Pentagon. They were victims of language \ndiscrimination. That generation was a victim of language \ndiscrimination. They would have had maybe the same opportunities I have \nhad if they had been part of an America that fully understood they \nwould be treated the same as those who speak languages other than \nEnglish. But I do not want us to go back in the history of our country \nto a place where we are darkened again by that discrimination which \nexisted in the 1940s or the 1950s.\n  My fear is that the amendment that my good friend from Oklahoma is \noffering today will open the door once again to that history of \ndiscrimination, which I find very pernicious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening to the Democratic leader and \ncolleagues struggle to come up with some reason we shouldn't declare \nthat English is our national language. They are having a very difficult \ntime doing that. In fact, what they have been doing is arguing all \nsorts of unusual ways against an amendment that no one has proposed.\n  Let me say what Senator Inhofe's amendment does. It declares English \nas the national language of the United States. We are free to say \nwhatever we want, speak whatever we want, but it is our national \nlanguage. Specifically, the Inhofe amendment says it doesn't prevent \nthose receiving Government services in another language from doing so, \nwhether authorized by law or by Executive order or by regulation. That \nis No. 1. The Salazar amendment, in contrast, does not say English is \nour national language. That is the first point.\n  The second thing is the Inhofe amendment would say that those who are \nillegally here, who might become legal under this law and get on a path \nto citizenship, would have to actually learn English rather than just \nenroll in school. Anyone can sign up and not learn anything. Senator \nSalazar's amendment doesn't do that.\n  A third reason Senator Inhofe's amendment is better, in my opinion, \nis it has some excellent language that would improve the citizenship \ntest that new citizens take, including the key ideas, key documents, \nand key events of our history that we all agree on, and which we voted \nunanimously on a couple of years ago in another piece of legislation.\n  If you believe English is our national language and don't want to \ninterfere with any existing law or right, if you want new citizens who \nmight be illegally here today to learn English as a part of that path \nto citizenship, and if you want a better American history test for new \ncitizens, the Inhofe amendment is preferable.\n  I think a lot of this debate is about unity versus diversity. That is \nthe struggle. It is a real struggle in this country.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle said this is unimportant. It \nmight be to them, but it is not to me, nor is it to most Americans. I \nthink it is at the center of this whole discussion about what we are \ndoing with immigration. If the American people got any whiff that we \nthought having a national motto or a national anthem or a national \npledge of allegiance or a national language was unimportant to us, I \nthink they would throw us all out because most people know that our \ndiversity is a magnificent strength--we are a land of immigrants--but \nour greater strength is that we have turned that all into one country.\n  Iraq is diverse, and Bosnia is diverse. Are they better places for \nthat? They haven't been able to unite themselves into one country. How \ndid we do that? Partly because of these unifying principles which we \ndebate here with respect for one another, and through our national \nlanguage.\n  No matter what they say, the opponents of this amendment are \nreluctant to say that English is our national language. If they were \nnot, they would vote for the Inhofe amendment. First, it declares that \nif you have any rights now, you will still have them after the Inhofe \namendment passes. It requires those who are here illegally but want to \nbecome citizens to learn English rather than just enroll in school. And \nit beefs up the U.S. history requirement in a way the Senate has \npreviously approved.\n  The Democratic leader talked about how nice it would be for someone \nto call 9-1-1 and get a Spanish-speaking voice. It wouldn't have been \nso nice to the 200,000 new citizens from Asia who came in last year \nbecause they do not speak Spanish. That is why we have a common \nlanguage.\n  My goal is that every child in America be bilingual or even \nmultilingual. But one of those must be to learn English, and every \nchild should learn it as soon as possible. We have a common language \nbecause we are a land of immigrants. It is our national language.\n  A vote for the Inhofe amendment is a vote for our national language. \nIt is a vote to leave everyone's rights to receive services in other \nlanguages exactly where they are today. It is a vote to say that those \nwho might be here illegally today but who seek to become citizens must \nlearn English, and it is a vote to beef up our U.S. history tests which \nare required of those coming into this country and applying for \ncitizenship.\n  For generations, we have helped people in this country learn English. \nWe do so even further in the underlying bill with new $500 grants. It \nshould be a simple statement to say that English is our national \nlanguage, that we have a national motto, a national pledge, a national \noath.\n  Then why struggle to come up with reasons not to make English our \nnational language?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it is very obvious what is going \non here. It has been 23 years since we have had a chance to vote on it. \nIt probably will be the last time most Members--maybe all of the \nMembers in this Chamber--will have a chance to vote to make English the \nnational language.\n  Those who are offering this amendment today don't want English to be \nthe national language. They use the word ``common,'' the common \nlanguage.\n  Those opposing this amendment want an entitlement to have the Federal \nGovernment provide for language, services, and materials. They can do \nit now. If you pass this bill, they can still do it. It is just not \nmandatory. It is not something that can't be done; it doesn't have to \nbe done. They say that national origin equates to language. Their \nclaims are consistently refuted by the Federal Government, the most \nrecent one being in 2001, the Sandoval case.\n  The opponents of this don't want people learning English but instead \nbeing served in foreign languages.\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\n  I think it is interesting that the word ``racist'' was used. I just \nwish the people here knew what has happened in the past and what I have \nbeen involved in in my State of Oklahoma. This is not the time to \nrepeat what I said earlier. But the bottom line is I received the \nhighest award given by the Hispanic community in the city of Tulsa. I \nstarted the first Hispanic community commission, and it is now a model \nfor the Nation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \namendment. He is a Senator who continues to demonstrate his interest \nand ability in bringing us together rather than seeking to drive wedges \nbetween us. We can all agree that English should be the common language \nof the United States. His is a good suggestion for an alternative that \nI will support. In many local communities and States, it may well be \nuseful and helpful for the Government to reach out to language \nminorities. Greater participation and information are good things. We \nshould not be mandating artificial and shortsighted restrictions on \nState and local government.\n  I have spoken in the course of this debate about my belief that \nimmigrants should learn the English language. In my experience, most \nnew Americans want to learn our language and make efforts to do so as \nquickly as possible. The bill that we are debating calls for immigrants \nto learn English as one the several steps they must take before they \ncan earn citizenship.\n  I certainly understand why the Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, the Asian American Justice Center, the Lawyer's \nCommittee for Civil Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the \nNational Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials \nEducational Fund and others have been concerned about the Inhofe \namendment. I share their concerns. I strongly support the efforts of \nthe Senator from Colorado to find a common ground to unite us rather \nthan divide us and strongly support his alternative amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nSalazar's amendment. English is one of the common bonds that bring \nAmericans together. Just as a new immigrant must learn the monetary \ncurrency of a country, new immigrants must learn the social currency \nthe English language. Immigrants need to learn English so they can be \nsuccessful and contribute to their new country. That is why current law \nalready states that anyone becoming a U.S. citizen is required to learn \nEnglish.\n  Yet as immigrants are learning English, we need to be able to provide \nthem with critical information in a language they can understand. What \nif there was an avian flu outbreak? What if there was another terrorist \nattack? Or a hurricane? Our first priority is to make sure they are \nsafe in any language.\n  English can bring us together it shouldn't pull us apart. We must \nremember that our country was founded by immigrants from around the \nworld. Their contributions to this Nation have made it great. My own \ngreat-grandparents were immigrants from Poland. Their desire to seek a \nbetter life for them and their children is the part of the American \ndream.\n  It is ridiculous. I don't think people are going to buy into it.\n  I agree with my friend from Tennessee. If they are looking, searching \nfor things to object to, they are not going to find it in this bill.\n  The racist thing, it is interesting. If you will look at polling data \nin 2002, the Kaiser Family Foundation poll says 91 percent of foreign-\nborn Latino immigrants agree that learning English is essential to \nsucceed in the United States.\n  Just 2 months ago, the Zogby poll found that 84 percent of Americans, \nincluding--this is significant--77 percent of Hispanics, believe that \nEnglish should be the national language. That is only 2 months ago--77 \npercent of the Hispanics.\n  I think it is an insult to the Spanish to say we are not going to \nhave English as a national language because they are not capable of \noperating and succeeding in a country like this. They are dead wrong.\n  In terms of people criticizing us for wanting to make this the \nnational language, 51 countries have done it. Isn't that interesting? \nFifty-one countries have made English their national language, except \nfor us. Twenty-seven States out of fifty States already have it on a \nState basis.\n  When you go to your townhall meetings, it is not even a close call. \nThis comes up every time I go to a townhall meeting in Oklahoma: Why \ndon't we have English as a national language? Now I hope they \nunderstand why, if they have seen this debate today, and the dialogue \nthat is going on, pulling out of the air very eloquent statements that \nmight be referring to some bill someone may want to introduce someday, \nor some amendment. It is certainly not this amendment.\n  I look at this and wonder, and I shake my head. What have you been \nreading? It has nothing to do with this. Our amendment does not \nprohibit using language other than services, or any other Government \nservices in languages other than English. It doesn't prohibit it at \nall; it allows it. It doesn't prescribe and say you have to do it. \nThere is no prohibition of giving Medicare services or any other \nGovernment services in a language other than English. This amendment \nsimply says there is no right unless Congress has explicitly provided \nthat right.\n  If you read page 2 of the bill, it very specifically says ``unless \notherwise authorized or provided by law.'' That is the exception. In \nevery one of these examples that have come up--from the Senator from \nCalifornia, the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Illinois, \nthey fall into that category.\n  This is going to answer the question for a lot of people out there \nsaying: Why can't we have this as our national language?\n  It has been 23 years since we had our last vote. You can't have it \nboth ways. I wouldn't want anyone here to be under the misconception \nthat they could vote for my amendment and then turn around and vote for \nthe Salazar amendment because that would completely negate our \namendment.\n  This is your last chance to vote to make English the national \nlanguage. When we listen to the National Anthem: O, say can you see, by \nthe dawn's early light . . . bombs bursting in air . . . gave proof \nthrough the night that the flag was still there . . . the land of the \nfree, and the home of the brave--that is not an official anthem, that \nis not a common anthem, that is the national anthem.\n  This is our last chance to have English as the national language for \nAmerica.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute.\n  Patriotism doesn't belong to a political party or any individual. The \nSalazar language is very clear. English is the common unifying language \nof the United States. It helps provide unity for the American people, \npreserving and enhancing the role of the English language. It couldn't \nbe clearer.\n  Let us not distort and misrepresent the amendment that is before us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and \nnays on the Salazar amendment and the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSalazar and Schumer be added, along with Senators Obama and Boxer, as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as has become abundantly clear from the \ndebate on the floor, immigration is a Federal responsibility. As this \ndebate has shown, for too long the Federal Government has neglected its \nduty.\n  My amendment addresses one of the clearest examples of this neglect \nbecause our failed national immigration policy has left our State and \nlocal governments to bear the brunt of the cost of immigration. Our \nschools, our hospitals, our other State and local services are being \nstrained.\n  Obviously, this is a problem in many communities and not just in \nborder communities. Throughout our country and in my State, there are \ncounties and municipalities that are covering the costs of dealing with \neducation, health care, and law enforcement without adequate or any \nFederal reimbursement. So we have left our local and State governments \nto fend for themselves. They should not be left to bear these costs \nalone because it is not they who are making Federal immigration policy.\n  This amendment does several things. It helps finally provide adequate \nsupport for State and local governments. How? Well, it not only \nappropriates the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program funding to our \nStates, but it establishes a program that provides financial assistance \nto State and local governments for the cost of health and educational \nservices related to immigration.\n  Money is allocated to our States in accordance with a funding formula \nbased on the size and recent growth of the State's noncitizen \npopulation. The State must then pass the funds on to local governments \nand other entities that need the money for reimbursement. Here is how \nthis program would be funded, because the amendment does not \nappropriate any new funds or impose any new fees on immigrants. Funding \nis drawn solely from existing fees already in the underlying bill.\n  The underlying bill creates a State impact assistance account at the \nTreasury, but it does not direct any money into that account. It is an \nempty account with no State purpose. My amendment would direct certain \nfees that already exist in the underlying bill into the account and \nthen provide for the disbursement of the collected funds to State and \nlocal government.\n  To which fees are we referring? Well, there is a $500 fee for \nimmigrants who participate in the guest worker program. Right now, that \nfee is not marked for any purpose, and the funds simply go to the \nTreasury. My amendment directs this $500 fee into the State impact \nassistance account. Additionally, the underlying bill imposes a $2,000 \nfee for the undocumented immigrants to participate in the path to \nlegalization program spelled out in title VI of the bill, plus imposes \nan additional fine that is left to the Department of Homeland Security \nto determine later. Eighty percent of these funds go to border \nsecurity; 20 percent go to processing and administrative costs related \nto the undocumented.\n  My amendment does not touch the 80 percent going to border security. \nInstead, it takes half of the processing fees--in other words, 10 \npercent of the $2,000 fee and the yet-to-be, unspecified fine by DHS--\nand redirects that money away from Federal Government administration to \nthis fund which will help State and local governments get reimbursed.\n  This still leaves about $1 billion for processing and administrative \ncosts at the Federal level. What happens with this money? Pursuant to \nmy amendment, 25 percent goes to the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, known as SCAAP, to pay for the cost of detention which our \nState and local governments incur.\n  Each year, the SCAAP program is underfunded. A 2005 GAO study \ndocuments that State and local governments get only 25 percent of their \ncosts reimbursed through this program. A report indicates that my State \nof New York received even less--21 percent of their costs were \ncompensated in 2002 and 24 percent in 2003. The remaining 75 percent of \nthe money collected from the fees deposited in the State Impact \nAssistance Account would go to States and localities to pay for the \ncost of providing health and education services to noncitizens. This \nmoney is allocated among the States in accordance with a funding \nformula based on the size and recent growth of the States' noncitizen \npopulation.\n\n  Now, to ensure that the funds actually get to the counties and cities \nand don't sit in State governments, my amendment also requires that at \nleast 70 percent of those funds be passed on to localities within 180 \ndays of the States receiving the money. States can retain the remaining \n30 percent to help offset their own costs related to immigration.\n  I think this amendment helps us fix a problem I care a lot about as I \ntravel around my State. Our local communities have a tradition in New \nYork of being very welcoming. We are a State that is not only built on \nimmigrants but very proud of that, as the Statue of Liberty in New York \nHarbor so eloquently says. But the costs of immigration have steadily \nincreased, and the Federal Government's neglect has\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\nstrained local and State government budgets. I think if we pass any \nkind of immigration reform and we don't take into account the strains \non the budget on State and local governments, we will not have done our \njob.\n  This amendment also helps State and local governments not only recoup \nsome of their expenditures, but it underlines a message to communities \nthat they are working together, they welcome people who work hard and \nwho make a contribution and will be on the path to earned legalization.\n  So I hope this amendment will be supported. It has support from the \nNational Immigration Law Center, the National League of Cities, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures.\n  I think our laws can be both fair and strict. I think we can have \nlaws which don't shut the doors of America to people who want to make a \ncontribution and at the same time don't really provide disincentives to \ncommunities to be part of that welcoming tradition. Balancing all of \nthe interests in this debate is not easy, but I appreciate the efforts \nthat are being made on this floor to wrestle with this difficult \nproblem. I hope we will also send a message to local communities that \nwe are here to help them because they don't set immigration policy, \nthey don't enforce immigration laws, but they are often left holding \nthe bag for the costs that flow because we haven't done our job.\n  So I hope that this amendment finds favor in this body and we send a \nmessage to our local executives and legislatures around our country \nthat we are going to send them some help to be part of a comprehensive \nimmigration solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New York \non her amendment. One of the greatest scams the Federal Government has \never imposed upon taxpayers across the country is unfunded Federal \nmandates, and education costs and health care costs imposed by the \nFederal Government on local taxpayers without reimbursement is not only \nunfair, it is a scandal.\n  The estimated annual costs to hospitals and other emergency providers \nof health care nationwide for undocumented immigrants or illegal \naliens, which is mandated but not reimbursed by the Federal Emergency \nMedical Treatment and Labor Act, is $1.45 billion a year. According to \ncongressionally commissioned research, the annual cost to just 24 \nborder counties in my State and in New Mexico and California exceeds \n$200 million a year. Texans spend more than $4 billion annually on \neducation for the children of illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born \nsiblings. About 12 percent of Texas schoolchildren in K through 12 are \nchildren of undocumented immigrants. Texas health care expenditures for \nillegal aliens are more than $520 million a year.\n  All States--New York, Texas, and all 48 other States--bear the burden \nof unfunded mandates providing for the health and education of \nundocumented aliens because we have failed to enforce our immigration \nlaws. Again, the Federal Government is twice culpable. No. 1, it \nimposes these costs on local taxpayers and local government; and No. 2, \nthe very reason why they are incurred is because of the Federal \nGovernment's failure to secure our borders and enforce our immigration \nlaws.\n  The Federal Government requires, under the IMTALA act, that hospitals \ntreat every person, irrespective of their immigration status. But then \nCongress fails to secure the border and our local hospitals have become \noverrun. So while the Government requires hospitals to treat everyone, \nthe Government then fails in its own responsibility to secure the \nborders or reimburse those health care providers for carrying out their \nfederally mandated obligations.\n  The bill before the Senate fails to reimburse States for the costly \nburden placed upon their health care system and education system by \nundocumented immigrants. For example, recent reports are that 70 \npercent of the children born at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, TX, are \nborn to undocumented immigrants.\n  What will my amendment do? The current Senate bill does not reimburse \nState and local governments for health care and education costs related \nto the millions of undocumented immigrants. While the underlying bill \ncreates a State impact assistance account for future temporary workers, \nit is an unfunded account. The Cornyn amendment would impose a \nsurcharge on any illegal alien who applies for legal status under this \nbill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4038\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \ncurrent amendment and to call up amendment No. 4038 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4038.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The problem is this, Mr. President: Under the current \nbill, about 80 percent of the $2,000 paid by undocumented immigrants at \nthe time they apply for a green card or legal permanent residency, 80 \npercent of that $2,000 fee goes for border security. Ten percent of it \ngoes to administering the process provided for under the underlying \nbill and another 10 percent for other uncovered administrative costs. \nIn other words, there is an 80-20 split of the $2,000 that are paid by \nundocumented immigrants at the time they regularize their status, in \ncontrast with the Clinton amendment--the Senator from New York provides \nessentially an 80, 10, and 10 split, with 80 percent of the money going \nfor border security, 10 percent going to a State impact fund, and 5 \npercent each for the administrative costs. In other words, rather than \nan 80-20 distribution, the Senator from New York sets aside 10 percent \nfor the State impact fund, and then retains an additional 10 percent to \npay for the administrative costs.\n  The difference between the Cornyn amendment and the Clinton amendment \nis this: The Clinton amendment takes money away from the program that \nadministers this immigration reform bill in order to pay the State and \nlocal taxpayers under the impact fund.\n  I don't think most of our colleagues are familiar with this, but \nactually the $2,000 that is required to be paid under this bill is not \npaid at the time that illegal aliens get a H-2C card and remain in the \ncountry for approximately 6 years, pending their application for a \ngreen card or legal permanent residency. It is only at the time they \napply for their green card or legal permanent residency that money is \ndue. So for 6 years, they are able to stay in the country with an H-2C \ncard without paying a penny, while continuing to impose financial \nburdens on local taxpayers for health and educational costs that are \nunreimbursed. Under my proposal, they will get money right away as the \nmoney and costs are being incurred and not some 6 to 8 years later.\n  Finally, under my proposed fee, which is a surcharge paid, $750, at \nthe very time that a person enters in the system, not waiting 6 years \nwhen they apply for their green card. By paying $750 a person and an \nadditional $100 for each family member, this will generate about $7.5 \nbillion in money for this State Impact Fund as opposed to approximately \n$1.3 to $1.5 billion under the Clinton amendment.\n  Just by way of comparison, in 1986 when the U.S. Congress granted \namnesty to 3 million undocumented immigrants, it set aside $4 billion \nin taxpayer money to help reimburse the States for these uncompensated \ncosts. In other words, $4 billion for 3 million undocumented immigrants \nto regularize their status. Yet under this bill, if passed, the bill \nwould regularize four times the number of people. Yet under the Clinton \namendment it would only provide $1.3 to $1.5 billion for State impact \nfunds. Under my proposal, which would impose a $750 surcharge at the \nvery time an individual registers for the H2-C program, it would \ngenerate $7.5 billion, obviously necessary to pay for the unfunded \nmandates I mentioned a moment ago.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto rollcall votes on the Clinton amendment at 6:20, to be followed by a \nrollcall vote on the Cornyn amendment, with the Cornyn amendment being \na 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was just going to speak for 5 minutes on the amendment \nthat Senator Clinton and I and others have introduced.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I get 30 seconds at the very end?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would ask for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent I \nspeak for 5 minutes, and Senator Kennedy proceed for 1 minute \nimmediately thereafter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, how much time does \nSenator Cornyn have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no division of time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will take 3\\1/2\\ minutes. I don't mind.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I was under the impression there was 15 minutes allotted \nto Senator Clinton and 15 minutes to me, a total of 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That agreement was not entered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are talking about how much Senator Cornyn needs and \nhow much Senator Schumer needs. We could delay the votes a bit. How \nmuch time does Senator Cornyn need?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be happy with 5 more minutes total.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I amend the unanimous consent request to give 5 more \nminutes to Senator Cornyn, 5 minutes to Senator Schumer, and that would \nbring us to 6:25, at which point I ask unanimous consent that we have \nrollcall votes on Senator Clinton, then a rollcall vote on Senator \nCornyn, with the second vote to be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nsponsored by my colleague, Senator Clinton, cosponsored by a number of \nus on this side. I commend her efforts to address a very important \ncomponent of the immigration debate.\n  This amendment is going to provide some much needed and overdue \nrelief to States and localities that have had to bear a \ndisproportionate share of the burden when they have been host to a \nlarge number of undocumented immigrants. Too many of our State and \nlocal governments are overwhelmed and underfinanced. As the number of \nundocumented immigrants goes up in a community, so do the costs of \nservices that the local governments provide to them--including \nincreased costs for law enforcement, health care, and education.\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\n  These localities are not to blame for the Federal Government's \nfailure to adequately secure our borders or to enforce the immigration \nlaws against employers who do not play by the rules. But more and more, \nthey had to devote already scarce resources to deal with the rising \nnumbers of undocumented immigrants.\n  They have done the right thing. They have provided medical care, \neducation, other public services. But it has all come at the expense of \nlocal taxpayers who are already stretched too thin, and that is not \nfair.\n  As we work toward comprehensive reform, we in the Federal Government \nowe them our help. We need to make sure the flood of new immigrants \ndoes not drown out our local governments. We need to make sure that \nwhile we embrace our new immigrants we don't give the local communities \nthe cold shoulder.\n  This is not just a problem on the southern border. In Suffolk County \non Long Island there are about 40,000 undocumented immigrants. Total \nestimates for all of Long Island are about 100,000. In Suffolk, the \nannual cost of meeting the needs of undocumented immigrants is \nestimated to be $24 million. Of course, property taxes are too high. \nThe counties are strapped for cash. This amendment will offer some much \nneeded relief to localities such as Suffolk County that have had to go \nit alone for too long. And it will not require finding new sources of \nrevenue. It will take some of the fees already in the bill and give the \nbulk of that money for reimbursement of health care and educational \ncosts paid out by the States and localities, and the rest goes to \nSCAAP, to pay for the costs of detaining noncitizens, a program I have \nbeen much involved with in the past.\n  These funds will be targeted toward States that have seen the \nsharpest rise in their noncitizen populations, and we are going to get \nthe money from the States to their localities fast because they are \nfeeling the strain now. States will have to get most of the money to \nthe localities within 180 days once the money is allocated.\n  Taxpayers in our country are already being pushed to the limit. They \ndidn't cause the problems, but they far too often have to bear the \nfinancial consequences, and they should not be left holding the bag.\n  This financial assistance will not solve every problem associated \nwith undocumented immigration, but it will go a long way toward lifting \nthe financial strain in our States and localities all over the country.\n  I yield. If my colleague from Massachusetts wants, I yield my \nremaining time to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Clinton has a very sensible and \nresponsible amendment. The way the funds are allocated, there will be \napproximately more than $1 billion that would be available under her \namendment that will be allocated to these needs which she has outlined. \nIt seems to me that is the way to go.\n  On the other side, Senator Cornyn is going to raise, for these \nworkers, immigrant workers who are working hard, playing by the rules--\nhe is just going to jack up the amounts they are going to have to pay \nby another $750.\n  The sky is the limit. Why not $2,000, $3,000, $4,000? I mean, the \nfact is, they are already going to be paying the $2,000. This is going \nto add at least $750; $100 per child additional. So you are giving \nadditional kinds of burdens on the worker, those who are in line to \nbecome citizens. I think the Clinton proposal is far superior and more \nfair.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I fail to understand why it poses an \nunreasonable burden upon the 10 million or 11 million or 12 million \nundocumented immigrants who currently live in the United States in \nviolation of our immigration laws to pay a modest fee as part of the \nquid pro quo for their regularization when, in fact, they have been \nimposing unfunded burdens on local taxpayers and local hospital \ndistricts and counties and cities for the entire time they have been \npresent in the United States. No one is talking about being punitive or \nbeing unnecessarily harsh. But fair is fair. To suggest that it is not \nfair for them to pay a fee really stands in stark contrast to the fact \nthat these same individuals, when they apply for legal permanent \nresidency or a green card, will be required to pay $2,000.\n  The truth is, most individuals who come across at least the southern \nborder in violation of our immigration laws, turn their lives over to \nhuman smugglers and pay on average about $1,500 each for each trip they \nmake into the United States. Certainly, these individuals, in return, \nfor the benefits that are conferred upon them under this bill, should \nbe expected, and I think they would expect, to pay some modest cost to \nhelp defray the expenses to local and State taxpayers. In fact, these \nindividuals are being given an opportunity for a second chance, and I \nbelieve there should be some cost associated with that. In fact, we \nhave been told during the course of this debate that this underlying \nbill creates a situation where people earn their right to legal status.\n  As we found out, during the first 6 years of their presence in the \nUnited States, after this bill passes, if it passes in its current \nstatus, they will be able to live and work and travel and have all the \nbenefits of living in this country and have paid nothing--zero, zip, \nnada. Only after about 6 years, when they apply for a green card or \nlegal permanent residency, will they then be required to pay the \n$2,000.\n  I think it is only just that these individuals be required to pay a \nsurcharge of $750, a reasonable amount for reimbursement to State and \nlocal governments and taxpayers for the costs of health care and \neducation that have been imposed by their very presence on local \ntaxpayers. Again, this is not punishing anybody. This is not about \nmaking it unusually difficult for them to comply. This is a matter of \nsimple justice.\n  Indeed, if the only source of that money is the funds that are paid \nsome 6 years after they began to transition into legal permanent \nresidency, under the Clinton amendment--and I applaud the goals of the \nSenator, to pay some money into a State impact fund, but it will amount \nto about $1.3 billion as opposed to $7.5 billion under my amendment. We \nwill not see any of that money for at least 6 years and, in fact, it is \ntaking money away from the program necessary to administer this \nunderlying legislation which is necessary to make it a success.\n  Certainly, we are not going to build failure into this model by \nunderfunding the very administrative process by which it is supposed to \nwork.\n  I suggest it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step up. \nThis is not taking any tax dollars in order to fund this unfunded \nmandate. This is coming from the beneficiaries of the program that is \nsupposed to be enacted by this underlying legislation. If, in fact, it \nmade sense to appropriate from tax dollars $4 billion for the 3 million \nindividuals who were given amnesty in 1986, it makes sense to me, \ntoday, that it is going to cost quite a bit more than the $1.3 billion \nunder the amendment of Senator Clinton. But it also makes sense that \nburden should not be borne again by the taxpayers of the United States \nbut, rather, should be borne by the individuals who are going to \nreceive a benefit under this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it only makes \nsense, it is only fair and just to the local taxpayers around this \ncountry, and it is a matter of funding what is currently an unfunded \nFederal mandate on those tax credits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the Clinton amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare now trying to work through another amendment following the votes, \nthe Chambliss amendment. We are checking to see how much time would be \nneeded. But it appears that we have a good likelihood of proceeding \nwith that amendment and a later vote tonight, after enough time for \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are not prepared. We thought we were moving ahead \nwith the Kyl amendment. Now we are on the Chambliss amendment. It \ninvolves a number of individuals here\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nwho feel very strongly. We are just trying to find out the amount of \ntime they would need. Hopefully, we are going to be having two votes \nnow, and by the end of those votes we will have more information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Clinton \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are now prepared to take the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, and have a brief debate, 10 \nminutes. It will be accepted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania outline what the \nrest of the evening is going to be?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is what I am in the process of doing. I commented \nabout the Ensign amendment. I was about to say we are going to have the \namendment of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, which I anticipate \nwill be accepted as well. Then we are going to take the Kyl amendment \nunder an arrangement where there will be a tabling motion. And it is \nnow anticipated that we will have an hour-and-a-half time limit there. \nI would like to do it in an hour time limit, if that would be \nacceptable to that side. Senator Kyl is prepared to take a half an \nhour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine, an hour evenly divided.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. We just received a call from one of our Senators who \nobjects to the Ensign amendment. So let's do the hour and a half on \nKyl, and maybe we can work that out while we are doing that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, through the Chair, I ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania if it would be possible at least to make my statement, lay \ndown the amendment, and then we can consider it at the appropriate time \nbased on the two managers of the bill.\n  Mr. REID. That certainly is appropriate. Mr. President, as you know, \nwe don't run this place. I don't know why we need to wait an hour and \n45 minutes to vote. We are going to have votes in the morning anyway. I \ntalked to Senator Kennedy. It is all right to go ahead for 90 minutes \nprior to a motion to table tonight on Kyl; we have no objection. \nFollowing that, we can decide what we will do for tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that we have a time agreement of \nan hour and a half. We have just been informed that Senator Kyl wants \nan hour. I hope we can get some of that yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. We will take 30 minutes prior to a motion to table.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And a motion to table with no second-degree amendments \nbeing in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, did I understand that prior to the debate, \nI would have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was about to come to that. Let me include in the \nunanimous consent request that we lay down the Ensign amendment and \ngive him 10 minutes, and then we will move to the Nelson amendment. \nThere would be 5 minutes for Senator Nelson. I anticipate it will be \naccepted.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is not fair to our folks over here. If \nwe are going to have a vote tonight, let's vote and let people go home. \nThose people\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nwho want to still stand around and talk--that is Nelson and Ensign and \nLandrieu or anybody else--let them do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, may I just ask that at \nany time tonight or any time in the morning, I be allowed to offer the \ntwo amendments that have been pending all week. We can vote whenever \nthe leadership would like, in the morning or later tonight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will take a look at the amendments. I \nwill give the Senator from Louisiana an answer as soon as we can take a \nlook at the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest we modify the unanimous consent \nto accommodate the minority and those who want to vote. I would be \nfirst recognized for 10 minutes right after the vote on Kyl to lay down \nmy amendment, debate for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Nelson, \nfollowed by Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to modify the unanimous consent request that \nafter Senator Nelson from Florida, Senator Landrieu would then be \nallowed to offer two amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that we have not seen the \namendments of the Senator from Louisiana. I repeat, we are going to be \nin here next week. We will take a look at them. We will accommodate her \ntomorrow, if we can, but we have to see the amendments before we can \nsay anything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding we are going to have 90 minutes of \ndebate on Kyl--60 for the majority, 30 for the minority--prior to a \nmotion to table the Kyl amendment, no second-degree amendments would be \nin order, and following that there would be 10 minutes for Senator \nEnsign and then Senator Bill Nelson 10 minutes after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to \nrestate or state the request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Reid has accurately stated the unanimous consent \nrequest. I adopt his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, another aspect of our evening business \nis, at the conclusion of the sequencing stated in the unanimous consent \nagreement, to then lay down the Chambliss amendment. I am advised there \nare quite a number of Senators who want to speak on that. They can \nspeak as long as they like. A vote will occur tomorrow on a tabling \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I most certainly don't \nmind showing the amendments. They have been on file for a week. But I \nwould like it to be in order this week for 10 minutes, either tonight \nor tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we would be glad to respond after we see \nthe amendments. We may need more time. We haven't seen the amendments. \nThat has been a problem continuously, not having seen the amendments. I \nrepeat to the Senator from Louisiana, if we can see the amendments, we \ncan answer the question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate that. I cannot agree to any unanimous \nconsent until we get this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would say to the Senator from \nLouisiana, there is no request pending. The unanimous consent request \nwas agreed to without objection previously. The Senator from \nPennsylvania has subsequently spoken about the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Chambliss. There is no request pending.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Then I will wait to object to that next request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may we start on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3969\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself, I \ncall up amendment 3969.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for Mr. Kyl, for \n     himself and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 3969.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit H-2C nonimmigrants from adjusting to lawful \n                       permanent resident status)\n\n       Beginning on page 295, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through page 297, line 2, and insert the following:\n       ``(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an \n     alien having nonimmigrant status described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(c) is ineligible for and may not apply for \n     adjustment of status under this section on the basis of such \n     status.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the bill that is on the floor purports to \ncreate two different paths to American citizenship for those, first of \nall, who are in the country living outside of the law in an \nundocumented status, and secondly, for those who are not yet present in \nthe country but who want to come here at some future date to work. We \nhave given the somewhat misleading name of ``guest worker'' to the so-\ncalled future flow, the people who are not yet here.\n  As I pointed out earlier, a guest is not ordinarily defined as \nsomeone who moves in with you and never leaves. Rather, a guest is \nsomeone who comes into your home or wherever it may be temporarily and \nthen leaves. The title ``guest worker'' to describe the future flow of \npeople coming into the country to work is simply inaccurate. It does \nnot describe what this bill does.\n  First let me talk about the future flow. Under the Bingaman \namendment, the Government would authorize the entry of 200,000 people a \nyear who would qualify for an H-2C visa. These so-called guest workers \ncould work here up to 6 years, live, travel, enjoy the benefits of this \ncountry short of citizenship, after which they then apply for a green \ncard, whereby they become a legal permanent resident. They then get on \nthe path to American citizenship 5 years later. Rather than a temporary \nworker, these are individuals who, under this bill, will become first \nlegal permanent residents and then American citizens. Because of that, \nthe title of ``guest worker'' is a misnomer. It is a \nmischaracterization of what this bill does. I submit it is simply \nmisleading.\n  It is important for us to debate this issue honestly. This is a \ncomplicated bill, over 600 pages long. Obviously, the Congress has not \ndebated the issue of comprehensive immigration reform for the past 20 \nyears, since the last time Congress dealt with this in a comprehensive \nfashion. But at the very least, we ought to require of each of \nourselves that we have an honest debate, that we call things what they \nare and we don't call things what they are not.\n  The Kyl amendment, one I am proud to cosponsor, simply makes the \npoint that a guest worker ought to be temporary. It doesn't sound like \na profound amendment but, in fact, it will change the fundamental \nstructure of this underlying bill to make the representation that \neveryone, from the President of the United States on down to those of \nus here, believes that a guest worker program is part of a \ncomprehensive solution to the crisis that now confronts our country \nwith our broken immigration system, that, in fact, we are talking about \na temporary worker program.\n  That is important for many reasons. Let me mention two beyond the \ninitial reason that we ought to be honest and accurate and clear about \nwhat it is we are doing.\n  First, in terms of the future flow of individuals who come into the \ncountry to work, it is important that we have a temporary worker \nprogram in order to protect American workers. In fact, if we have an \ninflux of 200,000, or whatever the number is, permanent residents and \nthen new citizens in this country, without regard to the fact that our \neconomy is in a boom time when we need those workers or in a bust when \nwe find that those new workers will end up competing with Americans and \npotentially displacing them from their jobs, it is important that we \nkeep faith with the American\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\npeople and we protect American workers by being able to dial up or dial \ndown the provisions of this guest worker program in order to meet the \ndemands of our economy.\n  Secondly, Mexico, as an example, which has a 1,600 mile common border \nwith my State of Texas, has seen the mass exodus of some of its best \nand brightest and hardest working people permanently out of their \ncountry to live forever, the rest of their natural lives, in the United \nStates.\n  Now, I believe we ought to have a legal system of immigration and \nthat ought to serve our national interests. But the reason why there is \nso much pressure put on our borders and on illegal immigration is \nbecause when a country's young workers leave permanently and never \nreturn, how in the world can that country, whatever the country is--\nMexico, United States, Guatemala, Honduras, or Brazil--how can any \ncountry ever hope to create economic opportunity and jobs within that \ncountry if its young, hard-working workers leave permanently and never \ncome back?\n  Well, a temporary worker program would allow people to come to the \nUnited States and work for a while and then return to their country of \norigin with the savings and skills they have acquired working in the \nUnited States. That would benefit not only the employers who need the \nworkforce--a legal workforce that cannot be satisfied with sufficient \nnumbers of Americans--but it would also satisfy the demands and the \nneeds of their country of origin by providing circular migration--in \nother words, people coming for a while to work and then going home with \nthe savings and skills they have acquired in the United States. What \nare they going to do with the money they have earned? Some may decide \nto buy a home or start a small business in their country of origin.\n  I think that has at least the promise of developing economic \nopportunity and jobs in those countries that are now a net exporter of \npeople to the United States. It would give them a realistic opportunity \nof creating jobs for those who, in fact, would prefer not to sever \ntheir ties with their home and their family and their culture. It would \nreinstate this circular migration that would benefit both the United \nStates and their country of origin.\n  I remember some time ago--maybe 2 years ago--I was visiting Guatemala \nand had lunch with our American Ambassador to Guatemala at his \nresidence. We were talking about American trade policy, and \nspecifically the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which had not \nyet come to Congress for a ratification vote. What a gentleman from \nGuatemala told me at that time very concisely--I will never forget--was \nthat they want to export goods and services, not people. I think he \nsaid it perfectly. We ought to provide countries such as Guatemala, \nMexico, and others an opportunity to do business with the United States \nin a way that will help them develop their economy, so their people can \nstay home and enjoy their culture and their country and their family \nand not feel compelled to leave permanently to come to the United \nStates and never return home.\n  Some have said that, well, what attracts countries such as Mexico to \nmassive illegal immigration of its own citizens is the fact that this \nlast year they received $20 billion in remittances; that is, savings \nthat workers from Mexico earned in the United States while working in \nthe shadows, in the cash economy, in the black market, so to speak. \nThey sent that money home to their family to help support them. \nRecently, though, a high official in the Mexican Government pointed out \nto me that it is not a benefit to countries such as Mexico to see their \npeople leave just to send maybe 10 percent or 15 percent of their money \nor savings back home because if you look at the economic activity that \noccurs in the United States, they would much rather have that economic \nactivity occur in their country of origin.\n  Let's say, for example, that $20 billion represents a 10-percent \nsavings rate. That means that for the $20 billion that is sent from \nMexican workers back to Mexico, there is $180 billion in economic \nactivity occurring in the United States that could occur in Mexico if \nthey had opportunities and jobs there. Obviously, that kind of economic \nactivity feeds on itself and provides greater opportunity for those \npeople and benefits to those people living at home. It takes a lot of \npressure of illegal immigration off our borders.\n  Ultimately, I believe in comprehensive immigration reform because I \nbelieve that whatever we do has to be built upon a foundation of \nsecurity. In 2006, national security is about border security. In a \npost-9/11 world, we simply must know who is coming into our country and \nthe reasons they are coming here. We cannot assume that people are \ncoming here only for benign reasons. We all understand that when people \nhave no hope and no opportunity where they live, they are going to do \nwhatever it takes. Any one of us, assuming we had the courage, would \ntake whatever risk was necessary, including a risk to life itself, to \nprovide for our loved ones. So at a very human level, we understand why \npeople want to come to the United States.\n  But we also know, in a post-9/11 world, that the same porous borders \nthat allow people to come across our borders to work are also available \nto be exploited by violent gangs such as MS-13, by drug traffickers, by \nall sorts of people that we don't want in the United States because we \nhave a duty to protect the American people and their security.\n  We also know that in a post-9/11 world, international terrorists can \nuse these same avenues of entry into the United States and potentially \ncreate another 9/11, or some similarly catastrophic incident. So we \nhave to have that border security. We also have to have interior \nenforcement working with local and State law enforcement officials. We \nalso have to have worksite verification, along with secure \nidentification cards that can be swiped through a reader to confirm \nthat the person presenting themselves for work is, in fact, legally \nauthorized to work in the United States.\n  Indeed, the one thing that people point to, when they point to the \nmistakes of the 1986 amnesty that was granted, is the failure to create \na reliable means of verifying eligibility to work in the United States, \nand along with that sanctions for employers who cheat. It is absolutely \ncritical that we secure our borders, that we work with our local and \nState law enforcement officials to enforce the law beyond the borders \nand the interior, and that we provide security at the worksite by \nproviding secure documents and ways for employers to confirm legal \nauthority to work in the United States; then we punish those employers \nwho cheat. If we do that, I believe we can get this problem under \ncontrol. If we fail to do any part of that, I worry that we will have \nbeen engaged in a futile act, and we will have been laboring and \ndebating in vain on this bill.\n  Finally, I believe there are sectors of our economy that create jobs \nthat are not being satisfied adequately by Americans and by legal \ncitizens, legal immigrants in the United States. So I believe that to \nsupply a legal workforce for those sectors that cannot find an adequate \nworkforce among native-born and legal immigrants, we ought to create a \ntemporary worker program, as I have described it a moment ago. This \nwould also have the additional benefit of allowing law enforcement to \ndirect their attention at the real problems and to eliminate from their \nconcerns those who simply want to come here and work in a temporary \nworker program.\n\n  Mr. President, I also say that the other part of this amendment deals \nwith those who are already here and who, under the underlying bill, \nwould be able to stay in place and then participate in the H-2C program \nor those who would have to go to a port of entry and then who could \ncome back in, participate, and get on a path to legal permanent \nresidency and citizenship. This would say that ``notwithstanding any \nother provision of this act, an alien having non-immigrant status is \nineligible for and may not apply for adjustment of status under this \nsection on the basis of such status.'' In other words, temporary means \ntemporary, and that a guest is welcome, assuming they qualify, to come \nfor a time and participate in the benefits of this program but not \nnecessarily be put on a path to a green card or legal permanent \nresidency and citizenship.\n  Now, there are those who say that this kind of plan will not work and\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nthat we have no option but to legalize those who are here in place and \nthose who want to come in the future. There are those who say there is \nno such thing as a temporary worker because America has not shown \nitself capable of enforcing its own immigration laws and making sure \nthat people whose visas expire, in fact, leave the country at the \nexpiration of their legal authorization.\n  I believe that we can, assuming we have the political will, enforce \nour laws. We can create humane and realistic laws that provide for our \nNation's needs and that serve our Nation's interests and which, \nincidentally, serve the interests of countries who have young workers \nwho want to come for a while and then return to their country of \norigin.\n  I don't believe that we are incapable of enforcing our laws. I don't \nbelieve we have to throw our hands up and say the only way we can deal \nwith this is to create an opportunity for people to basically stay in \nplace and become legal permanent residents and citizens. It is not that \nI think that we should not provide that opportunity. In fact, I believe \nwe should do it for those who meet our Nation's capacity to deal with \nthis and who create a realistic cap based on our ability to assimilate \nthose people and for them to become Americans.\n  So I think we can create a category of temporary workers, people who \nhave no desire to stay, and then those who do want to come to our \ncountry, assuming that we can establish realistic caps and can then \nassimilate that population and they could become American citizens, and \nthat we ought to create a reasonable opportunity to do that.\n  But our interests ought to be, first and foremost, what is in \nAmerica's best interest? What is in America's best interest?\n  I guess I wish that America could open its arms and accept the flood \nof humanity that might want to come from the four corners of the world, \nfrom every oppressed and downtrodden part of the planet. But the fact \nis that we cannot. We cannot do that without jeopardizing what America \nis. That is not to say that we would discontinue being the melting pot, \nwhere people who want to come legally from any part of the world and \nbecome Americans can do so. We ought to provide an opportunity for them \nto do so, to the extent that it serves America's interests and serves \nAmerica's needs.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this from the time in opposition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment. It undermines both the intention and the spirit of this \nbill. The amendment would not only treat future workers as less than \nAmerican workers, it would treat them as less than all other immigrant \nworkers.\n  The real issue is--I will get right to it--after many long months and \nweeks and hours of negotiation, we had a proposal that passed through \nthe Judiciary Committee and then a compromise, thanks to Senators Hagel \nand Martinez, basically establishing the framework for a compromise in \nthe Senate. If this amendment should pass, that whole compromise is \ndestroyed because a fundamental part of that compromise was that those \nwho have been here for 2 to 5 years, after having gone back to a port \nof embarkation, would then be eligible for temporary work under the \ntemporary worker program, and then over time be eligible for green card \nstatus and citizenship. This amendment would destroy that compromise. I \nunderstand very well why the Senator from Texas and the Senator from \nAlabama on the floor of the Senate, and others, have been opposed to \nthis bill from the beginning. I understand that and I appreciate it and \nI respect it. But let's have no doubt about what this amendment would \ndo. It would destroy the entire carefully crafted compromise.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Texas has an interesting theory about people \nwho would want to come here and only work and then go back, or maybe \nnot go back, but not have any opportunity for citizenship. We have \nexamples today in Europe of the situation that the Senator from Texas \nand my colleague from Arizona would want to create, which is having \npeople living in your country with no hope to ever be a part of that \nsociety.\n  I would remind my colleagues of what happened not long ago in France. \nThere were thousands of young Muslims who were burning cars everywhere \nand rioting and demonstrating because they had no hope and no \nopportunity. Why is it that all over Europe you find these enclaves of \nforeign workers who are totally and completely separate from society? \nBecause they are in the situation which this amendment would dictate: \nNo hope, no job, no opportunity, no future, but we will let you work.\n  This is not what we do with highly skilled workers. That is not what \nwe do under various other programs, and especially for those who have \nalready been here between 2 and 5 years under this very carefully \ncrafted compromise, the Hagel-Martinez compromise, as it is called, \nembodied. I understand why the Senator from Texas or the Senator from \nArizona would oppose that. They oppose the very principles upon which \nthe legislation was based and the Hagel-Martinez compromise was shaped.\n  The Senator from Alabama is on this floor constantly against \nvirtually every aspect of the bill. I understand that.\n  But I want my colleagues who are voting to understand that if this \namendment would pass, this whole compromise and this whole legislation \ncollapses because it removes a fundamental principle of this \nlegislation, which is that we give people an opportunity to earn \ncitizenship, which is exactly what the 2- to 5-year part of the \ncompromise under the Hagel-Martinez proposal represents. If you are \nhere between 2 to 5 years, you have to go to a port of embarkation, you \ncome back, you take part in a temporary worker program, and then over \ntime you obtain eligibility for a green card, and ultimately \ncitizenship. That is what America has been all about: people coming \nhere and having the opportunity to obtain citizenship.\n  So we have a fundamental disagreement. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill recognize that passage of this amendment would cause the entire \nbill to collapse, which we have been working on now for a week with \nexcellent debate and good votes, and I think the way the Senate should \nfunction. So I hope that everybody understands exactly the implication \nof this amendment, and I understand and respect the view that is held \nby my colleagues who support this amendment. But I want all of my \ncolleagues to understand the impact of passage of this amendment. It \nundermines not only the principles of the bill but, in my view, the \nprinciples of what this Nation should be and is all about today.\n  We have talked many times about people who live in the shadows, the \npeople who don't have the benefits of our citizenship, or an \nopportunity to become citizens, these 11 million people who are living \nin the shadows. If this amendment would pass, I can assure you we would \nkeep several million in the shadows because they would never come out \nof the shadows because they would never want to return to their country \nand never be able to be on a path to citizenship. So from a principled \nviewpoint and, frankly, from a practical viewpoint, this amendment is \nunacceptable.\n  I know the hour is late. I know a lot of my colleagues are not paying \nas much attention, perhaps, as they would at other hours of the day, \nbut I hope we make it very clear that the passage of this amendment \nwould cause the entire legislation to implode, and we would then be \nobviously in a position where we could probably not pass meaningful \nlegislation that would entail comprehensive immigration reform, which \nis what the President has espoused and what I believe the overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate has proved in numerous votes this week that we \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nhard work on this amendment and his thoughtfulness.\n  The Senator from Arizona just tells us that he and a few masters of \nthe universe have met somewhere in some room to which I wasn't \ninvited--I am not sure many other Senators were invited--and they have \ndecided that this bill as written is the compromise and if any of it is \nchanged, well, the compromise collapses and the bill fails. So, if I am \nhearing the Senator from Arizona correctly, he thinks we should all \njust give it up and quit offering amendments. But I don't think that is \nthe way the Senate does business. I know the Senator from Arizona is a \nsmart man and so are some of the others who have worked on this bill \nand worked out all of these compromises with Senator Kennedy.\n  When they were working out these compromises did they consult the \nAmerican people? I submit they haven't consulted the American people. \nThe American people, when they find out what all is in this bill, they \nare going to be more upset with it than they are today.\n  More is wrong with this piece of legislation than can be explained. I \ntook an hour or so Friday, not condemning the philosophy of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, not condemning steps to make the \nlegal system work properly in a way that we can be proud of, I talked \nabout why the legislation is insufficient and flawed and is unable to \ndo what the sponsors say.\n  Senator McCain doesn't back down from a challenge, and I don't intend \nto back down either. I am not going to just hide under my desk because \nhe and Senator Kennedy have worked out a compromise. They think we \nshouldn't even make an argument against it, I suppose.\n  Let me just show you what the bill says. In big print up here: \n``Title IV--Nonimmigrant And Immigrant Visa Reform.'' All this rubric \nat the top in big letters: ``subtitle A, Temporary Guest Workers.'' It \nsays, ``Temporary Guest Workers'' in big print--not even the normal \nprint. It says ``temporary'' and ``guest'' I don't know how many times \nin this provision.\n  The President told me--and he has said publicly a half dozen times--\nhe believes in a temporary worker bill. I suppose his lawyers, maybe \nthey thought it must be temporary, right? Well, it is not so. Let's \ntake the people who will be allowed to enter our country in the future \nunder this bill. This bill say that they can come in as a guest worker, \ntemporary, and they can come for 3 years and then they can extend and \nstay another 3 years.\n\n  So that means it is temporary, right? Wrong. All you have to do is \nread the language of the bill, and as Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn \nhave pointed out, and you discover that the first day the temporary \nworkers are here they can apply for a green card through their \nemployer. And what is a green card? It makes them a legal, permanent \nresident. Permanent resident, not a temporary guest workers.\n  Five years after that green card is issued, they are entitled to \napply for citizenship, every single one of them that enter under this \nso-called temporary provision. That is the truth, but it is not the \nmessage we are being told.\n  Earlier today I thought about offering an amendment or a resolution \nto bar anyone in the Senate from using the phrase ``temporary guest \nworker'' when they talk about this bill because it is so bogus. It is \nan utter and total misrepresentation. As I just explained, and as the \nSenators have just explained, everyone coming in under this provision \nfor the indefinite future get to become permanent workers. I challenge \nanybody to dispute that. They have the ability to become a legal \npermanent resident, and after that, they get to go and become a \ncitizen. So it is just not a temporary worker program, it is permanent \nimmigration. That is the deal.\n  Now, President Bush, as much as he believes in immigration and has \nbeen supportive of it, he has made clear that this is not what he \nwants. He supports the principles behind the Kyl-Cornyn amendment. We \nneed to listen to him. This is a big amendment. And I do not think the \nMembers of this body should feel in any way that they are not able to \nreject this bill and improve it by legislation because some group says \nthey have reached a compromise and nobody can fix it, when they have \nmade mistakes, and there are a lot of mistakes. This is just one of \nthem. But I don't believe this Senate has ever seen--since I have been \nhere, a piece of legislation of such monumental consequence have a \nmisrepresentation as great as the allegation that the bill deals with \ntemporary guest workers when it absolutely creates an automatic path to \ncitizenship.\n  So why don't we do it right? Why don't we do what Senator Kyl and \nwhat Senator Cornyn say and fix it, make it actually do what we the \nbill claims it does, make it temporary?\n  A green card is valuable. It entitles people to great benefits of the \nUnited States alone, even short of citizenship. So we have benefits \nthat accrue like the earned income tax credit, like the food stamps and \nbenefits of that kind as you come to be on the path of legal permanent \nresidence. A legal permanent resident can bring their family into the \ncountry, their wife, and their children. When they become a citizen, \nwhich they will have a right to do in 5 years, they will then be able \nto bring in their parents who would probably soon, as a matter of \ndemographics, be eligible and in need of substantial health care as \nthey age, which the American taxpayers would provide them in one form \nor another. They can bring in their brothers and sisters. They all are \neligible to come under the chain migration provisions of existing law.\n  This is a huge provision of the bill, is all I am saying. It is a \nmajor increase in the amount of people who will come into the country \nlawfully. It is a program that allows permanence and citizenship for \nevery single person who comes in under this provision. It is not a \ntemporary guest worker program. It is contrary to the whole message the \nAmerican people have been told repeatedly that they are somehow dealing \nwith, which is a guest worker program, when it is a permanent \ncitizenship track. It is against what the President of the United \nStates believes in. In fact, he has now endorsed the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment because he has been saying all along he thought we ought to \nhave temporary workers in not such a large number that would be coming \nin permanently under this provision.\n  There will be other provisions by which people can come and get on \nthe citizenship track. But the temporary guest worker provisions of the \nbill should be simply that. I think that will meet the needs of \nworkers; I think it will meet the needs of businesses. I think it will \nbe the right way to handle this matter. I think it is what the American \npeople have in their minds and think we are talking \nabout. Unfortunately, if they heard that message and think that is what \nwe are doing, it is not. Unless the Kyl-Cornyn amendment passes, we \nwill not have a temporary guest worker provision in the bill.\n\n  The choice is clear. If Senators actually believe what they have been \nsaying about what they are trying to pass, that they want a temporary \nguest worker program, then they should support Kyl-Cornyn. If not, they \nought to come out of the shadows and stand before the American people \nand say that the temporary guest worker words printed right here in \nthis bill--well, they don't mean what they say. They ought to tell us \nplainly and simply that they know that this is a provision that takes \npeople straight to permanent resident status and straight to \ncitizenship, so when we vote, Americans will know where we stand.\n  I thank the Senators from Texas and Arizona for offering the \namendment and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will yield myself 3 minutes. Also, I \nyield to the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, 20 minutes.\n  One of the hardest things about this whole subject I think is there \nare so many assumptions that people make based upon their own \nexperience. How in the world can we put ourselves in the place of some \nof the individuals that this bill impacts and know what their desires \nare, know what their aspirations are, know what their relationships are \nto their country and their family and their culture?\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\n  I think there are some people who assume if America was to offer \nindividuals from other countries an opportunity to come and qualify and \nwork legally in the United States for a period of time, that they would \nnot want to do that because they would want to stay permanently and \nthey wouldn't want to go back home. I think common sense tells us these \nindividuals love their country, they love their culture, and they love \ntheir family as much as we love ours. There is a deep and abiding \nconnection that is not easily severed. The reason why people do sever \nit is necessity, when they don't have any opportunities where they live \nso they are willing to do whatever it takes, including leave their \ncountry and come to work in the United States. But what they would \nlike--there is at least some segment of these individuals who like to \ncome and work for awhile and then go back home and then maybe come back \nagain and work for another couple of years and maintain their ties to \ntheir culture and their country and their family.\n  I would like to point out to our colleagues there is one piece of \nwhat I would call objective evidence out there that is not a \nsupposition or an opinion or a guess as to what people's motivations \nmight be. Not too long ago the Pew Hispanic Center took a survey of \n5,000 applicants for the Matricula Consular card in the United States. \nThat is basically a Mexican identification card that citizens of Mexico \ncan apply for and receive while living in the United States. Five \nthousand Mexican citizens applied for the Matricula Consular card and \nthey were asked this question: If you were provided an opportunity to \nwork legally in a temporary worker program in the United States, would \nyou participate, even though it meant that at the end of that temporary \nperiod you would be required to go home?\n  Seventy-one percent of the applicants said yes. Yes. I think we are \nfooling ourselves by thinking that the only folks who want to come to \nthe United States want to stay here permanently and that there are not \nat least a large segment of people who would participate in a temporary \nworker program.\n  I hope we don't get too confused about this. There are ways for \npeople to come, immigrate to the United States, and to become legal \npermanent residents and American citizens. But there are caps on those. \nThere are waiting lists on those. Those are designed with America's \nbest interests involved because, frankly, we can't assimilate everybody \nwho wants to come, as I mentioned a moment ago.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. We don't want \nunassimilated populations living permanently in the United States who \ndo not speak our language and do not share our values. That has been \nthe great promise and the hope and realization of America that, no \nmatter who you are, how you pronounce your last name, what country you \ncome from, if you believe in our values, you believe in freedom, and \nyou believe in opportunity, that you, too, can become an American if \nthat is what you want. But I believe we ought to provide a reasonable \nopportunity, based on our national interest, for people who want to \nimmigrate on a permanent basis, and we also ought to provide another \ncategory for people who don't want to sever their ties, don't want to \ncome here permanently, they want a job and then they want to go home.\n  That is what this temporary worker provision would provide. It is, in \nfact, I believe, an honest representation of what the program is, as \nopposed to the problem that the Senator from Alabama noted and that I \nnoted earlier. This bill, as written, is neither a guest worker program \nor temporary in any sense. This amendment, I believe, would correct \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes and 42 seconds. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 11 minutes and yield the \nremaining time to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The hour is late. We have had a very good debate over the course of \nthe day. Now we are faced with an amendment that, even though it comes \nat the late hours of the day, is very basic and fundamental to the \nsuccess of the whole piece of legislation. Just as important or even \nmore important is the spirit of this particular amendment and what it \nis meant to achieve and what it is not meant to achieve.\n  Under the current immigration law, if you have a H-1B, that means you \nhave a visa and you are highly skilled. The concept behind the H-1B is \nyou are highly skilled, and because you are able to have a particular \nniche, the result of your service means you are going to have 8 or 10 \nor 15 more Americans working. So there is a limited number of the H-\n1Bs.\n  Under our current law, if your employer wants to petition for you, \nyou can get a green card. If you are highly skilled, your employer can \nget the green card for you. But under the Cornyn amendment, if you are \nlow skilled, you are out the window. One set of treatment for the very \nhighly educated, highly skilled, who are working on the computers. But \nif you are cleaning a building in America, if you are working in menial \njobs, if you are looking after children, if you have one of the lower \npaid jobs, you are out of luck.\n  Really a nice, fair standard. The Statue of Liberty is turned around \ntonight, listening to the argument of our friends over here. It is \nturned around. One standard for high skilled, and, boy, if you are \ndoing the more menial work, which we know other Americans are not \nprepared to do, you are out. You are finished. You are gone. No chance \nat all. Work for 6 years and then maybe they will go out and leave the \ncountry or maybe they will stay. If they stay, they will be part of a \nsubclass. Do you hear me? A subclass in the United States of America. \nThat is what we are trying to avoid in the basic immigration bill.\n  We emphasize legality: legality in coming in as guest workers, the \nlegal system; legality in terms of employment; you can only employ \nthose who come in where there is not an American for the job.\n  But there is also opportunity. We respect those individuals who do \nmenial jobs because after the 4 years that they are here, if there is \nnot going to be an American to do the job, they can petition, and if \nthey meet all the other requirements--they learn English, they obey the \nlaws--they can be part of the American dream. Boy, if the Cornyn \namendment applied to our immigration laws 150 years ago, no Irish \nneeded apply, no Polish needed apply, no Italians needed apply, no Jews \nneeded apply. But tonight we are saying no Hispanics, primarily, need \napply because those are the ones--sure, it is 85 percent, the rest 5 \npercent or 6 percent Asian, the rest from Central America. But that is \nwhat the Senate tonight is confronted with. This undermines the whole \npurpose of the bill. It brings in illegality again. It says your \nemployer hires this person, they work for 6 years, the employer might \nhave trained him, given him decent skills and, bang, you are either \npart of the subclass or you are reporting to deport.\n  Those were wonderful words--report to deport. We will know who those \nindividuals are--Homeland Security. As soon as that time is up, six \ntimes, they will get picked up and either pushed over and pushed out of \nthe country or they will be in a permanent underclass.\n  This is probably a very nice amendment that goes over in some \ncircles. But I tell you, if we are talking about fairness in this \ncountry, if you are talking about fairness in the immigration bill, you \nare talking about fairness in the standards, you are talking about the \nhistory and the tradition of this country about welcoming the poor and \nthe unwashed in our country, you are changing that with the Cornyn \namendment. Make no mistake about it. You are changing that.\n  I was around during the Bracero period, and the exploitation of \nhumanity was extraordinary. We are returning to it if we accept the \nCornyn amendment. We are saying: Because you do more menial jobs, your \nlife, your worth, your being is not worth as much as somebody who is a \nhighly skilled person. That is a wonderful statement for the United \nStates of America to make.\n  You know what is going to happen? Those individuals are going to be \nexploited. If they are women, they are going to be abused. You are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nhave sexual harassment and abuse for them. That is the record. Read the \nhistory of the Braceros. I went to the hearings. I attended the \nhearings all through the Southwest and into California; one of the most \nshameful periods in American history. We go back to it tonight with \nthis amendment. That is what this amendment is all about. That is what \nthis amendment is all about. It strikes a dagger at the heart of what \nthis legislation is about: strict enforcement, strict accountability, \nstrict legality if people are going to play by the rules and earn their \nway to be a part of the American dream.\n  I withhold the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. The chair would say \nto the Senator from Nebraska, there are 11 minutes for you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25\\1/2\\ minutes on the Kyl side and \n16\\1/2\\ on the opposition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I would like to address the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment tonight. I obviously have listened to some of this debate \nover the last hour. There is one thing I want to address before I get \ninto what I think are the real critical issues here, not just on this \namendment that we are going to be voting on but the bill, the purpose, \nunderlying focus.\n  I heard the junior Senator from Alabama say that the White House, the \nPresident, was supporting the Kyl-Cornyn amendment.\n  That is not my understanding. As a matter of fact, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the senior Senator from Florida, Mr. \nMartinez, and I just got off the phone with the Chief of Staff of the \nPresident of the United States. He did not tell us what I just heard on \nthe floor of the Senate as to the President's support of this \namendment. There seems to be some confusion. I would welcome the junior \nSenator from Alabama or maybe the junior Senator from Texas clarifying \nthat if they have some tangible evidence that the President is \nsupporting this amendment. As I said, we just got off the phone with \nthe Chief of Staff of the President of the United States.\n  I would even add further that maybe some of my colleagues didn't hear \nthe President of the United States Monday night. I think most of \nAmerica did. As a matter of fact, there seems to be some significant \napproval developing out there because the President of the United \nStates articulated very clearly essentially the underlying bill that we \nare debating and have been debating this week on the Senate floor. Much \nof that is about the Hagel-Martinez bill. The President laid that out \nrather clearly.\n  I don't know if the President of the United States is withdrawing his \nposition that he clearly articulated to the people of the United \nStates, and why he felt the underlying bill was important. He laid out \nhis principles. Those principles are the principles in this underlying \nbill.\n  I welcome clarification of where the President is on this. Maybe the \nWhite House would like to clarify that as well.\n  Let us talk about what this is about. This is a difficult issue. It \nis complicated. It is wide and deep. Yes. Why is that? Because we have \nessentially deferred this issue for years. We have provided no \nleadership for the American people. We have not had the courage to deal \nwith it because it is political, because it is emotional, because it \ncuts across every sector and every line of our society. It is about \nnational security. It is about autonomy, and our future. It is about \nour society, our schools, our hospitals. That is difficult. It is \ndifficult.\n  But what the President of the United States did Monday night--and a \nnumber of my colleagues have been doing for a long time--was to try to \nfind a resolution.\n  Mr. President, the American people have a very low opinion of you, of \nme, of the Congress, of the President--not because I say it. Read the \nlatest polls. I do not know if the President takes any heart in the \nfact that his job approval numbers are higher than ours.\n  Why are the American people upset with us? Because we are not doing \nour job. We talk about: Let's run to the base. Let's run to the \npolitical lowest common denominator. That is not governing. That is \ncheap, transparent politics. That is why we are all down in the \ntwenties and the low thirties. The people of this country have lost \nconfidence in us, and no wonder. We run from every tough issue. We can \nget into the subsections on page 17 and 500 and 433 of the underlying \nbill--all imperfect, absolutely, because resolution on this issue will \nbe imperfect, absolutely. But we are trying to do something. We are \ntrying to come to some resolution. We are trying to find some answer \nfor the American people.\n  What do we do with the 12 million illegal aliens in this country? Do \nthe American people really believe we are going to ship them all out of \nhere, go down to the bus depot? Is that really what they are going to \ndo? Come on. That is not the answer.\n  Why are we so afraid of this issue? This issue brings out the best in \nour society and the worst in our society. Why are we afraid to deal \nwith this issue? Do we really want, as Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, \nand others have said, a second-class system in this country? Do we \nreally want that? Do we know what the consequences of that are? I am \nnot sure we do.\n  This Kyl-Cornyn amendment destroys every fiber of what many of us \nhave worked for, including the President of the United States, to try \nto find some resolution, some common denominator center point, some \nconsensus of purpose about how we do this. Sure, we can pick apart \ntemporary worker visas. Does that really mean that somebody is going to \nstay longer or not going to stay longer? All imperfect, absolutely, but \ndo you know what we were doing with a resolution like this, as \nimperfect as it is? What we are saying to our country, to the world? \nThat we can deal with the tough issue. We, in fact, can put people onto \na path of responsible behavior, of legal status, just like America has \nalways stood for--hard work, opportunity, do your best, 12 million \nillegal immigrants. They are here illegally. Of course, they are. Yes.\n  This nonsense about amnesty. I said on the floor yesterday--Mr. \nPresident, you might remember 1978 when Jimmy Carter gave amnesty, \nunconditional, no questions asked: Come on back over the border, all of \nyou who ran away from this country and didn't want to serve your \ncountry, didn't want to go to Vietnam, didn't want to be a part of our \ncountry. Jimmy Carter said in 1978, no questions asked, unconditional, \ncome back. That is amnesty.\n  What we are talking about is not amnesty. The President said it very \nclearly Monday night.\n  We are talking about pathways to legality, responsible processes, \nopportunities for people to come out of the shadows.\n  Who are we helping with the current situation that we have today? How \nare we winning? People stay in the shadows, we don't collect the taxes \nwe need, we don't have the complete involvement in communities that we \nhave always had from our immigrants. There is a national security \nelement to this. There is a law enforcement element to it. There is \ncertainly an economic element to it.\n  Are we really winning? No, we are losing. We are losing everywhere.\n  What we are trying to do is find a way to move this forward so that \nwe can start to resolve the issue. I will be the first to say, since I \nhad a little bit to do with helping construct this and I have been at \nthis for many years--I have not been at this as long as Senator Kennedy \nhas, but I tell you, not many Senators on the floor of this Senate have \nbeen at this as long as I have. It doesn't mean that I am right. But I \ndo know a little something about it. I have been down on the border. I \nhave talked to immigrants and have spent personally thousands of hours \non this issue, as has my staff. It doesn't mean I am right or that I am \nsmarter. But I know a little something about it. I know a little about \nthis country. I know how this country was built, and I know about the \npeople of this country.\n  The people of this country want us to resolve the problem. It isn't \nperfect. That is what we have been doing this week. We have been adding \namendments. Some amendments I did not vote for, some I didn't like. But \nadding to this, crafting something for the future, for our history, for \nour children, and for our society, that is what it is about.\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\n  If this amendment passes tonight, if this goes down, the entire \ncompromise will go down. What will stand in its place? What will stand \nin its place?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona, on the proponent's \nside, 25 minutes 28 seconds; on the opposition side, 7 minutes 22 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes and then the \nremaining period of our time to the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  Mr. President, I respect enormously the contributions that the \nSenator from Nebraska and the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nand Senator Kennedy have made to try to address this problem that has \nfestered for so long and which cries out for resolution.\n  I daresay, as chairman of the Immigration, Border Security, and \nCitizenship Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that I have \nbeen trying to make a contribution to that solution, as has Senator \nKyl. We have held numerous hearings of our subcommittee. He chairs the \nTerrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Inasmuch as \nour border presents national security concerns, we have held many \ncommittee hearings to try to, first, find out what the problem is, and, \nsecond, try to couple with practical solutions. I appreciate the \ncontributions of each and every Senator who has tried to find a \nsolution to this problem.\n  I recognize this is what some have called a ``fragile compromise''--\nthat if we tinker with it, all of a sudden it implodes and nothing is \ngoing to happen.\n  I personally don't believe that because we have seen a number of \namendments offered and accepted during the course of this debate which \nI believe has done nothing but make this bill stronger and better. I am \nabsolutely committed to seeing passage of a bill out of the Senate and \nthen going to the conference with the members of the House of \nRepresentatives. They have some very different views from all of us.\n  If our colleagues from Nebraska and Massachusetts and the senior \nSenator from Arizona think that they have found some adversaries on \nsome of these points among those of us here, just wait until they get \nto the conference with Members of the House. Then they will see that we \nreally have a shared vision for comprehensive immigration reform, and \nwe are going to have to work through all of that.\n  But I don't believe it is appropriate to say that this amendment \nwhich merely tries to bring accuracy and truth in advertising to this \ntemporary worker program, that it, in fact, be made temporary and not \npermanent that a guest worker program does not mean permanent residence \nand American citizenship.\n  I differ with the interpretation of some of our colleagues who say we \nare trying to replace the normal immigration path with legal permanent \nresidency and citizenship with a temporary worker program. That is not \ntrue at all. What we are trying to do is say there is an additional way \nthat people who want to come here and don't want to stay here can come \nfor a while and work in a legal system and then go home, and those who \nwant to become American citizens we ought to provide a reasonable path \nfor them to do so subject to cap, subject to our ability to determine \nwhat is in America's best interests.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts talked about distinguishing \nbetween immigrant populations based on skills, based on talents and \ntheir contribution. I say we have every right as a nation to determine \nwhat the attributes are of the immigrants we want to come here and \ncontribute to our country, whether they are a net-plus in terms of \ntheir contribution. Let's say have engineer, math, or science skills as \nopposed to low-skilled workers. I think we have a right to make that \ndistinction.\n  This is an important amendment. I do not believe it will gut the bill \nbut will advance it.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment, a very important \namendment. It is not inconsequential. It changes in a major way a \nspecific feature of the underlying bill. But I believe that feature is \nwrong and needs to be changed. The underlying bill sets up a temporary \nworker program, but it is not temporary in the sense that the workers \nwho come here and get a temporary worker permit can then apply for \npermanent legal residency and ultimately citizenship. There is no \nreason to deny them that under the bill.\n  As a result, you never have temporary workers. You always have \npermanent workers, people who are allowed to come here originally as \ntemporary but who can in effect automatically convert their status to \npermanent legal residency and then citizenship.\n  The question is, Why is that necessary? The second point is it \ncreates a problem when economic conditions change.\n  Why would it be necessary? There are many visas in our system today \nthat are temporary. In fact, there are skilled labor visas that are \ntemporary. They can be renewed. They are based upon an economic need. \nWhen there is a job here that is going unfulfilled by an American \nworker, we have the ability to issue visas to foreigners who can then \ncome here and work for a temporary period of time. Then they return \nhome. As long as there are jobs here, those visas ordinarily continue, \nbut when the work is not here, the visas stop. That is a good thing.\n\n  I support a temporary worker program under this legislation. However, \nit should be temporary. That is to say, the program may be permanent, \nbut the visas under it are temporary, for a limit period of time. They \nmay be 8 or 10 months out of the year; they may be 1 or 2 or 3 years in \nduration. In my view, they should be renewable. There are a lot of \ndifferent ways to construct it. The bottom line is, when you come in \nbecause there is a job available for you as a temporary worker, that \nsame job or another job may not be available to you 5 years later. \nThere may be no work for you 5 years later.\n  Let me give an illustration I have used before. In my home State of \nArizona, we are in a construction boom period. We cannot get enough \npeople to help build houses. There are jobs that go begging, and \ntherefore we have to rely on a large supply of foreign labor to help. \nIt is undoubtedly the case that many of the foreign laborers are \nillegal. They are not documented in the appropriate way. However, they \nare workers who are performing a valuable function in our economy \ntoday.\n  Here is the question. I have been in Arizona now for almost 50 years. \nWe have seen lots of upturns and lots of downturns. What happens when \nthe downturn comes, when we are not building as many houses or office \nbuildings, there aren't many jobs available, and Americans begin to \nfind that jobs are not available for them, they are unemployed, and \nthere is just not the work for people? What happens if you have a \ntemporary visa issued and say that visa is for a period of 2 years? \nThat visa expires, and there is no more job available. In fact, there \nare Americans looking for work. That foreign worker goes home. When \nanother job opens up, when the construction industry gets going again \nand there are opportunities for foreign labor because Americans can no \nlonger provide all of the labor required, the visas would begin being \nissued again, and that individual could come back and begin working \nagain. Perhaps there is some other industry in which the individual can \nwork. In any event, the visa for that job would, after a year or after \n2 years, expire, and if there is not a job available, you do not issue \na new visa.\n  The problem in the underlying bill is that once you get your \ntemporary visa, you can apply or your employer can apply for you to \nturn that automatically into a permanent legal residency status or a \ngreen card status. And we know from that you can apply for citizenship. \nWhen you have a green card, it does not matter whether there is a job \nhere for you, it does not matter whether we are in the middle of a \nrecession and Americans are looking for work; you have a legal right to \nbe in the United States and no one can kick you out. That is what legal \npermanent residency means.\n  So there is no reason in a temporary worker program to be able to \nconvert the temporary visa or permit into a\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nlegal permanent residency. In fact, there can be great harm done if the \neconomy changes, the economic situations change, jobs are no longer \navailable, and instead of having those visas expire, you have converted \nthe individuals into people who have a permanent right to stay in the \nUnited States.\n  This amendment does absolutely nothing to change the existing law \nwith respect to how you can acquire a green card in the United States \nor convert other legal status into benefits under our immigration laws. \nYou can still apply for a green card. You can still apply for other \nways of remaining in the United States for differing periods of time. \nWe do not change any of that. If you are somebody who wants a green \ncard, there is still a way to get a green card. In fact, under \ndifferent versions of the bill, the number of green cards is increased \nso that there are greater opportunities for green cards. The bottom \nline is, you do not have to convert the temporary worker program into a \npermanent worker program.\n  There are economic studies which back up what I am saying. For the \nsake of time, I will not get into the details of some of the studies. \nAmong other things, in previous times, going back to the year 2000, for \nexample, in the skilled visa era where we issued large numbers of \nvisas, there were economic studies that suggested we could have a \ncontinuing need for those visas on into the future for some number of \nyears, and we were issuing those visas at a very high rate at that \ntime. Little did we know that the economic conditions were going to \nchange very rapidly, and very quickly those high-skilled jobs fell off. \nYet we had issued visas for people to come into the country at a time \nwhen, in fact, we were starting to go into a recession and, in fact, \nthose jobs were not available for those people.\n  If they had been able to permanently reside in the United States \nafter they got their temporary visas, it wouldn't matter whether there \nwere jobs available for them; they would be here. It would be legal. \nThere would be no way to remove them. And of course, with green cards, \nthey would be entitled to benefits which would flow from that status. \nThe United States is going to have to pay a lot of unemployment \ncompensation if we now have two bodies of workers, neither one of which \ncan get a job or both of which are competing with each other, American \nworkers and foreign workers.\n  Whether you are talking about purely the future flow workers under \nthe temporary worker program which many in this Senate want to create, \nalthough we differ somewhat on the details of it, I would like to \ncreate a temporary worker program because we think they may be needed \nin the future, or you are talking about the people in the underlying \nbill who have been here 5 years or less and are required to go into the \ntemporary worker program--those are the two groups of people we are \ntalking about--our view is they should be temporary workers, subject to \nthe economic conditions of the United States, not replacing American \nworkers but fulfilling a work requirement when there aren't enough \nAmericans to do the job. It is basically the same thing the President \nsaid in his speech earlier this week when he said that the temporary \nworkers should have an opportunity to be matched with a willing \nemployer when there are not Americans who can do the job. When the job \nis finished, they can return home. I am paraphrasing, but I think those \nare the words of the President.\n  The concept the President has articulated is the same concept that we \nbelieve is appropriate. It is the basis of the temporary worker bill in \nthe Kyl-Cornyn legislation. We believe it is appropriate for that same \nconcept to be embodied in this legislation.\n  Might I inquire how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes to the Senator from Arizona and \n7 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KYL. I will give someone on the other side an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I approach this part of the debate on a \ncritical piece of legislation with due caution. I say that because of \nmy respect for my colleagues from Arizona and from the State of Texas \nand the work they have done as members of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe due diligence they have always put into this critical issue.\n  I believe there is a component missing from this debate that speaks \nto the need for this country to be in a continual and progressive mode \nof training and shaping a permanent stable workforce.\n  Unlike all of the demographic studies of the last decade or two, \nthere is something upon us as a nation that we have never experienced \nbefore. I am a 1945 baby. I am 60 years old. I am just 1 year ahead of \na great class of people--77 million Americans--called baby boomers. \nThey, similar to myself, because of their age, will soon be leaving the \nAmerican workforce. There are demographic studies out there today which \nsuggest that if we are to sustain a 3.5- to 4- percent growth economy, \nwe have to have about 500,000 new, non-U.S. citizen workers in our \nworkforce on an annual basis.\n  Yes, we will have ups and downs in the economy. We always have. But \nin the last downtrend we had, in the final days of the Clinton \nadministration and the early days of the Bush administration, it was \nabout 3.5 million in the downturn before it came back. In the 5.2 \nmillion jobs created since that time, one-third of them have been \nclaimed by foreign nationals. It speaks to an economic growth pattern \nthat now requires for the first time in our history a sustained, \nincoming, trainable, and permanent workforce of the kind that the \nAmerican citizen, by birthrate, is not providing.\n  If we deny that as a country, if we create instability as a country, \nwe deny ourselves the ability to continue to grow. And if we do not \ngrow, this Senate is going to be faced with public policy decisions we \nare not yet brave enough to make: Social Security reform, Medicare \nreform, Medicaid reform--all of those things which, without a sustained \neconomic growth cycle, become phenomenally expensive and maybe \nunaffordable.\n  That does not sound like part of the debate that would tie itself to \nthe Kyl-Cornyn amendment, but I suggest it does. I suggest it behooves \nthis country to create a legal transparent immigration system with a \nsecured border that allows America's employers to train and sustain a \npermanent workforce, a constantly growing permanent workforce, because \nthe American, by birth, is no longer going to do that. It is the nature \nof our country. It is the maturity of our country. It is, in fact, the \nwealth of our country. That is, in part, what all of this debate is \nabout.\n  Americans said: Get your borders secured and get the illegal flow \nunder control; identify them, control them. That is what we are trying \nto do.\n  I do not believe that a constant temporary environment is a stable \nenvironment. For those who work for long periods of time and get a \ngreen card, does it mean they will become a citizen? No, it does not. \nDoes it mean they are eligible? In this bill, it says: Yes, if you go \nto the end of the line and apply, and that is 6 years, another 5 years, \nthat is 11 years, and it goes on and on.\n  I don't believe this is an appropriate amendment to this bill. There \nis enough temporariness to the bill itself by the nature of H-2A's, H-\n2B's and H-2C's, and that is written in. There has to be some stability \nof permanency. That is critical to the American economic scene and to \nthe stability of America's workforce. And even in that, we will have \nthe down cycles that the Senator from Arizona talks about. I am not \nsure at that point, when trained workers are at hand and have supplied \nthe American economy with its growth, that you say: The lights are out, \nleave the country.\n  Somehow, we have to balance that out. That is what we are attempting \nto do. That is why tonight I ask my colleagues to oppose the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is yet another amendment designed to \nundermine the well-balanced programs in this bill. The Comprehensive \nImmigration Reform Act is the product of hard-fought compromise and it \nreflects a balance between the needs of American business and American \nworkers. Strong coalitions representing both of those sectors of our \nsociety support\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nthis bill and endorse the temporary worker program contained in it.\n  One critical provision in the bill creates an opportunity for \ntemporary workers who have followed the rules and worked hard while in \nthe U.S. to seek legal permanent status after a period of time. An \nemployer who has come to rely upon an immigrant guest worker and wants \nto keep that immigrant on staff can file a petition after 1 year for \nthe immigrant to get in line for a green card. The guest worker does \nnot receive any preferential treatment in this program. He must get in \nthe back of the line and meet all the other requirements to earn \ncitizenship, a process that will likely take more than a decade to \ncomplete.\n  The Kyl amendment strips out this provision, taking away a valuable \noption for both the immigrants and their employers.\n  When a similar amendment was debated in the Judiciary Committee--and \ndefeated, as I hope this one will be--the sponsor stated his belief \nthat lower skilled immigrant temporary workers should have to leave the \nU.S. after a few years. High-skilled workers are not treated in this \nmanner. H-1B visas holders have the opportunity to apply for green \ncards under current law. But some sponsors of this bill are willing to \ntreat guest workers as second class.\n  This attitude is deeply disturbing. Lower skilled workers are \nessential to our economy and deserve to be treated with respect and \ndignity. Many of our great American leaders, scientists, artists, and \nteachers have immigrant roots of very modest means. Throughout this \ndebate we have heard many Senators tell their personal stories. Almost \nall of these reflected early years of hardship and struggle while \nimmigrant parents worked hard under very tough circumstances so that \ntheir children could have greater opportunities.\n  Not only is that attitude offensive to me, but it makes little \nbusiness sense. Employers of immigrants in the sectors most likely to \nuse these temporary workers, such as hotels and tourism, food service, \nhealth care, and meat packing, support the program in the bill. The \nNational Restaurant Association has stated that the restaurant industry \nis expected to create almost 2 million new jobs by 2016. It expects \nthis growth to outpace available labor. For reasons such as these, the \nbusiness community, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and members \nof the Essential Worker Coalition support the bill, and strongly oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Striking the path to citizenship measures in the guest worker program \nis also the wrong decision for national security reasons. One of the \ndriving forces behind enacting a comprehensive reform program is to \nensure that we know who is living and working within our borders. If \nthere is no path available to those who seek it and can meet the tough \nrequirements in the bill, then some guest workers will overstay their \nvisas and continue to live and work in the U.S. out of status. That \nwould put us back in the position we are in right now--the position \nthat we all agree must be reformed.\n  In fact, the reason that guest worker programs have failed in the \npast is precisely because they did not contain an option for guest \nworkers to apply to remain in the U.S. legally, if that is what they \nhope to do. Many guest workers will return home, but not all. We should \nensure that the programs we define in law do not send immigrants back \ninto the shadows.\n  Finally, I express my disappointment in hearing about the White House \nsupport of the Kyl amendment. I find it troubling that the White House \nwould choose this amendment to fight so hard to pass. A tremendous \namount of effort has been expended by many of us in the Senate, \nincluding a handful of determined Republicans, to preserve the core \nprovisions of the bill. These committed supporters of the bill view the \nKyl amendment as one that strikes to the core of the compromises \ncontained in it. We would have benefited from the White House's \ninvolvement earlier in the process in a helpful way, but its choice to \nfight against comprehensive reform today is a grave disappointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining on the opposition \nside and 12 minutes on the proponents'.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are prepared to yield back our time if the other side \nwants to yield back.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes to respond to \nmy friend, the Senator from the State of Idaho.\n  He projects that 500,000 workers are going to be needed every year. \nThat sounds a bit high, but there is a way to resolve the question. If \nwe have a temporary worker program that works well and brings in all of \nthe temporary employment needed to fill your labor needs, then whatever \nthat number is can be satisfied with the temporary worker program. But \nif the Senator is wrong and we do not need that many people but we have \nallowed that many people to come into this country and remain here \npermanently, then we have a big problem because we also have to \nconsider the American worker and the job of the American worker.\n  The Senator said we need stability in our workforce. Indeed, that is \na good thing. But I submit we need stability for the American worker. \nThe American worker needs to know his job is secure. In all of the \nindustries we are talking about, while there is a significant need for \nforeign labor, there are far more American workers working in those \nindustries than foreign workers.\n  The bottom line is, there are American workers who will do these \njobs. The only exception of any significance is in certain specters of \nagriculture. And agriculture, in many respects, is a very different \nanimal.\n  The reality is, whether you are talking about the hospitality \nindustry with people making beds and washing the dishes or talking \nabout the construction industry or landscaping, there are millions of \nAmericans doing those jobs. And we want to know that those jobs are \nthere for those American citizens when the economy is not as strong as \nit is now.\n\n  So in periods of decreasing jobs and increasing unemployment, we want \nto be able to ensure that American workers can remain employed. With a \ntemporary foreign worker program, we can ensure that because the \nforeign workers are brought in, to the extent they are needed, when \nthey are needed, in each of these industries. But if they can convert \nto permanent status automatically, which is what this legislation would \nallow, they cannot be removed. They are here. They have legal permanent \nresidency and eventually can acquire citizenship, if they desire.\n  So whether there is a job for them here or not, they are here. The \nstudies show they compete with American workers very well in the low-\nskilled job categories by usually taking less money than Americans, \nwith the result that many times Americans will be unemployed, for which \nwe will be responsible for paying unemployment compensation and other \nbenefits, and yet the foreign worker might have the job. So instead of \na situation in which there is not an American to do the job, we will \nhave a situation in which there is a job, but it is held by a foreign \nworker rather than an American worker.\n  Why do we need to take the chance, is my question. We all agree with \nthe concept of a temporary worker program for skilled labor. In skilled \nlabor, these visas expire. For student visas, they expire. For tourist \nvisas, they expire. They can be renewed in certain situations. In the \ndifferent categories of temporary workers that we have in the law \ntoday, they are all for a specific period of time, and then they \nexpire.\n  What is the matter with that same principle being applied to low-\nskilled workers? In fact, the experts all agree--we had testimony \nbefore our committee--that with respect to low-skilled workers, you are \nmore likely to have people who are undereducated or less well educated \nand likely to work in the lower skill occupations. No surprise there. \nSo if you are going to end up in a situation in which you have extra \nworkers who are here, would you rather have them be of the high-skilled \nvariety or the low-skilled variety, unable to be as flexible in the job \nmarket as somebody with better education and skills?\n  Our immigration law has always been very leery of allowing large \nnumbers of undereducated and low-skilled workers into the country \nbecause they represent a potential expense for this country in the \nevent that the employment that was promised to them does not \nmaterialize or goes away.\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n  So there is no need to take a chance on this. If, in fact, my \ncolleague is correct that we will need more laborers, we can get them \nunder a temporary program where permits can continue to be expanded. We \ncan expand the number or they can be renewed.\n  In any event, there is always the opportunity for people to acquire \ngreen cards. In fact, under I think all of the bills that are pending, \nthe number of green card slots is increased. So there is also an \nopportunity for that.\n  But in case they are wrong, and jobs evaporate over time, and even \nAmericans cannot find work, why would we want to be granting these \nforeign residents who are here temporarily the right to be here \npermanently? It seems to me it is unnecessary. It is potentially \ndevastating, devastating to American workers, and we ought to change \nit.\n  As a result, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, which \ncould go a long way toward improving this bill, creating a true \ntemporary worker program rather than one which automatically converts \nto legal permanent residency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes on the proponents' side and 2 minutes on the \nopponents' side.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is willing to \nyield back his time. And if there is no one else on this side desiring \nto speak, I will be happy to yield back our time. I hope our colleagues \nwill support the amendment. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Martinez), and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay'' and the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nMartinez) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have made good progress on the bill \nbut, candidly, not enough progress. We have about two-thirds of the \nRepublican list included, and I think that much or perhaps even more of \nthe Democrats' list. We are not sure there because we just got the \nlist. We have been trying hard to schedule two votes for tomorrow to \ntry to get the Senate back on a schedule where we work on Fridays. It \nwould take about a half hour to go through the chronology of about \neight different amendments that we have tried to structure but all of \nwhich have collapsed. Managing a bill has a lot of pitfalls, where we \nhave absences for dinners on both sides, where we have adjournments for \nsigning ceremonies, where we have recesses for social events at the \nWhite House and other places. In one situation, we had an arrangement \nfor a half hour, equally divided, and to have a vote tomorrow and that \nwas changed to we cannot do it tomorrow to we can do it tomorrow, but \nwe want 2 hours, to we cannot do it ever.\n  I think there would be a 100-to-nothing vote on the point that we \ndon't have enough discipline here to move ahead with our work. We have \ntried to get this bill complete. So after telling the majority leader \nwhat the situation was, it was decided that it would be fruitless to \nhave two 99-to-0 votes which are meaningless when they could be \naccepted. It would be ludicrous, notwithstanding the fact that we all \ndeserve to be voting tomorrow on ludicrous matters. But the majority \nleader decided we will not bring in people to have meaningless votes. \nIt is our hope that this will spur us to some meaningful votes early \non.\n  The Chambliss amendment will be laid down tonight, and there will be \n30 minutes of debate on it before the vote at 5:30 on Monday. We will \nhave a vote on Senator Feinstein's amendment, where she will have \nsubstantial time on Monday afternoon. We will see if we can construct a \nvote for Senator Ensign on what he is trying to work out, which has \nquite a number of concerns. Senator Bond has an amendment that we may \nbe able to take.\n  The remaining business tonight is to take the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida by a voice vote, which will, I believe, conclude \nbusiness on this bill for the evening and the week.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the big picture, let me say at the \noutset that things are going very well. It is 9:30 on a Thursday night. \nWe are making decisions about tomorrow and Monday. We have had a very \ngood week. I thank the Democratic leader and both managers for making \ngreat progress over the course of the week.\n  It is very frustrating, from a leadership standpoint, for the \nDemocratic leader and myself, where we have to truncate and essentially \nstop tonight when we could have had a productive day tomorrow morning. \nTwo reasons. The managers have done such a good job addressing such a \nlarge number of amendments--more than I had anticipated--which is good, \nwhich means the amendments that remain, they want a lot of people \naround to be able to vote on those. In part, I am making an excuse \nbecause I told everybody we are going to vote tomorrow morning. Given \nwhere we are, it is in our best interest to complete debate tonight, \nand the votes we would have had tomorrow we will have Monday. There \nwill be at least two votes starting at 5:30 on Monday.\n  We do have to recognize in this body that we cannot stop work on a \nThursday afternoon or evening. We have to be able to use Fridays, \nespecially over the remainder of the session. We don't have that many \ndays. Even between now and next week, we have this bill--and that is \nwhy we are working as hard as we can--and we have the Kavanaugh \nnomination, which is out there and ready to bring to the floor. We have \na supplemental spending bill which funds our troops overseas. I talked \nto three different generals today and the Secretary of Defense, all of \nwhom say we have to act on that supplemental. So we have to have \nSenators here. We have to have them participating.\n  Again, this is not the fault of the managers. They have done a superb \njob. It means that tomorrow we will likely be in session, but we will \nnot\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nhave rollcall votes. We will be voting Monday afternoon at 5:30.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will make a brief comment.\n  Mr. President, we started out on this with the decision that we were \ngoing to try to do some legislation on this very difficult bill. This \nis from our perspective. We wanted to move through this an amendment at \na time. I think it worked out well. We are at a point now, I think, as \nwe have done earlier in the day, that we don't have to live by that. We \nhave proven that we can legislate. We can always go back and do an \namendment at a time if we have to. We are going to take an amendment at \na time on a case-by-case basis, and we have no objection tonight--or \nvery likely in the near future--to being able to set amendments aside \nand move on. I think we have been able to accomplish a great deal in \nthis short week.\n  This bill is not finished yet, so there is no reason to give high \nfives and say work well done. There is still a lot of real hard work to \ndo. I have submitted at the request of the manager, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, a list of Democratic amendments that we have \nhotlined--a lot of them. I have indicated to the managers that I am \nconfident that most of them will not have to be offered. You asked for \nthat and you have gotten that.\n  I think that this coming week we all have to keep our heads down and \npush hard. There is a lot of work to do, and we have very significant \namendments. I applaud and commend Senator Specter and Senator Kennedy \nfor the way I see the Senate working. I think we have done good work. \nWe have had some very timely amendments and difficult amendments. We \nhave had winners and losers. That is what legislating is all about. \nSome of the compromise takes place not in the back room but on the \nSenate floor when we vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the leaders and my \ncolleague, Senator Specter. I think this has been a very good week in \nterms of talking and debating. I think we have seen some real debates \non the floor of the Senate, some which we have not seen for a long \nperiod of time. I think the Members know a great deal more about what \nis in this legislation. They may like it or not, but I think the debate \nwill be even better next week. I think we have made good progress. \nSometimes it is useful to take a little time to go over these \namendments, as someone who has been here for 12 hours. Sometimes we can \nhave a better debate and discussion if we can go over them and know \nwhere we are going to be on Monday and then what the priorities are. \nThe Republicans have had, as I remember, 20 sort of key issues. We have \ngotten through a fair amount of them. There is still a good group of \nthose. I think they have laid out the issues, and I think we can use \nthis time and be better prepared and have a better debate and a better \noutcome next week. I thank the leaders for all they have done, and I \nthank the Members on both sides.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will now go to the Nelson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague would yield, we have an \namendment that I think has been agreed to, and I am prepared to take 5 \nor 10 minutes tonight and get through it. I will leave it up to the \nleaders how they want to handle it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let's take the Nelson amendment. There is \nalways manana.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my understanding of the earlier unanimous \nconsent agreement was that I would be recognized followed by Senator \nNelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The unanimous consent \nagreement recognized the Senator from Nevada for 10 minutes prior to \nSenator Nelson. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4076, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we have spent a great deal of time talking \nabout how to proceed with tonight's debate. We have been trying to work \nout whether we would have a vote on my amendment No. 4076.\n  I send a modified version of my amendment to the desk which has been \nseen by both Senator Byrd and Senator Gregg who had previously \nexpressed problems with the text of the amendment. The modification \nstrikes a particular paragraph which had dealt with the questions of \nwhich agency would fund the program if the cost exceeded a certain \ndollar amount. I would ask for immediate consideration of the modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 4076, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4076), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (To authorize the use of the National Guard to secure the southern \n                      border of the United States)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 133. TEMPORARY NATIONAL GUARD SUPPORT FOR SECURING THE \n                   SOUTHERN LAND BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Authority To Provide Assistance.--(1) With the approval \n     of the Secretary of Defense, the Governor of a State may \n     order any units or personnel of the National Guard of such \n     State to perform annual training duty under section 502(a) of \n     title 32, United States Code, to carry out in any State along \n     the southern land border of the United States the activities \n     authorized in subsection (b), for the purpose of securing \n     such border.

Mr. President, I will speak just briefly, because it is \nlate. I am not going to take up a lot of time, but this is a very \nimportant amendment. The substance of this amendment is something that \nI have been\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nworking on for over a month. During the last Congressional recess, I \nwent down to Yuma, AZ, where the President was today. I saw firsthand \nwhat an extraordinary job our Border Patrol is doing. I also observed \nfirsthand how undermanned the agency is and how overwhelmed they are \nwith the numbers that are coming across our southern border.\n  When I was at the border, I asked a question of the Border Patrol \npersonnel. That question was: Could you use more National Guardsmen at \nthe border, beyond those in the Counter Drug Program, to help you with \nyour mission of protecting and securing our borders? The overwhelming \nanswer was that they would absolutely welcome our National Guard in \nlarger numbers down on the border.\n  The Border Patrol was very clear. It would create problems if the \nNational Guard were to come down to the border to carry on law \nenforcement duties like arresting, detaining, and questioning \ndetainees. Each of those things are part of the speciality role that \nthe Border Patrol should do. They are, after all, highly trained law \nenforcement personnel while the National Guard is trained in other \nareas, areas for which the Border Patrol requires support.\n  In his Monday night address, the President proposed using up to 6,000 \nNational Guardsmen on the border this year. Their presence would help \nmultiply the force of the Border Patrol that is currently on the \nborder. What do I mean by that? In many instances, the Border Patrol is \ntaken away from their normal duties when they have to, for instance, \nperform a medical rescue of somebody who has gone into distress. This \nis actually a common occurrence in the southwest desert. Immigrants \ncrossing the desert become dehydrated and nearly die. Some of the \nBorder Patrol surveillance cameras might pick it up, or the alien pulls \na distress beacon to signal they need help, and the Border Patrol \nactually goes to rescue them. This is something the National Guard is \nvery well trained to do. When they are on the border, the National \nGuard can fulfill that mission which will free up the Border Patrol to \nperform some of the other functions of their duties, like arrest and \ndetention.\n  When the National Guard trains today, when personnel are performing \ntheir 2 to 3 weeks of training, they are building roads, building \nfences, and building bridges. They do all of these things as part of \ntheir training. Except most of the time when they are training, after \nthey build something they are required to tear it down. It is a \ntraining exercise. What this amendment envisions is that what they will \nbuild, fences, barriers, and roadways, will all be essential \ninfrastructure needed to secure the border. The National Guard can use \ntraining time to build roads down on the border, except this time they \nwon't have to tear them down. What they build will actually be \npermanent structures.\n  We had a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday. \nThe National Guard told the committee that they are very excited about \nthis mission, about what they will be accomplishing. Instead of \nbuilding a road and tearing it up with a tractor, they will actually be \nbuilding a road that is going to help secure the United States of \nAmerica. I have received e-mails from National Guardsmen in my State \nthat say they believe in the objective, they believe in the mission, \nand they are very excited about it.\n  I want to be clear. Some people have erroneously reported in the \nmedia that the National Guard would be on the border and would be \narresting, they would be shooting at people, that they would be \nmilitarizing the border and performing law enforcement activities. That \nis not true. Let me tell you exactly what we have put in this amendment \nthat states exactly what the National Guard will be authorized to do. \nThey will be authorized to conduct ground reconnaissance activities, \nairborne reconnaissance activities, logistical support, provision of \ntranslation services in training, administrative support services, \ntechnical training services, emergency medical assistance and services, \ncommunications services, rescue of aliens in peril, and construction of \nroadways, patrol roads, fences, barriers, and other facilities to \nsecure the southern land border of the United States. They will also \ncooperate with ground and air transportation.\n  We are very clear on what their mission is going to be down there. I \nappreciate the work of Senator Craig on this issue. I see him here on \nthe Senate floor. He has been one of the biggest proponents of using \nthe National Guard down on the border, and I appreciate the driving \nforce that he has been in the United States Senate to bring everybody's \nattention to this issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing this issue \nbefore the Senate. Yesterday the Senator from Nevada and I were in \nattendance at a hearing of the Armed Services Committee chaired by \nSenator Warner, with the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of the \nNational Guard, the lieutenant general of the Army, and the Chief of \nthe Border Patrol. What we saw was the coming together of a complete \nunit, a complete unit to secure our border and build an orderly process \non the border.\n  What the Senator from Nevada speaks to tonight is a reality that is \nvery doable, and it is done in the normal activity of the summer \ntraining of our Guard. The Senator knows that we are not putting \nGuardsmen out on the front lines. They will facilitate those of the \nBorder Patrol who are the frontline officers in this defensive securing \nmechanism that we will call the southwestern border of our country.\n  So I thank the Senator for bringing this to the floor. It is critical \nand important. It fits well into what our President has proposed, \nresponsibly so, for our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes so that I will be able to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a question \nbecause perhaps he has thought this through and he could help me \nunderstand it. I support the President's effort to make the border \nstronger and safer. What I understood him to say was at least 6,000 \nNational Guardsmen at any one time, rotated every 2 or 3 weeks to \naccommodate what was their normal training schedule. By my calculation, \nthat means that in the first year over 100,000 National Guardsmen from \naround the United States will be sent to the border. And in the second \nyear, when half as many are needed, another, say, 50,000. So out of the \n400,000 National Guardsmen nationwide--I hope my figure is correct, \nalthough I don't know if it is--but is it your understanding that \n100,000 to 150,000 will end up on border duty during that period?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question. I \nwas going to address his very point. The way that the Border Patrol, \nthe National Guard, and the administration have developed their plan \nenvisions that about one-third of the 6,000 Guardsmen would actually be \non the border for longer than the 21 day maximum. My amendment mirrors \ntheir plan. It sets forth that two-thirds of the overall personnel will \nperform their required 21 days of annual training down on the border. \nThat time is time that the Guardsmen committed to when they signed up. \nThe amendment also says that about a third of the force, consisting of \ncommand personnel and guardsmen who are necessary for integration \npurposes, will be down there full time. They will be there full time to \nensure some continuity. The personnel who are rotating in will need to \nhave leadership that can organize and who have some institutional \nmemory. The full time personnel can say to the rotating personnel: you \nneed to go here, this is what you will do, and we need you to work with \nthis other group.\n  During our hearing yesterday--this very issue came up--according to \nthe National Guard the numbers that the President has committed will \nwork. They have said that this mission can be done, that there is \nabsolutely no problem for them to operate in this fashion, considering \nthey will be going through the training anyway. Personnel will have to \ngo through the 2 to 3 weeks of training and this set up will\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nactually improve the training they are getting.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to address this question through the Chair. \nAbout 75 percent of the Illinois National Guard units have been \nactivated to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan, and some have been on more \nthan one tour of duty. During the course of that, they have left behind \nin Iraq and Afghanistan a lot of wornout equipment, damaged equipment. \nCurrently our National Guard, in some areas of supplies, like certain \ntrucks, is down to 7 percent of what they need, and nationwide we have \nbeen told the National Guard stock of supply and equipment has been \ndepleted to the level of 34 percent of what they need.\n  Can the Senator from Nevada tell me whether our commitment of the \nNational Guard to the border will also be a commitment to replenish the \nequipment they will need to serve effectively there and return home and \ndo their job?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to address that question, we actually \ntalked about that in yesterday's hearing. It was one of the questions \nthat was asked. What the National Guard is going to do, with the \nDepartment of Defense, is take the equipment down there, and it will \nstay down there. If the Illinois National Guard comes down, they won't \ncome down with their own equipment; they will use the equipment that is \nthere. So it will stay there for the 2 years, for the duration, what \nthey need. So that is going to be paid for separately. It is part of \nthe $1.9 billion the administration had requested, so it does not come \nout of the normal National Guard budget, it doesn't come out of what we \nare trying to replenish of the National Guard's that are coming back \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Those are excellent questions. We have addressed those. We have \naddressed those as to how the administration policy is going to happen.\n  This is the last point I will make. This is a critical stopgap, but \nit is only a stopgap because we can only train about 1,000 Border \nPatrol agents a year. It was my amendment actually to ramp us up to \n10,000 more Border Patrol agents in the intelligence bill last year. We \ncan't do even the 2,000 that bill envisioned, and we certainly can't \nget to the 10,000 right way. This bill before us needs this if you are \ngoing to have the temporary guest worker program. This National Guard \nis the temporary measure that we need to fill in so we actually secure \nthe borders. 1I appreciate very much the indulgence of the manager of \nthe bill. We look forward to further debate, if people have that. I \nreally appreciate your taking the time to allow us to fit in tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3998, as Modified\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, since I seem to be the only \nthing in between now and the Senate adjourning, I will not take the 10 \nminutes and will make it very short at the request of the chairman.\n  I call up amendment No. 3998, with a modification which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3998, as modified.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3998), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 178, line 24, before ``20 detention facilities'', \n     insert ``at least''.\n       On page 179, line 1, strike ``10,000'' and insert \n     ``20,000''.\n       On page 179, line 4, after ``United States'', insert \n     ``subject to available appropriations.''\n       Beginning on page 179, strike lines 5 through 23 and insert \n     the following:\n       (b) Construction of or Acquisition of Detention \n     Facilities.--\n       (1) Requirement to construct or acquire.--The Secretary \n     shall construct or acquire additional detention facilities in \n     the United States to accommodate the detention beds required \n     by section 5204(a) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Protection Act of 2004, as amended by subsection (a), subject \n     to available appropriations.\n       (2) Use of alternate detention facilities.--Subject to the \n     availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall fully \n     utilize all possible options to cost effectively increase \n     available detention capacities, and shall utilize detention \n     facilities that are owned and operated by the Federal \n     Government if the use of such facilities is cost effective.\n       (3) Use of installations under base closure laws.--In \n     acquiring additional detention facilities under this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall consider the transfer of \n     appropriate portions of military installations approved for \n     closure or realignment under the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law \n     101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) for use in accordance with \n     subsection (a).\n       (4) Determination of location.--The location of any \n     detention facility constructed or acquired in accordance with \n     this subsection shall be determined, with the concurrence of \n     the Secretary, by the senior officer responsible for \n     Detention and Removal Operations in the Department. The \n     detention facilities shall be located so as to enable the \n     officers and employees of the Department to increase to the \n     maximum extent practicable the annual rate and level of \n     removals of illegal aliens from the United States.\n       (c) Annual Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually \n     thereafter, in consultation with the heads of other \n     appropriate Federal agencies, the Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress an assessment of the additional detention facilities \n     and bed space needed to detain unlawful aliens apprehended at \n     the United States ports of entry or along the international \n     land borders of the United States.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the \nproblem that, when our Border Patrol apprehends illegal aliens, they \nhave no place in which to process them, no detention beds, so 90 \npercent in some parts of this country are released. Guess what. They \nnever appear for their formal appearance and they melt into the economy \nand add to the existing problem.\n  The chairman has addressed this already. Whereas the current law adds \n8,000 of these detention beds per year, and that is on top of a base of \nonly 20,000 detention beds nationwide--the chairman's bill adds a one-\ntime additional 10,000 new beds over and above the 8,000 beds per year. \nThis amendment will double that by adding a one-time 20,000 new beds \nabove the 8,000 beds per year. It is very simple. That is it.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for being willing to accept \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is an excellent amendment which is \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3998), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4009\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I call up amendment No. 4009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself, Mr. \n     Isakson, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4009.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the wage requirements for employers seeking to hire \n                H-2A and blue card agricultural workers)\n\n       On page 452, strike line 1 and all that follows through \n     page 459, line 10, and insert the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--An employer applying to hire H-2A \n     workers under section 218(a), or utilizing alien workers \n     under blue card program established under section 613 of the \n     Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, shall offer to \n     pay, and shall pay, all workers in the occupation for which \n     the employer has applied for alien workers, not less than \n     (and is not required to pay more than) the greater of--\n       ``(i) the prevailing wage in the occupation in the area of \n     intended employment; or\n       ``(ii) the applicable State minimum wage.\n       ``(B) Prevailing wage defined.--In this paragraph, the term \n     `prevailing wage' means the wage rate that includes the 51st \n     percentile of employees with similar experience\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\n     and qualifications in the agricultural occupation in the area \n     of intended employment, expressed in terms of the prevailing \n     rate of pay for the occupation in the area of intended \n     employment.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nAlexander and Bond be added as original cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I have said it before and I say it \nagain today that I think the approach taken in this legislation we are \nconsidering today is contrary to the best interests of agriculture. By \nignoring proper enforcement of our immigration laws for many years, the \nFederal Government has been sending the wrong message to farmers and \nranchers across the United States: that it pays to break the law. Quite \nliterally, it has. For those who have flouted rule of law by refusing \nto utilize the temporary worker program for agriculture--the H-2A \nprogram--have gained a tremendous economic advantage over their \ncounterparts who have adhered to the laws on the books today.\n  I will be the first to admit that some farmers have had little choice \nbut to utilize an illegal workforce--for the H-2A program, as presently \nwritten has its limitations--for instance, farmers with jobs that are \nnot seasonal are not able to utilize it. However, changes can be made \nto the H-2A program to make it more responsive to the needs of \nagriculture and more user-friendly for farmers.\n  That is what the focus of immigration reform should be. Instead, the \nbill we are considering today is putting in statute what has only been \nimplied previously by the Federal Government's blind eye about illegal \nworkers: it pays to break the law.\n  This statement is truest in the agricultural section of this bill \nthan anywhere else. The amendment I have introduced is one of a series \nthat I will file that will attempt to eliminate some of the hardships \nthis bill levies on those agricultural employers who have been and will \ncontinue to utilize the legal program we have in place for temporary \nagricultural workers.\n  Currently, agricultural employers who utilize the H-2A program must \npay all workers in the occupation in which they utilize H-2A workers \nthe higher of the applicable minimum wage rate, the prevailing wage \nrate, or the adverse effect wage rate. In almost every instance, the \nadverse effect wage rate is the highest of these options.\n  Conversely, those agricultural employers who utilize an illegal \nworkforce and, are often competitors of those using the H-2A program, \nare governed by no wage floor and generally end up paying around the \nFederal minimum wage rate, sometimes less. Obviously those who utilize \nan illegal workforce have a significant competitive advantage over \ntheir H-2A user counterparts based on overhead costs due to wage rates \nalone. And those illegal workers are subject to abusive payment \npractices by some employers.\n  Historically, approval of an employer's use of non-immigrant visa-\nholding foreign workers was predicated on two things: No. 1, No U.S. \nworkers were available to fill the specific job, and No. 2, wages for \nthat occupation would not be depressed by the hiring of foreign \nworkers.\n  The obvious solution was the imposition of a prevailing wage \nrequirement for specific occupations. The prevailing wage, determined \nby surveys conducted by States, insured that available U.S. workers \nwould not be discouraged from applying for the job because it paid \nlower than usual wages. It also guaranteed that all workers, both \nforeign and domestic, would be paid a wage that was competitive in the \nlocal area, thus avoiding depressing wages for that occupation or \nmaking the use of foreign workers more attractive than hiring U.S. \nworkers.\n  At the present time, prevailing wages are required for H-1B, H-2B, \nand permanent work-related visas. However, H-2A, the agricultural \nversion of temporary, non-immigrant work visas, is required to pay a \ndifferent wage rate--the adverse effect wage rate.\n  Unlike prevailing wages, which are established for a local area for \nspecific jobs, and determined by the level of experience, skill, and \neducation they require, the adverse effect wage rate is an average of \nall wages including incentive pay, bonuses, and seniority for all farm \njobs in a multi-State region.\n  So an H-2A employer in Indiana must guarantee an H-2A worker with no \nexperience who is working on a dairy farm the same minimum wage as a \nfarm employee in Ohio with 5 years of experience operating a combine to \nharvest soybeans. Likewise, an inexperienced employee who is harvesting \nlettuce in Arizona must be guaranteed the same minimum wage as an \nexperienced greenhouse worker in New Mexico. It just doesn't make \nsense.\n  Prevailing wages are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor \nthrough its State partners, using a methodology designed to capture a \nfair wage that reflects the local standards specific to a particular \noccupation. This is currently done for H-1B and H-2B visas.\n  I might add that the new H-2C program that has been approved as part \nof this particular underlying bill and was accepted as the prevailing \nwage for that work was accepted by unanimous consent yesterday.\n  Conversely, the adverse effect wage rate is determined by a survey \nconducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of its larger \nNational Agricultural Statistics surveys. Officials in the Department \nof Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service readily admit \nthat the wage survey used for adverse effect wage rate was never \ndesigned to set specific wages--only to describe them in general. As \nsuch, the National Agricultural Statistics Service's survey creates an \nartificial, multi-state wage floor--one that significantly increases \nannually, regardless of the economy, the agricultural market, and \ncompetitive factors within a product line or local area.\n  Supporters of maintaining an adverse effect wage rate for H-2A \nworkers will tell you that it is necessary to prevent the presence of \nforeign workers from adversely affecting the wage rates of U.S. farm \nworkers. These are generally the same folks who advocate for greater \nprotections for farm workers.\n  So you can imagine my surprise when reading this bill when I found \nthat there is no mandated wage floor for those workers who are now \nillegal working in agriculture once they get on a blue card or once \nthey adjust to permanent resident status--assuming they stay in \nagriculture.\n  So while a farmer who utilizes H-2A workers in an occupation will \nhave to pay all workers in that occupation the adverse effect wage \nrate, those farmers who have been using an illegal workforce and are \nallowed to continue to use that same workforce, which is legalized \nthrough this bill, will only be bound by the applicable minimum wage.\n  This does not make the least bit of sense.\n  To give you some examples: a farmer who uses the H-2A program in \nOklahoma will have to pay his workers $8.32 per hour, while a farmer in \nthe same place who uses a newly legalized blue card worker will have to \npay only $5.15 per hour to his employees.\n  In Louisiana, an H-2A employer will have to pay $7.58 an hour to his \nworkers while a farmer who employs blue card workers will only have to \npay $5.15 per hour.\n  In Maryland, an H-2A employer must pay $8.95 an hour while a blue \ncard employer only has to pay $5.15 an hour.\n  In Nebraska, an H-2A employer must pay $9.23 an hour while an \nemployer of legalized blue card workers must pay only $5.15 an hour.\n  In Arkansas, H-2A employers must pay $7.58 an hour to their workers, \nwhile those who continue to use the previously illegal workforce pay \nonly $5.15 an hour.\n  In Arizona, H-2A employers must pay $8.00 an hour while blue card \nemployers pay only $5.15 an hour for the same work.\n  In Kansas, H-2A employers will have to pay $9.23 an hour, while \nemployers of blue card workers must pay only $5.15 an hour.\n  In Montana, H-2A employers must pay $8.47 an hour while blue card \nemployers must pay $5.15 per hour.\n  You might be asking--well what about those states that have minimum \nwages higher than the federal minimum wage? The adverse effect wage \nrate is still higher--for example, an H-2A employer in New York will \nhave to pay his workers $9.16 an hour while an\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nemployer who uses blue card workers will only have to pay $6.75 an \nhour. And in Connecticut, an H-2A employer will be mandated to pay \n$9.16 an hour while the farmer who uses blue card workers will pay \n$7.40 an hour. This is not fair to the farmers and it is not fair to \nthe workers.\n  This bill systematically rewards law-breakers and punishes those who \nhave, with some difficulty, been obeying the laws on the books today. \nThis amendment is not just about parity, though I would argue strongly \nthat it is needed--for not only will H-2A employers be mandated to pay \nhigher wages than their counterparts who use the newly legalized \nworkforce, H-2A employers will also continue to be responsible for \nproviding to their employees free housing and utilities, reimbursement \nof transportation costs, and payment of visa, consular, and border \ncrossing fees. This amendment is about what is right for agriculture, \nboth for the farmer as well as the migrant worker.\n  We know from past experience that once farm workers are legalized \nthrough an amnesty, they leave farm work. This means that the farmers \nwho use an illegal workforce today and plan to legalize their workers \nwith the blue card program in this bill will be faced with the reality \nthat the H-2A program will be the only avenue for legal workers when \nthey cannot find others to do the jobs they need in the near future. \nThe failure of the H-2A program in the past to meet the needs of \nagriculture across the nation has been based, in part, on provisions \nsuch as the adverse effect wage rate. H-2A employers simply can't \ncompete with the illegal workforce and they won't be able to compete \nwith employers of blue card workers.\n  This amendment will require that all workers in agriculture be paid \nthe higher of the applicable minimum wage and the prevailing wage rate, \nas determined by the Department of Labor.\n  This will allow the mandated wages to reflect geographic location, \noccupation, and skill level, unlike under current law and in this bill. \nIn addition, it will provide much-needed additional worker protections \nto those workers who adjust status under this bill by ensuring that \nthey are guaranteed the same wage as an H-2A worker in the same \noccupation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Let's put parity in agriculture in a temporary worker program that \nhas been on the books for decades and will work--if we can streamline \nit, if we can make it fairer for the employer, more attractive to the \nemployer to use, and at the same time fair to the employee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the hour is late. I know those at the desk, \nincluding the Chair, would like to dim the lights and say good evening. \nI will do that in just a few moments.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to debate in detail what the \nSenator from Georgia has put before the Senate as it relates to a wage \nrate for agricultural workers that is embodied within the bill that is \nbefore us in comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I must tell you that after having worked on the agriculture portion \nof this bill for nearly 5 years, and as a farmer and rancher, I totally \nagree with the Senator from Georgia, that those who were under the H-2A \nprogram and those who weren't were very different, and those who \nweren't were placing the farmer-producer who had adhered to the H-2A \nprogram at a true competitive disadvantage because of the adverse \neffect wage rate that the Senator spoke to.\n  As we work to reform and change the character of the H-2A program, \nand for those Senators who aren't quite aware of that--that is the \nagricultural portion--we recognize that the adverse affect wage was out \nof step. It was skewed in large part by comparative and competitive \ndisadvantaged margins that the Senator speaks to. The Senator has \nproposed moving to a prevailing wage, which, in my opinion, is in \nitself a minimum wage.\n  Let me make those points. What the Senator from Georgia has failed to \nsuggest is after an examination of the adverse effect wage rate and \nrecognizing the problems, we changed it dramatically. We said let's \nfreeze it at the 2003 level, January 1, which is actually the 2002 \nlevel, and keep it flat for 3 years while we adjust the agricultural \nworkplace into a true prevailing wage.\n  That is what the bill does. Let me show you what I believe the \neffects are. I will go into those in more detail on Monday because they \nare significant, and in many instances what the bill does for American \nagriculture is better than what the Senator from Georgia is \nproposing. It causes us to focus on what is appropriate and right in \nbringing about equity and balance in the agricultural workforce and in \nthat wage rate.\n\n  In 2006, the adverse effect wage rate was $8.63 an hour. This bill \ndrops it to $8.19. In 2010, $10.25 and drops it to $9.06, and many \nexamples on a State-by-State basis drop it more than that. But more \nthan dropping the wage rate down and bringing equity in it, we bring \nequity in a sense by going in and looking at it and making sure that we \neffectively change the indices, immediately upon the enactment of the \nagriculture portion known as AgJOBS of this bill.\n  In California, the wage rate will drop by 11 percent; in New \nHampshire, 13 percent; South Carolina, 13 percent; Montana, 12 percent; \nPennsylvania, 16 percent.\n  I wish the Senator would check his numbers. The numbers he talks \nabout tonight are not prevailing wage. That is minimum wage. And \nminimum wage will not stand. That is something we are all going to have \nto look at as we focus on the Chambliss amendment to see if those \nnumbers are truly accurate. I am not in any way suggesting the Senator \nis wrong, but I am suggesting those who did the research used the \nNation's lowest indices possible. I challenge those numbers. It is \nappropriate to do so.\n  By 2016, the average farm wage is projected to be $12.81 but the \nprojected adverse effect wage is $10 or down 17.5 percent below the \naverage farm wage if we look at those kinds of indices. It is important \nwe understand we are proposing significant changes in the wage rate and \nin the market.\n  The Senator is suggesting, and appropriately so, embodied within \nadverse effected wage were a variety of other things that agricultural \nproducers had to supply, in some instances, housing, or housing \ncertificates, and other types of amenities at the workplace. That will \nstill happen, whether it is a transitional blue card employment force \nor an H2-A force because, clearly, once we have transitioned the \nmodified and reformed H2-A program embodied within the bill before the \nSenate, will be the effective guest worker law portion of it dealing \nspecifically with agriculture.\n  Agriculture is a different workforce. And it is a different wage \nscale. We know that.\n  Had the Senator embodied within it the advantage of piecework, the \nadverse effect wage rate does that. Do you know some workers who are \ngetting $7 an hour, if they work piecework, get $12 an hour? It is \ntheir advantage to do is. There is a higher level of productivity when \nyou bring them all to a common denominator that goes away. There are a \nvariety of things that are critically important to look at.\n  I do not mean to suggest in any way that the numbers offered were \noffered in an untruthful way but the numbers that were provided to the \nofferor are the lowest common denominator at a minimum wage rate and \nnot the 50th medium talked about by the Department of Labor in their \nanalysis and in the establishment of an appropriate wage rate that \nwould be a true prevailing wage rate.\n  I want a prevailing wage rate. That is what the bill proposes, a \ntransitional pattern of time, a 3-year pattern of time with a frozen \nadverse effect wage rate, to move us to prevailing. The Farm Bureau \nasserts that the prevailing crop wage in Ohio ranges from $5.85 to \n$7.13 an hour. They compare this to the wage rate of $8.38 per hour \nwhich would apply during the AgJOBS wage freeze. Those are the kind of \nnumbers that were being offered this evening. However, the medium \nhourly wage, which would be the prevailing wage under the amendment \nbefore the Senate, was $8.57 for crop workers in Ohio in the data \nsourced by the Farm Bureau.\n  I am still digging into the numbers because I cannot quite understand \nit.\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nThere is a disparity that is troublesome if we are to arrive at a fair, \nresponsible, and accurate measurement to establish an effective \nprevailing wage that is fair to the worker, but more importantly, and \nas importantly, fair to the producer so that we get out of this \ncompetitive disadvantage the Senator from Georgia has recognized and \nsees as critically important.\n  In other words, if this data source represented agriculture \nprevailing wage, which in my opinion it does not, the prevailing crop \nrates I mentioned for Ohio would be at least 19 cents an hour higher \nthan the AgJOBS minimum wage even in 2006 before we tamp it down in the \nlaw. The projected Ohio prevailing crop wage in 2010, based on the data \nsource, would be $10.33 per hour compared to the AgJOBS minimum wage of \n$9.29.\n  In all sincerity, I offer to the Senator from Georgia a time for us \nto look at numbers and do some comparisons. There is a disparity. I \nknow what the bill does because the bill is accurately and effectively \nrepresented in these charts because we knew what the effected adverse \nwage was going to be, and there is a very clear projection line. What \nwe do not know are the indices given and provided as it relates to the \nChambliss amendment.\n  I will spend the weekend looking at it and looking at those numbers. \nThey do concern me. It is important we get it right, not that we want \nto treat anyone in a disadvantaged way, but what we do has to be \naccurate, it has to create stability, it has to take away the \ncompetitive disadvantage the Senator from Georgia is talking about, \nthat is real today in this disparity between those H-2A workers and, if \nyou will, the undocumented workers out there in the American workforce \nthat the provision of the bill that deals with agriculture attempts to \nget its arms around and legalize through the blue card transition \nperiod the Senator and I have spoken to.\n  It is a very important part of the bill. Both the Senator from \nGeorgia and I have been concerned for some time and have compared \nnumbers about an American agricultural work base built on a faulty \nemployment base. You cannot be working 75 percent undocumented workers \nand be wholly dependent upon them to bring the perishable crop to the \nmarket and then have them swept out from under you.\n  Yet we also know that when there is 1.2 to 1.5 million people in the \nAmerican agricultural workforce that are foreign nationals, yet \nannually, the H-2A as a program only effectively identifies 42,000 to \n45,000, something was and is dramatically wrong. That is why the \nSenator is here with his amendment. That is why I am here with a major \nreform package within the bill. We both agree that the wage part of \nthis is skewed. That is why we rolled it back dramatically and we are \nproposing establishing a prevailing wage. And he has proposed a \nprevailing wage.\n  We have to get the numbers right. I disagree with his numbers. It is \nimportant that in the effort to bring stability and equity we get them \nright.\n  I hope the Senate would get the Chambliss amendment, stay with the \nfreeze that is actually the 2002 wage scale for 3 years, while we get \nthe numbers right as it relates to the effective establishment of a \nprevailing wage.\n  In the end, I would argue that during that period of time we have \nsubstantially lessened the competitive disadvantage and improved the \noverall wage base for agricultural workers in a sense of equity and \nbalance.\n  We will be back to this amendment, I understand, Monday afternoon to \ndebate it before a vote on Monday evening at 5:30. It is a challenge \nfor all of us. More than one Senator over the course of the last week \nhas said this is a very complicated bill. And the area that Senator \nChambliss and I have ventured into is a very complicated portion of the \nbill.\n  I know what the bill does because I helped write it and spent a good \nnumber of years attempting to negotiate it. I am yet to clearly \nunderstand what I believe the Senator from Georgia is attempting to do \nas to the accuracy of his numbers and what they would mean on a State-\nby-State basis based on the indices he proposes to be used if this were \nto become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I do not intend to take but a few \nseconds to not necessarily respond to my friend from Idaho, who \ncorrectly states we have been working together in trying to solve a \nvery difficult problem relative to reform of the H-2A program. He has \nbeen at it for a long time. My first vote on this was 11 years ago as a \nMember of the House of Representatives. That is how long I have been \nworking on this issue. And we have yet to get the H-2A program \nreformed.\n  I am very hopeful, as we go through this, we will have an opportunity \nto look at the numbers. I did not even mention prevailing wage numbers \nfor Ohio or any other State. Obviously, I am happy to look at those. \nBut the numbers are what they are. And the Senator from Idaho, I \nassume, agrees with me and is going to vote with me because he said he \nwants a prevailing wage, and I am seeking to amend this bill to get a \nprevailing wage in a bill that has an adverse effect wage rate in it.\n  But seriously, the numbers are what they are. I think we can agree \nthat the prevailing wage rate is higher than the minimum wage, and it \nis less than the adverse effect wage rate today virtually in every \nState and in every location in the country. Our farmers are very much \nat a disadvantage today, and it is not like they are not willing to pay \na fair wage.\n  You are right, most of our employees work on a piece rate. They cut a \nbucket of squash, they take it to the wagon, and they get a chip. And \nthat chip may be worth $2 or it may be worth $5. That is the way most \nagricultural workers are paid: on a piece-rate basis. But there has to \nbe a floor. They have to be paid a certain amount per hour under the \nlaw, and that is the way it should be. And that is what we are going to \nbe talking about.\n  But the numbers are what they are. And the numbers speak for \nthemselves. We look forward to debating in much more detail on Monday. \nOur purpose today on both ends was simply to get the amendment laid \ndown. We will be back Monday to engage in more extensive debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 on Monday, May \n22, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Chambliss amendment \nNo. 4009; provided further that the time from 5 to 5:30 be equally \ndivided between Senator Chambliss and the Democratic manager or his \ndesignee. I further ask consent that following that vote, the Senate \nproceed immediately to a vote in relation to the Ensign amendment No. \n4076, as modified. Finally, I ask consent that no second degrees be in \norder to either amendment prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring recognition to one of \nthe most majestic places in Nevada--the Desert National Wildlife \nRefuge. On Saturday, May 20 the refuge will have been in existence for \n80 years. Established in 1936 during the Presidency of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, the Desert National Wildlife Refuge is a key part of the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System that protects sensitive lands and \nspecies throughout our great Nation.\n  Covering 1.5 million acres of the Mojave Desert in southern Nevada, \nthe Desert refuge is the largest National Wildlife Refuge in the \ncontinental United States. The Mojave Desert is known for its wide \nvariety of geology, plant life, and animal life. The Desert National \nWildlife Refuge epitomizes this diversity. It contains six different \nmountain ranges and four different habitat types. With an average \nrainfall between 4 and 15 inches, elevations ranging from 2,500 ft to \n10,000 ft, and over 300 different animal species, the\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nDesert refuge offers a truly varied landscape.\n  The Desert National Wildlife Refuge was originally established for \nthe preservation and management of Nevada's desert bighorn sheep \npopulation, which had begun to decline as early as the 1880s. The \ndesert bighorn sheep is the State animal of Nevada and, thanks in large \npart to the refuge and the work of groups such as the Fraternity of the \nDesert Bighorn and Nevada Bighorns Unlimited, our bighorn sheep \npopulation has been steadily rising in recent years.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also take a few moments to talk about \nthe incredible sheep range that runs up the east side of refuge. Rising \nnearly 10,000 feet out of the desert floor and running over 50 miles in \nlength, this mountain range has engaged the imaginations of Americans \nsince well before southern Nevada was settled. This most memorable \nnatural landmark is one of the key reasons that President Nixon \nproposed much of the refuge for wilderness designation in 1974.\n  On this occasion of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the \nDesert National Wildlife Refuge, I thank all those who have worked to \nprotect these lands. I also salute those visionary individuals--some \ngenerations ago--that recognized the need to preserve this incredible \nhabitat for desert bighorn sheep and the myriad of other species that \nstill thrive on these lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4792-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF TOYOTA MOTOR MANUFACTURING, WEST \n                                VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginians are both a prayerful and a \nprideful people. We cherish our State, honor its unique heritage, and \nrevere its citizenry. Our respect for one another and for our joint \naccomplishments is apparent in every cornr and cranny of this wondrous \nState, filled with unparalleled scenic beauty, old-fashioned \nhospitality, and a sincere commitment to excellence. Our belief in \nourselves and in our abilities is apparent when we welcome our troops \nhome from service overseas; when we watch our sons and daughters \nreceive their high school diplomas; when our communities band together \nto overcome tragedy; or when we gather together to celebrate shared and \nlofty achievement. It is always the same: Mountaineer pride runs strong \nand deep in West Virginia.\n  West Virginia pride is particularly on display today in Buffalo, WV, \nwhere Toyota Motor Manufacturing, West Virginia, TMMWV, is celebrating \nits 10th anniversary. I commend Toyota on its commitment to West \nVirginia, and I heartily congratulate the company on its celebration of \n10 years in the Mountaineer State.\n  I have seen, over the past decade, how hundreds of West Virginians \neach day have committed themselves to their work at Toyota. The high \nstandards that have been set by the men and women who work at Toyota's \nfacility in Buffalo show that our State, though small in size, \nsuccessfully plays host to one of the world's largest, most successful, \nand well-respected companies. Toyota's plant in Buffalo truly deserves \nits fine reputation, based on its gains in productivity, its high \nstandards for fine quality, and its unfailing commitment to the future.\n  Toyota Motor Manufacturing established its operations in West \nVirginia in 1996, and currently produces four-cylinder engines for the \nToyota Corolla, the Matrix, and the Pontiac Vibe. It also produces V6 \nengines for the Toyota Sienna and Solara. The plant also manufactures \nautomatic transmissions for the U.S.-built Solara, Sienna and Avalon, \nthe Canadian-built Lexus RX 350, and the Japan-built Highlander, \nproviding quality jobs for over 1,000 West Virginians. And employment \nthere is projected to grow to 1,150 workers when the existing \ntransmission plant is expanded as promised.\n  In fact, last year Toyota announced that it would undertake a $120 \nmillion expansion of its engine and transmission plant in Buffalo. As a \nresult, beginning in 2007, Toyota Motor Manufacturing in West Virginia \nwill build 240,000 additional automatic transmissions per year. This \nwill bring the plant's total automatic transmission capacity to 600,000 \nunits, and this fifth expansion by Toyota in West Virginia will bring \nits total investment there to near the $1 billion mark.\n  Every day, in Buffalo, hundreds of West Virginians commit themselves \nto superior performance. Toyota has become a highly valued member of \nthe West Virginia business community, and the company's commitment to \nits continued expansion in our State sends a clear message to the world \nnot only that West Virginia's workforce is top of the line, but also \nthat communities throughout West Virginia make our State a beacon for \nbusiness, including international investment. The employment provided \nby Toyota at Buffalo constitutes exactly the type of well-paying jobs, \nwith accompanying health and pension benefits, that West Virginia \nworkers so richly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to once again \ncongratulate Toyota on its 10th anniversary in West Virginia. I thank \nDr. Toyoda for believing in West Virginia. I also congratulate Toyota \nMotor Manufacturing, West Virginia President Yutaka Mizuno and the men \nand women of this plant for its all of its truly spectacular \nachievements in its first decade in our fair State.\n  I would also like to thank my dear friend and colleague, Senator Jay \nRockefeller, who worked so tirelessly and in such good faith to bring \nToyota to West Virginia. Jay and I, and all West Virginians, are \npleased and proud to have Toyota in Buffalo, WV. May this be the first \nof many more decades of partnership and accomplishment for our State \nand for Toyota Motor Manufacturing.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Toyota Motor \nManufacturing of Indiana, on celebrating the 10th anniversary of its \ntruck assembly plant in Princeton. Since opening its doors 10 years \nago, Toyota's Princeton plant has spurred economic growth in southwest \nIndiana and brought quality, good-paying jobs to the State, giving more \nworkers the opportunity to provide for their families and live the \nAmerican dream.\n  When I was Governor, I was proud to join with Toyota Motor \nCorporation, TMC, Chairman Hiroshi Okuda in bringing the Toyota truck \nassembly plant to Princeton as part of my economic development for a \ngrowing economy, EDGE, initiative. Over the past 10 years, Toyota's \nPrinceton plant has experienced remarkable growth, which has had a \nsubstantial, positive economic impact on the State of Indiana as well \nas the local economy.\n  Toyota's initial investment of $700 million in the Princeton assembly \nplant led to the immediate creation of 1,300 family-wage jobs and \nresulted in the production of approximately 100,000 trucks per year. \nToday, Toyota's investment has grown to more than $2.6 billion, and its \ntruck assembly plant now employs more than 4,700 men and women who \nproduce more than 300,000 vehicles each year, including the Tundra \nfull-size pickup truck, Sequoia sport utility vehicle, and Sienna \nminivan.\n  This exceptional growth and the recent announcement of Toyota's \ncollaboration with Subaru in Lafayette have made it one of Indiana's \nlargest auto manufacturers. Toyota's efforts demonstrate its continued \ncommitment to the State and highlight the contributions Toyota has made \nto the United States and local communities in Indiana.\n  It is estimated that Toyota's annual economic impact on the State of \nIndiana is equal to about 31,385 jobs, nearly $503 million in employee \ncompensation, and $5.5 billion in business sales. A study conducted by \nthe University of Evansville and the University of Southern Indiana \nestimates that in Gibson County alone, Toyota is annually responsible \nfor 8,865 jobs, approximately $119 million in employee compensation, \nand $519 million in business sales.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to enter this tribute in the \nCongressional Record of the Senate and commend Toyota Motor \nManufacturing of Indiana for all that it has done for Hoosier working \nmen and women over the past 10 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4792-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4792-S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DAY OF PRAYER FOR COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. This Sunday, members of Lutheran World Relief, in \nconjunction with churches and people of faith, will pray for a peaceful \nresolution to the conflict in Colombia. Lutheran World Relief advocates \nfor those\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\naround the world suffering from poverty, hunger, or injustice. It is a \nvoice for the most vulnerable worldwide, and this weekend Lutheran \nWorld Relief will shine a bright light on the current situation in \nColombia.\n  For over 40 years, Colombia has been engulfed in a civil conflict \npitting guerrilla groups again the Colombian Government. As a result, \ninnocent civilians have been kidnapped and ransomed; illicit coca \nproduction and drug trafficking continue to plague the country; and \nthousands have died or have been forced from their homes in order to \nflee violence.\n  The United States has provided assistance to Colombia, both military \nand economic, in order to stem the illegal trade in drugs and promote a \npeaceful resolution to the civil conflict. However, Colombia remains \nthe leading supplier of the world's cocaine, and it is home to at least \nthree illegally armed groups that have been designated foreign \nterrorist organizations by the U.S. Department of State. Without \nquestion, Congress must assist countries in eradicating drug crops and \ncombating terrorism. However, we must also remember that societies are \nbased on the rule of law, and human rights must be respected. We should \nnot sacrifice one goal in order to achieve another.\n  Lutheran churches in South Dakota an around the Nation are in \nsolidarity with peace communities in Colombia. I commend Lutheran \nparishioners and worshippers of other faiths, as they pray for peace \nand remember all those who have perished in the conflict. As a Lutheran \nmyself, I believe protecting human rights in Colombia must remain a \nhigh priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF LEONIDAS RALPH MECHAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Leonidas \nRalph Mecham, who recently retired after more than 20 years as Director \nof the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. As that agency's \nlongest-serving Director, Ralph ably guided the judiciary through some \nturbulent and challenging times, and for such he deserves the praise \nand commendation of this body.\n  Ralph Mecham was born on April 23, 1928, in Murray, UT. He earned a \nbachelor's degree with highest honors from the University of Utah, a \nlaw degree from George Washington University, and a master's degree in \npublic administration from Harvard University. Ralph's first stint here \nin Washington began more than 50 years ago, when he served as a \nlegislative assistant and administrative assistant to Senator Wallace \nBennett of Utah, the father of our colleague Senator Bob Bennett. Ralph \nreturned to our State to serve as vice president of his alma mater, the \nUniversity of Utah, where he also taught constitutional law and was \nresponsible for creating the University of Utah Research Park.\n  Ralph could not stay away from Washington and returned to serve as \nSpecial Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce. In July 1985, Chief \nJustice Warren Burger appointed him Director of the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts. The Administrative Office provides internal \nadministrative support to the judicial branch and communicates on \nbehalf of the judiciary with Congress, the executive branch, and the \npublic.\n  Ralph served in this capacity during a particularly challenging time \nfor the judiciary. Providing effective judicial administration in the \nface of budgetary constraints is difficult when the Federal judiciary's \ncaseload continues its upward spiral. Cases filed in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals, for example, more than doubled during Ralph's time as \nDirector. The number of bankruptcy cases skyrocketed from 365,000 to \nover 1,780,000 in that same period. In addition, national tragedies \nsuch as the terrorist attacks of September 11, as well as catastrophes \nsuch as Hurricane Katrina, created their own unique challenges to the \ncontinued functioning of the judiciary. Ralph met each challenge \neffectively. His extensive background in public administration and \nexperience in both the legislative and executive branches served him \nwell in equipping the judicial branch for its critical tasks even \nthrough these challenges and troubled times.\n  Ralph also helped guide the judicial branch through a period of \nincreased public attention and even criticism regarding judicial \ndecisions. Protecting judicial independence while also enhancing public \nunderstanding of the function of judges in our system of government is \njust the kind of balancing act Ralph was prepared to tackle. He did so \neffectively with a steady hand.\n  The Director of the Administrative Office serves as secretary of the \nJudicial Conference and as a member of its executive committee. The \njudges who chaired the executive committee during Ralph's tenure also \nhave praised his work.\n  The current executive committee chairman, U.S. District Judge Thomas \nF. Hogan, says that ``[w]atching Ralph operate is like watching a \nmaster conductor guide the philharmonic orchestra through a complicated \nBach symphony.'' If only this could be said of us Senators and our work \non our committees or on this floor.\n  Judge Carolyn Dineen King, Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit, chaired \nthe executive committee from 2002 to 2005. In tackling a wide range of \nproblems, she says, ``Director Mecham exhibited his usual \ninventiveness, intensity, tenacity, and judgment and his remarkable \nability to inspire others . . . to do the very best they were capable \nof.''\n  Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit chaired the executive committee from 1987 to 1989. He has said \nthat ``Ralph handled this difficult job with confidence, competence and \ndedication. It is a testament to his hard work and dedication that \ntoday the federal courts to a large extent so successfully manage their \nown resources and operations.''\n  Judge Ralph K. Winter, also a former Chief Judge of the Second \nCircuit, chaired the executive committee a decade later, from 1999 to \n2000. He believed that Ralph showed ``a remarkable capacity for keeping \nthe long view in mind while putting out the short-term fires that would \nrelentlessly pop up in various directions.''\n  Perhaps the best applause for Ralph Mecham's leadership comes from \nSixth Circuit Judge Gilbert Merritt, who chaired the executive \ncommittee from 1994 to 1996. ``The judiciary is in much better shape \nadministratively than it was 20 years ago.'' Whether in our families, \nour communities, or our work, we should each strive to leave those in \nour charge better off than we found them.\n  I was pleased to hear that Ralph recently received the 2006 National \nPublic Service Award in recognition of his excellence in a half-century \nof public service. The award announcement noted his support for the \nJudicial Conference by providing high-quality services to judges and \nthe courts, and by building relationships both inside and outside the \njudiciary.\n  Ralph Mecham has been married to the former Barbara Folsom for more \nthan 55 years. With 5 children and 14 grandchildren, he is a devoted \nfamily man. Ralph has served in various positions in church and \ncommunity, including time as a missionary in Great Britain, chairman of \nthe Utah State Heart Association, chairman of the Salt Lake County \nCancer Association, and chairman of the University of Utah National \nAdvisory Council. His commitment to the community and to his church \ncontinues.\n  The judicial branch and the country are better because of Ralph's \nservice. I want to commend him for his commitment and for setting a \ngood example of public service. His record tells me that, even in \nsupposed retirement, Ralph Mecham will continue helping and serving \nthose around him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4793-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4793-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4794-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the automobile fuel economy provisions of \ntitle 49, United States Code, to reform the setting and calculation of \nfuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy, CAFE, Program Reform Act of 2006. I am pleased to \nbe joined in this effort by Senator Pryor, who serves on the Commerce \nCommittee with me.\n  Since being introduced in the 1970s, CAFE standards have been \ncontroversial. The effectiveness of these standards is often debated as \nis their effect on safety, consumer choice, and the automobile \nindustry.\n  CAFE became so controversial that it essentially was frozen for many \nyears.\n  The stand-off over CAFE finally eased a little bit when a \nCongressionally commissioned National Academy of Sciences review of the \nCAFE program was released in 2002. Although that study found that CAFE \nhad in fact reduced energy consumption, the Academy was critical of how \nthe program was structured and found that there was a negative impact \non safety.\n  Just this spring, the Department of Transportation issued new \nreformed CAFE rules for pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs. This rule is a \nradical departure from prior CAFE rules in that it applies different \nstandards to different sized vehicles rather than a uniform standard \nacross the whole fleet. The Department's approach addresses many of the \ncriticisms in the academy's study.\n  The recent rule did not, however, include new standards for cars. \nThose standards have been the same since 1984 and there is considerable \nlegal ambiguity about the secretary's ability to increase the existing \nstandards. It is clear, however, that the law does not allow the \nsecretary to ``reform'' CAFE standards for cars, since that part of the \nstatute is written differently than for light trucks.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and \nMerchant Marine, I held a hearing on reforming CAFE standards last \nweek. We heard from Secretary Mineta, as well as the automobile \nindustry, safety advocates, and fuel economy experts. After listening \nto what our witnesses had to say, I am convinced that ``reform'' is a \nnecessary approach.\n  After that hearing, Secretary Mineta transmitted legislation to \nCongress asking for the authority to reform CAFE standards.\n  The bill we are introducing today is very straightforward. The main \nfeature of the legislation is that it gives the Secretary of \nTransportation the authority to reform the CAFE program in a manner \nsimilar to the rule that he issued for light trucks. The bill puts the \nresponsibility of setting CAFE standards where it belongs--and that is \nwith the scientists and technical experts at the Department of \nTransportation.\n  The reformed CAFE program authorized by this legislation will address \nmany of the past criticisms. For example, the legislation specifies \nthat the Secretary must take motor vehicle safety into consideration \nwhen developing new CAFE standards. The legislation also allows the \ntrading of CAFE credits between a manufacturer's passenger car and \nlight truck fleets. This gives manufacturers the flexibility to \nincrease CAFE where it is most cost effective to do so.\n  Let me briefly address one issue that is potentially controversial. \nThat is the issue of what is being called ``backsliding.'' The concern \nis that under a reformed CAFE program, manufacturers could simply stop \nmanufacturing some of their smaller cars since these cars are no longer \nneeded to ``average out'' the larger, less fuel efficient models. The \nmanufacturer's overall fuel economy average could then end up\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nbeing below where it is presently. Although this is very unlikely to \nhappen and that isn't the intent of a ``reformed'' CAFE system, I \nunderstand the concern. Senator Pryor and I have included a provision \nin our legislation to address that problem. I know that there are many \nopinions on how to deal with this backsliding issue, and some people \nmay not feel that our approach is strong enough. On the other hand, if \nthe provision is too strict then the benefits of reform are potentially \nwiped out.\n  In the past, many in Congress have played politics with CAFE--\noffering bills that try to set unrealistically high or arbitrary CAFE \nstandards. On the other side are those that have simply opposed doing \nanything. This has resulted in a stalemate and lots of finger pointing. \nI hope this doesn't happen again, because we really do need to get \ntougher standards in place as soon as we can.\n  Senator Pryor and I are committed to improving the fuel economy of \nour vehicles without reducing safety and reliability or losing jobs. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, to introduce legislation to \nreform and raise the corporate average fuel economy standard for the \nfirst time since its inception over 30 years ago.\n  In 1975 this body passed, as a part of the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act, the very first fuel economy standards for our \npassenger car fleet, setting a standard that all manufacturers must \nachieve 27.5 miles per gallon. This was done in response to the first \noil embargo and the energy crisis of the early 1970s. Americans \nrealized for the first time that we as a nation must set and achieve \nattainable goals for energy conservation, not only for our economic \nsecurity but also for our national security.\n  At that time, the fuel economy of passenger cars averaged around 14 \nmiles per gallon. Ten years after CAFE was enacted, the fuel economy of \npassenger cars had almost doubled, saving an estimated 2.8 million \nbarrels of oil a day. There can be no doubts as to the benefits of the \noriginal CAFE standard. Still 20 years after reaching this peak around \n1985, the fuel economy of the Nation's passenger car fleet has \nstagnated. Some have even argued the fleet of vehicles entering the \nmarketplace today gets less fuel economy than those models in 1985. \nWhile fuel efficient technology has improved over the years, the fuel \neconomy of the Nation's passenger fleet has not. Also today, our \ndependence on oil is greater than ever before. This dependence has \ncomplicated decisions we make as a country, such as foreign policy \ndecisions, and as individuals, such as whether or not to fill up your \ngas tank or buy groceries.\n  I believe we must do better for families in Arkansas and around the \nNation. We must protect our national security by reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil and uncomplicating our foreign policy \ndecision-making in oil-rich regions. We must protect the environment by \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. We must reduce the cost of \ntransportation for consumers. We must begin implementing more stringent \nCAFE standards now before these problems worsen. Gasoline is over 70 \ncents higher than this time last year, and the number of miles driven \nby every American over the age of 16 has risen over 60 percent since \n1970--and is continuing to climb at a rapid pace.\n  This is why I have joined my colleague and worked in a bipartisan \nmanner to introduce comprehensive CAFE reform. For over 30 years the \noriginal CAFE standard has remained in place while a rapidly advancing \nmarketplace and rapidly advancing technology have left it behind. Each \ntime fuel economy standards have been debated in this body, they have \nbeen mired in partisan politics resulting in nothing but stalemate.\n  Senator Lott and I are choosing progress over politics with our \ncommon sense legislation, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Reform Act \nof 2006. The bill will help accomplish our national security and energy \nconservation goals while preserving motor vehicle safety, American \nmanufacturing jobs, and consumer choice for vehicles.\n  Specifically, it will clarify the authority of the Secretary of \nTransportation to raise and reform CAFE standards. It requires the \nSecretary to begin the reform process within 60 days in addition to \nrequiring the Secretary to complete an expedited rulemaking to \nimmediately amend the current CAFE standard before a reformed standard \ntakes effect.\n  For the first time, it will require the Secretary to consider \ngreenhouse gas emissions when promulgating a CAFE standard as well as \nrequire the Secretary to obtain comments from the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency on the impact of any new rule on the \nenvironment.\n  Our legislation also gives automobile manufacturers more flexibility \nin the way they can apply CAFE credits in order to help them preserve \nAmerican jobs. It preserves the 18-month lead time required before the \nSecretary can issue more stringent CAFE standards. It also allows the \nSecretary to use the fines collected for violations of the CAFE \nstandard for research and development of fuel saving technologies and \nto conduct CAFE rulemakings. Finally, our bill provides a backstop fuel \neconomy average which no manufacturer can go below, regardless of their \nfleet mix.\n  There is no silver bullet in accomplishing our national security and \nenergy goals, and we must seek short-term alternatives in addition to \nlong-term solutions. CAFE reform is one part of a long-term solution to \nreduce our dependence on oil, but it is one that can have lasting \nimpact. Still, I believe for the long-term security of our country, \nthis is as good a place as any to start. We must start now.\n  I thank my colleague from the Commerce Committee, Senator Lott, for \nhis hard work on this bipartisan legislation. I look forward to working \nwith him and the rest of my colleagues to ensure that this reform \nbecomes law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Graham, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2831. A bill to guarantee the free flow of information to the \npublic through a free and active press while protecting the right of \nthe public to effective law enforcement and the fair administration of \njustice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the bill at the desk is introduced on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Specter, Dodd, Graham, and Schumer. I am \npleased to join my good friends and colleagues, Senators Specter and \nDodd, in introducing a revised version of the Free Flow of Information \nAct.\n  I believe that the free flow of information essential element of \ndemocracy. In order for the United States to foster the spread of \nfreedom and democracy globally, it is incumbent that we first support \nan open and free press nationally. The role of the media as a conduit \nbetween government and the citizens it serves must not be devalued.\n  Unfortunately, the free flow of information to citizens of the United \nStates is inhibited. Over 30 reporters were recently served or \nthreatened with jail sentences in at least four different Federal \njurisdictions for refusing to reveal confidential sources. I fear the \nend result of such actions is that many whistleblowers will refuse to \ncome forward and reporters will be unable to provide our constituents \nwith information they have a right to know.\n  In 1972, the Supreme Court held in Branzburg v. Hayes, that reporters \ndid not have an absolute privilege as third party witnesses to protect \ntheir sources from prosecutors. Since Branzburg, every State and the \nDistrict of Columbia, excluding Wyoming has created a privilege for \nreporters not to reveal their confidential sources. My own State of \nIndiana provides qualified reporters an absolute protection from having \nto reveal any such information in court.\n  The Federal courts of appeals, however, have an incongruent view of \nthis matter. Each circuit has addressed the question of the privilege \nin a different manner. Some circuits allow the privilege in one \ncategory of cases, while others, have expressed skepticism about \nwhether any privilege exists at all.\n  Congress should clarify the extraordinary differences of opinion in \nthe Federal courts of appeals and the effect they have on undermining \nthe general policy of protection already in place among the States. \nLikewise, the ambiguity between official Department of Justice rules \nand unofficial criteria used to secure media subpoenas is unacceptable.\n  There is an urgent need for Congress to state clear and concise \npolicy guidance.\n  Senators Specter, Dodd, and I have introduced legislation today that \npreserves the free flow of information to the public by providing the \npress the ability to obtain and protect confidential sources. It \nprovides journalists with certain rights and abilities to sources and \nreport appropriate information without fear of intimidation or \nimprisonment. This bill sets national standards, based on Department of \nJustice guidelines, for subpoenas issued to reporters by the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\n  Our legislation promotes greater transparency of government, \nmaintains the ability of the courts to operate effectively, and \nprotects the whistleblowers that identify government or corporate \nmisdeeds and protect national security.\n  It is also important to note what this legislation does not do. The \nlegislation does not permit rule breaking, give reporters a license to \nbreak the law, or permit reporters to interfere with crimes prevention \nefforts. Furthermore, the Free Flow of Information Act does not weaken \nnational security nor restrict law enforcement. Additional protections \nhave been added to this bill to ensure that information will be \ndisclosed in cases where the guilt or innocence of a criminal is in \nquestion, in cases where a reporter was an eye witness to a crime, and \nin cases where the information is critical to prevent death or bodily \nharm. The national security exception and continued strict standards \nrelating to classified information will ensure that reporters are \nprotected while maintaining an avenue for prosecution and disclosure \nwhen considering the defense of our country.\n  Reporters Without Borders has reported that more than 100 journalists \nare currently in jail around the world, with more than half in China, \nCuba, and Burma. This is not good company for the United States of \nAmerica. Global public opinion is always on the lookout to advertise \nperceived American double standards.\n  I believe that passage of this bill would have positive diplomatic \nconsequences. This legislation not only confirms America's \nconstitutional commitment to press freedom, it also advances President \nBush's American foreign policy initiatives to promote and protect \ndemocracy. When we support the development of free and independent \npress organizations worldwide, it is important to maintain these ideals \nat home.\n  In conclusion, I thank, again, my colleagues, Senator Specter, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Dodd for \ntheir tireless work on this issue. With their assistance, I look \nforward to working with each of my colleagues to ensure that the free \nflow of information is unimpeded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Lugar, \nthe principal sponsor, and Senators Dodd, Graham, and Schumer on the \nintroduction of legislation which will codify a reporter's privilege, \nsomething that is very necessary. The matter came into sharp focus \nrecently with the contempt citation and the incarceration of New York \nTimes reporter, Judith Miller, for some 85 days. The Judiciary \nCommittee held two hearings on this subject. Senator Lugar, with \nCongressman Pence in the House, introduced legislation which has formed \nthe nucleus of the bill we are introducing today.\n  The Branzburg v. Hayes case, 33 years ago, which was a 5-to-4 \ndecision, with a concurring opinion by Justice Powell, has led to what \nis accurately called a ``crazy quilt'' situation in the circuits--five \ncircuits going one way, four circuits going another way, and laws \nunsettled in some circuits. This bill, modeled significantly after the \nDepartment of Justice regulations, will codify this important issue.\n  There is an exception on reporter's privilege for national security \ncases. Keeping in mind the incarceration of Judith Miller, this bill \nmakes a sharp distinction between national security and an inquiry in \nthe grand jury for obstruction of justice or perjury. As a prosecutor \nin the past, I have great appreciation for the offenses of obstruction \nof justice and perjury. But in my judgment, they do not rise to the \nlevel of importance as a national security case. When a special \nprosecutor's investigation shifts from the disclosure of a CIA agent, \nto a question of obstruction of justice, it is a very different \nsituation. This bill would not permit, would not compel the disclosure \nof a source for obstruction of justice or perjury, but would compel the \ndisclosure of a source for a national security case.\n  This legislation has the endorsement of 39 of the major media \norganizations in the United States: The New York Times, the Washington \nPost, the Associated Press, Time, Hearst Corporation, Philadelphia \nInquirer, Newspaper Association of America, ABC, NBC, and CBS. It goes \na long way to protecting sources, but it also leaves latitude, in the \nform of a balancing test, for Federal prosecutors to gain information \nunder limited circumstances for plaintiffs and defendants in civil \ncases to have access to sources. And, it does not have a shield if a \nreporter is a witness to some criminal incident.\n  In recent months, there has been a growing consensus that we need to \nestablish a Federal journalists' privilege to protect the integrity of \nthe newsgathering process--a process that depends on the free flow of \ninformation between journalists and whistleblowers, as well as other \nconfidential sources. I do not reach this conclusion lightly. The \nJudiciary Committee held two separate hearings in which it heard from \nsixteen witnesses. Included in this number were seven journalists, six \nattorneys, including current or former prosecutors and some of the \nNation's most distinguished experts on the first amendment.\n  These witnesses demonstrated that there are two vital, competing \nconcerns at stake. On one hand, reporters cite the need to maintain \nconfidentiality in order to ensure that sources will speak openly and \nfreely with the news media. The renowned William Safire, former \ncolumnist for the New York Times, testified that ``the essence of news \ngathering is this: if you don't have sources you trust and who trust \nyou, then you don't have a solid story--and the public suffers for \nit.'' Reporter Matthew Cooper of Time magazine said this to the \nCommittee: ``As someone who relies on confidential sources all the \ntime, I simply could not do my job reporting stories big and small \nwithout being able to speak with officials under varying degrees of \nanonymity.''\n  On the other hand, the public has a right to effective law \nenforcement and fair trials. Our judicial system needs access to \ninformation in order to prosecute crime and to guarantee fair \nadministration of the law for plaintiffs and defendants alike. As a \nJustice Department representative told the committee, prosecutors need \nto ``maintain the ability, in certain vitally important circumstances, \nto obtain information identifying a source when a paramount interest is \nat stake. For example, obtaining source information may be the only \navailable means of preventing a murder, locating a kidnapped child, or \nidentifying a serial arsonist.''\n  As Federal courts considered such competing interests, they adopted \nrules that went in several different directions. Rather than a clear, \nuniform standard for deciding claims of journalist privilege, the \nFederal courts currently observe a ``crazy quilt'' of different \njudicial standards.\n  The current confusion began 33 years ago, when the Supreme Court \ndecided Branzburg v. Hayes. The Court held that the press's first \namendment right to publish information does not include a right to keep \ninformation secret from a grand jury investigating a criminal matter. \nThe Supreme Court also held that the common law did not exempt \nreporters from the duty of every citizen to provide information to a \ngrand jury.\n  The Court reasoned that just as newspapers and journalists are \nsubject to the same laws and restrictions as other citizens, they are \nalso subject to the same duty to provide information to a court as \nother citizens. However, Justice Powell, who joined the 5-4 majority, \nwrote a separate concurrence in which he explained that the Court's \nholding was not an invitation for the government to harass journalists. \nIf a journalist could show that the grand jury investigation was being \nconducted in bad faith, the journalist could ask the court to quash the \nsubpoena. Justice Powell indicated that courts might assess such claims \non a case-by-case basis by balancing the freedom of the press against \nthe obligation to give testimony relevant to criminal conduct.\n\n  In attempting to apply Justice Powell's concurring opinion, Federal \ncourts have split on the question of when a journalist is required to \ntestify. In the 33 years since Branzburg, the Federal courts are split \nin at least three ways in their approaches to Federal criminal and \ncivil cases.\n  With respect to Federal criminal cases, five circuits--the first, \nfourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh circuits--have\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\napplied Branzburg so as to not allow journalists to withhold \ninformation absent governmental bad faith. Four other circuits--the \nsecond, third, ninth, and eleventh circuits--recognize a qualified \nprivilege, which requires courts to balance the freedom of the press \nagainst the obligation to provide testimony on a case-by-case basis. \nThe law in the District of Columbia Circuit is unsettled.\n  With respect to Federal civil cases, nine of the twelve circuits \napply a balancing test when deciding whether journalists must disclose \nconfidential sources. One circuit affords journalists no privilege in \nany context. Two other circuits have yet to decide whether journalists \nhave any privilege in civil cases. Meanwhile, 49 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia have recognized a privilege within their own \njurisdictions. Thirty-one States plus the District of Columbia have \npassed some form of reporter's shield statute, and 18 States have \nrecognized a privilege at common law.\n  There is little wonder that there is a growing consensus concerning \nthe need for a uniform journalists' privilege in Federal courts. This \nsystem must be simplified.\n  Today, we are taking the first step to resolving this problem by \nintroducing the Free Flow of Information Act. This bill draws upon 33 \nyears of experience, as embodied in the Department of Justice's \nregulations, the law established by the Federal courts of appeals, \nState statutes, and existing national security provisions. The purpose \nof this bill is to guarantee the flow of information to the public \nthrough a free and active press, while protecting the public's right to \neffective law enforcement and individuals' rights to the fair \nadministration of justice.\n  This bill provides ample protection for the Nation's journalists, as \ndemonstrated by the fact that it has been endorsed by 39 news \norganizations identified in a list I will include at the end of my \nremarks.\n  This bill also provides ample protection to the public's interest in \nlaw enforcement and fair trials. In drafting this legislation, we \nstarted with what works. Both the Department of Justice and the vast \nmajority of journalists with whom we have met--in individual meetings \nand over the course of two hearings--have generally voiced strong \nsupport for the regulations that the Department of Justice currently \napplies to all of its prosecutors. Moreover, time has proven that these \nregulations are workable. The Department of Justice has been \neffectively prosecuting cases under these regulations for 25 years and \na majority of State prosecutors carry out their duties under similar \nstatutes.\n\n  I have two concerns with the Department's regulations, however. \nFirst, under current law, these regulations do not apply to special \nprosecutors. Special prosecutors are often called upon in cases that \nare politically sensitive, may potentially be embarrassing to senior \ngovernment officials, and are high profile--those cases that seem to \ncarry the greatest risk of an overzealous prosecutor needlessly \nsubpoenaing journalists.\n  Second, the Department regulations are presently enforced by the \nAttorney General, not a neutral court of law. This places the Attorney \nGeneral in a difficult position; namely, the primary check on Federal \nprosecutors' ability to subpoena journalists is the nation's highest \nFederal prosecutor. Most Americans, I believe, would feel more \ncomfortable having the competing interests weighed by a neutral judge \ninstead of a political appointee who answers to the President. \nAccordingly, this bill, in large part, codifies the Department of \nJustice's regulations into law; applies them to all Federal \nprosecutors, including special prosecutors; and provides that the \ncourts, not a political official, shall decide whether the public's \nneed for information outweighs the interest in allowing a journalist to \nprotect a confidential source.\n  The Free Flow of Information Act addresses two additional areas of \nconsiderable confusion and concern. First, it addresses the situation \nof a criminal defendant who subpoenas a journalist. To ensure that \nevery criminal defendant has a fair trial, a criminal defendant has \nless of a burden than a prosecutor does, to show that the journalist's \nprivilege should be waived. This is consistent with our long standing \nbelief as a nation that a criminal defendant must be given ample \nopportunity to defend himself.\n  Second, it addresses private civil litigation. This bill provides \nthat before a private party may subpoena a journalist in a civil suit, \nthe court must find that the party is not trying to harass or punish \nthe journalist, and that the public interest requires disclosure. \nAgain, this should help clarify the existing law in federal courts.\n\n  Finally, the Free Flow of Information Act adds layers of safeguards \nfor the public. Reporters are not allowed to withhold information if a \nfederal court concludes that the information is important to the \ndefense of our Nation's security or is needed to prevent or stop a \ncrime that could lead to death or physical injury. Also, the bill \nensures that both crime victims and criminal defendants will have a \nfair hearing in court. Under this bill, a journalist who is an \neyewitness to a crime or takes part in a crime may not withhold that \ninformation. Journalists should not be permitted to hide from the law \nby writing a story and then claiming a reporter's privilege.\n  It is time to simplify the patchwork of court decisions and \nlegislation that has grown over the last three decades. It is time for \nCongress to clear up the ambiguities journalists and the Federal \njudicial system face in balancing the protections journalists need in \nproviding confidential information to the public with the ability of \nthe courts to conduct fair and accurate trials. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and help create a fair and efficient means to \nserve journalists and the news media, prosecutors and the courts, and \nmost importantly the public interest on both ends of the spectrum.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the list of organizations and \ncompanies that support the legislation in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations/Companies Supporting ``Free Flow of Information Act of \n                                 2006''\n\n       ABC Inc.; Advance Publications, Inc.; American Business \n     Media; American Society of Newspaper Editors; Associated \n     Press; Association of American Publishers, Inc.; Association \n     of Capitol Reporters and Editors; Belo Corp.; CBS; CNN; \n     Coalition of Journalists for Open Government; The Copley \n     Press, Inc., Court TV; Cox Enterprises, Inc.; Freedom \n     Communication, Inc.; Gannett Co., Inc.; The Hearst \n     Corporation; Magazine Publishers of America; The McClatchy \n     Company; The McGraw-Hill Companies.\n       Media Law Resources Center; National Newspaper Association; \n     Nation Press Photographers Association; National Public \n     Radio; NBC Universal; News Corporation; Newspaper Association \n     of America; Newsweek; The New York Times Company; Radio-\n     Television News Directors Association; Raycom Media, Inc.; \n     The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press; E.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me express my gratitude to my colleague \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar, and his colleague from Indiana, \nCongressman Pence, and his colleague, Congressman Boucher of Virginia, \nwho are drafting similar legislation and propose similar legislation in \nthe other body and, of course, Senator Specter, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, and \nthe Presiding Officer for their work on pulling together this bill \nwhich is a very sound proposal. As the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexplained, it deals with an issue that many were concerned about, and \nthat is the national security question.\n  The point I would like to make is that while this is about \njournalists and the collection of information and revealing stories \nthat might otherwise not be told, the real winners of this proposal are \nnot journalists or news media outlets, television stations, or the \nlike. The real winners are the people we represent, our constituents, \nand the consumers of information. This is most important for them. It \nis really not that significant. If it were only about journalists, \nfrankly, we might have second questions about it.\n  Jefferson, of course, said it better than anyone many years ago when \nhe said if he had to choose between a free country and a free press, he \nwould select the latter. Madison, on the same\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nsubject, talking about freedom of information, freedom of the press, \nhad this quote:\n\n       Popular government without popular information or the means \n     of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce, or tragedy, or \n     perhaps both.\n\n  Today, that fundamental principle--that a well-informed citizenry is \nthe cornerstone of self-government--is at risk in a manner in which it \nhas not been at risk previously.\n  In the past year alone, some two dozen reporters have been subpoenaed \nor questioned about their confidential sources. Most of theme face \nfines or prison time. Seven have already been held in contempt. One has \nbeen jailed. Another was found guilty of criminal contempt for refusing \nto reveal a confidential source and served 6 months under house arrest. \nWhy? Because they received information from confidential sources and \npledged to protect the confidentiality of those sources. In other \nwords, they have committed the ``offense'' of being journalists.\n  These actions by our Government against journalists are having a \nprofound impact on news gathering. For example, in testimony last \nsummer before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Norman Pearlstine, the \neditor in chief of Time, Inc., said this about the fallout from the \nJustice Department's efforts to obtain confidential information from a \nTime reporter:\n\n       Valuable sources have insisted that they no longer trusted \n     the magazine and that they would no longer cooperate on \n     stories. The chilling effect is obvious.\n\n  Confidential evidence may be just the tip of the iceberg. We have no \nway of knowing for certain the number of journalists who have been \nordered or requested to reveal confidential sources. We can only \nspeculate as to how many editors and publishers put the brakes on a \nstory for fear that it could land one of their reporters in a spider \nweb spun by the Federal prosecutors that could include prison. If \ncitizens with knowledge of wrongdoing could not or would not come \nforward to share what they know in confidence with members of the \npress, serious journalism would cease to exist, in my view. Serious \nwrongs would remain unexposed. The scandals known as Watergate, the \nEnron failure, the Abu Ghraib prison photos--none of these would have \nbeen known to the public but for good journalists doing their work.\n  That scenario is no longer purely hypothetical. It is, in some \nrespects, already a reality. When journalists are hauled into court by \nprosecutors and threatened with fines and imprisonment if they don't \ndivulge the sources of their information, we are entering a dangerous \nterritory for a democracy. That is when not only journalists, but \nordinary citizens, will fear prosecution simply for exposing \nwrongdoing. When that happens, the information our citizens need to \nremain sovereign will be degraded, making it more and more difficult to \nhold accountable those in power. When the public's right to know is \nthreatened, then I suggest to you that all of the liberties we hold \ndear are threatened, as well.\n  Again, I thank Senator Specter for working out this compromise, and I \nemphasize that the issue of national security, which was a very \nlegitimate concern, has been handled by this proposal. The underlying \nissue is the right of citizens to have access to important information \nthat might otherwise never become available were it not for the ability \nto have confidential sources share that information and the ability of \nthese journalists to protect the confidentiality of those sources. \nThirty-nine States have provisions dealing with the shield law. I think \n10 States have regulations regarding the same matter.\n  I think it is long overdue that the Federal Government have a similar \npiece of legislation to protect the kind of information we seek. I \ncommend my colleagues for their efforts in this regard. I am happy to \njoin them.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say with regard to what has just taken \nplace, these are complex areas, and we need to be careful about \nprotecting our free speech rights. Nobody denies that. But you have to \nbe careful, too. I was thinking that if a spy comes into our country \nand gets secure information and gives it to our enemy, we put him in \njail, and they can be convicted, I guess, of treason. If a reporter \ngets information and publishes it to our enemies and to the whole \nworld, they get the Pulitzer prize.\n  I think we have to be careful about how we word this. I am sure we \nwill come up with a pretty good solution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSchumer be recognized for 4 minutes to speak on the Lugar-Specter-Dodd \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join as a cosponsor of the bill just \nintroduced because I think it really cuts the Gordian knot. There has \nbeen a deadlock on improving the shield law for the very reason that \nnot all disclosures by Government officials to members of the press are \nequal. We certainly want to protect a whistleblower. We certainly want \na person, if they work at the FDA and see that tests are being short-\ncircuited and they go to higher-ups and get nowhere, to be able to go \nto the press and expose it. It is a far different matter when something \nis prohibited by statute from being made public, such as with grand \njury minutes. Frankly, that dealt with the Plame case. In both cases \nmaking that information public was a violation of law. There was a \npublic policy against disclosure, which there is not in the typical \nwhistleblower case.\n  I believe the reason that the legislation my colleagues from Indiana \nand Connecticut put in didn't get as much support is that it failed to \ndistinguish that difference. We need to protect the press, especially \nwith a large Government that keeps things secret more and more. But we \nalso have to have some respect for the fact that there are certain \nthings that should not be made public by statute in open debate.\n  As I said, this legislation cuts the Gordian knot. It protects those \nmatters that should not be made public and doesn't put them under the \nshield of law but strengthens the protections for whistleblowers and \nothers who might want to expose Government wrongdoing when there is no \nother way to expose it.\n  This is a large step forward. It is legislation I am proud to \ncosponsor. I am very glad that the deadlock has been broken by this \nthoughtful legislation, which I now believe will garner enough support \nto become law. Whereas, the previous legislation, as sweeping as it \nwas, would not.\n  I compliment my colleagues from Indiana, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, \nand South Carolina, with whom I join as lead cosponsors because it is \ngoing to make our country a better place.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2854. A bill to prevent anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions \nin the oil and gas industry; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oil Industry \nMerger Antitrust Enforcement Act. This legislation will significantly \nstrengthen the antitrust laws to prevent anticompetitive mergers and \nacquisitions in oil and gas industry.\n  We have all seen the suffering felt by consumers and our national \neconomy resulting from rising energy prices. Gasoline prices have now \nshattered the once unthinkable $3.00 a gallon level, have doubled in \nthe last 5 years, and increased more than 30 percent in the last year \nalone. And prices for other crucial energy products--such as natural \ngas and home heating oil--have undergone similar sharp increases.\n  Industry experts debate the causes of these extraordinarily high \nprices. Possible culprits are growing worldwide demand, supply \ndisruptions, the actions of the OPEC oil cartel and limits on refinery \ncapacity in the United States. But about one thing there can be no \ndoubt--the substantial rise in concentration and consolidation in the \noil industry. Since 1990, the Government Accountability Office has \ncounted over 2,600 mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures in the oil \nindustry. Led by gigantic mergers such as Exxon/Mobil, BP/Arco, Conoco/\nPhillips and Chevron/Texaco, by 2004, the five largest U.S. oil \nrefining companies controlled over 56 percent of domestic refining \ncapacity, a greater market share than that controlled by the top 10 \ncompanies a decade earlier.\n  This merger wave has led to substantially less competition in the oil \nindustry. In 2004, the GAO concluded that these mergers have directly \ncaused increases in the price of gasoline. A\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nstudy by the independent consumer watchdog Public Citizen found that in \nthe 5 years between 1999 and 2004, U.S. oil refiners increased their \naverage profits on every gallon of gasoline refined from 22.8 cents to \n40.8 cents, a 79 percent jump. And the grossly inflated profit numbers \nof the major oil companies--led by Exxon Mobil's $8.4 billion profit in \nthe first quarter of 2006, which followed its $36 billion profit in \n2005, the highest corporate profits ever achieved in U.S. history, are \nconclusive evidence--if any more was needed--of the lack of competition \nin the U.S. oil industry. While it is true that the world price of \ncrude oil has substantially increased, the fact that the oil companies \ncan so easily pass along all of these price increases to consumers of \ngasoline and other refined products--and greatly compound their profits \nalong the way--confirms that that there is a failure of competition in \nour oil and gas markets.\n  More than 90 years ago, one of our Nation's basic antitrust laws--the \nClayton Act--was written to prevent just such industry concentration \nharming competition. It makes illegal any merger or acquisition the \neffect of which ``may be substantially to lessen competition.'' Despite \nthe plain command of this law, the Federal Trade Commission--the \nFederal agency with responsibility for enforcing antitrust law in the \noil and gas industry--has failed to take any effective action to \nprevent undue concentration in this industry. Instead, it permitted \nalmost all of these 2,600 oil mergers and acquisitions to proceed \nwithout challenge. And where the FTC has ordered divestitures, they \nhave been wholly ineffective to restore competition. Consumers have \nbeen at the mercy of an increasingly powerful oligopoly of a few giant \noil companies, passing along price increases without remorse as the \nmarket becomes increasingly concentrated and competition diminishes. It \nis past time for us in Congress to take action to strengthen our \nantitrust law so that it will, as intended, stand as a bulwark to \nprotect consumers and prevent any further loss of competition in this \nessential industry.\n  Our bill will strengthen merger enforcement under the antitrust law \nin two respects. First, it will direct that the FTC, in conjunction \nwith the Justice Department, revise its Merger Guidelines to take into \naccount the special conditions prevailing in the oil industry. In \nreviewing a pending merger or acquisition to determine whether to \napprove it or take legal action to block it, the FTC follows what are \nknown as ``Merger Guidelines.'' The Merger Guidelines set forth the \nfactors that the agency must examine to determine if a merger or \nacquisition lessens competition, and sets forth the legal tests the FTC \nis to follow in deciding whether to approve or challenge a merger. As \npresently written, the Merger Guidelines fail to direct the FTC, when \nreviewing an oil industry merger, to pay any heed at all to the special \neconomic conditions prevailing in that industry.\n  Our bill will correct this deficiency. Many special conditions \nprevail in the oil and gas marketplace that warrant scrutiny, \nconditions that do not occur in other industries, and the Merger \nGuidelines should reflect these conditions. In most industries, when \ndemand rises and existing producers earn ever-increasing profits, new \nproducers enter the market and new supply expands, reducing the \npressure on price. However, in the oil industry, there are severe \nlimitations on supply and environmental and regulatory difficulty in \nopening new refineries, so this normal market mechanism cannot work. \nAdditionally, in most industries, consumers shift to alternative \nproducts in the face of sharp price increases, leading to a reduction \nin demand and a corresponding reduction in the pressure to increase \nprices. But for such an essential commodity as gasoline, consumers have \nno such option--they must continue to consume gasoline to get to work, \nto go to school, and to shop. These factors all mean that antitrust \nenforcers should be especially cautious about permitting increases in \nconcentration in the oil industry.\n  Accordingly, our bill directs the FTC and Justice Department to \nrevise its Merger Guidelines to take into account the special \nconditions prevailing in the oil industry--including the high \ninelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum-related products; the ease \nof gaining market power; supply and refining capacity limits; \ndifficulties of market entry; and unique regulatory requirements \napplying to the oil industry. This revision of the Merger Guidelines \nmust be completed within 6 months of enactment of this legislation.\n  The second manner in which this legislation will strengthen antitrust \nenforcement will be to shift the burden of proof in Clayton Act \nchallenges to oil industry mergers and acquisitions. In such cases, the \nburden will be placed on the merging parties to establish, by a \npreponderance of evidence, that their transaction does not \nsubstantially lessen competition. This provision would reverse the \nusual rule that the government or private plaintiff challenging the \nmerger must prove that the transaction harms competition. As the \nparties seeking to effect a merger with a competitor in an already \nconcentrated industry, and possessing all the relevant data regarding \nthe transaction, it is entirely appropriate that the merging parties \nbear this burden. This provision does not forbid all mergers in the oil \nindustry if the merging parties can establish that their merger does \nnot substantially harm competition, it may proceed. However, shifting \nthe burden of proof in this manner will undoubtedly make it more \ndifficult for oil mergers and acquisition to survive court challenge, \nthereby enhancing the law's ability to block truly anticompetitive \ntransactions and deterring companies from even attempting such \ntransactions. In today's concentrated oil industry and with consumers \nsuffering record high prices, mergers and acquisitions that even the \nmerging parties cannot justify should not be tolerated.\n  As ranking member on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I believe \nthat this bill is a crucial step to ending this unprecedented move \ntowards industry concentration and to begin to restore competitive \nbalance to the oil and gas industry. Since the days of the break-up of \nthe Standard Oil trust 100 years ago, antitrust enforcement has been \nessential to prevent undue concentration in this industry. This bill is \nan essential step to ensure that our antitrust laws are sufficiently \nstrong to ensure a competitive oil industry in the 21st century. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Oil Industry Merger Antitrust Enforcement \nAct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oil Industry Merger \n     Antitrust Enforcement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) American consumers are suffering from excessively high \n     prices for gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and other \n     energy products.\n       (2) These excessively high energy prices have been caused, \n     at least in substantial part, by undue concentration among \n     companies involved in the production, refining, distribution, \n     and retail sale of oil, gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, \n     and other petroleum-related products.\n       (3) There has been a sharp consolidation caused by mergers \n     and acquisitions among oil companies over the last decade, \n     and the antitrust enforcement agencies (the Federal Trade \n     Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division) \n     have failed to employ the antitrust laws to prevent this \n     consolidation, to the detriment of consumers and competition. \n     This consolidation has caused substantial injury to \n     competition and has enabled the remaining oil companies to \n     gain market power over the sale, refining, and distribution \n     of petroleum-related products.\n       (4) The demand for oil, gasoline, and other petroleum-based \n     products is highly inelastic so that oil companies can easily \n     utilize market power to raise prices.\n       (5) Maintaining competitive markets for oil, gasoline, \n     natural gas, and other petroleum-related products is in the \n     highest national interest.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) ensure vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws in \n     the oil industry;\n       (2) restore competition to the oil industry and to the \n     production, refining, distribution, and marketing of gasoline \n     and other petroleum-related products; and\n       (3) prevent the accumulation and exercise of market power \n     by oil companies.\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\n     SEC. 3. BURDEN OF PROOF.\n\n       Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``In any civil action brought against any person for \n     violating this section in which the plaintiff--\n       ``(1) alleges that the effect of a merger, acquisition, or \n     other transaction affecting commerce may be to substantially \n     lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, in the \n     business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n     processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n     available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n     from petroleum, oil, or natural gas; and\n       ``(2) establishes that a merger, acquisition, or \n     transaction is between or involves persons competing in the \n     business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n     processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n     available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n     from petroleum, oil, or natural gas;\n\n     the burden of proof shall be on the defendant or defendants \n     to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n     merger, acquisition, or transaction at issue will not \n     substantially lessen competition or tend to create a \n     monopoly.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION.\n\n       (a) Review.--The Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust \n     Division of the Department of Justice shall jointly review \n     and revise all enforcement guidelines and policies, including \n     the Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued April 2, 1992 and \n     revised April 8, 1997, and the Non-Horizontal Merger \n     Guidelines issued June 14, 1984, and modify those guidelines \n     in order to--\n       (1) specifically address mergers and acquisitions in oil \n     companies and among companies involved in the production, \n     refining, distribution, or marketing of oil, gasoline, \n     natural gas, heating oil, or other petroleum-related \n     products; and\n       (2) ensure that the application of these guidelines will \n     prevent any merger and acquisition in the oil industry, when \n     the effect of such a merger or acquisition may be to \n     substantially lessen competition, or to tend to create a \n     monopoly, and reflect the special conditions prevailing in \n     the oil industry described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Special Conditions.--The guidelines described in \n     subsection (a) shall be revised to take into account the \n     special conditions prevailing in the oil industry, \n     including--\n       (1) the high inelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum-\n     related products;\n       (2) the ease of gaining market power in the oil industry;\n       (3) supply and refining capacity limits in the oil \n     industry;\n       (4) difficulties of market entry in the oil industry; and\n       (5) unique regulatory requirements applying to the oil \n     industry.\n       (c) Competition.--The review and revision of the \n     enforcement guidelines required by this section shall be \n     completed not later than 6 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice shall jointly \n     report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives regarding the review and revision of the \n     enforcement guidelines mandated by this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Oil industry.--The term ``oil industry'' means \n     companies and persons involved in the production, refining, \n     distribution, or marketing of oil or petroleum-based \n     products.\n       (2) Petroleum-based product.--The term ``petroleum-based \n     product'' means gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating \n     oil, natural gas, or other products derived from the refining \n     of oil or petroleum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2855. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to eliminate \nsecurity risks by replacing the use of extremely hazardous gaseous \nchemicals with inherently safer technologies; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nWater Treatment Hazards Reduction Act of 2006. This legislation would \ncompletely eliminate a known security risk to millions of Americans \nacross the United States by facilitating the transfer to safer \ntechnologies from deadly toxic chemicals at our Nation's water \ntreatment facilities.\n  Across our Nation, there are thousands of water treatment facilities \nthat utilize gaseous toxic chemicals to treat drinking and wastewater. \nApproximately 2,850 facilities are currently regulated under the Clean \nAir Act because they store large quantities of these dangerous \nchemicals. In fact, 98 of these facilities threaten over 100,000 \ncitizens. For example, the Fiveash Water Treatment Plant in Fort \nLauderdale, FL, threatens 1,526,000 citizens. The Bachman Water \nTreatment in Dallas, TX, threatens up to 2 million citizens. And there \nare similar examples in communities throughout the Nation. If these \nfacilities--and the 95 other facilities that threaten over 100,000 \ncitizens--switched from the use of toxic chemicals to safer \ntechnologies that are widely used within the industry we could \ncompletely eliminate a known threat to nearly 50 million Americans.\n  Many facilities have already made the prudent decision to switch \nwithout intervention by the government. The Middlesex County Utilities \nAuthority in Sayreville, NJ, switched to safer technologies and \neliminated the risk to 10.7 million people. The Nottingham Water \nTreatment Plant in Cleveland, OH, switched and eliminated the risk to \n1.1 million citizens. The Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant \nswitched and eliminated the risk to 1.7 million people. In my hometown \nof Wilmington, DE, the Wilmington Water Pollution Control Facility \nswitched from using chlorine gas to liquid bleach. This commendable \ndecision has eliminated the risk to 560,000 citizens, including the \nentire city of Wilmington. In fact, this facility no longer has to \nsubmit risk management plans to the Environmental Protection Agency \nrequired by the Clean Air Act because the threat has been completely \neliminated. There are many other examples of facilities that have done \nthe right thing and eliminated the use of these dangerous, gaseous \nchemicals.\n  The bottom line is that if we can eliminate a known risk, we should. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will do just that. It will \nrequire the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to do a few \nsimple things. First, water facilities will be prioritized based upon \nthe risk that they pose to citizens and critical infrastructure. These \nfacilities--beginning with the most dangerous ones--will be required to \nsubmit a report on the feasibility of utilizing safer technologies and \nthe anticipated costs to transition. If grant funding is available, the \nAdministrator will issue a grant and order the facility to transition \nto the safer technology chosen by the owner of the facility. I believe \nthat this approach will allow us to use Federal funds responsibly while \nreducing risk to our citizens.\n  Once the transition is complete, the facility will be required to \ntrack all cost-savings related to the switch, such as decreased \nsecurity costs, costs saving by eliminating administrative requirements \nunder the EPA risk management plan, lower insurance premiums, and \nothers. If savings are ultimately realized by the facility, it will be \nrequired to return one half of these savings, not to exceed the grant \namount, back to the EPA. In turn, the EPA will utilize any returned \nsavings to help facilitate the transition of more water facilities.\n  A 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office found that \nproviding grants to assist water facilities to transition to safer \ntechnologies was an appropriate use of Federal funds. The costs for an \nindividual facility to transition will vary, but the cost is very cheap \nwhen you consider the security benefits. For example, the Wilmington \nfacility invested approximately $160,000 to transition and eliminated \nthe risk to nearly 600,000 people. Similarly, the Blue Plains facility \nspent $500,000 to transition after 9-11 and eliminated the risk to 1.2 \nmillion citizens immediately. This, in my view, is a sound use of \nfunds. And, this legislation will provide sufficient funding to \ntransition all of our high-priority facilities throughout Nation.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that facilities making the \ndecision to transition after 9-11, but before the enactment date of \nthis legislation will be eligible to participate in the program \nauthorized by this legislation. I have included this provision because \nI believe that the Federal Government should acknowledge--and promote--\nlocal decisions that enhance our homeland security. In addition, we \ndon't want to create a situation where water facilities wait for \nFederal funding, before doing the right thing and eliminating those \ndangerous gaseous chemicals.\n  Last December the 9-11 Discourse Project released its report card for \nthe\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nadministration and Congress on efforts to implement the 9-11 Commission \nrecommendations. It was replete with D's and F's demonstrating that we \nhave been going in the wrong direction with respect to homeland \nsecurity. One of the most troubling findings made by the 9-11 \nCommission is that with respect to our Nation's critical infrastructure \nthat ``no risk and vulnerability assessments actually made; no national \npriorities established; no recommendations made on allocations of \nscarce resources. All key decisions are at least a year away. It is \ntime that we stop talking about priorities and actually set some.'' \nWhile much remains to be done, the Community Water Treatment Hazards \nReduction Act of 2006 sets an important priority for our homeland \nsecurity and it affirmatively addresses it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 484 which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 484) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate condemning the military junta in Burma for its recent \n     campaign of terror against ethnic minorities and calling on \n     the U.N. Security Council to adopt immediately a binding, \n     nonpunitive resolution on Burma.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today's Burma resolution reflects the \nSenate's grave concern about the deteriorating situation in Burma. It \nalso reflects the view of the Senate that, while a second United \nNations Security Council briefing on Burma is welcomed, there now needs \nto be a legally binding, nonpunitive resolution regarding Burma passed \nby the U.N. Security Council. Absent such action, the Association of \nSouth East Asian Nations could very well end up being tougher on Burma \nthan the U.N. The Senate has expressed its concern for the plight of \nthe Burmese not only through this resolution but also by recently \nincluding $5 million in the emergency supplemental bill to assist \nrefugees from Burma who are in Thailand.\n  On a related note, I have concerns about the visit of U.N. envoy, \nIbrahim Gambari, to Burma this week. This visit should not be viewed as \na success unless and until Mr. Gambari has an audience with Nobel Peace \nPrize winner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Burmese leader, Than Shwe. Mr. \nGambari should consider cutting his trip short if it becomes apparent \nhe will not be permitted to hold these meetings, or if the SPDC \notherwise interferes with his visit.\n  I would also add that I applaud the President's action today in \nextending the state of emergency with respect to Burma. It reflects the \nclear recognition by the President of the grave problems facing this \nbeleaguered country.\n  These problems were poignantly addressed by Benedict Rogers, in his \nMay 16, 2006, piece in The Wall Street Journal. In that piece, Rogers \ntold of his encounter with a 15-year-old Burmese boy. This youth had \nwitnessed the murder of both parents and the razing of his village and \nhad endured abduction into forced labor. He hauntingly pleaded to \nRogers `[p]lease tell the world not to forget us.' The Senate has not \nforgotten Burma and it is my profound hope that the U.N. will not \neither.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 484) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 484\n\n       Whereas the regime in Burma, the State Peace and \n     Development Council (SPDC), reportedly threatened to abolish \n     the pro-democracy National League for Democracy;\n       Whereas recent reports indicate that the SPDC escalated its \n     brutal campaign against ethnic groups in November 2005;\n       Whereas reports indicate that the military operation has \n     resulted in approximately 13,000 new internally displaced \n     persons in Burma;\n       Whereas reports estimate that approximately 540,000 people \n     are now internally displaced within Burma, the most serious \n     internal displacement crisis in Asia;\n       Whereas the Thailand Burma Border Consortium reports that \n     the military junta in Burma has destroyed, relocated, or \n     forced the abandonment of approximately 2,800 villages in \n     eastern Burma over the past 10 years;\n       Whereas refugees continue to pour across Burma's borders;\n       Whereas those forced to flee their homes in Burma are \n     increasingly vulnerable, and the humanitarian situation grows \n     more dire as the rainy season approaches;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council was briefed on \n     the human rights situation in Burma for the first time ever \n     in December 2005;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and \n     Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Ibrahim Gambari \n     acknowledged the seriousness of the problems in Burma, and \n     the Secretary-General's office suggested the first-ever \n     course of action on Burma at the United Nations Security \n     Council at the December 2005 briefing;\n       Whereas numerous efforts outside the United Nations \n     Security Council to secure reform in Burma, including 28 \n     consecutive non-binding resolutions of the United Nations \n     General Assembly and United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights, have failed to bring about change;\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\n       Whereas there is ample precedent in the United Nations \n     Security Council for action on Burma; and\n       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi remains the world's only \n     incarcerated Nobel Peace Prize recipient:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to condemn the military junta in Burma for its recent \n     campaign of terror against ethnic minorities; and\n       (2) to call on the United States and other democracies to \n     continue to work with the Association of South East Asian \n     Nations to promote democracy, human rights and justice in \n     Burma; and\n       (3) to call on the United States to lead an effort at the \n     United Nations Security Council to pass immediately a \n     binding, non-punitive resolution calling for the immediate \n     and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all \n     other prisoners of conscience in Burma, condemning these \n     atrocities, and supporting democracy, human rights and \n     justice in Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/18/senate-section/article/S4817-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MAY 19, 2006\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.
