Mr. President, I rise this morning as a point of personal \nprivilege to welcome a friend and leader in our community in \nWilmington, DE. Father Christo opened the Senate in prayer this \nmorning. It may be the only time the entire Greek community in \nWilmington, DE, was tuned in to C-SPAN as we opened up the morning \nsession. I want this Senate to know and I hope my colleagues will get a \nchance to meet Father Christo.\n  Many who were raised with a parochial education got an opportunity to \nmeet religious teachers. The kind of guy one always looked for was \nFather. Father is a guy whom everyone knew was much smarter than you. \nYou knew he was probably a better athlete than you were. You knew he \nhad thought through whatever you were thinking of before you thought \nit. And you also knew you could go to him whenever you needed help.\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\n  That is the role he continues to play with an adult parish in one of \nthe most active communities in my State. The Greek-American community \nis small in our State, but it is extremely vibrant. Similar to many \ncommunities, the heart and soul of it is the church. The heart and soul \nof it is not only the spiritual center of the community, it is the \npolitical center of the community. I mean that in a nonpartisan way. It \nis the social center of the community. It is the community. It is the \nembodiment of community.\n\n  We have very important business this morning, and I will yield to my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Carper.\n  I can say to Father, it is an honor to have him here this morning. I \nhope he has an even greater impression than I know he possessed when he \ncame, of the majesty of this place. This is the people's Chamber. They \ntalk about the people's House, this building, this Senate, all of the \nCapitol. Every time people come to visit, I remind them that this \nbelongs to them. This is theirs. We are only here as hired hands for a \nwhile. I hope Father takes back to his parish the notion that there is \nan awful lot of good that can be done here.\n  I am delighted he took the time this morning to remind us of the \nrelationship between temple, Government, and the spiritual leadership \nthat comes directly and immediately from God. I thank him for that. I \nthank him for his generosity and leadership back home in our community \nbeyond Holy Trinity. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I add a couple of comments to the words of \nour colleague, Senator Biden, in welcoming Father Christo to the Senate \nChamber today.\n  We are proud of our Constitution. Delaware was the first State to \nratify the Constitution of our country. The Constitution calls for \nseparation of church and state. Some people may find, given that as our \nheritage, it is unusual we begin each of our sessions in the Senate \nwith an opening prayer.\n  Today, we are honored for all in Delaware, for everybody in the Greek \ncommunity in our State, and everyone in the country, to be able to \nwelcome one of our own to open the Senate in prayer.\n  I am struck by the number of times I talk to people in my State and \naround the country who say: We pray for you--not just me as an \nindividual but for us as a collective body, as we meet. I always say: \nWe welcome your prayers; keep praying. We certainly need those prayers.\n  I asked my staff to give me a little bit of background on Father, to \nsay a few words. I have 10 pages of accomplishments. What a remarkable \ntale of accomplishment--and still a young pup.\n  I am honored you are here. Thank you for coming and starting our day \non the right foot.\n  I would say to those people from other States, in talking to the \nPresiding Officer before the session began, he was asking where the \nGreek Church is in our State. If you come through Delaware on I-95, and \na lot of people do, in the early part of June, you get off on \nPennsylvania Avenue and head north a couple of blocks, make a left turn \non Broom Street, you will find the Greek Church. They hold a great \nfestival there. It is not only a church where people go for their \nsouls, but three nights in the early part of June you can go there and \nenjoy great Greek food, dance, and drink. It is a wonderful time of \nfellowship with people who are Greek their whole lives and people who \nare Greek for a night or two.\n  We are honored by your presence, Father, and thank you for embracing \nus and thank you for your warm and wonderful prayer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes to \nspeak in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9072-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9072-S9073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                           CPL Phillip Baucus\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, west of Baghdad in Iraq's Al Anbar \nProvince, the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion of the 1st \nMarine Division rested for the night. On Saturday, June 29, a suicide \nbomber crashed his vehicle into a barrack. The structure collapsed. \nFour marines died. Among them was a 28-year-old corporal named Phillip \nBaucus. He is my nephew.\n  When I first took my wife Wanda to the family ranch many years ago, \nabout 23, young Phillip, 5 or 6 years old, received Wanda. He walked up \nto Wanda and said: Wanda, welcome to the ranch. He had a wildflower in \nhis hand and he gave it to Wanda. That is how he was.\n  Wanda and I had the sad duty at Dover Air Force Base to receive \nPhillip's casket. When we asked, they said, no, we could not touch his \ncasket, but they reconsidered--the colonel did--and said, yes, it was \nall right for Wanda and let Wanda touch Phillip's casket. Beneath the \nflag that draped the casket, Wanda slipped a wildflower. That is how \nshe is. North of Helena, in Montana's Lewis and Clark County, Phillip \ncame to his final rest. On the afternoon of Sunday, August 6, more than \n500 Montanans gathered under the willow trees of the family ranch to \nremember Phillip.\n  A Chinook helicopter flew overhead, a massive American flag draped \nbelow it. White doves were released into the sky. A bagpipe played \n``Amazing Grace,'' and the ``Marine Corps Hymn.'' Bugles played \n``Taps.'' The funeral ended with a family tradition, a tradition that \nPhillip loved. We packed 2 pounds of black gunpowder, fired an anvil \nweighing about 60 pounds several hundred feet into the air. It fell to \nthe ground with a heavy thud.\n  Marines folded the flag that had covered Phillip's casket into a \ntriangle and handed it to his widow Katherine. Phillip and Katherine \nhad been married at that very same place less than a year before. \nPhillip's Marine colleague, Sergeant Raymond Rios, spoke to Phillip \nsaying: ``Baucus, you will always be here with every shadow, the sun \nshining and the trees blowing.''\n  My brother John and I planted two trees there a few weeks ago on the \nranch in memory of Phillip. They will blow in the winds and grow in the \nsun there in his memory. It was at that ranch where he was laid to rest \non the same mountain where my father lies.\n  In the days since, I have been moved by the hundreds of handwritten \nnotes I have received from Montanans, friends, and colleagues. I have \nbeen moved by these many tributes. In the Native American culture there \nis no greater honor than dying for your community, being a warrior. \nAmerican Indians have answered this country's call to service in \nnumbers far greater than their fair share of the population. When \ninjured or killed in war, Native American service men and women are \nhonored as fallen warriors. Their praises are sung before every powwow \nand special occasion.\n  I visited several Indian tribes last August. Time after time, I was \nhonored when the tribal leaders honored Phillip as a fallen warrior. \nFollowing one tribal council meeting, an elderly grandmother asked if \nshe could honor Phillip. She told me she had two grandsons in Iraq. She \nwanted to express her condolences to my family. She had made a quilt \nwith the American flags interspersed throughout the quilt for the \nfallen warrior. She asked me to turn around. And reaching on her \ntiptoes, she draped the quilt around my shoulders. Then she embraced \nme.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 3865 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, coincidentally, coming to the floor this \nmorning, I signed two letters of condolences to families, one in \nnorthern Nevada--Silver Springs, NV--and one in Las Vegas, NV, to \nparents who lost young men in Iraq during the last week or so. I have \nsigned lots of these letters for Nevadans, but signing one of these \nletters in the future will never be the same after listening to my \nfriend from Montana.\n  When I first learned of Phillip's death, I said on the Senate floor: \nMax Baucus has a son. I know him, a wonderful young man. But this \nnephew of Senator Baucus was like his second son. So in the future, \nwhen I sign these letters, I will think of Max Baucus because it is \neasy, it is human nature, to\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\nfeel sorrow when we sign these letters and see these names--approaching \n2,700--but when you have actually experienced the loss, I know, having \nwitnessed the distress my friend has gone through, I repeat, signing \nthat letter to one of these families will never be the same.\n  So I say to Senator Baucus, who is part of the Senate family, one of \nthe senior Members of the Senate, the thoughts of every Senator go out \nto you, Max. And you did today what your heart said you should do. I \nwish we could convey to everyone in America, through you, what is going \non in our country and what sacrifices families are making. We have to \nmake their sacrifices stand for something.\n  Again, it is wonderful to have Max Baucus as our friend. And more \nespecially to me, on a personal note, it is important he is my friend.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very good friend from Nevada. I \nthank you very much. And I thank all my colleagues very much. We are \none big family here in the Senate and in the country, and we are a \ngreat country. We will see our way through all this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just heard a very powerful and \nmoving statement from the senior Senator from Montana, and we all \nunderstand he has suffered a deep and personal loss. I heard about the \nvery close relationship Senator Baucus had with the nephew he lost, and \nhe should know that his friends and his colleagues share that loss, \nthat we grieve with him and we grieve with the family, that we \nespecially appreciate the very moving statement he made.\n  It is our obligation--it is our obligation--to make certain these \nlosses mean something and that, in the end, our country is successful \nagainst this threat.\n  I think every Member of this Chamber recognizes there is a real \nthreat to our Nation and that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to those \nwho answer the country's call, who come forward and serve when they are \nasked. This Nation owes much to those who have sacrificed, and we \nshould never forget it.\n  Senator Baucus, you should know that your friends and your \ncolleagues--this is a family--mourn with you and grieve with you and \nyour family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nfor morning business allotted to the minority has expired.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nnational security. Safety and security of the American people must be \nour Government's top priority, and we must not lose sight of the threat \nthat faces our Nation. As we approach the anniversary of the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, I wish to remind all Americans that these were acts \nof war against the United States.\n  Since then, the United States and our coalition partners have fought \nback.\n  Despite what some might say, we have seen many successes. We have \ndismantled al-Qaida's terrorist network in Afghanistan and helped \ndemocracy rise in its place.\n  We are working with our allies to secure a united, stable, and \ndemocratic Iraq.\n  We have led an international campaign against terrorist financing, \nfreezing over $1.5 billion in terrorist assets in the United States \nalone.\n  Since September 11, there have been no terrorist attacks or acts on \nAmerican soil. Our intelligence system has prevented 15 major terrorist \nplots that we know of and likely many others that are undisclosed. We \nhave convicted over 261 defendants in terrorism-related cases and \ncharged more than 180 others.\n  While we are continually working to make America safer, we still face \nserious threats from our enemies both at home and abroad.\n  To win the war against the Islamic fascists, we need an effective \nintelligence system that is lawful but also provides us with the \nnecessary information to prevent attacks before they occur.\n  Only last month we were once again reminded that there are people out \nthere who want to kill us and what we stand for. Fortunately, with the \nhelp of our British allies, we were able to prevent the terrorists from \nkilling innocent civilians. These threats are real, this war is real, \nand the outcome will be determined by the action of our Congress and \nour people, and it will determine the future of our Nation.\n  This war is unlike any other war we have ever fought. It is both a \nbattle of arms and a battle of ideas. This war of ideology is not an \neasy one and requires an advancement of freedom.\n  I know it is often difficult to turn on the news and hear reports \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan and question what type of effective democracy \nwe have in place. Have we so quickly forgotten the image 9 months ago \nof Iraqis waving their blue fingers in the air after they had voted in \nthe first free elections in their nation's history? Have we forgotten \nthe images of women and children sitting in classrooms in Afghanistan, \nfree to learn without the fear of persecution or execution?\n  These are images I will never forget. They are images of democracy at \nwork.\n  Just this morning we saw democracy at work when coalition forces in \nIraq handed over control of the Iraqi armed forces to the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  Effective democracies do take time and hard work. They cannot be \ncreated overnight, but in the end they combat the ideology of Islamic \nfascists.\n  These terrorists recognize this and because of it are willing to kill \ninnocent people to stop the spread of freedom.\n  I urge my colleagues not to let them succeed in their efforts and to \njoin me in maintaining a united front against these terrorist nations \nand the terrorists across the world as we press ahead with important \nnational security legislation in the coming weeks.\n  While we may disagree about different policies in our war against \nthese terrorists, we must not lose sight of what is at stake for our \ncountry. We owe it to future generations--my 35 grandkids, 4 great-\ngrandkids, 9 children, and their spouses--we owe it to all Americans \nbecause the cost of failure is too great.\n  I, for one, will not back down from the challenges and look forward \nto working with my colleagues on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nKentucky in commenting this morning during morning business on our \nefforts to protect against the continuing threats to our Nation, \nspecifically protecting ourselves against the continuing threat from \nterrorists.\n  I am pleased to see President Bush in recent days presenting to the \nAmerican people and the world what the facts are, what we have achieved \nin our efforts to defend our country against the terrorist acts and to \nprotect against those who would harm American citizens around the \nworld.\n  I am pleased to see that we have the strong leadership of the \nPresident on this issue and those who are working with him in the \nadministration to carry out his policies and the policies we have \nidentified here to support through votes in the Senate and the House.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has come under a lot of criticism recently. Many \npeople have been making speeches, calling for his resignation. I think \nhe has done a good job. I think he has been a solid performer to carry \nout the mission that we have to perform to succeed in the war on \nterror.\n  The Congress has approved appropriations bills, authorizations for \nthe work that is being done in this very difficult and challenging \narea. We now have before us in the Senate another appropriations bill \nproviding funds for the Department of Defense. We have a bill that has \nbeen approved by our Appropriations Committee funding the Department of \nHomeland Security. In both of these measures, we have outlined an \naggressive effort that should be carried out by our Government to \nprotect our country, and the efforts that we have made and the \nadministration has made are working. They are doing a great job.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  Recent events in England have shown us how difficult the challenge is \nfor other countries and how sometimes preemptive and decisive action is \nneeded in order to protect the citizens of England and our country as \nwell. We applaud the close working relationship we have with them. We \nbenefit from their efforts, and we are grateful to them for the courage \nand the skill they have shown in this war on terror.\n  The Congress should continue to support the administration, not take \nadvantage of opportunities for political bickering, partisan \nnitpicking--whatever one might want to call it. I think we need to take \na higher ground in this debate and discussion of what our options are \nfor protecting our country and our people. We don't need the constant \ndrumbeat of partisan criticism against the President and the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  I think we should consider instead the impressive success of our \nsoldiers, their courage, and the courage of their leaders and the skill \nof their leaders in mobilizing the resources of our country to \nguarantee success in the war on terror.\n  Just consider what is going on in Iraq right now. Madam President, \nunder the leadership of President Bush and Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld and GEN George Casey, our outstanding commander who is \nresponsible for the multinational force that is in Iraq today, we are \nsuccessfully helping Iraq organize, equip, and train their forces so \nthey can take care of their own security interests.\n  Iraqi security forces are now in the lead and responsible for almost \n75 percent of the military obligations and challenges that are faced \ntoday in Iraq.\n  There are currently 5 Iraqi divisions, 26 brigades, and 88 battalions \nthat are in the lead in their areas of responsibility in Iraq.\n  More and more of the land area in Iraq is now under the control of \nIraqi's own security forces, supported, of course, by coalition \ngovernment troops who are there as well.\n  The other day, at a news conference in Baghdad, General Casey \nexplained that he can see U.S. troop reductions in Iraq over the next \n12 to 18 months because Iraqi security forces are progressing to a \npoint where they can take on the security responsibilities of the \ncountry.\n  We have seen a significant step being taken when the Iraqi Ministry \nof Defense announced it is assuming direct operational control over the \ncountry's Armed Forces. That announcement was made today. The Iraqi \njoint headquarters, under the direction of the Ministry of Defense, \nwill be fully responsible now for the Iraqi Air Force, the Iraqi naval \nforce, and the Iraqi ground forces command.\n  These are facts, Madam President, which we ought to consider and \napplaud, and our Government and our Department of Defense and our \nsoldiers deserve credit for the successes they have achieved and the \nstrong leadership that has been provided to them.\n  The United States and coalition forces have gradually turned over \nother security operations in Afghanistan, for example, to NATO forces. \nThis has been a very impressive feat of leadership to bring together \nthe forces of NATO originally responsible for European defense and now \nenlarged to include areas of concern to other NATO countries in what \nhad been previously considered out-of-area interests.\n  NATO forces have taken control of the International Security \nAssistance Force in the north, west, most recently in the south, and \nnow are making progress in the east to achieve control and success in \ndefending the security of the people of Afghanistan.\n  There are 37 nation states involved in this effort. We ought to \napplaud the President, and we ought to applaud the Secretary of Defense \nfor the successes they have achieved in moving us to this point in our \ndealings with Afghanistan. We have liberated Afghanistan. The Russians \nhad experiences there. We recall their failures and the dangers that \ncontinued under the Taliban--the deprivation of rights, particularly of \nwomen and children. No schools were available. Now we have moved into a \nnew area of freedom and hope because of the work that these 37 nations \nhave achieved under U.S. leadership and with the U.S. military very \nactively involved.\n  So today I am pleased to say to the administration and the Secretary \nof Defense and the President specifically: We are proud of the work you \nare doing. We are going to continue to support you by providing the \nfunding you need to carry out your missions and protect our country \nagainst terrorists and the other threats that we have looming on the \nhorizon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is only 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 5 minutes as in morning business. I want to speak about the \nIranian President who is going to be in Washington speaking today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no objection on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9074-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9074-S9075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for this \nopportunity to speak.\n  Later today, President Khatami of Iran will be speaking at the \nNational Cathedral. I hope he is asked and he answers a number of \nquestions about what happened during his reign of terror in Iran.\n  President Khatami was the President of Iran, the lead sponsor of \nterrorism around the world.\n  President Khatami was President of Iran, a country that seeks to have \nthe United States bow down in front of Iran and to Iran.\n  President Khatami worsened the human rights record in Iran to its own \npeople. As we speak right now, a press conference is going on at the \nNational Press Club of Iranians who have somehow gotten out of that \ncountry who were tortured under President Khatami and President Ahmadi-\nNejad, the current President of Iran.\n  I hope that as we deliberate the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill, we recognize this threat. This is a country, Iran, that seeks to \ndestroy Israel, seeks to attack and destroy the West, seeks to have us \nbow down. I will read the quote from President Ahmadi-Nejad that he \nsaid in July. He called on America and the West to bow before Iran \nsaying:\n\n       If you would like to have good relations with the Iranian \n     nation in the future, bow down before the greatness of the \n     Iranian nation and surrender. If you don't accept to do this, \n     the Iranian nation will force you to surrender and bow down.\n\n  Those are his words. We will not bow down. We are in a war on \nterrorism. We are in a war against Islamic fascism, which this is a \nstatement of. I hope we recognize that. In the war on terrorism, \nterrorism is their tactic, and they use it through Hezbollah and Hamas, \nwhich Iran is supporting and operating. They direct it at us. We have \nto confront this and we have to confront this Islamic fascism. What \nthey seek to establish is a militant dictatorship, an Islamic fascist \ndictatorship. This group has an object. They don't just wander around. \nStep 1 is to remove the United States from the Middle East. Step 2 is \nto establish an Islamic caliphate. This is an Islamic dictator over an \nentire region--a Shia crescent over an entire region of the world. \nThese are his words. This is what they seek. They seek a nuclear weapon \nto be able to threaten the region, to be able to use in this region. \nAyatollah Khamenei, the lead sponsor and organizer of the current \nIslamic Republic, in 1979, removing the Shah, came in and said if we \ndestroy Israel, Allah will reward us. This is a governing theological \nphilosophy that has not been walked away from by the current leadership \nin Iran. Let's listen to the words they say themselves.\n  Former President Khatami is going to be speaking in Washington, DC, \ntonight. He said in October 2000:\n\n       If we abide by the Koran, all of us should mobilize to \n     kill.\n\n  This is October 2000. He should be asked, does he still believe that \nstatement or support that statement.\n  Today, I will be introducing the Iran Human Rights Act, legislation \ndesigned to focus our attention on the\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nhuman rights abuses taking place in Iran today and support the efforts \nof the Iranian people to enact peaceful, democratic reforms.\n  While we have been focusing on the nuclear weapon development by the \nIranians and on their support for terrorism, we should not forget about \nthe plight of the Iranian people and their difficulties under this \nregime. The bill creates a special envoy to focus on human rights \nabuses in Iraq and to work with groups who support human rights and \ndemocracy in Iran.\n  The bill provides financial supports to these groups supporting human \nrights and that are working toward democracy in Iran. Finally, it \nensures that the United States broadcast into Iran emphasize U.S. \nsupport for the rights and well-being of the Iranian people. We need to \nfocus on the nuclear weapons, and we also need to focus on the rights \nof the Iranian people being abused by this regime. It is also my hope \nthat we will grant visas to this country to professors being kicked out \nof universities in Iran because they don't tow the line of the ruling \nclerics in that country. Currently, the universities are being purged \nin Iran of the dissident voices of these professors.\n  We stand with the Iranian people. We stand against this Iranian \ntyrannical regime. I hope we can move this legislation forward to show \nour support for the suffering people. I ask the people who go to the \nmeetings where President Khatami is speaking to ask these questions:\n  Why did he support terrorism? Why did the human rights record get \nworse under his 8 years of leadership in Iran? Why do they persecute \nreligious minorities and women? Why do they persecute those who have \npeaceful protests inside Iran? Why does Iran need to enrich uranium \nwhen they have plentiful oil and gas supplies? These are serious \nquestions in serious times.\n  I hope that as we consider this Department of Defense bill, we will \nconsider what the words of those who have vowed to destroy us are and \nthat we take appropriate action against them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9075-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment is on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan, \nSalazar, and Menendez.\n  Five years ago, our Nation was viciously attacked by al-Qaida. We all \nremember the horrific images from that fateful day. I remember so well \narriving at the Capitol building for early morning meetings and, as we \nentered, security personnel ordered an evacuation. Those of us who were \nevacuated from this building went back to our offices and were again \nevacuated there, as there was a belief that there was a potential \nthreat to the Capitol complex. Later on, we saw the results of the \nattack. We saw people jumping from the World Trade Center. We saw the \nattack on the Pentagon. We did not know, in the early hours, who was \nresponsible, but we knew the world had changed.\n  I remember very well that night, as Members of Congress stood on the \nsteps of the Capitol showing that we were shoulder to shoulder in \ndefense of America. That night, there were no Republicans, there were \nno Democrats; there were just proud Americans on the steps of this \nCapitol, men and women elected to represent our individual States here \nin this Capitol. In the 20 years I have been in this Chamber, I never \nsaw such unity, such a sense of purpose that we would not let these \nacts stand and that those who were responsible would be held to \naccount.\n  We need to renew that spirit. We need Democrats and Republicans \nstanding together to bring to justice those who were responsible for \nthese horrific acts. In this photo is the man who planned, financed, \nand organized those operations, Osama bin Laden, the head of al-Qaida. \nIt has now been over 1,800 days since those attacks, and this man is \nstill on the loose. This man has still not been brought to justice. I \nbelieve it is one of our Nation's highest priorities that he and the \nother top leadership of al-Qaida be brought to justice. I include Mr. \nal-Zawahiri. I think we also know that Mullah Omar, the leader of the \nTaliban in Afghanistan, has not been apprehended and brought to justice \neither.\n  To me, this is centrally important to the war on terrorism. We have \nto get the terrorist leaders who designed the attack on our country. I \nsay to my colleagues that I graduated from high school from an American \nmilitary base in Tripoli, Libya, North Africa, Willis Air Force Base. I \nhad relatives who were in the intelligence service of the United States \nwho served in that part of the world as well. One thing I learned when \nI was in that part of the world is that if a fight started, you better \nget the leaders and you better get them quick; otherwise, it mushroomed \nand escalated. My experience was very minor. It was on the basketball \ncourt, where we would have shepherds periodically come and start \nthrowing\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nstones. We found out early that you better get a stone and you better \nnail a couple of their guys or the thing got worse. I think all of us \nwho have studied the Arab world know that in that culture, if somebody \nattacks and is not held to account, that person grows in stature in \nthat culture.\n  We have to hold to account Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and all of \nthe rest of the al-Qaida leadership. I think that is absolutely \ncritical for success in the war on terror. Osama bin Laden continues to \ncall for attacks on us. We are now seeing a Taliban resurgence in \nAfghanistan. Last month, we saw a plot that may have been orchestrated \nby al-Qaida to blow up airliners flying between Britain and the United \nStates. Unfortunately, the latest intelligence--and this is not \nclassified, so I am not disclosing any state secrets here--according to \nthe National Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, the number of \nal-Qaida operatives worldwide has grown from 20,000 in 2001 to 50,000 \ntoday.\n  Some of our colleagues have likened this to World War II. I don't \nbelieve that. This is not like World War II. This is fundamentally and \nprofoundly different. In World War II, we had Hitler Germany attempting \nto achieve world dominance. In World War II, we had a state, the nation \nof Germany, attacking its neighbors, seeking hegemony throughout Europe \nand beyond. We had Germany attacking its neighbors. We had Germany on \nthe move against Great Britain. We had Germany with its allies \nattacking the Soviet Union. That was profoundly different than a \nnetwork of terrorists spread in over 70 countries around the world \nseeking to weaken our country. That is a profoundly different \ncircumstance than we faced in World War II. In World War II, we faced \nthe sneak attack by Japan on the United States, and Japan being allied \nwith Germany in a move to achieve world dominance. That is a profoundly \ndifferent circumstance than the one we face today. And if we don't \nadapt our methods and tactics and strategy, we will be less successful.\n\n  It is critical that we have this debate, and it should not be a \npartisan debate. To me, this is not a matter of Republicans and \nDemocrats; this is a question of how does our country succeed in this \nbattle against terrorism? How do we best succeed? My own conviction is, \nit starts with this man. It doesn't end there, but it starts here. \nOsama bin Laden has got to be brought to justice. Mr. Zawahiri has got \nto be brought to justice. Mullah Omar has got to be brought to justice. \nAnd I don't question--I don't question the intention of this \nadministration to attempt to do that, but I do note that it has now \nbeen 5 years, and there has been a failure to get those who organized \nthe attack on our country. That is a fact. And we need to deal with \nthat fact and we need to adopt new methods, new strategies in order to \nachieve success. That is my conviction.\n  These are things that disturb me greatly. In March of 2004, USA Today \nreported:\n\n       In 2002, troops from the fifth special forces group who \n     specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for \n     Osama bin Laden to prepare for their next assignment: Iraq. \n     Their replacements were troops with expertise in Spanish \n     cultures.\n\n  Let's think about that a minute. After Osama bin Laden, who led the \nattacks, we put in special forces to find him who were experts in Arab \nculture and in Arab languages. But when we diverted our attention and \nmoved to Iraq, we pulled those forces out of Afghanistan in the search \nfor Osama bin Laden and replaced them, according to these news reports, \nwith troops with expertise in Spanish culture. There aren't many \nSpanish speakers or much Spanish culture in Afghanistan. I think this \nwas a profound mistake.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The CIA meanwhile was stretched badly in its capacity to \n     collect, translate, and analyze information coming from \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  When some say the center of the war on terrorism is Iraq, I think \nthey have it wrong. The center is in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden \nand Zawahiri have been located. I am not saying I know that they are \nlocated there now. We know they were located there; perhaps they are \nsomewhere else at this point. But at the time we shifted our focus, I \nbelieve it was a mistake. I believe we ought to have focused like a \nlaser on the leadership of al-Qaida. Al-Qaida attacked us; not Iraq. \nThere wasn't a single Iraqi on those airplanes that crashed into the \nWorld Trade Center. There wasn't a single Iraqi on the plane that hit \nthe Pentagon. There wasn't a single Iraqi on the plane that went down \nin Pennsylvania. They were al-Qaida operatives led by Osama bin Laden, \nnot Iraqis led by Saddam Hussein.\n  I might add that once we took our eye off the ball in getting the \nterrorists and instead went to Iraq, we have now unfortunately freed up \nIran for all kinds of troublemaking in the Middle East. Iran is behind \nthe operations of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Is there any doubt that they \nare the financial muscle behind that operation? This is a battle. It is \na battle that is critically important to our Nation's security, and we \nhave to fight it in a smart and disciplined and focused way if we are \nto succeed. That is my belief.\n  Now we learn that the CIA has closed the unit that is focused on the \ncapture of Osama bin Laden. This report from July of this year says:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency has closed the unit that \n     for a decade had the mission of hunting Osama bin Laden and \n     his top lieutenants. The unit, known as Alec Station, was \n     disbanded late last year and its analysts reassigned within \n     the CIA Counter-Terrorist Center.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       In recent years, the war in Iraq has stretched the \n     resources of the intelligence agencies and the Pentagon, \n     generating new priorities for American officials.\n\n  I believe the priority remains getting those who attacked us. It \nwasn't Iraq that attacked us; it was al-Qaida that attacked us, and it \nis critically important we hold them to account.\n  On August 21, the President said this:\n\n       The terrorists attacked us and killed 3,000 of our citizens \n     before we started the freedom agenda in the Middle East.\n\n  He was then interrupted by a reporter who asked:\n\n       What did Iraq have to do with that?\n\n  The President:\n\n       What did Iraq have to do with what?\n\n  The reporter:\n\n       The attacks upon the World Trade Center.\n\n  The President:\n\n       Nothing.\n\n  That is correct, nothing. We know from the 9/11 Commission Iraq was \nnot involved in the attacks of 9/11. It was al-Qaida--al-Qaida led by \nOsama bin Laden. That is where we have to focus. And this, to me, is \nnot a political debate. This is a question of the strategic policy of \nthe United States. How do we best defend America against those who have \nalready attacked us and intend to attack us again? I would submit the \nfirst thing we have to do is get the leadership of the organization \nthat is worldwide in scope, that seeks to take us down. Make no \nmistake, this is a battle with real consequences, and we have got to \nfight it in the smartest, most effective way.\n  It has now been 1,823 days since Osama bin Laden attacked us. Madam \nPresident, 1,823 days; that is a long time. That is nearly 5 years. The \nPresident just issued a new intelligence estimate and analysis. There \nis only one mention of Osama bin Laden in that document, and it is a \nreference in passing.\n  I don't think it should be a matter that is mentioned in passing. I \ndeeply believe we have to refocus and we have to go after, in a \ndisciplined and dedicated way, the leadership of al-Qaida, starting \nwith Osama bin Laden, going to Zawahiri, and right down the list. I \napplaud those successes that we have had in getting Zarqawi and others. \nThank God for that. But we have got to get those at the top.\n\n  This amendment adds $200 million to the intelligence budget for a \nunit explicitly dedicated to bringing Osama bin Laden and other top al-\nQaida leadership to justice. The second part of this amendment requires \na classified report every 90 days on activities of our Government \nrelated to bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. A classified report \nbecause, obviously, we don't want to signal the game plan.\n  This is the amendment that I offer, and I thank my colleagues who \nhave cosponsored it with me: Senator Dorgan, my colleague from North \nDakota; Senator Salazar from Colorado; Senator Menendez from New \nJersey; and now I am informed that additional Senators have asked to \njoin, including Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, and Senator Obama of Illinois.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to add them as original cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, Senator Conrad and I have, over the last \n2 days, talked about the need for an amendment of this type to be \noffered to the Defense appropriations bill. We have talked about \nseveral different ways of offering this amendment and the circumstances \nthat require us to come here and draft an amendment and offer it to our \ncolleagues. This amendment represents some discussions, as well, with \ncolleagues. I want to say that almost all of that which persuaded us to \ndo this has now been described by my colleague, Senator Conrad.\n  He talked about 9/11 2001. I recall going to Ground Zero in New York \nas the fire was still burning, smoke coming out of the wreckage of the \nWorld Trade Center from the bombing of the trade center by the \nterrorists and the murder of 3,000 innocent Americans. And as we toured \njust several days after those terrorists had hit the World Trade Center \nin New York, and the smoke was still billowing out of that twisted \nsteel wreckage, one of the grizzled firefighters who had not shaved for \nseveral days, obviously had not slept, had bloodshot eyes, came up to \nme as we were touring--a group of Senators--and he said to me: ``Get \n'em. Ya'll have to get 'em. If you don't get 'em, they are going to do \nit to us again.''\n  Having worked in this wreckage of the World Trade Center and having \nseen the carnage and the bodies, what he meant was that if we don't get \nthose who did this, they will repeat it. That firefighter was speaking \nwith a real passion, a passion that I think is shared by the American \npeople. That passion was shared on that day and it is now, today.\n  That attack on 9/11--my colleague showed a picture of it--was with \ncommercial airplanes loaded with fuel used as weapons. The New York \nTimes ran a piece on August 11, 2004, by Nicholas Christoff, about a \nbook by Harvard professor Graham Allison called ``Nuclear Terrorism.'' \nAllison told a story in this book that exactly 1 month after 9/11, on \nOctober 11 in 2001, aides told President Bush that a CIA source named \nDragon Fire had reported that al-Qaida had obtained a 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon, apparently stolen from Russian stockpiles, and had \nsmuggled it into New York City, and al-Qaida terrorists were now \nprepared to detonate it. This is described in some detail in the book.\n  The CIA apparently found this report plausible. They knew that \napparently Russia had small 10-kiloton nuclear weapons. Russia was \nreported to have lost some nuclear materials. Al-Qaida had made a \ndetermined effort to acquire them. The CIA had apparently picked up al-\nQaida chatter about an ``American Hiroshima.'' This issue was taken \nvery seriously in October of 2001. Later it was determined the lead by \nthe agent named Dragon Fire was a false lead. But in retrospect of this \nissue, all of those who evaluated it determined it could well have been \ntrue.\n  It is not implausible that a nuclear weapon could be stolen. After \nall, there are some 30,000 nuclear weapons on this Earth. It is not \nimplausible that having a nuclear weapon stolen by a terrorist group, \nit could be detonated. And it is certainly likely they would attempt to \ndetonate a nuclear weapon in the center of a major city, especially a \ncity in the United States.\n\n  I describe that only to say these issues are critically important. \nYes, \n9/11 breaks our heart--all of the innocent Americans killed by acts of \nterrorism. But that will be an event that will be small by comparison \nif, in fact, a nuclear weapon is acquired by a terrorist group like al-\nQaida and detonated in an American city in the future.\n  There are responsible people who have said they believe there is a \nvery substantial likelihood such an event could or will happen in the \nnext 10 years, unless this country provides the leadership to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, stops the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand does everything necessary to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands \nof terrorists.\n  The evil of terrorism requires and demands a unified American \nresolve. As my colleague has previously said, when it comes to fighting \nterrorism, there are no D's or R's, there are no Republicans or \nDemocrats, conservatives or liberals, there are only Americans resolved \nto confront this evil.\n  We are determined to confront and defeat those who are intent on \nmurdering innocent people in the name of terrorism. We fight terrorism \nto preserve freedom, but we betray rather than serve our freedom if we \nturn a blind eye to the actions which will diminish the very freedoms \nwe cherish, even as we confront the actions of terrorists. As we wage \nthis fight against terrorism, we do not serve the interests of our \ncountry by labeling others who may disagree with strategies as \nappeasers, of the type who appeased Nazism. That does not serve \nAmerica's interests either.\n  I have heard colleagues today come to the floor to lament that there \nhave been some criticisms of Administration strategies. Let's all \nunderstand no one is perfect. Big mistakes have been made. Mistakes, \nand big mistakes, have been made, both with respect to Iraq and also \nwith respect to the war against terrorism.\n  In Iraq, we discovered later there were no weapons of mass \ndestruction. There was no yellow cake from Niger. The aluminum tubes \nwere not for the purpose of building a nuclear capability. There were \nno mobile chemical weapons labs. Would we be treated as liberators as \nwas suggested? No. It turns out that was not the case.\n  Were mistakes made? Two days ago, a young fellow who left law school \nafter 9/11 to enlist in the Army to go to Iraq told me that when he got \nto Iraq his mother, an elementary schoolteacher, had to go on the \nInternet to buy body armor to send it to him. Were mistakes made? You \ndarned right mistakes were made. Mistakes were made. Let's understand \nthat. Recognizing and understanding that and admitting it allows us to \ndecide not to make those mistakes again.\n  All of us are here to support our soldiers in their fight against \nterrorism, in their mission in Iraq. Let me say, as an aside as well, \nthat the violence and terrorism in Iraq does have an al-Qaida \ncomponent; it does. But by far the bulk and the majority of the \nviolence and terrorism in Iraq is Iraqi upon Iraqi, Sunni upon Shia, \nShia upon Sunni. There was not an Iraq connection with al-Qaida prior \nto the war in Iraq.\n  Having said all of that, with respect to the broader war on terror, \nwhen we open the newspaper this morning and we see the front page of \nthe Washington Post--and I suspect every other daily paper in this \ncountry--and we see the pictures of terrorists who will now be \ntransferred to Guantanamo and be brought to justice, all of us say to \nthe President it is the right thing to do. We support that. Yes, this \nis progress. We understand that progress and we salute it.\n  My colleague and I believe there is more to do, however. When we talk \nabout the war against terrorism and we talk about al-Qaida and those \nwho have orchestrated the vicious terrorist attacks that have murdered \nso many innocent people in this country and around the world, the point \nis there is one person who is the head of that organization, who has \nadmitted ordering the attacks against this country. That is Osama bin \nLaden. It is 5 long years since 9/11, 2001, and Osama bin Laden is \nstill here.\n  The President, day before yesterday, mentioned Osama bin Laden 17 \ntimes in his speech of 45 minutes. That is appropriate to do, although \nI might observe Osama bin Laden has not been mentioned at all with \nrespect to the war on terror by anyone in the Administration for some \nlong while until a couple of days ago. But I want to describe why I \nthink there is an urgency here and why my colleague, Senator Conrad, \nand I put together an amendment and are offering it to this bill.\n  I have a record here going back to December 13, 2001--it is about \neight pages of Osama bin Laden talking to us, in America, talking to \npeople in the rest of the world, and talking to al-Qaida, his \norganization. It is December 13, 2001; November 2, 2002; February 11, \n2003; February 13, 2003; April 7, 2003; September 10, 2003. I shall not \ngo through the rest of it. But I want to talk about this year. Just \nthis year we have heard from Osama bin Laden on 5 occasions. This chart \nshows January 19 this year. This is from the news report\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nthat evening, Osama bin Laden speaking to the people of the United \nStates and the people of the world. That is the first message this \nyear.\n  Here is the second message, Osama bin Laden speaks again, the head of \nal-Qaida, 5 years after 9/11. On April 23, he issues his second tape of \nthe year.\n  May 23, this year, once again the news reports:\n\n       Bin Laden boasts of masterminding the 9/11 attacks.\n       I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers. Those 19 \n     who attacked this country.\n  June 29 of this year, another news report, the fourth tape of the \nyear by Osama bin Laden.\n  July 1, this year, the fifth tape of the year by Osama bin Laden.\n  We are talking a lot about the war on terrorism. We are talking a lot \nabout al-Qaida. This is the head of al-Qaida. This is the leader of \nthat terrorist group. This is the person who says he masterminded the \nattack against this country, and 5 years after that attack he is still \nsending us messages--five of them in this year alone. My colleague and \nI do not question anyone's commitment to doing the right thing. That is \nnot the purpose of our amendment. My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I \nbelieve, however, that it is important as we put together a piece of \nlegislation providing funding for the Department of Defense, for the \nwar against terrorism, that we decide on focus and priority with \nrespect to one issue and that is bringing to justice the head of an \norganization that attacked this country and is determined to attack \nthis country again.\n  The amendment we have offered is not a particularly complex \namendment. It simply does two things. It asks that the unit in the CIA, \nour intelligence community, that used to exist but was closed be \nreconstituted. Let me describe that unit. I will describe it by a New \nYork Times, July 4, story. The lead of the story is:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency has closed the unit that \n     for a decade had the mission of hunting Osama bin Laden and \n     his top lieutenants, intelligence officials confirmed on \n     Monday. Agency officials said that tracking Mr. bin Laden and \n     his deputies remained a high priority and that the decision \n     to disband the unit was not a sign that the effort had \n     slackened. Instead, the official said, it reflected a belief \n     the agency could better deal with high level threats by \n     focusing on regional trends rather than on specific \n     organizations or individuals.\n\n  Let me quote the former senior CIA official who is quoted by name, \nMr. Michael Scheuer, a former senior CIA official, who was the first \nhead of this unit at the CIA. He said the move ``reflected a view \nwithin the agency that Mr. Bin Laden was no longer the threat he once \nwas.'' Mr. Scheuer says, ``That view is mistaken.''\n  Madam President, our amendment would provide the funds to \nreconstitute that unit, to provide focus, clarity and a specific set of \ngoals. And, second, to require a quarterly classified report to the \nCongress that would describe, from the standpoint of those in the \nintelligence community and the defense community who are involved, what \nthey have done with respect to apprehending and bringing to justice \nthose who head the organization called al-Qaida.\n  My hope and expectation would be that upon passage of this amendment \nmy colleague and I will have provided some more clarity and some more \nfocus and even perhaps some more determination that a significant goal \nof ours is the apprehension of the head of the organization that \nattacked our country. I do not think that apprehension will occur by \naccident. I think it will occur if it is in fact a significant goal and \none that we pursue with the resources and the vigor that is necessary.\n  I understand that there will be some who say that we have other \npriorities; this remains a priority but there are many other things to \ndo. Let me go back to the position that I started with and that is \nthis. We live in a very dangerous world, a very uncertain world. The \nPresident is dead right when he talks about the war on terrorism being \na war in which we must prevail. He is absolutely right that we have to \nwork together and have to be as one as we confront this evil that \nexists around the world.\n  But I also want to point out that we live in a world, now, where, as \nI indicated before, there are almost 30,000 strategic and tactical \nnuclear weapons that exist in this world. Going back to October 11 of \n2001, the threatened loss of one of those nuclear weapons, because of a \nrumor that it had been stolen from the Russian stockpile, caused an \napoplectic seizure in parts of the government because everyone, at that \npoint, in the intelligence community, who had heard of this rumor, knew \nit was plausible and that the detonation of a nuclear weapon in a major \nAmerican city by al-Qaida would be devastating. The consequences of \nthat are impossible to describe. The next terrorist act may render the \nattack of \n9/11/2001, a much less significant attack in terms of casualties. Let's \nhope that is not the case.\n  That is why it is so urgent for us to determine that we are going to \napprehend and bring to justice those who head the al-Qaida organization \nand who masterminded the attack against this country on 9/11/2001. That \nis what our amendment seeks to do, to provide the resources and the \nassistance to make that possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nPryor be added as an original cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if \nhe seeks time on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we have time on the floor. I seek \nrecognition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have not relinquished my right to the \nfloor. I simply asked a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. He is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is an urgent matter. I hope \nvery much our colleagues would support this amendment on a bipartisan \nbasis so that we send the clear message that this country intends to \nhold to account those who organized the attack on America. I think that \nis absolutely essential.\n  I also say to my colleague, if the Senator from Alaska seeks \nrecognition, I will be happy to yield the floor so he can do that.\n  I ask him at this point if he would have an interest in a time \nagreement on the amendment? We were approached earlier with a request \non that matter. I would be happy to explore that, if the Senator from \nAlaska has any interest.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If that is an inquiry to me, I am interested in a time \nagreement, without any question. I am happy to set a time to vote, at \nnoon or at any time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We would be happy to agree to a time. Would noon be an \nacceptable time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are checking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps later on in this discussion we can reach an \nagreement. We would certainly be willing to agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would welcome the opportunity to make \nsome brief comments on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues from North Dakota \nand Colorado and others who are supporting this amendment. In many \nrespects, this gives real focus to what I think is part of the dilemma \nthat we are facing in our battles with al-Qaida and the issues of \nsecurity. A number of us opposed the resolution to go to war in Iraq. I \ndid. I said it was the best vote that I cast in the U.S. Senate. And I \ndid it primarily as a result of listening to military commanders in the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  We had testimony--although he didn't testify personally--from General \nZinni. We listened to General Hoar of the U.S. Marine Corps, actually \nfrom my own State of Massachusetts. We listened to General Wesley Clark \nand General Nash--a number who have been combat commanders. If you look \nback in terms of the history and the testimony of those military \ncommanders, virtually all of them were saying to the Armed Services \nCommittee that we ought to keep our focus\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\non what was really the challenge: Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida, and \nAfghanistan. That was the testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I will not take the time now to repeat the series of statements and \ncomments that were made by the President and the Secretary of Defense. \nI remember the testimony of the Secretary of Defense before the Armed \nServices Committee when he talked about weapons of mass destruction. He \nwas asked at that time by the ranking minority member, Senator Levin. \nHis response was they were north, south, east, and west of Baghdad. \nThat was where the weapons of mass destruction were. That is the \ntestimony of the Secretary of Defense.\n  We remember all of those comments. We saw the Nation move and shift \nthinking that there were weapons of mass destruction, and al-Qaida was \nthe primary force in bringing about 9/11. Of course, there wasn't \nadequate intelligence to justify that. Even the President admitted that \nthere were no weapons of mass destruction. Even the bipartisan 9/11 \nCommission's thorough examination shows very clearly that those were \nthe representations made by the Vice President of the United States.\n  During that period of time, the combat commanders who testified \nunderstood where we were going--the real challenge was finding Osama \nbin Laden. We saw the extraordinary efforts that were made by the \nmilitary, all of which had this Nation focused on trying to get al-\nQaida. The world was supporting the United States. The world understood \nthat the United States had been assaulted and attacked. The world \nintelligence community was coming together and saying we are going to \nhelp the United States of America find the person who perpetrated the \n9/11 attack in the United States. All of that was happening all over \nthe world.\n  Then what happened? The judgment and the decision was made in the \nWhite House: Well, we have the role of going over there to Afghanistan, \nso we are going into Iraq. The rest is history.\n  In spite of the fact that Osama bin Laden was on the run, despite the \nfact that the intelligence reports showed that he was just within hours \nof almost getting captured, the diversion of both troops and diversion \nof focus, the diversion of intelligence went to Iraq.\n  Now we have an amendment to try to get us back in focus on the \nprimary individual who was the organizer of 9/11.\n  I share the concerns that have been stated by both Senators and the \nfrustration when the judgment and decision was made by the Pentagon \nthat they no longer had the priority of going after bin Laden.\n  We all understand the complexities of trying to find him in the \nmountainous areas around Afghanistan's border and into Pakistan. We all \nunderstand those complexities and those difficulties and the political \nproblems and all the rest. But, nonetheless, we had the world combined \nto find him and bring him to account. We have failed to do so.\n  I think this amendment brings the Senate, in hopefully a bipartisan \nway, to say we want to give focus and attention to finding and bringing \nto justice Osama bin Laden.\n  Listening to Senators, I am mindful that at the end of this year we \nwill have been fighting the war in Iraq longer than we fought in World \nWar II. Understand that we took on the Germans in western Europe, north \nAfrica, the Japanese in the Far East, mobilizing 12 million to 14 \nmillion people over this period of time. And we will have by the end of \nthe year--we are now in September--we have been fighting in Iraq longer \nthan we fought in World War II--28 million people. We virtually \noccupied with air supremacy over the whole country--the top third of it \nand the lower third of it was a heavy embargo, violations of embargoes. \nBut the amount was $14 billion a year in terms of the military, and we \nnow have servicemen still weighted down over there.\n\n  I agree with those who said the service men and women have done their \njob. The politicians haven't done theirs with regard to Iraq.\n  That doesn't get away from the point that our focus has been diverted \nto Iraq.\n  We have seen the number of al-Qaida grow. According to the National \nSecurity Project, in 2001 it was 20,000. In 2006, it is 50,000. The \nnumber of al-Qaida terrorist attacks 5 years before 1991 was 3. But now \nthe number 5 years since 9/11 is 30. We have the growth happening all \nover the world and no accounting for Osama bin Laden.\n  This is what has happened with al-Qaida. The number of significant \nglobal terrorist attacks reported by the U.S. State Department in 2003 \nwas 175. The number exceeded 3,000 in 2004, and 11,000 in 2005.\n  Look at the growth. We are weighted down in Iraq, and Osama bin Laden \nis out there someplace.\n  This amendment makes a great deal of sense. I thank both my \ncolleagues for doing something. This is a small amount of resources \nwhich are asked for. Look at what we are spending, more than $200 \nmillion a day in Iraq. I believe this is $20 million--$200 million a \nday we are spending in Iraq.\n  Do we realize that if we weren't spending $200 million a day--and \nover $350 billion has been expended--what we could have done with \nregard to homeland security? How could we have protected Americans with \nthose resources more effectively? How could we have gone after al-Qaida \nmore effectively? How could we have enhanced the security of the \nAmerican people more effectively?\n  This has been a catastrophic miscalculation on the part of the \nadministration, and the amendment of the Senators is trying to give \nfocus and attention and priority to where we ought to give focus and \nattention and priority.\n  I commend them for doing something.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted and embraced and passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it has been cleared on this side by \nSenator Inouye and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto the pending Conrad amendment at 12 noon, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote, and with the time equally \ndivided between the two managers or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no objection on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am, as are the Senators from North \nDakota, quite worried about this amendment. It is my intention to ask \nthe Senate to vote. It is my understanding that they want a vote on \nthis amendment. It is my intention to ask every Senator to vote for the \namendment.\n  It is a political season. I understand that. I consider this \namendment to be a slam at the intelligence community.\n  I can tell the Senate that there is more money than this available. \nIf I tried to discuss the amount of money which is available, I would \nbe violating my oath as far as confidential and classified material. \nFor reasons of national security, I cannot elaborate on that.\n  I arranged for the two Senators from North Dakota to be briefed about \nthe programs which Senator Inouye and I know about. We urged them not \nto offer this amendment. There are many funds dedicated in our bill for \nthe global war on terrorism. There are funds in our bill to continue \nthe search for Osama bin Laden. That has never lapsed. It does not need \nthis amendment.\n  The classified annex accompanying this bill provides details of \nclassified programs in this bill, and they are available to every \nSenator in room 405 if they want to question my view. Those were \noffered to the Senators from North Dakota. I do not know whether they \ntook advantage of that or not.\n  We cannot discuss those programs here. We would jeopardize the lives \nof many people if we did so.\n  I know of no way to handle this amendment except, as I said, I ask \nall Senators to join and vote for this amendment and to trust Senator \nInouye and myself to find a way to deal with it in conference. Maybe \nthe Senate will listen to us when we come back.\n  I remember once, years ago when I offered an amendment to provide \nfunds to deal with Osama bin Laden, offering a reward of dead or alive. \nThat was objected to by a Member on the other side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\n  I note that this amendment says to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. \nTo bring him to justice--does that mean dead or alive? Must we keep him \nalive if we find him?\n  There are a lot of things we could discuss on the floor of the Senate \nabout this issue.\n  I am going to sit down in a minute and I am not going to answer any \nquestions. I am not going to discuss it any more because I consider it \nto be an irresponsible amendment that should never have been brought \nbefore the Senate.\n  With all of these pictures, it is a campaign period. But to imply to \nthe American public that we have not been looking for Osama bin Laden \nfor years--I can tell you, I am not going to press my friend from \nHawaii, but we have spent hours and hours and hours with the \nintelligence community seeing how we can better devise methods to find \nthis man.\n  I can assure the Senate that without any question the search for \nOsama bin Laden has not been hampered by a lack of funds. It has not \nbeen hampered by a lack of funds in this bill. If I tried to tell you \nwhere the funds are, I would violate my oath.\n  It is time for us to come to some understanding about what led to \nthis amendment. It was the President's statement the other day. I was \nthere. The conversation on this floor misses the point. It was not \nHitler during World War II he was talking about; it was Hitler before \nWorld War II. Let me quote what he said on September 5. I listened to \nit. He said:\n\n       In the 1920's, a failed Austrian painter published a book \n     in which he explained his intention to build an Aryan super-\n     state in Germany and take revenge in Europe and eradicate the \n     Jews. The world ignored Hitler's words, and paid a terrible \n     price. His Nazi regime killed millions in gas chambers, and \n     set the world aflame in war, before it was finally defeated \n     at a terrible cost in lives.\n       Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their \n     intention as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them. The \n     question is: Will we listen? Will we pay attention to what \n     these evil men say?\n\n  The world can tell I am close to losing my famous temper. I do have \none. As I said, I arranged for these Members to be briefed on \ninformation that is in this classified annex. I don't understand this \namendment.\n  I intend to let the Senators have their half of the time. The balance \nof the time will be spent in a quorum.\n  I yield to my friend from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the record should show that there are \nsignificant amounts of money allocated in this bill to several \nagencies. But to go beyond that and discuss in greater detail would be, \nas the chairman indicated, a violation of the rules of classification. \nI will cease at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague that it is a curious \nconclusion to suggest that adding more resources to the intelligence \ncommunity for the purpose of bringing to justice Osama bin Laden is a \nslap in the face to the intelligence community. It is no slap in the \nface to the intelligence community. If anything, it is a vote of \nconfidence in the intelligence community.\n  We owe the country this debate and this discussion. I believed when \nwe went to Iraq we were making a mistake. I said on the floor of the \nSenate right before that vote that I thought we were diverting our \nattention from those who attacked us. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin \nLaden, not Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein. The simple fact is we have not \nbrought them to justice.\n  The Senator wonders, what does it mean to bring to justice? We all \nknow what it means to bring someone to justice. Osama bin Laden \ndeserves to be brought to justice. There is no one in this Chamber who \ndoesn't know what that means.\n  The Senator says this amendment is irresponsible. I think it would be \nirresponsible not to have this amendment.\n  The Senator indicated that he asked us to be further briefed \nyesterday. We did that. There is not one thing I heard in that room \nthat doesn't tell me that what we are seeking to do here is not the \nright thing, the responsible thing. We cannot talk about those \nbriefings, and we will not talk about them.\n  Finally, I say to my colleague, this is not political with me. I \ndon't need a political amendment. Anyone who has analyzed my race knows \nthat what I am saying is true. I don't need a political amendment. I \nhave a responsibility to my constituents and to the future of our \ncountry. I believe deeply we have not done the job of protecting \nAmerica when we have failed for 5 years to get the man and the \nleadership cadre of al-Qaida that organized the attack on this country. \nI don't choose to make this political.\n  I made very clear in my statement that I don't question for one \nmoment the commitment of this administration to protect America. I \ndon't question for one moment the intention of every Member on both \nsides of this aisle to protect our country. I don't question that. I \ndid not make this a political matter; I make this a matter of policy--\nwhat is the right thing to do for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are areas of classified information \nthat are not discussed in the Senate. Senator Conrad has just described \nthat we both have had access to that information. It is the information \nto which my colleagues allude. There is nothing--I repeat, nothing--\nthat we are doing here that does anything to injure anything else that \nwas being done anywhere, at any time. There is nothing here that does \ninjury to anything I know about.\n  Frankly, it is far too easy to jump up from a chair in the Senate and \nallege that the amendment you do not like is somehow borne of politics. \nYes, there is a barrel full of politics around these days, a barrel \nfull of politics in this Chamber and downtown. We know it when we see \nit. But I think it ill serves this discussion to talk about \nirresponsibility, to talk about politics on the issue of what the role \nof this country is, the determination and the resolve of this country, \nto decide to provide more focus, more clarity, and more energy to \napprehending the head of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the person who \nmasterminded the attack against this country. Again, there is never a \ncircumstance where anyone would find myself or my colleague, Senator \nConrad, coming to the Senate to do injury to anything else we are doing \nin this country together.\n  I indicated when I started that I don't think the fight against \nterrorism is about Democrats or Republicans. It is certainly not about \npolitics, or shouldn't be. However, it is almost unbelievable to me \nthat this amendment is described as ``political season'' campaign \nperiod-motivated and, even more, a slam at our national security. \nNothing could be further from the truth than that. This is not slamming \nanyone. This is trying to provide additional resources, additional \nfocus, additional energy toward a goal that I hope every \nsingle American shares. In fact, I bet we would be hard pressed to find \nan American citizen who says this is not a worthy goal for our country.\n\n  My colleague has said that there has been a continuing, unwavering \neffort to apprehend the top of the terrorist groups, including the \nleaders of al-Qaida. Let me read, from 2002, the President's response \nwhen asked about Osama bin Laden:\n\n       I don't know where he is. I know I just don't spend much \n     time on him, to be honest. I am not truly that concerned \n     about him. I know he's on the run.\n\n  The fact is, there have been times when we have been diverted to \nother areas. Does anyone here believe Iraq has not detracted \nsubstantially from what is happening in Afghanistan? Does anyone here \nbelieve that? Most of us have been over those mountains. I have flown \nover those mountains and looked down at the mountains between \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. That is where most believe Osama bin Laden is \nhiding, among supporters. I understand how difficult it is to apprehend \nsomeone hiding in that region. I don't diminish the difficulty and the \ncomplexity of accomplishing that mission.\n  My colleague and I offered an amendment which is relatively simple \nwhich tries to provide more focus and more clarity on the goal, which \ntries to provide resources. These resources are not dramatic or \nsubstantial resources relative to the amount of money we have been \nspending, for example, in Iraq.\n  A Member brings an amendment to the floor and someone says: This is \npolitical, this is campaign season. That is too easy. I don't think \nthat treats serious issues seriously enough. This is an\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nissue which is serious. It is an issue that deserves attention by this \nCongress, deserves a statement by this Congress, which I expect we will \nmake unanimously, I hope we will make unanimously. It is a statement \nthat almost every American, I believe, would say they agree with, a \nstatement that says to the American people: Here is a priority, a very \nsubstantial priority for which we will dedicate the resources and \nrededicate ourselves to address these issues.\n  My understanding is the Senator from Alaska will seek a quorum call, \nwhich is just fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened with great interest to both of my friends and \ncolleagues in their comments.\n  As I understand, the amount included in the Senator's amendment is \n$200 million to be expended over a 2-year period?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the Senator mentioned a figure, and it is my \nunderstanding we are spending $200 million a day, virtually, in Iraq at \nthe present time. I think that gives some proportion as to requested \nresources--$200 million a day in Iraq and $200 million over a 2-year \nperiod for this effort.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think the Senator puts in perspective the amount of \nmoney that is being described.\n  Let me finally say that I noticed yesterday--I was not in the Senate, \nbut I had the television on--noticed the same issue developing \nyesterday on an amendment my colleague offered. There was a suggestion \nthat this is all political, all politics, every time someone offers an \namendment that someone disagrees with. That is total nonsense. This \nissue deserves much more serious treatment and much more serious debate \nthan that.\n  I am pleased that apparently there will be a unanimous vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will discuss a bit more fully what led \nme to this amendment. It is not the President's comments of several \ndays ago. That was not the genesis of this amendment. I have believed \nsince we went to war in Iraq--anyone can look at the record and what I \nsaid in this Senate the night of the vote--I said then that I believed \ngoing to Iraq was a distraction. I believe it diverted our attention \nand resources from going after the al-Qaida leadership that organized \nthe attack on America. I said that then. I believed it then. I believe \nit now.\n  I have a bit of a different background from many of my colleagues. I \nwent to high school at an American military base in Tripoli, Libya, \nNorth Africa. I lived in the Arab culture. One of the ironies was the \nSenator from Alaska suggested this is a slap in the face at the \nintelligence community. My family served in the intelligence services \nof our country in that part of the world. I am precluded from going \nfurther than that because of classification issues. I have great \nrespect for those who serve in the clandestine and the intelligence \nservices of our country. I have consulted many of them in writing this \namendment.\n  I believe deeply this is the right approach to operationalize, to \nmore fully fund the efforts, not only to get Osama bin Laden--although \nI believe he is at the top of the list--I also believe it is critically \nimportant to get Zawahiri, I believe it is critically important to get \nMullah Omar. I regret deeply that resources were transferred from \nAfghanistan to Iraq. that we had forces that were experts in Arab \nculture and Arab language and we shifted them to Iraq.\n\n  The hard reality is, while there have been successes, which I \nacknowledged in my opening remarks--I would say to the Senator from \nAlaska, there have been very excellent successes. Getting Zarqawi, \nthank God, we got him. Thank goodness for each of those who have been \ncaptured and taken out of operational involvement in planning \nadditional attacks on the country.\n  But the job is not done. We know that. I believe very strongly that \nwe made a strategic error in going to Iraq. I said it then, I say it \nnow. I believe the focus and the energy and the attention ought to have \ngone--the priority ought to have been al-Qaida, its leadership, and its \nworldwide network.\n  I believe this is fundamentally different than World War II. I \nbelieve this is a long and difficult struggle. I believe this is a \ndangerous world. I believe there are people who are plotting right now \nto again attack our country. And I want to be part of an effort to do \neverything we can to stop them. That is why I offer this amendment, and \nfor no other reason.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dayton be added \nas an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 49 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me read one additional piece I did not \ndescribe in my earlier presentation. Let me read from the State \nDepartment's latest report on terrorism because I think it is important \nfor all of us to understand.\n  This is, again, from the U.S. State Department's latest report on \nterrorism:\n\n       Al-Qaida's top leaders continue to plot and direct terror \n     attacks worldwide. . . . Over the past four years, al-Qaida, \n     its affiliates and those inspired by the group were also \n     involved in many anti-U.S. or anti-coalition attacks in \n     Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \n     Iraq, including suicide bombings and vehicle-borne improvised \n     explosive devices.\n\n  Again, the first sentence:\n\n       Al-Qaida's top leaders continue to plot and direct terror \n     attacks worldwide. . . .\n\n  ``Direct terror attacks worldwide''--it is why I think there is no \nmore important goal for this country than to add additional resources, \nprovide additional focus to this question of bringing to justice the \nhead of the organization that has attacked this country and that now \norganizes and expands and continues to attack around the rest of the \nworld.\n  I previously described that just in this year alone we have been the \nrecipients of five messages from Osama bin Laden--five just this year. \nIt has been dozens since 2001. I think all of us share a goal and the \nview that we need to apprehend and bring to justice those who head the \norganization that attacked this country.\n  Fighting terrorism is difficult and dangerous and complex. We \nunderstand all that. All of us salute our troops. All of us want to \nwork together. As I have indicated, this is not about Republicans and \nDemocrats. It is about Americans sharing and aspiring to achieve a \ngoal. And that goal is to defeat terrorism.\n  I think the most effective and important way to defeat terrorism, \nhowever, is to try to dismantle the organization, and especially \ndismantle the organization by apprehending the head of that \norganization and bringing the head and top officials of that \norganization to justice.\n  That has not been done, and we are not blaming anybody. I join my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, in saluting those in our intelligence \nservice and our military who risk their lives every day. But I believe \nit is very important for us, as we put together a piece of legislation \nwith substantial resources, to provide greater clarity and focus on \nthis goal. That is why Senator Conrad and I have written this amendment \nand offer it today.\n  I understand there are some who do not want it offered, do not want \nto have this discussion. I respectfully believe they are wrong. I do \nnot allege that they have political motives. I just believe they are \nwrong. My hope is,\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\nwhen the Senate speaks to this, it will have accomplished something \nthat is productive and substantial in its comments on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are other Members who are on their \nway who wish to speak on this matter. I do not know if they will make \nit.\n  Senator Menendez has arrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to Senator Menendez, we could give you 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator \nConrad's and Senator Dorgan's amendment and to join with them in it.\n  It seems to me, as someone who on the anniversary of September 11 is \nreminded of the 700 New Jersey lives that were lost on that fateful \nday, as well as all of those other Americans who lost their lives on \nthat fateful day, that the central figure, the individual who was the \nmastermind of their deaths, who struck on that fateful day, is Osama \nbin Laden. It is very clear to me that we must either catch or kill \nOsama bin Laden, the mastermind of those attacks.\n  I know many Americans were as shocked as I was when they heard the \nnews reports that the administration had allegedly closed down or \nrealigned the Osama bin Laden unit at the CIA. And while there is a \nvery difficult process to publicly confirm these reports, I believe the \nSenate must make it very clear that the United States can in no way \nreduce or dilute our efforts to kill or capture Osama bin Laden.\n  With this amendment, we ensure that not only is that unit not \ndisbanded and not merged and not diluted, but, in fact, we ensure that \nwe increase our efforts.\n  To anyone who would like to argue that we do not need to focus on al-\nQaida or bin Laden, I would remind them that just because there has not \nbeen another terrorist attack on U.S. soil that does not mean al-Qaida \nhas been eliminated or that bin Laden has been rendered ineffective.\n  So I am in incredibly strong support of Senator Conrad's amendment. \nPerhaps the face of Islamic terrorism has evolved, but he still is our \ncentral focus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nAnd I thank both of my colleagues from North Dakota for offering this \noutstanding amendment.\n  If there were ever a metaphor for what is wrong with the war on \nterror, it is the fact that Osama bin Laden is alive. He continues to \ntaunt us on al Jazeera broadcasts that we have not found him.\n  Now, if we said we were doing everything we could to find him, that \nwould be one thing. But the unit to get him was disbanded. Many report \nthat the number of troops in Afghanistan is not adequate. They have \njust asked for more today. And he is our No. 1 danger.\n  So I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this \namendment. The fact that 5 years after 9/11 we have not yet found bin \nLaden shows we can do a whole lot better in the war on terror than we \nare doing.\n  This amendment will help bring us there. I urge full bipartisan \nsupport of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I announce to the Senate that the next \nvote will be Senator Domenici's 13,000th vote.\n  I also announce to the Senate that my younger brother, from Hawaii, \nSenator Inouye, has a birthday today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope every Senator will vote for the \namendment. I don't know any Senator who will vote against providing \nmoney to continue the search for Osama bin Laden. If I could disclose \nto you how much money is in this bill otherwise for a classified \nprogram, you would understand why this is a superfluous amendment.\n  Understanding that nobody would want to vote against something like \nthis, if this amendment becomes law, the freedom of information \nprovisions would mean all of the activities would be available to \nanybody. This is not a classified $200 million to search for bin Laden. \nAgain, it is irresponsible, but I would not vote against the amendment. \nI don't want to be known for voting against additional money to search \nfor Osama bin Laden.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Senator's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4907 offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nIsakson), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 235 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Chambliss\n     Isakson\n     Lieberman\n     Santorum\n  The amendment (No. 4907) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n       Congratulating Senator Pete Domenici On His 13,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on this last rollcall vote, No. 235, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, the current chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, and the former long-serving \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Pete Domenici, cast his \n13,000th vote in this Chamber--13,000 votes. Senator Domenici now joins \na very historic and select club of Senators who can claim this \ndistinction. Senators now cast more votes than ever in each Congress, \nso while historical records are not perfect, the Senate Librarian says \nthat we are safe to conclude that among all Senators who have served \nsince the beginning of the Republic, Senator Domenici is in a class of \nonly eight. Since the beginning of the Republic, only seven other \nSenators have similarly cast more than 13,000 votes in their careers in \nthe Senate, and four of them are serving today. The club of seven now \nbecomes the club of eight with Senator Domenici's last vote here today.\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\n  Those other seven Senators are Senator Clayburn Pell, the current \nPresident pro tempore, Senator Ted Stevens, Senator Ted Kennedy, \nSenator Daniel Inouye, Senator Ernest Hollings, the late Senator Strom \nThurmond, and with over 17,733 votes, the all-time record, Senator \nRobert C. Byrd.\n  Senator Domenici, I know I speak for all of your fellow Senators when \nI say congratulations on this achievement. But more importantly, thank \nyou for your tremendous service over the years to New Mexico, to your \ncountry, and importantly to the U.S. Senate.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, why would I, the Democratic leader of the \nSenate, stand to offer effusive praise for my Republican colleague, the \nSenator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici? The reason is, I know him. He \nis my friend. Pete Domenici and I have worked on a subcommittee that is \nso important to this country, Energy and Water. My entire tenure in the \nSenate has been with him. The last many years Senator Domenici and I \nhave worked as ranking member and chair. Whoever controls the Senate, \nDemocrat or Republican, the person whose party is controlling becomes \nthe chairman, the member of the other party becomes the ranking member \nof that committee. It doesn't matter to Pete Domenici or Harry Reid, as \nit relates to that subcommittee, which is the party in power because we \nhave worked as partners on that subcommittee. We have done some \ntremendously important things for this country, not only in funding \nimportant projects but changing policy.\n  I like Pete Domenici for a number of reasons. I admire Pete Domenici \nfor a number of reasons. As a boy, I wanted more than anything else to \nbe a baseball player. I wanted to be a good baseball player. In my \nchild's mind, I figured I could be. But as I got older, I didn't run \nvery fast. I wasn't as strong as I thought I was, so my baseball career \nwas not much to write home about. Pete Domenici's is. Pete Domenici was \na pitcher. Pete Domenici pitched for a farm club of one of my favorite \nbaseball teams, the Dodgers, where my good, close friend, Hall of Famer \nGreg Maddux, now pitches.\n  Pete Domenici will not make the Hall of Fame for baseball, but he \nwill for U.S. Senator. He is a wonderful man.\n  One reason he is as good as he is is because of the woman he married \nin 1958 by the name of Nancy Burke. They are a wonderful team. I admire \nand respect them both very much. They have a wonderful family, a large \nfamily--two sons and six daughters.\n  I congratulate Pete Domenici, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to add my congratulations to \nSenator Domenici on this great achievement, achieving this milestone of \nbecoming one of eight Senators in the history of our country to have \ncast this many votes.\n  I have had the good fortune in the 24 years I have been here in the \nSenate to serve with Senator Domenici, and also, of course more \nrecently, to serve with him on the Energy Committee as the ranking \nmember. I have seen the leadership he has provided to deal with our \nenergy issues.\n  He is the longest serving Senator to have served from the State of \nNew Mexico. Of course, he has cast more votes on behalf of the people \nof the State of New Mexico than anyone in the history of this country. \nFor that he deserves great recognition.\n  The people of the State I represent recognize his great contribution \nand appreciate it greatly. I congratulate him today on reaching this \nmilestone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, let me say thank you to \neach Senator who commented on my many years of voting, which has \nyielded 13,000 today. I thank you very much and, in particular, I thank \nthe majority leader for doing what he has done, by setting aside these \nfew moments. I greatly appreciate it.\n  I guess it is pretty easy to get to 13,000. You just stick around \nlong enough and come and vote and you will get there. I don't know how \nmany more I will get but certainly a lot more because there are a lot \nof years left to come. I don't know how many we will be celebrating, \nbut this is a very special one because of the special people who are \nhere, indicating to me in their own gracious way their appreciation for \nwhat I do or don't do in the Senate. I thank all of them for that.\n  Frankly, I don't feel as if I have cast 13,000 votes, so I don't know \nwhat that means. Maybe it means I have a lot more to come. I hope so. \nMaybe it means we are voting a lot more in the Senate than we used to.\n  In any event, it is a proud day because you all have made it one. \nThank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, before I speak to an amendment, let me \njoin in the commendations to our colleague, Senator Domenici. I am \nprivileged to serve on the Energy Committee which Senator Domenici \nchairs. I appreciate his leadership, as well as his commitment to our \ncountry. I am pleased to join the many voices that have spoken about \nhis service.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4909\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4909.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for a public relations program \ndesigned to monitor news media in the United States and the Middle East \n and create a database of news stories to promote positive coverage of \n                            the war in Iraq)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8019. (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Certain \n     Public Relations Activities.--None of the amounts \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be \n     obligated or expended for a public relations program designed \n     to monitor news media in the United States and the Middle \n     East and create a database of news stories to promote \n     positive coverage of the war in Iraq.\n       (b) Scope.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to programs and activities of the Department of Defense \n     directed at collecting or analyzing information in the news \n     media.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould limit funds for any future public relations campaign being \ncommissioned by the Pentagon to promote positive coverage of the war in \nIraq. We first learned about this $20 million PR campaign to improve \nthe image of President Bush's Iraq policy in the Washington Post last \nweek. In my mind, this proposal is not just irresponsible, it is an \ninsult to the thousands of Iraqi citizens and coalition forces who have \ndied in this war. At a time when this violent insurgency continues to \nexpand and American troops are putting their lives on the line day in \nand day out, what is the administration's focus? A better public \nrelations campaign? The Bush administration doesn't need a new PR \ncampaign in Iraq. They need a new policy in Iraq.\n  We must change the course in Iraq, not waste time or money for public \nrelations efforts. We must work to reduce the insurgency, not suppress \nnews reports of its existence. We must strive to improve the situation \non the ground in Iraq, not focus on changing the spin. That is why I am \noffering this amendment that would prohibit funds being used for this \ntype of public relations campaign.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment prohibits the use of funds for a \npublic relations campaign and a database of news stories that is \ndesigned to promote positive coverage of the war. But the amendment \nspecifically does not prohibit the normal work of the Department of \nDefense for collecting or analyzing information in the news\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\nmedia. The fact is, we do not need more propaganda. We need a new \npolicy. I can certainly understand why the Bush administration would \nwant to sugarcoat the news coming out of Iraq. The facts and the \nfigures about the reality on the ground tell a somber story.\n  When more than 250 Iraqis were killed last week alone, and the \nkillings continue today; when kidnapping by those wearing Iraqi \nsecurity force uniforms becomes commonplace, and average Iraqis now \nflee from Iraqis in uniform; when the U.S. Special Inspector General \nfor Iraq Reconstruction comes out with a report that paints a picture \nof incompetence, fraud, and failure, and USAID, the agency in charge of \nover $1.4 billion in reconstruction, has been hiding millions of \ndollars in construction overruns and failing to report the true costs \nand problems to the Congress; when some Iraqis are now too afraid to go \nto the morgue to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones for fear of \nbeing killed or kidnapped themselves; and when instead of reducing \ntroops, thousands of troops have been ordered to go to Baghdad, and an \nArmy brigade had its tours extended, it is time to change the course in \nIraq.\n  It is certainly easy to see why the Bush administration is afraid of \nthe truth, and it is no surprise that a CNN poll released on Monday \nshowed that 61 percent of Americans said they oppose the war as it is \nin Iraq, the highest opposition shown in any CNN poll since the war \nbegan.\n  For those in the Bush administration who complain that the media only \nreports bad news coming out of Iraq, I invite them to look at the facts \nand figures offered by the Pentagon itself last week. In its latest \nreport to Congress, the Pentagon found that Iraqi casualties are up by \nmore than 50 percent in recent months. Violence in Iraq continues to \nrise, and innocent Iraqi civilians are paying the price. The casualty \nrate is now almost 120 a day, compared to 30 a day 2 years ago.\n  The President continues to speak of progress, but the numbers tell a \ndifferent story. From the time the new Iraqi Government was established \non May 20, until August 11, the number of attacks were almost 800 per \nweek. That is a huge increase from the beginning of the year and almost \ndouble from the beginning of 2004. So it is clear that the Bush policy \nin Iraq simply is not working, and it is time for a new direction.\n  The President needs to realize that we do not need a new propaganda \ncampaign, we need a new policy. Frankly, I personally never believed \nthe administration's false arguments about why we should go to war in \nIraq, and I believe this administration never had a strategy for \nsuccess in Iraq, and that is why I voted against the war in Iraq even \nwhen that vote was unpopular. That is why I am standing up for a new \ndirection in Iraq today.\n  The President led us into this war based on false premises and false \npromises. President Bush went into the war without a plan to win the \npeace.\n  Unfortunately, this administration still doesn't have a real plan for \nsuccess in Iraq. Our soldiers have performed bravely under the most \ndifficult of circumstances. But as Iraq moves closer and closer to an \nall-out civil war, as even the commander, General Abizaid, admitted was \npossible, it is time to change policy.\n  The fact is that the war in Iraq has hurt us along the way in terms \nof our national security. By changing course in Iraq, we can make our \nown country more secure.\n  I look back at Hurricane Katrina just a year ago. I see the terrible \nprice the people of the gulf paid when their National Guard troops were \naway in Iraq and unable to protect their neighbors here at home. Our \nhomeland is simply less secure when our National Guard and Reserves are \nbeing kept in permanent rotation in Iraq.\n  This war has also distracted us from the great international security \nthreats to the United States. While the administration is focused on \nthe war in Iraq, North Korea has only become more defiant because they \nknow we are bogged down in Iraq and have lost credibility with the \ninternational community.\n  Under this administration, North Korea has conducted launched missile \ntests and has likely increased the size of its nuclear arsenal. They \nhave withdrawn from the Non-proliferation Treaty. The Congressional \nResearch Service has estimated that the number of simple, fission-type \nweapons produced by the North Koreans prior to 2001 was between zero \nand two. Now this defiant regime has an estimated three to nine nuclear \nweapons.\n  While the administration has been distracted in Iraq, Iran has also \nbecome more defiant and has started enriching uranium, flaunting an \ninternational package designed to help end their nuclear weapons \nprogram, and is supporting Hezbollah's attacks against Israel.\n  It is in Afghanistan that we have paid one of the heaviest security \ncosts for the war in Iraq. The bottom line is the administration never \nfinished the job in Afghanistan. Afghanistan--not Iraq--was the right \nplace to pursue the national security of the United States. It was in \nAfghanistan--not Iraq--that the murderers of September 11 were located. \nOur lack of attention and resources in Afghanistan has allowed the \ncountry to once again become a land of increased turmoil.\n  Many of us have been horrified as we have watched the resurgence of \nTaliban and strong anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan. In the past \n3 years, there have been 284 attacks by the Taliban, and the number of \nsuicide attacks continues to rise sharply. We have also seen poppy \ncultivation more than double since 1999. That ultimately is what \nemanates the opium on the streets of our cities and across the world.\n  I believe it is long past time for the United States to focus \nattention on Afghanistan and on the current threats from Iran and North \nKorea.\n  Let me simply say that the war in Iraq has not helped quell \nterrorism. In fact, it has fueled the proliferation of terrorist \norganizations and has increased instability in Iraq at the expense of \nour Nation's economy and the lives of our service men and women. The \nIraq war has drained our Treasury of $320 billion. Well over 2,600 of \nour bravest men and women have lost their lives, and nearly 20,000 have \nbeen injured. That is the most fundamental issue facing our country \ntoday.\n  Three and a half years into the war and the administration's \noverhyped spin has become unwound. Predictions that we would be greeted \nas liberators have proven false, and the President's partisan attacks \non anyone who dares criticize his failed policy have led to the hollow \ntruth behind both the original decision to go to war and the propaganda \nhe and his supporters still spew forth every day. The facts are as \nclear as the day, and a majority of Americans know the decision to \ninvade Iraq was the wrong one.\n  In light of this knowledge, it is time to tell the President that we \ndon't need a new propaganda campaign; we need a new policy. It is time \nto make clear that the Defense bill should be about flak jackets for \nour troops, not PR flak for the Bush administration. That is why I have \noffered this amendment which tells the administration to forget about \nthe spin and concentrate on the mission at hand.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. What is this? I thought we would dispose of \nthe Menendez amendment first. Are there further speakers on the \namendment? I would like to see the amendment. Will the Senator agree to \na time agreement for a vote on the Menendez amendment? Will Senator \nMenendez agree to vote at a time certain on his amendment?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Sure. I would consider such an agreement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't believe my amendment will take much time. It \nmight be good to dispose of both of them together.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. I hope we can get a time agreement for a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4897\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4897.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4897) is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make available up to an additional $700,000,000 for Drug \n   Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities to combat the growth of \npoppies in Afghanistan, to eliminate the production and trade of opium \n   and heroin, and to prevent terrorists from using the proceeds for \n   terrorist activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and to \n         designate the additional amount as emergency spending)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109. (a) Additional Amount for Drug Interdiction and \n     Counter-Drug Activities.--The amount appropriated by title VI \n     under the heading ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug \n     Activities'' is hereby increased by $700,000,000, with the \n     amount of the increase designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007, \n     as made applicable in the Senate by section 7035 of Public \n     Law 109-234.\n       (b) Availability.--Of the amount appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by title VI under the heading ``Drug \n     Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities'', as increased by \n     subsection (a), up to an additional $700,000,000 may be \n     available to combat the growth of poppies in Afghanistan, to \n     eliminate the production and trade of opium and heroin, and \n     to prevent terrorists from using the proceeds for terrorist \n     activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere.\n       (c) Supplement Not Supplant.--The amount available under \n     subsection (b) for the purpose set forth in that subsection \n     is in addition to any other amounts available in this Act for \n     that purpose.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill to \naddress what is literally a growing problem in the fight on the war on \nterror. We are not really doing enough to counteract an ever-increasing \nproduction of opium in Afghanistan, a problem that is threatening the \never fragile Government. Not only does opium production fuel its heroin \ntrade around the globe, but the heroin funds terrorists who aim to \nattack America and our allies around the world.\n  We all note the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. One of \nthe main reasons that situation is deteriorating is the opium \nproduction is increasing dramatically. It will increase by a huge 50 \npercent over last year. A large portion of the opium trade is \ncontrolled by the Taliban, the very people who provide the ``warm'' \nreception.\n  I say that with sarcasm. It is due to bin Laden and al-Qaida. And yet \nthe Taliban is increasing their reach, their strength, their hold on \nthe country, and their wealth through opium.\n  As I mentioned, there has been a surge by over 50 percent over the \nlast year's harvest, a surge in production largely in the southern part \nof the country where the Taliban has reasserted control. It is in part \nbecause we have abandoned Afghanistan and the country is steadily \ndescending into chaos as we have less and less to say over it. We have \nabandoned large parts, and opium rules.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to the fact. Afghanistan now \nsupplies more than 90 percent of the world's opium. In this year alone, \nthere were over 400,000 acres of poppies planted, compared to 250,000 \nacres in 2005--a 50-percent increase. Why is this happening? It is \nhappening in Afghanistan because the administration failed to finish \nthe job when we changed our focus to Iraq, and now the country is \nswarming with corrupt warlords and the Taliban is once again taking \ncontrol over a large portion of the country. Our soldiers fought long \nand hard to rid Afghanistan of terrorists and the Taliban; however, if \nthe drug trade continues to surge and consume the nation, their heroic \nefforts may be undone.\n  The Taliban draws its strength from the drug trade, and in order to \nprevent them from reclaiming the country, we need to crack down on the \ndrugs that fuel its regime. The Taliban generates an amazing 70 percent \nof its income through the production and sale of opium. Those poppies \ngenerate a whole lot of money. This year's opium harvest is worth \nroughly $4 billion.\n  In addition, the Taliban is fueling the production of opium from \nbehind the scenes and using the profits to fund its brutal and \noppressive regime. Every night, the Taliban drops off ``night letters'' \nencouraging poor Afghan farmers to grow poppies in exchange for \n``protection.'' Unfortunately, just like in ``The Godfather,'' that is \nan offer they cannot refuse.\n  Now Afghanistan's narcotrade is spreading outside its borders and \nfunding insurgents and foreign terrorists in Iraq. Money from the sale \nof Afghan-produced heroin is being used by terrorists to buy weapons \nand equipment, to create improvised explosive devices, and to pay \nordinary Iraqi citizens to attack U.S. soldiers in Iraq. If foreign \nterrorists are using Afghanistan's opium production to fund their \ndeadly activities in Iraq, what is to stop them from using the same \nfunds to attack the United States? On 9/11, it is estimated that the \nhorrible acts by al-Qaida cost only $500,000 to carry out. Can you \nimagine how many more attacks they could carry out given how huge the \nprofits are from Afghanistan's opium?\n  Given the magnitude of this problem, a total of $350 million to the \nDepartments of State and Defense to fight opium in this part of the \nworld is not enough. Those funds weren't enough--it is proven fact--\nwhen the production has doubled in a year's time. I am not saying the \nfunds are not being used effectively. They may well be. They are \nclearly not enough. Fighting Afghanistan's drug production and trade is \nelemental to our success in fighting global terrorism. It is essential \nto protect our troops in Iraq, keep Afghanistan from descending into \nchaos, and save American lives here at home.\n  My amendment will increase counternarcotics funding in Afghanistan by \n$700 million. With additional funds, the Department of Defense can work \nto ensure that the Taliban and other foreign terrorists don't use \nAfghanistan's opium crop against the United States.\n  Last year, the U.S. Government spent less than $350 million fighting \nthe drug trade. Afghanistan produced its largest poppy crop in recorded \nhistory and raised billions of dollars to fund terrorism.\n  For people who say this significant amount of money is not useful, it \nsure is. On a cost-effective basis, it is. It costs a lot more to fight \nterrorists who use the money from the poppy trade than to fight the \npoppy trade itself.\n  Some may suggest the money is not useful to DOD, but I would argue \nthat DOD clearly doesn't have enough resources just on the basis ipso \nfacto that the crop doubled last year. We have to make sure the \nDepartment of Defense and the State Department have all the available \nresources to combat this threat.\n\n  Others may say this issue is not a priority to DOD and we should let \nother agencies take the lead on this issue. The problem clearly is not \na priority to DOD, but it absolutely should be, and this amendment will \nmake clear that is our intent.\n  The growing insecurity in Afghanistan clearly requires that DOD take \na more active role in combating the rise in the Taliban and \ncorresponding rise in production of opium. To show that we are serious \nabout combating cultivation of poppies and the production and trade of \nopium and heroin, we must put additional resources into the fight. If \nwe don't, Afghanistan's drug trade will come back to haunt us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when we have a vote on \nit later today. I thank the President and my colleagues from Alaska and \nHawaii.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be added as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4909\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the Menendez\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\namendment be put before the Senate again. I ask unanimous consent that \nit be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to be as courteous as possible. It \nis not a very good word to use, but it seems to me the Menendez \namendment places a gag order on the Department of Defense. It says that \nthe gains made by our military people and by the Iraqi forces cannot be \nreported to our people or to the Iraqi people.\n  It is a strange amendment, if you want to look at it, because it just \nsays no funds may be expended for a public relations program to monitor \nnews media in the United States and Middle East and create a database \nof news stories to promote a positive image of the war in Iraq.\n  The Department's press office normally reports day-to-day activities \nand is doing just that--getting the stories around and making sure we \nat home and the people in Iraq and our people in uniform know the \npositive side of this engagement.\n  I can tell you that at home we see the negative side all the time. It \nseems to me that answering questions with positive stories would be \nconsidered a PR effort. I do think it would have unintended \nconsequences potentially impacting intelligence activities. I don't \nwant to go into that too much, but the world knows about this \ninformation and the activities that have been going on for years. They \nhave been going on for years.\n\n  We should not allow the Senate to take the position that prevents the \nDepartment of Defense to report on favorable news and to create a \nprogram to do that. To me, it constitutes a gag order.\n  I move to table the Senator's amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4897\n\n  It is my intention now to ask the Senate to make the Schumer \namendment the pending business. I ask unanimous consent that is the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, funding in this current year for \nactivities in Afghanistan is $116.5 million.\n  That money is being used to build border crossing points and police \nheadquarters and to train and equip Afghan national police and other \nsecurity forces in drug detection and eradication.\n  A significant portion of those funds is still being programmed to be \nspent. There was a delay in getting that bill ready for expenditures \nfor 2006 so there will be some carryover into 2007. We don't know how \nmuch that will be.\n  The President asked for an additional $18.5 million for this year in \nthis bill, and the committee supported that request.\n  In addition to the funding in the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill before the Senate, the fiscal year 2007 Foreign \nOperations bill as reported to the Senate has $297 million for \ncounterdrug activities in Afghanistan. The Commerce Science Justice \nbill includes $30.5 million for counterdrug activities in Afghanistan. \nThis means in the current bills pending for approval, there is already \n$346 million for counterdrug activities in Afghanistan for 2007, \nnotwithstanding the carryover money that is available. This means there \nis approximately $400 million that will be available in 2007 already \nand the Senator wants to add $700 million to that. That is an enormous \namount of money.\n  The British Government actually takes the lead in counterdrug \noperations in Afghanistan. As we all know, NATO is in there now. The \nUnited States should not offer to take the entire financial burden of \nthis operation. It is a multinational effort.\n  The Senator is right in his premise that poppy production sales are a \nfunding mechanism for terrorist activities in Afghanistan. We do \nsupport poppy eradication efforts. However, we do not need to throw \nmoney at that problem. Four-tenths of a billion dollars ought to be \nenough for one year.\n  We have reviewed the counterdrug budgets for DOD and other agencies, \nand we believe they are sufficiently budgeted not only for this current \nyear but for the 2007 year. If the Department needs additional funds \nfor 2007, we will have a supplemental in the spring. I would be the \nfirst to support it if the Department came in and said they needed more \nmoney. However, in view of the fact that we are working with NATO and \nworking with the British Government, which has the lead on this \nprogram, I do not think doubling the amount available for this program \nis prudent.\n  As a matter of fact, obviously from the experience in the current \nyear, it would not be spent.\n  That should not be voted upon by the Senate. I move to table Senator \nSchumer's amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent at 2 p.m. today the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the pending Menendez amendment, to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Schumer amendment--I have always made the motions to \ntable--that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote, \nand there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote on each \namendment. I believe this has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't wish to seem preemptory about this. I thank the \nSenators for their courtesy in bringing the amendments to the Senate.\n  Can we make the second vote 10 minutes? I ask unanimous consent the \nvote on the Menendez amendment be a 15-minute vote and the Schumer \namendment be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent it be in order for me to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on both amendments at the same time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4911\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment and send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself and \n     Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment numbered 4911.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make available an additional $65,400,000 for additional \nappropriations for Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, for the procurement \nof Predators for Special Operations forces, and to designate the amount \n                      as an emergency requirement)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Additional Amount for Aircraft Procurement, \n     Air Force.--The amount appropriated by chapter 3 of this \n     title under the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'' \n     is hereby increased by $65,400,000, with the amount of the \n     increase designated as appropriations for contingency \n     operations directly related to the Global War on Terrorism, \n     and other unanticipated defense-related operations, pursuant \n     to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 376 (109th Congress), as made \n     applicable to the House of Representatives by H. Con. Res. \n     818 (109th Congress) and designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. 83 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2007, as made applicable in the Senate by Section 7035 \n     of Public Law 109-234.\n       (b) Availability for Procurement of Predators.--Of the \n     amount appropriated by chapter 3 of this title under the \n     heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air Force'', as increased by \n     subsection (a), up to $65,400,000 may be available for \n     procurement of Predators for Special Operations forces.\n       (c) Supplement Not Supplant.--The amount available under \n     subsection (b) for the purpose specified in that subsection \n     is in addition to any other amounts available in this Act for \n     that purpose.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment along with my \ncolleague from Indiana, Senator Evan Bayh, which would provide an \nadditional $65.4 million for the procurement of Predators for our \nspecial operations forces. The Predator is an unmanned aerial vehicle--\nor UAV, for\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nshort--used for armed reconnaissance, airborne surveillance, and target \nacquisition. It has become a critical asset in the war on terror. It is \na small, remotely piloted aircraft that brings the battlefront to the \nmilitary.\n  Through the use of cameras and other sensors, the Predator monitors, \nin real time, buildings or people. Because it is unmanned, it is ideal \nfor use in areas that are inaccessible to the U.S. military such as \nareas where the airspace is unsecure, the terrain is unpassable, or the \nenvironment is contaminated by chemical or biological weapons. The \nPredator system's hardware consists of a small monoplane with sensors, \na ground control station, and data communications system.\n  The special operations forces--the front line in our war on terror--\nrely on Predator surveillance as part of their work to capture and kill \nthe terrorists targeting our troops and the Governments of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  There has been a lot of discussion recently about the war on terror. \nThis is actually one of the systems which has been most decisive in \nkilling the terrorists. That is why I think we have to support \nadditional funding for this antiterrorist system.\n  Right now, special operations forces depend upon Air Force assets, \nwhich are already in high demand, for Predator support. With more \nPredators, we can be more effective in going after and taking out the \nterrorists. According to the Defense News article entitled ``Inside the \nZarqawi Takedown: Persistent Surveillance Helps End 3-Year Manhunt,'' \nthe capture of the terrorist Abu Mus'Ab al-Zarqawi--the leader of al-\nQaida in Iraq, notorious for his despicable conduct--was facilitated \ndecisively by Predator surveillance provided to special operations \nforces.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review recognized that special operators need \ndedicated UAV support and called for the establishment of a UAV \nsquadron organic to special operations forces.\n  The QDR reads:\n\n       To achieve the future force characteristics for SOF--\n     special operations forces--and to build on progress to date, \n     the Department will: . . . establish a SOF unmanned aerial \n     vehicle squadron to provide organic capabilities to locate \n     and target enemy capabilities in denied or contested areas.\n\n  This special operations squadron would eventually provide coverage 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, to assist the forces working to capture and \nkill terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan. The objective, according to \nGEN Doug Brown, Commander of the Special Operations Command, SOCOM, is \nto establish an ``unblinking eye,'' which would help special operators \ntargeting terrorists.\n  The President's budget request for fiscal year 2007 included funding \nsufficient to begin to build the squadron, including the purchase of \neight UAVs.\n  On April 6, VADM Eric Olson, Deputy Commander of SOCOM, testified to \nthe Armed Services Committee that the command did not have sufficient \nsurveillance platforms. On April 27, Senator Bayh sent a letter to the \nArmed Services Committee expressing his intent to address this issue \nvia legislation. Subsequently, the Appropriations Committee took action \nin the fiscal year 2006 supplemental and accelerated funding for this \npurpose. This funding would have allowed the initial operating \ncapability to be achieved in 2007, rather than 2008, and for the \nsquadron to be fully operational with 24 UAVs in 2010 instead of 2011.\n  I believe this acceleration would have been significantly \ncontributing to the capability of our Special Operations Command. \nHowever, the acceleration was reversed by the Appropriations Committee \njust a few months later when it cut the funding for the UAV procurement \nfor SOCOM--a cut to the Air Force aircraft procurement line.\n  According to the Special Operations Command, this cut ``would negate \nthe effect of the FY2006 Supplemental, . . . causing Full Operation \nCapability to revert back to the original timeline. This delay will \nadversely affect AFSOC's urgent ongoing requirement to conduct \npersistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting \nmissions.''\n  The amendment Senator Bayh and I are offering would put the \nacceleration back on track by adding $65.4 million for six UAVs and \nassociated equipment.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, during a trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, the Armed \nServices Committee staff was told by the special operations forces in \nboth countries, who are working hard to track the terrorists targeting \nour troops and the Governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, that their No. \n1 need is for Predator coverage. They need dedicated UAV support.\n  We have not captured Osama bin Laden yet, and unfortunately there are \nmany more targets for the special operators to conduct reconnaissance, \nsurveillance, and, we hope, preemption. There is no rationale for not \naccelerating the establishment of the UAV squadron.\n  SOCOM wants this, and they have stated such. They can execute this in \nthe timeframe they have given the Congress. We need to increase the \npressure on al-Qaida operatives in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as \nother terrorists attacking U.S. and coalition troops. These terrorists \nare threatening, each day, the success of our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the safety of our personnel.\n  If we really want to carry the fight to the terrorists, if we really \nwant to individually and collectively go after and take out these \nterrorists, the Predator, according to our special operations forces, \nis a key ingredient in this effort. Rather than rhetoric about fighting \nthe war on terrorism, let's give these special operators the tools to \neffectively fight and destroy terrorists wherever they may be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was off the floor, but I was informed \nof the amendment offered by Senators Reed and Bayh. It is my \nunderstanding--the Senator from Hawaii concurs--we would be willing to \naccept this amendment.\n  Does the Senator want a vote on it? We would be happy to take it by \nvoice vote if he is ready to let us accept it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, my preference would be \nfor a recorded vote, if possible. I think this is an important point \nabout providing adequate resources to our special operators. Also, I \nwould like to at least confer with Senator Bayh.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. I have no objection. This money, if nothing \nelse, would be available to replace some of the Predators that have \nbeen lost. So we are willing to accept it, but if the Senator wishes a \nvote, I would ask that--Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nvoting on this amendment be delayed until we can confer with the \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4909\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. \nAs has been his tradition, as has been his experience, he brings forth \nan issue that I think is of special importance at this moment because \nwhile we discussed in these last few days the honesty with which we get \ninformation and data, we have recognized that there is often an attempt \nto obscure the truth from the American people about the war we are in \nat the moment.\n  We see it in different ways. We see it in the fact that, for \ninstance, flag-draped coffins are not permitted to be photographed when \nthe remains of our most courageous people fighting the\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\nbattle in Iraq are returned home. They come to a base in the State of \nDelaware, and it is prohibited to take pictures of those flag-draped \ncoffins. That testimonial the country gives to these fallen soldiers is \ndenied public view, as is the fact that there is another American, or \nmore, lost in this quest to bring democracy to a country in which there \nis considerable doubt about whether they want our form of democracy. \nThis amendment would make certain that no Department of Defense funds \nare used for propaganda.\n  Last week, we learned that the Defense Department wants to pay a \ncompany $20 million to monitor and analyze American and Middle East \nmedia to help improve the image of the U.S. Government and the \nmilitary. I fully agree with him on the importance of limiting these \nfunds for a propaganda campaign. I will not support the use of these \nfunds in that manner.\n  The contractor being hired is expected to put together a database of \nnews stories and assess their tone to come up with ways to get more \nglowing news coverage for the administration to try to convince the \nAmerican people that things are going pretty much to plan and it just \nneeds more time.\n  We don't talk about the fact that it needs, very often, more troops \nto do this assignment, without regard to whether we ought to be there \nat this time or whether they deserve the protections and equipment that \nis often missing. But we are not just talking about the Middle East \npress. This is Department of Defense money provided by U.S. taxpayers \nto comb American newspapers to track and evaluate their stories.\n  I can't say I am surprised by this development. After all, this \nadministration has mastered the art of propaganda, and after I asked \nfor investigations of the administration's propaganda activity, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, ruled that the administration \nviolated law in several cases. Propaganda efforts by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and the Department of Education were ruled \nillegal by GAO.\n  So what did the administration do? Did it agree to abide by the law? \nOf course not. That is not their customary action, not this \nadministration. The administration announced that it would ignore the \nGAO rulings. The administration sees the rule of law as kind of a speed \nbump, not a roadblock. That is why Congress has to cut off these funds \nfor these propaganda efforts.\n  This isn't the Soviet Union. We promote a free press in this country. \nIt is essential to our democratic functioning. Learn the truth, \npleasant or unpleasant, and deal with it as we should--honestly. We \nshould not be manipulating the news media in our country.\n  I want the news about Iraq to be better, too. We all have great \nrespect and affection for those who are on the front line who are doing \ntheir duty in spite of questions about what the purpose is or when the \nreturn to their homes begins. But maybe if we made some changes in our \nleadership and in our strategy we wouldn't need a PR campaign to \nimprove our image here or abroad. Instead of trying to make the current \nsituation look better, we ought to focus on actually making it better.\n  If we have any money to spare, let's spend it on our troops making \nsure that everybody has body armor, the latest there is, to protect \nthem, or that the humvees and other vehicles are appropriately armored \nto see if we can defend ourselves better against these roadside bombs \nand these attacks on our troops, or on developing better strategies to \nfight terrorism and to defend our country.\n  We are on the eve of the commemoration of 9/11. It was one of the \nevents in American history that still shocks our psyche. The fact that \nin a single day almost 3,000 Americans were killed on our soil by \nforeign intervention still astounds even the grimaced imagination. The \nfact that these two tall towers fell--I had an office in one of those \ntowers when I was a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and \nNew Jersey before I came to the Senate. They stood like cities, with \n50,000 people going in and out, moving to their jobs, to their \nassignments, to their responsibilities, to their families, not only to \ntheir companies, not only to the services they provided. And we are \nstill in search of the perpetrators.\n  We all want to see victory come out of this war. The problem is I am \nnot sure we can define victory. It is too late for us to resume our \nlives as we used to live them without constantly having to show an ID, \nwithout constantly having to be in lines waiting, interfered with in \nour normal routine. The last thing we need is to cover up reality. That \nis what is taking place. This is an attempt to further cover up the \nreality, cover up the losses we are enduring, cover up the expense it \nis costing us. The financial costs are secondary to the loss of life, \nbut, nevertheless, that is reality.\n  I commend my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. He has \nbrought thoughtful discourse to this body, and we welcome his attempt \nto clear the air, to make sure we are not spending money to color the \nissues, to give it a rosy tone, but to tell the truth and to not spend \n$20 million of taxpayer money on glossing over what is a very painful \nreality.\n  I hope our colleagues will fully support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Menendez amendment. Who yields time? The Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nmotion to table the amendment. With all due respect, this isn't about \nany gag order. It is not about promoting whatever gains are made. We \nare happy to see whatever gains are made in the Defense Department, in \nthe White House, and all of the Republican administration. They can \nroll out all of the good news they have. But what we don't need and \nwhat I hope the Senate will not vote for is $20 million of taxpayer \nfunds for the purpose of having a public relations firm ultimately \ngenerate ``good press out of Iraq.'' That is not what we need. We need \na change in policy, not a $20 million public relations contract.\n  Our amendment specifically allows the Department of Defense to \ncontinue to collect or analyze information in the news media, as they \ndo now, but we do not need a $20 million public relations program. If \nmy colleagues vote for the motion to table, they are voting to have \nthat $20 million public relations program that the taxpayers will fund.\n  We can generate whatever good news may exist, but what we need is a \nchange in policy. We don't need a PR program. This bill should be about \nflack jackets for our soldiers, not for the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment will prohibit \nspending monies for a program to create a database for news stories \nthat are positive. I do think there is an exception to that which says \nit does not apply to collecting and analyzing information in the news \nmedia. So they can spend money to analyze all the negative aspects of \nour news media, but they cannot spend money to collect the data that is \nnecessary to provide the positive side of what our people are doing and \nwhat the Iraqi people are doing in Iraq in this terrible situation over \nthere. I really think it is a gag order. I don't see why they should be \nable to collect all the news stories, but they can't collect the \ninformation that is positive and make it available.\n  So I move to table this, and I believe we will have a vote here \nfairly soon. The 2 minutes equally divided will be after this \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

There are 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote on the motion to table the Schumer amendment. The Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. The \nTaliban is gaining huge parts of Afghanistan, southern Afghanistan. The \nTaliban is all over the place. How do they fund themselves? How do they \nspread their hegemony? It is through opium. Opium production has \ndoubled in a year. While we are making some efforts to fight it, we are \nnot doing close to enough. If we want to stop the Taliban from going \nback to where they were before 9/11, we must stop the way they prosper, \nsurvive, and fund themselves. It is opium production. They make 90 \npercent of the world's heroin.\n  This amendment, very simply, adds money to the DOD budget so we can \nfight the scourge of opium and the scourge of terrorism to which it is \ninterlinked in Afghanistan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, NATO is in charge, now, of Afghanistan. \nThe British Government is the lead agency in counterdrug operations. \nNotwithstanding that, in this budget we have $346 million for \ncounterdrug efforts in Afghanistan. In addition to that, there is a \ncarryover available from 2007. It will be almost $400 million already, \nand the Senator wishes to add another $700 million. It is not our \nfunction. The lead agency is NATO, now, in Afghanistan.\n  I have made a motion to table. I urge the Senators to vote to table \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds appropriated by this Act \n   may be available for the conversion to contractor performance of \n certain activities or functions of the Department of Defense in cases \n   where the contractor receives a competitive advantage by offering \ninferior retirement benefits to workers who are going to be employed in \n the performance of such activities or functions than those offered by \n            the Department to comparable civilian employees)\n\n       On page 160, line 7, strike ``; or'' and insert a \n     semicolon.\n       On page 160, line 14, strike the period at the end and \n     insert the following: ``; or\n       (C) offering to such workers a retirement benefit that in \n     any year costs less than the annual retirement cost factor \n     applicable to Department of Defense civilian employees under \n     chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we know that vast numbers of Americans \nare increasingly concerned about their economic future. More than half \nof all workers describe themselves as ``worried'' or ``stressed'' about \nthe state of the economy, and growing numbers of workers fear they will \nnot be able to meet, much less surpass, the standard of living of their \nparents.\n  One of the primary factors contributing to these fears is the \nworsening crisis in the Nation's retirement system. The cornerstones of \nretirement security--private pensions, private savings, and Social \nSecurity--are increasingly at risk. Far too many working Americans will \nface retirement with little in their pocket--and with nothing to show \nfor their long years of loyal service and hard work.\n  The pension reform legislation enacted this year will help companies \nkeep the pension promises they have already made to workers, but we \nneed to do much more to encourage employers to provide adequate \nretirement benefits to their hardworking employees.\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\nToday, less than half of all private-sector employees have any \nretirement plan at all at work, and the number of workers with a secure \ndefined-benefit pension plan has been cut in half since 1980.\n  Employer-provided retirement plans are essential for retirement \nsecurity for working families. Workers are far more likely to save \nmoney for retirement through an employer-offered pension than if they \nare left to save on their own.\n  Unfortunately, instead of encouraging more companies to provide good \nretirement benefits to their employees, current Federal contracting \nrules actually discourage many private companies from helping their \nemployees save for retirement. The competitive bidding process for \ncontracts favors private employers who shortchange their workers on \nretirement benefits. Firms that provide no retirement benefits or only \nmeager benefits often win bid to perform Government work even when the \ncost savings from their bid are attributable solely to the lack of \nretirement benefits they provide.\n  This unfair policy creates a dangerous race to the bottom in which \nprivate sector companies compete against each other to see who can \nprovide the fewest benefits to their workers. As a result, the bidding \nprocess is actually increasing the number of Americans whose retirement \nsecurity is in jeopardy. That is both illogical and unconscionable.\n  In addition, this skewed privatization policy is fundamentally unfair \nto Federal workers who lose contracts simply because they receive \ndecent benefits. Valued Federal employees are losing their jobs because \nthey cannot compete on an unfair playing field with employers who are \nshortchanging their workers.\n  Defense workers are particularly at risk. Now, this year alone, the \nDepartment of Defense is putting more than 10,000 civilian employees at \nrisk of unfair termination--more than any other Federal agency--and it \nhas announced plans to increase this number in the future.\n  Thirty-five percent--35 percent--of civilian Defense employees are \nveterans. Hundreds more are active reservists currently serving in the \nIraq war. The least we can do for these dedicated and patriotic \nAmericans is to let them compete on a level playing field to save the \njobs they come home to after their service to their country.\n  The amendment Senator Hatch and I are offering will protect these \nworkers by preventing contractors from winning bids for Government work \nsolely because they provide inadequate retirement benefits to their \nemployees or no retirement benefits at all. Our goal is obvious: to \nprotect hard-working Federal employees from unfair competition. They \nshould not lose their jobs because they cannot compete with private \ncontractors on an unlevel playing field.\n  The amendment does not dictate the retirement benefits that employers \nmust provide or require contractors to change their existing benefits. \nIt simply levels the playing field for Federal employees and contract \nemployees by excluding costs related to retirement from a privatization \nreview. All the amendment does is prevent contractors from winning bids \nsolely because they offer inferior retirement benefits.\n  The underlying bill already includes provisions to level the playing \nfield for health care benefits. We need to do the same for retirement \nbenefits.\n  Our bipartisan amendment is an issue of basic fairness. It is fair to \nprivate sector workers who will otherwise lose their retirement \nbenefits in a ``race to the bottom.'' And it is fair to Federal \nemployees who will otherwise lose their jobs to unfair competition.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  Mr. President, just a few additional comments. The question that is \nraised is, is this going to add complicated accounting procedures? The \nanswer is, quite clearly, no. We have seen, for example, that when we \neliminated the current health issues out of the contracting, that \nworked out very easily and worked out in a way to ensure a greater \nfairness. As I mentioned, a great percentage of these workers are both \nmen and women who have been in the military; a great percentage of them \nare both in the Reserve and the Guard. It is an unusually high \npercentage of them because we know that preference is given, and \nlegitimately so, when there is an opening in the contracting for \nveterans.\n  So there is a particularly and disproportionately high number of \nthese workers who have served their country in the service, in the \nReserves, and in the National Guard.\n  This is really what we are doing. I have the good opportunity to be \nwith my chairman, Senator Enzi, chairman of our conference on pensions. \nWe worked very closely with the members of the Finance Committee, \nSenators Grassley and Baucus, in an often tedious conference. We spent \na great deal of the time on retirement benefits and on what is \nhappening to those benefits for workers. We have seen the results. \nSavings are way down. We are going to have to give focus and attention \nto the issues on Social Security. Pensions are the third part of that \nstool, which is absolutely essential in terms of a secure retirement.\n  In so many instances, those pension rights, as we read in the \nnewspapers every day, are increasingly threatened, and increasingly at \nrisk, and increasingly lost. I agree with Senator Hatch and others that \nit would be poor policy for us to have as a matter of Federal \npreference competitions. These Federal employees have certain kinds of \nretirement benefits, and that is being held against them in a \ncompetition in which they otherwise would be successful. That will \nobviously result in companies that want to do business with the Federal \nGovernment getting rid of their pension plans, and it will disadvantage \nthose who are working in the Federal employment system.\n  Mr. President, I commended our colleagues previously for taking into \nconsideration the current health issues and comparisons. We are talking \nabout retirement benefits. I think the case is strong and, hopefully, \nwe can take this to conference and have the opportunity to explore it. \nI have talked to both the chairman and the ranking minority member over \nthe last few days. I believe the staffs are familiar with the issue. \nHopefully, we can accept this and take it to conference. Senator Hatch \nand I would be glad to respond to additional questions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4913, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4913 and ask \nunanimous consent to send a modification of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4913, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on procedures and guidelines in the event \n                     of further sectarian violence)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress a report setting \n     forth procedures and guidelines of the Department of Defense \n     to protect United States military and civilian personnel \n     (should sectarian violence further increase in Iraq.)\n       (b) Form.--The report required by subsection (a) may be \n     submitted in classified form.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined. In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Select Committee on Intelligence, and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     International Relations, the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment simply requires the Secretary \nof Defense to submit a report on the procedures and guidelines \nnecessary to protect U.S. military and civilian personnel in the event \nof a further increase in sectarian violence in Iraq.\n  Right off the top, I thank Senator Stevens and his staff and Senator \nInouye and his staff. They really helped me in getting this amendment \naccepted. It means a lot to me because I worry deeply about this \nsituation.\n  The reason I worry is, as we look at this war, we just have not seen \nplans. We have not seen that we have been ready for the contingencies \nwe face. We never seem to plan for the worst-case scenario. Frankly, I \nthink we need to do that in this case because we have not been right in \npredicting what would happen. We have seen, over time, that we have not \nhad enough body armor, we have not had enough up-armored HMMWVs or \ncountermeasures against roadside bombs.\n  Frankly, the American people are losing confidence that we are \nprepared to protect our troops in the case of a full-scale sectarian \nconflict.\n  There was a quote in the paper recently from the commander of day-to-\nday operations in Iraq. This is the quote:\n\n       Quite frankly, in 33 years in the United States Army, I \n     never trained to stop a sectarian fight.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is from the commander on the ground in Iraq:\n\n       Quite frankly, in 33 years in the United States Army, I \n     never trained to stop a sectarian fight.\n\n  Now, for 6 months I have been asking Secretary Rumsfeld for a plan \nfor our troops in the event there is a full-blown civil war in Iraq. \nAnd I have not received any kind of answer on it. After I sent my first \nletter to the Secretary asking for such a plan, I got a letter back \nfrom Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman. And he said:\n\n       Recent acts of violence intended to spark civil war have \n     failed.\n\n  That is the answer to my letter. When I asked: What is your plan in \ncase civil war breaks out, he said: Well, there isn't a civil war. \nObviously, that is not good enough.\n  My second letter to Secretary Rumsfeld was answered by Deputy \nSecretary Gordon England. He told me:\n\n       Iraq's enemies are intent on provoking widespread \n     intercommunal conflict but they are not succeeding.\n\n  So, again, a lot of reassurances but no plan.\n  So, once again, I did not receive any type of answer that gave me any \nsolace that there is some planning to protect our troops and our \ncivilian personnel if things get worse over there.\n  Now, we know the number of monthly incidents of sectarian violence \nincreased from 5 per month in 2003 to 250 per month in 2006. Let me say \nthat again. Monthly incidents of sectarian violence increased from 5 \nper month in 2003 to 250 per month in 2006.\n  Well, why do we need a plan now? I think the facts speak for \nthemselves. The Pentagon's latest report that we received on conditions \nin Iraq, which was dated August 2006, said:\n\n       Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian \n     population and among some defense analysts has increased in \n     recent months.\n\n  And this is what they said:\n\n       Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq.\n\n  So if the Pentagon is telling us conditions that could lead to civil \nwar exist in Iraq, the least we can expect from our Pentagon leadership \nis for them to provide some kind of contingency plan to protect our \ntroops and civilian workers we have over there.\n  July saw the highest level of weekly attacks since military \noperations in Iraq began. Since last spring, the number of daily \ncasualties, both military and civilian, reached nearly 120 per day, up \nfrom approximately 80 per day.\n  According to the United Nations--and I believe this is also quoted in \nthis report, so this is the Pentagon quoting the United Nations--an \nestimated 22,977 families--or 137,862 individuals--have been displaced \nin Iraq due to sectarian strife since the February 22, 2006, Samarra \nMosque bombing.\n  So for those people who put their head in the sand and say, this \nsectarian strife, it is going to go away, the people really do not want \nit, the facts belie that. I would say to my colleagues, think of one of \nyour towns. And 137,862 would be one of your very large towns. If \neveryone in that town left that town, that is how many people have been \ndisplaced in Iraq due to sectarian strife.\n  General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, acknowledged to one \nof our committees there is a possibility of the situation in Iraq \nevolving into civil war. And he did not anticipate such a situation a \nyear ago.\n  So when I heard about that, I sent a third letter--a third letter--to \nSecretary Rumsfeld asking: What is the plan in case of civil war? That \nletter remains unanswered.\n  Now, there is no reason the Secretary of Defense cannot provide the \nrelevant committees in the House and the Senate a plan in case of civil \nwar. My amendment will allow for this plan to be submitted in a \nclassified form. I think that is very important because we certainly do \nnot want that published. But we want to know that it exists and that \nthere is a plan to protect our troops and civilians. Congress has the \nresponsibility to provide oversight of the executive branch. Congress \nfailed to ensure that the administration had a plan to win the peace in \nIraq. We all know that. I saw Senator Biden just briefly on the Senate \nfloor, and he was one of those voices, along with Senator Lugar--\nbipartisan--way early asking: Where is the plan? Where is the plan? \nWhere is the plan? We never had it.\n  Now the President says: We will be in Iraq. As long as I am \nPresident, we will stay in Iraq.\n  That is not a plan. That is an admission of no plan, no exit \nstrategy. So at least let us have a plan, a contingency plan, that if \nthe sectarian violence escalates, we know that our people will be \nprotected.\n  I again thank Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and their staffs \nbecause I have to say without their help--this was a bit contentious, \nbut we worked on it until we got it so that it could be accepted on \nboth sides. I am very grateful.\n  At this time, I yield the floor and ask, at the appropriate time, we \nhave a voice vote on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan \nand I be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 4914.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the pending business is the Boxer \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the Boxer amendment at this \ntime with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4193, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4193), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kennedy \namendment No. 4857 be agreed to, with the motion to reconsider laid \nupon the table. I further ask unanimous consent that the Rockefeller \namendment No. 4906 be withdrawn, and further, that the managers' \namendment, which has been cleared by both managers, which is at the \ndesk, be considered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table. I ask unanimous consent that following this action, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\nthe Reed amendment No. 4911, with no second-degree amendment in order \nto the amendment prior to the vote and that there be 4 minutes for \ndebate equally divided prior to that vote. I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing disposition of that amendment, the only other amendment in \norder to the bill be the Bingaman-Domenici-Burns-Dorgan amendment \nrelating to firefighters, and that following disposition of that \namendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote \non final passage of the bill, the Senate then insist on its amendments, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4857) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4906) was withdrawn.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4900\n\n(Purpose: To make available up to $2,000,000 for infrastructure for the \n                   Afghanistan military legal system)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8109.

Mr. President, that now means the floor is open for \nconsideration of the Bingaman-Domenici-Burns-Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4915\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Domenici, Mr. Burns, Mr. Dorgan, and Ms. Cantwell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4915.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To appropriate funds for emergency wildlfire suppression)\n\n       On page 230, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Wildland Fire Management'' \n     under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'' of title I \n     of the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-54), \n     $100,000,000 for the conduct of emergency wildfire \n     suppression activities of the Secretary of the Interior, \n     Provided, That the amount provided under this heading is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of S.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is the one that the floor \nmanager, the chairman, indicated was to be considered now. It relates \nto wildfire management and is one that has strong support on both sides \nof the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I know Senator Burns wishes to speak as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding this is a modified \namendment, modified from the original form. I ask the Senator from New \nMexico if that is the case.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that is correct. This is in modified \nform from what was earlier filed as an amendment. I believe the \nconcerns earlier raised have been resolved.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and ask for adoption \nof the amendment.\n  Does Senator Burns wish to comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. I thank \nSenator Bingaman for his work on this amendment. We heartily approve \nthe amendment. It has strong support on this side of the aisle.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President. Before I make my statement, I \nwant to take a moment to thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye for \ntheir leadership in getting this vitally important defense \nappropriations bill to the Senate floor. I know that that the chairman \nand ranking member believe, as I do, that ensuring sufficient funding \nfor our brave fighting men and women during this incredibly challenging \nIraq war is an urgent national priority. I appreciate their hard work \nand look forward to making sure we complete work on this legislation \nbefore the end of the fiscal year.\n  Today, I am here to speak on another issue critical to Washington \nState, and many States throughout the Nation: the threat of wildfires. \nTo date, we are in the midst of the most active fire year of the \ndecade. That may surprise many of my colleagues who remember the \ndevastating fires a few years ago. But as of today, more than 8.4 \nmillion acres have burned as a result of 84,000 fires across the Nation \nthis year. To put this year into perspective--compared to the 10-year \nnational average, this year 73 percent more acres have already burned. \nAlready, this is the third worst fire year since 1960.\n  As we speak, our brave wildland firefighters across the Nation are \nfighting 62 wildfires that have burned more than 1 million acres and \ncontinue to burn in 11 States. Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and \nWyoming all have active fires that have burned at least 25,000 acres.\n  In my State, Washington, an area nearly half the size of Rhode Island \nis ablaze. More than 309,000 acres have burned in Washington State as a \nresult of 13 active fires. The largest fire in Washington, the Tripod \nComplex Fire, has burned 163,000 thousand acres. In Southeastern \nWashington, residents and farmers alike have been dealing with and \nfighting the Columbia Complex Fire. That fire has burned more than \n90,000 acres--including some homes and valuable wheat crops--forcing \nthe evacuation of hundreds of Columbia County residents in and around \nthe city of Dayton during the last month.\n  Fighting these fires has truly been a national priority and I want to \nthank all of the firefighters, soldiers, local and State officials, and \nmany others who have worked so hard to protect our citizens and \nproperty. Last week, when my office called the Incident Command Center \nfor the Columbia Complex Fire in Waitsburg, Washington, a firefighter \nfrom Louisiana picked up the phone. Louisiana joined firefighting \npersonnel from the State of Washington, Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico, \nthe Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Australia, \nCanada, and New Zealand.\n  This year the Department of Defense has been involved for the first \ntime since 2003. ``Task Force Blaze,'' a 550-soldier battalion was \nmobilized from Fort Lewis to assist with firefighting activities on the \nTripod Fire last month. Air National Guard Units in Wyoming, Colorado, \nOregon, and California have been mobilized as part of the firefighting \neffort.\n  This situation is all too familiar to this part of the Pacific \nNorthwest. Citizens in Columbia County were forced to deal with the \nSchool Fire last year that raged for 13 days, burning 52,000 acres and \ndestroying 215 homes and other structures. Unfortunately, we are facing \nanother all too familiar situation, running out of money to fight these \nfires.\n  While Congress is aware of this perennial problem, and has wisely \nboosted wildland fire fighting money the last few years, this season's \nunusually high fire activity in Washington State and across the Nation \nhas strained us further still. In Washington State for example, more \nthan 3,300 firefighting personnel are bravely fighting these stubborn \nblazes. That is why I am a cosponsor of Mr. Bingaman's critical \namendment.\n  Any day now, the Federal Government will have spent all of its \navailable funding for wildland firefighting for this fiscal year. This \nwill leave our primary firefighting agencies--the Forest Service and \nthe Department of Interior--stuck with the choice of either cutting \nback firefighting efforts from the more than 1 million acres burning \ntoday, or cutting back from other necessary activities. Without these \nemergency funds, national forests throughout the country would likely \nhave to cut back on vital maintenance or services to the public. And if \nwe are forced to tap into the land and water conservation fund, we \nmight have to forgo preserving pristine or unique lands.\n  In these extraordinary circumstances with thousands of people \naffected by wildfires from Montana to Washington to Wyoming--I believe \nthat providing Federal wildland firefighting agencies with the adequate \nresources should be a top priority. That's why I support the Bingaman \namendment to provide an additional $275 million in emergency funding \nfor wildfire suppression activities. Specifically, based on the \nresource projections provided to us by the administration, $175 million \nwould be made available for the Forest Service and $100 million to the \nDepartment of Interior. These funds will help assure the thousands of \nour citizens in communities across the Nation that the Federal \nGovernment will have the adequate resources to continue fire \nsuppression activities without borrowing from other important programs.\n  When we run out of funding, we will have depleted available \nappropriations for fire suppression and a nearly $500 million reserve \nfund to deal with these emergencies. I recognize that we will probably \nneed to do a lot more for firefighting and I look forward to supporting \nthose efforts. However, based on available projections from the Federal \nGovernment providing $275 million now will help provide some immediate \nrelief.\n  While this is an extraordinary fire year, this is not a new issue for \nCongress to deal with. Over the last few years, Congress has added \nemergency appropriations and reserve accounts in response to wildfire \nsuppression activities and other fire-related activities. As recently \nas 2004, we added $500 million in emergency funding to the fiscal year \n2005 Defense appropriations bill for wildfire suppression activities.\n  With a million acres burning across the Nation in 11 States--American \ncitizens deserve to know that the Federal Government is doing \neverything it can to protect them, their property, and their \ncommunities. I think it is critical to provide these additional funds \nand I urge adoption of the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 4915.\n  The amendment (No. 4915) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, are there any other pending amendments \nnot taken care of by the unanimous consent agreement? It is my \nunderstanding from the unanimous consent agreement that the only other \namendment to be considered on this bill was the Bingaman amendment, and \nwe now have a vote on the Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Reed amendment is \nthe only remaining amendment under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is 4 minutes equally divided. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, awaiting the arrival of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4911\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the pending business is the \nReed amendment with 4 minutes equally divided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Conrad \nbe added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment that is offered by myself and \nSenator Bayh would add $64.7 million to continue an accelerated \nacquisition of Predator. These are unmanned aerial vehicles that are \ncritical to our war on terror. They were instrumental in the detection \nand the ultimate destruction of Zarqawi and other terrorists. They are \nthe chief tool of our special operations forces in terms of going \nafter, seeking, finding, and destroying terrorists and terrorist \nnetworks.\n  There was a plan to accelerate the deployment of these UAVs. That \nplan was disrupted, if you will, because of decisions previously made. \nBut I think today we can send a uniform and unanimous message that we \nneed to acquire these six additional UAVs to create ultimately a \nsquadron of UAVs for our special operations command. With these weapons \nsystems, we can continue to deal effective and decisive blows against \nterrorists. I urge unanimous passage of this legislation adding $64.5 \nmillion. I commend Senator Bayh because he really was a leader in this \neffort in terms of drawing the attention of the committee to this \nshortfall in funding and requesting that it be added with this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we were willing to accept this amendment \nwhen the Senator first brought the Predator to the attention of this \nCongress. I am delighted to see more Predators being bought. This is \nsort of a premature type of advance. These monies would have been \nrequested anyway for 2007, but we checked with the Department and they \nare willing to proceed with it now.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4911.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Funding Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for final \npassage of H.R. 5631, the fiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations bill, \nI would like to thank my colleagues for accepting an amendment that I \ncosponsored which addresses the growing concern of a number of veterans \nreturning from combat operations overseas that may have traumatic brain \ninjury, TBI.\n  According to reports, preliminary research by the center shows that \nabout 10 percent of all service personnel, and up to 20 percent of \nfrontline personnel, suffer concussions during combat tours. Like any \nmedical condition, early diagnosis is the key to successful \nintervention and treatment.\n  Unfortunately, many are not being properly screened for this serious \nand debilitating condition. TBI clinically presents many of the same \nsigns and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. These two \nserious but very different medical conditions require separate and \ndistinct treatment programs.\n  Because it is so important that our veteran care facilities have the \nproper training to distinguish between these two illnesses, I included \nlanguage in the fiscal year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill requesting the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to establish a separate education program to better diagnose \nTBI.\n  With final passage of this bill, we have another opportunity to \nfurther strengthen our efforts to better understand and treat TBI. I am \nproud to cosponsor this amendment which will add an additional $12 \nmillion in funding for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, \nDVBIC. The DVBIC is a collaboration between the Defense Department and \nthe VA to deliver care to patients with TBI.\n  During testimony earlier this year, leaders of the DVBIC testified \nthat the center needed $19 million in funding for fiscal year 2007. \nThis amendment brings the total funding from the $7 million requested \nto a total of $19 million. This funding level is important because it \nwill ensure our combat veterans receive the quality care they deserve.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank my good friend from Texas for her support by \ncosponsoring my amendment. I have enjoyed a wonderful working \nrelationship with Senator Hutchison on a number of issues, especially \nveterans issues. We have worked together to increase veterans health \ncare funding as well as veterans research funding. We just recently \nworked together on an amendment to provide credit monitoring services \nto Veterans and active duty servicemembers at no cost in response to \nthe theft of a Veterans Administration laptop computer.\n  Senator Hutchison and I, as well as other Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, are here today in an effort to give our veterans the health \ncare they\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nso rightfully deserve. Those returning servicemembers who suffered a \ntraumatic brain injury need the best quality care available and this \namendment is a long step in that direction. I thank the Senior Senator \nfrom Texas for her support and her leadership as chairman of the \nVeterans Affairs Appropriations Committee on this issue.\n\n\n                       Operation and Maintenance\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for clarification of \nlanguage that appears in title IX, on page 238 of the committee's \nreport. Under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance'' there is a \nwriteup entitled ``Pre-Deployment and Post-Deployment Training.'' The \ncommittee states in part ``The Committee believes that costs accrued at \nhome station for the aforementioned activities are allowable costs for \nthe use of title IX funding. To the extent that such training, \nmaintenance and reset activities displace normal peacetime training \nevents, the amounts provided to the Department in title IX operation \nand maintenance accounts should be used to ensure full support of pre-\ndeployment and post-deployment operations, as well as for continuing \ncombat and security operations in support of the global war on \nterror.''\n  Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, is it the committee's intent that \nfunds provided in this title for national and field level reset repair \nbe available for the reset of equipment used for pre-deployment and \npost training but not otherwise deployed?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is the committee's intent.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with the Senator from Alaska in regards to the \ncommittee's intended purpose of funds provided for Army reset programs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Given this interpretation, I urge the committee to work \nwith the Army to ensure that funds provided in this title and elsewhere \nin this bill should be used for upgrading equipment to current \nproduction type, model, and series, where determined by the Army \nAcquisition Executive to be required and cost effective, to include \nequipment used for predeployment training but not otherwise deployed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee will encourage the Army to do so and \nthanks the Gentleman from Wisconsin for raising this important issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, thank you.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, next week we will be commemorating an \nevent that none of us can forget and none of us wants to relive.\n  We mark September 11, 2001, as a day of national tragedy. But out of \nthe ashes rose a determination to bring the sponsors of this terrorism \nto justice and to reform the intelligence system that that we depend on \nto prevent such predatory attacks in the future.\n  In those first weeks and months after the attacks, we were united as \na nation and enjoyed the sympathy and support of the world. We went \nafter Osama bin Ladin and the government that hosted him, with some of \nAmerica's best and bravest. We assembled some of our wisest and most \nexperienced leaders to investigate the events leading up to the attack \nand to recommend a path of reform.\n  Since 2001 when I joined the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have \nworked to bring about intelligence reform. The Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was an important milestone on this \njourney. Important structural changes were made to our intelligence \ncommunity and barriers removed to information sharing between agencies.\n  But where are we now?\n  The operational failure of 9/11 was followed by an analytical failure \nin Iraq. The hidden agenda of the White House and the President's lack \nof interest in objective analysis compounded the consequences of flawed \nintelligence. The President did not level with the public before the \nwar. He did not keep his eye on hunting down al-Qaida. Instead, he led \nus into an unnecessary and disastrous war in Iraq.\n  Instead of providing oversight of the executive branch, congressional \nleadership has provided a rubberstamp. Instead of providing an \nindependent voice, it has offered an echo chamber. Instead of helping \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee investigate the Iraq intelligence \nfailure, it has helped the White House push roadblocks in our path. And \ninstead of taking care to safeguard liberty as we enhance security, it \nhas closed its eyes on violations of the law and betrayal of our \nvalues.\n  In spite of some strong disagreements on specific issues, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee has come together on a bipartisan basis to \nimplement the reforms already adopted and advance additional reform \nmeasures.\n  But last year, the leadership in the Senate did not allow the \ncommittee's authorization bill to be debated and voted on by the full \nSenate. For the first time in 28 years, the committee was blocked from \ncarrying out its most basic function--the authorization of U.S. \nintelligence programs.\n  This month, we have learned that the majority leader does not intend \nto bring the fiscal year 2007 intelligence authorization bill to the \nfloor before the Senate's fall recess. Again we face the prospect of \nthe leadership preventing the Intelligence Committee from doing its \njob.\n  This is irresponsible and unacceptable. The authorizing committee \nshould be the congressional vehicle for intelligence reform. The \nmembers of the committee spend the time needed to understand the \nissues. And we operate under special rules to keep our Nation's most \nsensitive secrets.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will do my best \nto make sure the intelligence community is adequately and appropriately \nfunded. But providing direction and guidance for intelligence \nactivities is the job of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Senator Rockefeller, the distinguished vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, elaborated from the floor this week about what \nis at stake. The fiscal year 2007 intelligence authorization bill, \npassed unanimously by the committee, included provisions: to enhance or \nclarify the authority of the Director of National Intelligence; to \nencourage information sharing and access; to establish a statutory \ninspector general of the intelligence community; to elevate the heads \nof the technical intelligence agencies by requiring them to be \nappointed by the President with Senate advice and consent; to improve \nthe timeliness and completeness of information provided to the \ncommittee, and; to streamline the security clearance process for \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency employees and contractors.\n  These measures are not trivial. If enacted, they will save lives and \nthey will save money. They will help restore congressional oversight \nwhere it is lacking. They will help prevent abuses in intelligence \noperations, which bring dishonor to our nation.\n  In short, these measures are critical to our national security. They \nshould not be casually discarded.\n  Senator Rockefeller has repeatedly raised his concerns with the lack \nof congressional oversight of the warrantless surveillance program \nconducted by the National Security Agency. I join him in expressing \nthose concerns from the perspective of a member whose state proudly \nhosts the headquarters of that invaluable agency.\n  After a long struggle against White House foot-dragging, members of \ncongressional intelligence committees are finally being briefed on this \n5-year-old program.\n  But as Senator Rockefeller points out, we have still not received the \ninformation necessary to adequately understand and evaluate the \nprogram. Nor have we been allowed to use the Intelligence Committee's \nspecialized staff--such as the minority counsel and the NSA monitor--\nwho are best qualified to help us with this task.\n  Under these conditions, the Senate cannot evaluate the need for the \nwarrantless surveillance program and cannot propose legislative \nremedies for the alleged deficiencies of the current law. These \ncircumstances must change.\n  Mr. President, intelligence is at the forefront in our fight against \nterrorism, just as it was in our long Cold War struggle against \ncommunism. Congress has a duty under the Constitution to be a critical \nand coequal partner in this fight. I join Senator Rockefeller in urging \nthe leadership of the Senate to let us get on with it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to discuss the Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2007, which is one of the most \nimportant of the appropriations measures that we consider annually. \nThis legislation will provide critical funding for the men and women in\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nour armed forces who, at this very moment, are in harm's way. We must \nsupport them, and, for that reason, I will vote in favor of its \npassage. But I have serious concerns over the earmarks contained in the \ncommittee report accompanying this bill.\n  The bill reported out of committee appropriates over $453 billion. \nThis is more than $9 billion below the President's request and I am \ndiscouraged that it required a $13 billion amendment designated as \nemergency funding to get back to the President's requested funding \nlevel. Also, as is the case with so many of the appropriations bills \nthat come to the floor, the report accompanying it contains hundreds of \nearmarks that were neither requested nor authorized--to the tune of \nover $4 billion. During a time of war we should be making every effort \nto support the President's budget request instead of slashing it and \nthen adding earmarks for favored projects.\n  Every day we ask the brave men and women who fight for freedom on \nbehalf of our great nation to make sacrifices. They sacrifice in Iraq \nand Afghanistan as well as several other places around the globe. Our \nsoldiers have sacrificed and their families have sacrificed. And so, we \nin the Congress should exercise some degree of self-restraint and \nsacrifice as well.\n  Let me mention a few of the add-ons that were included in the bill's \naccompanying report that were not requested in the President's budget \nand were not on any of the armed services unfunded priority lists--some \nof which have next to nothing to do with the Department of Defense or \nits mission:\n  $2 million for automotive research;\n  $2 million for Precision Polishing of Large Objects;\n  $3 million for improved shelf-life for Vegetables;\n  $2 million for Brown Tree Snakes;\n  $117 million for an Oceanographic Survey Ship;\n  $75 million for the Allegany Ballistics Lab in West Virginia;\n  $18.5 million for a Air Force C-17 Maintenance Training System in \nHawaii;\n  $8 million for the Allen Army Airfield in Alaska;\n  $1.5 million for Fort Detrick in Maryland;\n  $4 million for disposable dental masks; and\n  $3.5 million for Hibernation Genomics.\n  Once again, there are also many earmarks that may be for worthy \ncauses, such as ovarian cancer research, but there is no compelling \nnational defense reason for these items to be funded through this \nlegislation. These earmarks include:\n  $115 million for Breast Cancer Research;\n  $80 million for Prostate Cancer Research;\n  $6 million for Integrated Trans- lational Prostate Disease Research;\n  $34 million for the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network; and\n  $15 million for Ovarian Cancer Research.\n  Mr. President, as we are engaged fully in the global war on terror, \nit is imperative that we get the most of each and every defense dollar. \nThe money that is being diverted to projects like the ones I have \nmentioned could instead be used for body armor or other critical needs \nto protect our troops and help win the war on terror. The earmarks I \nhave mentioned are just a small sampling of the many, unrequested \nearmarks that fill the accompanying report. These earmarks are draining \nour precious resources and are not vital to our long term national \nsecurity. I strongly encourage the Federal agencies affected to use \ntheir judgement to ensure they are not allocating resources to projects \nthat are not legislatively mandated or authorized, but rather, are \nmerely the wish lists of the committee.\n  Beyond the earmarks contained in the Senate report, this bill \ncontains numerous authorizing provisions, some of which are outside of \nthe scope of defense policy. Some of these provisions include:\n  Authorizing medical services at Army medical facilities located in \nHawaii for civilian patients;\n  Authorizing the use of up to $50 million for operational ranges \nmanaged by the Air Force in Alaska; and\n  A provision that protects jobs in Hawaii and Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that some of these provisions may be \nimportant while others are questionable at best. What is important is \nthat we follow the authorization process and restrain ourselves from \nusing appropriations bills to authorize projects on this bill that have \nnot been requested by the Department of Defense, nor approved by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  I would also like to discuss the Buy America restrictions that cost \nthe Department of Defense and the American taxpayers. Like in previous \nappropriations bills, this year's bill imposes a number of Buy America \nrestrictions.\n  For example, the bill would prevent the purchase of ball bearings \nunless domestically produced. It requires that welded shipboard anchor \nand mooring chain be manufactured in the United States. Another section \nprohibits the Department of Defense from purchasing supercomputers from \na foreign source.\n  I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on \nreadiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. From a \nphilosophical point of view, I oppose these types of protectionist \npolicies. I believe free trade is an important element in improving \nrelations among all nations and essential to economic growth. From a \npractical standpoint, ``Buy America'' restrictions could seriously \nimpair our ability to compete freely in international markets and also \ncould result in the loss of existing business from long-standing trade \npartners.\n  Some legislative enactments over the past several years have had the \neffect of establishing a monopoly for a domestic supplier in certain \nproduct lines. This not only adds to the pressure for our allies to \n``Buy European'' but it also raises the costs of procurement for DOD \nand cuts off access to potential state-of-the-art technologies. DOD \nshould have the ability to make purchases from a second source in an \nallied country covered by a defense cooperation memorandum of \nunderstanding when only one domestic source exists. This would ensure \nboth price and product competition.\n  Defense exports improve interoperability with friendly forces with \nwhich we are increasingly likely to operate in coalition warfare or \npeacekeeping missions. They increase our influence over recipient \ncountry actions, and in a worse case scenario, allow the U.S. to \nterminate support for equipment. Exports lower the unit costs of \nsystems to the U.S. military. In recent years they have kept mature \nlines open while the U.S. has developed new systems that will go into \nproduction around the turn of the century. Finally, these exports \nprovide the same economic benefits to the U.S. as all other exports--\nwell paying jobs, improved balance of trade, and increased tax revenue. \nThese are really issues of acquisition policy, not appropriations \nmatters.\n  Mr. President, I would prefer not to criticize this legislation. It \nis very important to the ultimate success of our ongoing war on terror. \nYet I believe it is important to point out to the American taxpayer \nwhere some of their money is going. And some of it is not going to \nprojects that have anything to do with our defense.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007, I want \nto thank all of our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines for \ntheir hard work in the ongoing fight against terrorism, in Iraq, in \nresponse to natural disasters here at home, and in the many other \nmissions to which they have been assigned around the world. These \ndedicated men and women, along with their families, are making great \nsacrifices in service to our country. We owe a tremendous debt of \ngratitude to the members of the United States Armed Forces for their \nselfless service.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is about to pass the Defense Department \nappropriations bill. While I continue to have grave concerns about the \nmisguided strategy this administration is pursuing in Iraq, the Senate \nbill includes funds for many important programs and priorities for our \nservicemen and women. In particular, the bill includes a well-deserved, \nalthough modest, 2.2 percent across-the-board pay raise for our \nmilitary personnel. It also increases funding for vital equipment for \nthose in uniform facing daily dangers in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am \nalso pleased to support a number of good\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nprovisions in this bill that seek to ensure that our troops have the \nequipment they need to perform their duties on the ground, including \nincreased funding for body armor and personal protection equipment, as \nwell as additional funding for up-armored humvees.\n  I am also pleased to support increased funds for the National Guard \nand Reserve, including an additional $340 million for force protection \nequipment. This bill includes critical funding that will help the \nNational Guard repair its equipment and reinstate a superior readiness \nlevel so that it is capable of defending our country and responding to \nnatural disasters within the continental United States.\n  While I strongly support increased funding for the National Guard, \nand for border security, I opposed Senator Sessions' amendment to \nappropriate nearly $2 billion to the Army National Guard solely to \nbuild hundreds of miles of fencing along the southern border. I did so \nbecause it is difficult to justify pouring massive Federal dollars into \nefforts that have not been shown to be effective. We must improve \nborder security but we simply do not have the data to show that border \nfences are an effective deterrent to illegal immigration. For that \nreason, I opposed the authorization of this fencing when it was \nproposed as an amendment to S. 2611, the Comprehensive Immigration \nReform Act of 2006, and I opposed appropriating the funds for it in \nthis appropriations bill.\n  The better approach would be to first implement another provision of \nS. 2611 that directs the Attorney General, in cooperation with other \nexecutive branch officials, to conduct a study on this question. The \nstudy would analyze the construction of a system of physical barriers \nalong the southern international land and maritime border, including \nthe necessity, feasibility, and impact of such barriers on the \nsurrounding area. It is estimated that construction costs for these \nborder fences is more than $1 million per mile. And that doesn't \ninclude the cost of maintaining these structures. Furthermore, there \nare very serious concerns about the environmental impact this type of \nmassive construction project would have. Before we commit to pouring \nprecious Federal dollars into a massive fencing system, at the very \nleast we should do a thorough analysis of the most effective and \nfiscally responsible means of securing our borders against illegal \ntransit.\n  While I support much of the funding for intelligence activities \ncontained in the bill, I am deeply concerned at the failure of this \nCongress to pass an intelligence authorization bill. Congressional \noversight of intelligence has never been more important. Strengthening \nour Nation's intelligence capabilities after the attacks of September \n11 requires the involvement of Congress, which is why the 9/11 \nCommission described strengthened oversight as one of its most \nimportant recommendations. The disastrous failures of intelligence \nrelated to Iraq, both by the intelligence community and by the \nadministration, further highlight the importance of thorough \ncongressional scrutiny. Recently revealed programs such as the NSA's \nillegal warrantless wiretapping and secret CIA detention facilities, \nare among the intelligence activities that the congressional \nintelligence committees must examine. Thirty years after the Senate \nIntelligence Committee was created in the aftermath of well-documented \nabuses, we need to ensure that Congress does not abdicate its important \noversight responsibilities.\n  While I do support many of the provisions in this bill, I am deeply \ndisappointed that the bill fails to put our Iraq policy on a better \nfooting. My vote for this bill in no way signals support for that \npolicy, which is hurting our national security. The war in Iraq is \nhaving a negative--and dramatic--effect on our military's capability \nand readiness levels. Because of the heavy usage of military equipment \nin Iraq, the Army National Guard's 34 brigades are not combat-ready, \nand it will be no easy task getting our physical capacity back up to \nfull strength. The costs we are incurring in Iraq are devastating and \nthey are not advancing our national interests particularly when they \nare undermining our military's capacity to defeat the terrorist \nnetworks that attacked us on 9/11. I will continue to call for the \nredeployment of our forces from Iraq so that our military remains \nstrong and so that our country can refocus on fighting the terrorist \nnetworks that attacked us on 9/11.\n  Unfortunately this spending bill contains many unnecessary items. The \nadministration continues to request large amounts for Iraq and \nAfghanistan through ``additional'' or ``emergency supplemental'' \nappropriations not subject to limits on total discretionary Federal \nspending and not subject to the full congressional authorization and \nappropriations review process. I continue to be deeply concerned about \nthis administration's priorities and about the process by which we \nconsider the Department of Defense authorization and appropriations \nbills, a concern I voice every year at this time. However, on balance, \nthis legislation contains many good provisions for our men and women in \nuniform who serve our country selflessly around the world. That is why \nI support it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in the course of attending a funeral \ntoday, I missed two votes. On the Conrad amendment No. 4907, I ask that \nthe record reflect that, had I been here, I would have voted ``aye.'' \nAnd on the motion to table the Menendez amendment No. 4909 I ask that \nthe record reflect that I would have voted ``aye.''\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for Department of \nDefense funding for the National Drug Intelligence Center in Johnstown, \nPA.\n  The National Drug Intelligence Center, NDIC, established in 1993, is \na component of the U.S. Department of Justice and a member of the \nintelligence community. The General Counterdrug Intelligence Plan, \nimplemented in February 2000, designated NDIC as the Nation's principal \ncenter for strategic domestic counterdrug intelligence. NDIC's mission \nis to provide strategic drug-related intelligence and assistance to the \ndrug control, public health, and national security authorities of the \nUnited States in order to reduce the adverse impact of drug \ntrafficking, drug abuse, and related harms in this country.\n  Since September 11, 2001, we have become gravely aware of the \nimportance of intelligence to all aspects of our national defense. This \nlesson is certainly applicable when assessing the resources generated \nby drug trafficking among terrorist groups and their sympathizers. I \nhave been told that, since January 2005, NDIC has provided support to \nthe Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence to produce the Nation's first National Money Laundering \nThreat Assessment. For this effort, NDIC received a letter of \ncommendation from the Treasury Department for its ``extraordinary \ncontribution'' to this effort. This is but one example of the fine work \nthat is provided by those who serve this country at NDIC. The center is \nalso actively contributing to the Department of Homeland Security's \nOffice of Counter Narcotics Enforcement on an ongoing drug/terror nexus \nproject. Further, NDIC personnel support the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's Special Operations Division which targets the \nconvergence of terrorism and traditional drug trafficking networks. \nThese contributions go along with the center's Document Exploitation \nDivision which, I am told, is second to none in extracting useful \ninformation from lawfully-seized evidence.\n  NDIC is providing a valuable service to this country. It is the only \nagency with the independence to provide the National Drug Threat \nAssessment while still maintaining the versatility to assist in the \nongoing operations and assessments conducted by the organizations that \nI have mentioned. The people of Johnstown who staff this facility are \nof the highest professional capabilities. It is important that we \nmaintain these capabilities as we fight the war on Islamic fascism on \nmany different fronts.\n  The House Defense appropriations bill provides $39 million for the \ncenter. I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member \nto ensure that this funding is included in the final conference report \nwith the House. I firmly believe that the National Drug Intelligence \nCenter is an important instrument in providing for our Nation's \nsecurity. I believe that the administration should include it in its \nbudget in future fiscal years. I will be writing President Bush in the \ncoming days to make this case. At a time\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\nwhen the nexus between drug traffic and terrorist groups is becoming \nmore acute, we need to make funding for our intelligence capabilities \none of our highest priorities.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the next vote will be on passage of the \nDefense appropriations bill. I congratulate the managers. It has been a \njob well done.\n  We are going to be on the port security bill tomorrow and on Monday. \nThe managers are here, and they are ready to debate and take up \namendments. We will not be voting tomorrow.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have scheduled an event on Monday at 6 \no'clock to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. We \ninvite all Members to participate.\n  There will be no more votes tonight. We will not be voting tomorrow. \nWe want to have all opening statements tonight and tomorrow on the port \nsecurity bill.\n  We will have announcements tomorrow morning as to whether we will be \nvoting on Monday. The Democratic leader and I will make that \nannouncement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to present the Port Security \nImprovement Act of 2006. This bill will help to close dangerous gaps in \nour ability to protect our shipping lanes and seaports from attack.\n  A number of our colleagues have worked very hard on this bill. This \nbill reflects not only bipartisan consultation and support but \ncoordination among the Senate Homeland Security Committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, and the Finance Committee. I thank our leader, Senator \nFrist, for encouraging and facilitating those discussions.\n  I particularly wish to thank my colleague, Senator Murray, who joined \nme in sponsoring the GreenLane cargo security bill in November of 2005, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nhas served as the basis for the legislation we debate tonight. Senator \nMurray has been steadfast in her commitment to enhancing port security. \nShe has been working on it since the attacks on our country 5 years \nago. She has been a terrific partner.\n  Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Grassley, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Coleman, and Senator Allen have also played \ncritical roles on this important legislation. Their support and \ninvolvement have been invaluable in crafting a measure that I believe \nis going to make a real difference and that will improve our protection \nagainst terrorist threats without crippling the operations of our \nports. This is very important. We need to strengthen security at our \nports, but we need to do so in a way that does not cripple our system \nof trade, that does not place barriers in the way of moving legitimate \ngoods.\n  This legislation will provide the structure and the resources needed \nto better protect the American people from attack through seaports that \nare both vulnerable points of entry and vital centers of economic \nactivity.\n  Our legislation, our joint legislation, which is the product of so \nmany weeks, months, and years of study and compromise, is a \ncomprehensive approach that addresses all major aspects of maritime \ncargo security. It would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop a comprehensive strategic plan for all transportation modes by \nwhich cargo moves into, within, and out of American ports. It creates \nan Office of Cargo Security Policy to coordinate departmental \nactivities and to be a central contact point for interagency, private \nsector, and international partners in cargo security. It requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to develop protocols for the resumption \nof trade at seaports after an incident. That is necessary to minimize \neconomic losses. It authorizes risk-based grants, training, and \nexercises for port security. It improves and expands several security \nprograms, such as the Container Security Initiative, known as CSI, and \nthe Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, or C-TPAT, and \nestablishes deadlines for DHS action on these programs. And it provides \nincentives for shippers and importers who meet the highest levels of \ncargo security standards.\n  Before commenting further on these provisions, let me offer a few \nfacts that illustrate the importance of strengthening the security of \nour seaports.\n  America's 361 seaports are vital elements of our Nation's \ntransportation network. Our seaports move more than 95 percent of \noverseas trade. In 2005 alone, U.S. ports logged 53,000 calls by \nforeign-flagged vessels, including 16,000 container ship calls that \nbrought 11 million shipping containers to our shores.\n\n  The largest 22 ports, ranging from Los Angeles to Boston, handle 98 \npercent of the container traffic. Nearly half of all container ship \ncalls are made in just three States--California, New York, and \nVirginia--but traffic arrives at many ports, from Maine to Hawaii, \nincluding a port in my State, Portland, the largest port by tonnage in \nnew England. Coming from a State with three international cargo ports, \nI am keenly aware of the importance of seaports to our national economy \nand to the communities in which they are located.\n  In addition to our ports' economic significance, the link between \nmaritime security and our national security is obvious and the \nvulnerabilities of our ports worrisome. Shipping containers are a \nspecial source of concern. When we look at shipping containers, we \nknow, in most cases, they contain useful consumer goods. But shipping \ncontainers could also be used to convey a squad of terrorists or a \ndirty bomb. In some sense, containers could be the 21st century \n``Trojan horse.''\n  The vulnerabilities of containers are evident when one considers a \nrecent incident that occurred in Seattle. In May, several Chinese \nnationalists illegally smuggled themselves within a shipping container \nthat made its way to Seattle. Now, they were discovered, fortunately, \nbut think if that container had, instead of including illegal Chinese \nimmigrants seeking a better way of life, included individuals, \nterrorists, who were dedicated to destroying our way of life.\n  The container has also been called ``the poor man's missile'' because \na low-budget terrorist could ship one across the Atlantic or the \nPacific to a U.S. port for just a few thousands dollars. And the \ncontents of a container do not have to be as complex as a nuclear or \nchemical or biological weapon. As former Customs and Border Protection \nCommissioner Robert Bonner told the New York Times last year, a single \ncontainer packed with readily available ammonium sulfate fertilizer and \na detonation system could produce 10 times the blast that destroyed the \nMurrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.\n  Whatever the type of weapon, an attack on an American port could \ncause great loss of life, damage our energy supplies and \ninfrastructure, cripple retailers and manufacturers dependent on just-\nin-time inventory, prevent farmers from exporting their crops, and \nhamper our ability to move and supply American military forces.\n  Earlier this year, I visited the ports in L.A. and Long Beach and \nSeattle. At the invitation of Senator Murray, I examined the Seattle \nport. When one looks at the busy harbor in Seattle, one sees ferries \nbringing thousands of passengers--a large urban population--in sight of \nthe port and two stadiums nearby. You realize immediately the depth and \ndestruction that a ship carrying a container with a weapon of mass \ndestruction could inflict at a single port.\n  Moreover, a successful port attack would likely trigger a security \nlockdown of all of our ports, just as the attacks 5 years ago grounded \nall commercial aircraft. So the economic damage would swiftly spread \nacross the entire country. The Pacific Coast has already given us a \nglimpse of the economic damage that an attack on a port would cause. \nThe west coast dock strike of 2002 was peaceful and anticipated, unlike \nany terror attack would be, but it cost an estimated $1 billion a day \nin economic losses for each of the 10 days it lasted.\n  Of course, a port could also be a conduit for an attack as well as \nbeing a target itself. A container with dangerous cargo could be loaded \non a truck or a railcar or have its contents unpacked at a port and \ndistributed to support an attack elsewhere--perhaps in the heartland of \nthis country.\n  For these reasons, and many others, including the risks of container \ntampering or false documentation, the 9/11 Commission concluded that \n``Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in maritime and \nsurface transportation'' as in commercial aviation.\n  Some actions have been taken to improve security at our seaports. The \n9/11 terror attacks prompted some useful moves toward better security \nfor vessel shipping lanes and the ports themselves. But, unfortunately, \nmany of these initiatives have not proceeded under a comprehensive, \nstrategic security plan. Some of them have lagged, and some of them \nhave not been effectively implemented.\n  The Senate Homeland Security Committee has conducted five hearings on \nport security and the failures of DHS's cargo security programs. The \nfirst hearing we held back in March of 2003 when the committee heard \ntestimony from several experts that cargo containers could well be the \nnext target of terrorists. Three of these hearings have been conducted \nby the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator \nColeman, and I thank him and Senator Levin for their efforts in this \narea. Indeed, several provisions in our bill address concerns that were \nidentified through that joint investigative work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Maine \nyield for just a brief comment or question or two?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just take a moment to thank Senator \nCollins for her leadership and the work of her committee in this area. \nI say to the Senator, I have been listening to her remarks. I think it \nis very important we outline the risks that are involved here and the \nimportance of our ports to the economy of America.\n  Like the Senator from Maine, I myself recently went around looking at \nlarge and small ports, from the gulf all the way to Seattle and Tacoma. \nI must\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nsay, I was somewhat pleased with the amount of effort that has been put \nin place in those ports.\n  But it also dramatizes how much more we need to do. We do need the \nmacro legislation to deal with this. One of the great concerns is, as \nthe Senator outlined, what would happen if we did have an event in one \nof those West Coast ports? It would lock them all down. What would be \nthe process to restart them? I am also very much impressed with the \nappearance of those ports and the volume of the training activities. It \nis a critical area.\n  While a lot of work has been done and money has gone to our ports, \nbig and small, we need this legislation. There is a lot more to it than \njust the restart protocols. It hasn't been easy because we have three \ncommittees with interest and jurisdiction, including Commerce and \nFinance. The Senator worked with the leadership of our Commerce \nCommittee and of the Finance Committee, and I thank the Senator for \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate that we move expeditiously on this \nlegislation and that we not play games with it in any way because this \nis serious business. I feel for the person who would oppose this kind \nof legislation, or delay it, if some incident occurs. We need to move \non it. This is the time to do it. It has been a real yeoman's task to \nbring it to this point. I wanted to be on record early commending the \nSenator from Maine, and I hope I will have an opportunity to talk later \nabout some of the substantive parts of this legislation, which is \ncritical for our country. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator from \nMississippi for his kind comments. He has been so helpful as a member \nof the Commerce Committee and the Finance Committee in helping us weave \nour way through a very difficult maze. Without his advice and support, \nI doubt that we would be here tonight. I express my personal \nappreciation to Senator Lott for his guidance and his assistance and \nfor keeping us all focused on the goal. We could never let turf battles \nor jurisdictional disputes block us from accomplishing such a needed \nand important task. He helped us keep our eye on the ball. I thank the \nSenator very much for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I was talking about the hearings we were having. Our \nmost recent hearing was in April on the GreenLane Maritime Cargo \nSecurity Act, which I mentioned Senator Murray and I had introduced. We \nheard also from the House leaders on port security, including \nRepresentative Dan Lungren and Representative Jane Harman, as well as \nother experts on our Nation's ports. The following month, that bill was \nreported out of the Homeland Security Committee.\n  The Port Security Improvement Act will clarify the roles, \nresponsibilities, and authorities of Government agencies at all levels \nand of private sector stakeholders. It will establish clear and \nmeasurable goals for better security of commercial operations from the \npoint of origin to the destination. It will also establish mandatory \nbaseline security standards and provide incentives for additional \nvoluntary measures.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Secretary of Homeland Security would be \nrequired to develop protocols for the resumption of trade in the wake \nof an attack. Five years after the 9/11 attacks, the Federal Government \nstill has not established adequate protocols for resuming port \noperations and setting cargo release priorities after an attack. I will \ntell you, when I talk to port authority directors, every single one of \nthem brings this up as a major issue. If we don't have a plan for \nrestarting our ports and for releasing cargo, then our ports will be \nclosed far longer than they would need to be and economic losses would \nmultiply.\n  This legislation would also establish priorities for critical DHS \nprograms necessary to improve maritime cargo security and would set \nclear timelines to ensure steady progress on their development and \nexpansion. Let me give another example of where DHS has languished in \nsome areas. They have made progress in others but languished in some.\n  For example, the Department has been working on a minimum standard \nfor mechanical seals on containers for more than 2 years but has yet to \nissue it. Under our bill, the Department would have 6 months to \nestablish minimum standards for securing containers in transit to the \nUnited States. All containers bound for U.S. ports of entry would have \nto meet those standards no later than 2 years after they are \nestablished.\n  The bill also provides guidance and deadlines for essential \nimprovements in the Automated Targeting System, the Radiation Portal \nMonitor Program, the CSI and C-TPAT.\n  The Automated Targeting System, ATS, is a screening mechanism that \nthe Federal Government uses to help it determine which of the 11 \nmillion containers entering this country should receive further \nscrutiny. The GAO has criticized ATS for utilizing inadequate \ninformation to accurately assess the risk of cargo, and our legislation \nwill ensure that the DHS improves that program.\n  Another notable provision of the bill is the requirement that \nradiation scanning be applied to 100 percent of the containers entering \nthe 22 largest U.S. ports by December 31, 2007. Now, the result of that \nis that 98 percent of all cargo containers coming into U.S. ports will \nbe screened for radiation. That is in addition to the radiation \nscanning that is done at foreign ports through the CSI and the \nMegaports Programs.\n  The legislation also expands and enhances the C-TPAT program to ensue \nthe security of cargo from point of origin to destination. It creates a \nGreenLane, a third tier of C-TPAT, offering additional benefits to \nparticipants that voluntarily meet the highest level of security \nstandards. The cooperation of private industry is vital to securing \nsupply chains, and C-TPAT is a necessary tool for securing their active \ncooperation in supply chain security efforts.\n  Another security measure that has languished for years is the vital \nTransportation Workers Identification Card, or the TWIC Program. Again, \nwe would require DHS to publish a final rule on the implementation of \nthis program by the end of this year.\n  Finally, this comprehensive legislation would authorize the \ncompetitive, risk-based Port Security Grants Program. It would have \nstable, consistent funding set at $400 million each year for the next 5 \nyears. This is a significant commitment of resources, and it will allow \nour ports to plan and to undertake multiyear projects that require a \nsustained investment.\n  The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 will help us construct an \neffective, layered, coordinated system that extends from the point of \norigin to the point of destination. It will cover the people, the \nvessels, the cargo, and the facilities involved in our maritime \ncommerce. And it addresses a major vulnerability identified time and \nagain by terrorism experts.\n  Mr. President, I do hope that we can proceed with all due haste to \nenact this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Port \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2006. It reflects a bipartisan compromise \nbetween the three committees that have jurisdiction over the security \nof our Nation's ports, international intermodal supply chain and the \nadministration of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This bill strikes the right balance between security and facilitating \nthe trade that is so important to our economy.\n  Our national economy depends on port security, yet amazingly, the \nadministration has not made it the priority that it needs to be. It has \nconsistently submitted inadequate funding requests and has routinely \nmissed critical security deadlines that were required by law. It was \nnot until the Dubai Ports World controversy hit the front pages of \nlocal newspapers that many members of the Congress began to take port \nsecurity seriously.\n  I hope that Members of this body will give this important piece of \nlegislation the consideration it deserves. Lastly, we all know that you \ncannot have a successful security policy without adequate funding. \nToday is a good first step, but the administration and this Congress \nmust take the next step after we pass this legislation and fund these \ninitiatives as proposed here.\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\n  There are more than 360 ports in our Nation that serve as a \ngatekeeper for our Nation's trade and commerce, bringing into the \ncountry most of the merchandise and raw materials our businesses rely \nupon. If an incident forced the shutdown of ports across the Nation, \nthe impact on our national economy would be devastating and have long-\nterm consequences.\n  The Coast Guard, through the National Maritime Transportation Act, \nhas taken important steps to create a plan to guarantee trade resumes \nquickly after an attack. However, more needs to be done to enhance the \nCoast Guard's plan and ensure effective implementation. Our economic \nhealth depends on it.\n  Given the role our ports play in the economy, we cannot underestimate \nthe importance of ensuring that the containerized cargo that comes into \nour country is safe and that the ships entering our borders do not \ncarry enemies of our Nation. Yet less than 6 percent of the cargo \ncoming into this country is inspected, a level that is unacceptable if \nwe are to take security seriously.\n  Making the current situation worse is the fact that current State \ninspection and radiation scanning technologies are woefully inadequate.\n  The measure before us today addresses the shortfalls of the past 5 \nyears. First, it enhances the examination of cargo domestically and \nbefore it reaches our shores. Second, the bill improves interagency \ncooperation. Third, it improves the sharing of intelligence information \nwith the creation of interagency port security command centers. Fourth, \nit provides an additional director within to improve communication and \ncooperation between the public and private sectors to quickly resume \ntrade should an incident occur. And fifth, the bill offers assistance \nand technical training to our partners in the war on terror. These are \nall simple fixes but fixes that have significant consequence in our \nefforts to protect our ports.\n  As we consider this piece of legislation, we must not forget the \nsecurity needs of our other transportation systems. Amendments will be \noffered to this bill that relate to securing other modes of \ntransportation and it is my intent to support those amendments as well \nso that we have a comprehensive approach to securing our \ninfrastructure.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this bill as soon as possible. \nOur approach has broad bipartisan support. The Senate Commerce, Science \nand Transportation Committee has focused on the issues of \ntransportation security long before the events of September 11, 2001.\n  We have dedicated substantial time and resources to oversee and \ninvestigate the security and safety of our Nation's systems of \ntransportation and this bill will mark the fourth landmark \ntransportation security related bill that has been brought before the \nSenate. The time is right to pass these needed security improvements, \nand I am hopeful that we can make it happen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has been 5 years since September 11, \nand our country is still dangerously vulnerable. We have huge loopholes \nat our ports and in our cargo container system, and none of us should \nsleep well at night until we close those security holes and protect our \ncountry.\n  That is why I am on the Senate floor once again pushing for us to \npass the bipartisan GreenLane bill. I am excited that after working for \na number of years, we are now on the verge of making our country more \nsecure.\n  The full House of Representatives passed our bill. The Senate \nHomeland Security Committee passed our bill. We have worked with the \nCommerce and Finance Committees to address the issues in the bill they \nhave raised. Now it is up to us, the full Senate, to finally pass this \nbill.\n  Today I wish to explain why our ports are so vulnerable, how an \nattack would affect our people and our economy, and finally, how this \nbill will make us more secure and keep trade flowing.\n  To understand why our ports are so vulnerable, one just has to look \nat something that happened in my home State of Washington 3 weeks ago.\n  On August 16, there was a big scare at the Port of Seattle. Two \ncontainers that originated in Pakistan were offloaded at terminal 18. \nThey were targeted for inspection. They were first scanned by a gamma-\nimaging machine, which is essentially a giant x-ray machine for cargo \ncontainers. The initial images suggested what was supposed to be in the \ncontainer was different than what that x-ray scan showed. Next, the \nport officials brought in two security dogs, and both dogs detected \nwhat they thought were explosives in that cargo container at terminal \n18.\n  To understand why that is such a scary incident in Seattle, one just \nhas to look at the Port of Seattle and what surrounds it.\n  This photograph shows the Port of Seattle. We can see the port very \nclearly in the foreground. That is Seattle in the background. My \ncolleague, Senator Collins, was out there and remarked, tonight and \nwhile she was out there, about the incredible closeness to where our \ncontainers are brought into the Port of Seattle, to where our downtown \narea is, where there are two sports stadiums that can have thousands \nand thousands of people at one time sitting in them, and I-5 is over \nhere. That is the main highway that goes through the State of \nWashington, right through downtown Seattle. As one can see, these cargo \ncontainers sitting on these docks are within feet and yards of mass \npeople, infrastructure, our community, our railroads, our \ntransportation system, sports stadiums, and where people live and work.\n  During the scare I just mentioned, officials had to close the \nterminal and establish a 500-yard safety zone surrounding the terminal, \nand they had to create a 300-yard safety zone around the entire Seattle \nwaterfront. Fortunately, that day, after having the port closed down \nfor some time, further testing showed that what was in that container \nwas just a false alarm.\n  I wish to take a second to commend everyone on the ground for doing \nan excellent job of immediately responding to a possibly very dangerous \nincident.\n  Here is the problem: We did not know what was in that container. We \ndid not know. It could have posed a problem, and it was sitting right \non the dock, right within our sports stadiums, within all of downtown \nSeattle, within our transportation systems, and where people live and \nwork.\n  That is why we are presenting this bill tonight. The main idea of \nthis bill is to push our country's borders out, to do the screening and \ntesting for these cargo containers overseas so that the container never \ngets close to our shores if we think it is dangerous. But today, too \noften we wait until that container is sitting on American soil, \ndangerously close to our cities, before we find out whether it could \npose a danger.\n  Fortunately, that Seattle incident ended well, but that very same \nweek, we got a very stark warning about how it could have ended \ndifferently.\n  In August around the same time, the RAND Center for Terrorism and \nRisk Management Policy issued a very troubling report that showed what \ncould happen if there is a nuclear device in a cargo container.\n  The RAND Corporation looked at the following scenario: terrorists put \na 10-kiloton nuclear bomb inside a cargo container and detonated it at \nthe port of Long Beach, CA. The researchers chose that scenario \nbecause, as they put it, ``analysts consider it feasible, it is highly \nlikely to have a catastrophic effect, and the target is both a key part \nof the U.S. economic structure and a critical global shipping center.''\n  Here is what they said would have happened: Up to 60,000 people would \nbe killed instantly from the blast or from radiation poisoning; 150,000 \npeople would be injured by radiation exposure; up to 6 million people \nwould flee Los Angeles; 2 to 3 million people would need to be \nrelocated because their land would be contaminated by radiation. And \nfinally, the economic loss simply would be about $1 trillion. That is \n10 times worse than September 11. Those costs would include medical \ncare, insurance claims, workers' compensation, evacuation, \nconstruction. Imagine that--the economic damage would be 10 times worse \nthan what happened on September 11.\n\n  How many more reports such as that is it going to take? How many port \nevacuations and scares is it going to take before we get serious about \nport\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nsecurity? Time is not on our side. Each year, 6 million cargo \ncontainers enter our U.S. seaports, and that number is expected to \nquadruple in the next 20 years. These cargo containers carry the \nbuilding blocks of our economy, but without adequate security, they can \nalso provide an opportunity for terrorists to deliver a deadly one-two \npunch to our country. The first punch would create untold number of \nAmerican casualties. The second punch would bring our economy to a \nhalt. Today we are not doing enough to keep America safe.\n  Standing in this Chamber, it can feel as if the dangers at our ports \nare a distant concern, but given that our ports are connected to our \nNation's transportation system and are close to our major population \ncenters, the threat is never far away.\n  I want to share a very disturbing photo that shows us what a \nterrorist attack could look like. On March 21, a container ship called \nthe Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast of Yemen when an \nexplosion occurred in the rear of the ship. This is a photo of what \nhappened. This is a container ship close to Yemen with an explosion at \nthe rear of the ship. Remember the picture I just showed of the port of \nSeattle and where we are and imagine this happening in the Port of \nSeattle.\n  What happened when this ship exploded was that 90 containers were \nblown off the side of this ship and it created a debris field 5 miles \nlong. Thankfully, amazingly, there were no fatalities and the crew was \nrescued.\n  This incident, by the way, did not appear to be terrorist related, \nbut it gives us an idea of what it would look like if a terrorist \nincident occurred on a container ship in one of our seaports.\n  I want my colleagues to imagine the same burning ship sitting just a \nfew feet off our shores in New York Harbor or Puget Sound, off the \ncoast of Los Angeles or Charleston, Miami, Portland, Hampton Roads, the \nDelaware Bay, or the Gulf of Mexico. Now imagine we are not dealing \nwith just a conventional explosion; we are dealing with a dirty bomb. I \nwant to walk through what would happen next.\n  Of course, there would be the immediate horrible loss of life. Many \nof our ports, as I said, are located near major cities. If this were a \nchemical weapon exploding in Seattle, the chemical plume could \ncontaminate the rail system, Interstate 5, SeaTac Airport, not to \nmention, as I showed my colleagues, the downtown business and \nresidential areas. At the port, there would immediately be tremendous \nconfusion. People would try to contain the fire, but it is unclear \ntoday who would be in charge. Then when word spread and chaos ensued, \npanic would set in and there would be chaos as our first responders \ntried to react and people who lived nearby would try to flee.\n  Next, what would happen is our Government would shut down every \nsingle port in America to make sure there were no other bombs on any \nother containers in any other city. That shutdown would be the \nequivalent of driving our economy into a brick wall and, in fact, it \ncould spark a global recession. Day by day, we would feel the painful \neconomic impact of the attack. American factories in the middle of our \ncountry would not be able to get the supplies they need. They would \nhave to shut their doors and lay off workers. Stores around our country \nwould not be able to get the products they need to put on their \nshelves. Prices would spike, demand would outweigh supply, and \nconsumers would not be able to afford the simple items they rely on \nevery single day.\n  In 2002, we saw what the closure of just a few ports on the west \ncoast could do. It cost our economy $1 billion a day. Imagine if we \nshut down all of our ports. One study, in fact, concluded that if U.S. \nports were shut down for just 9 days, it would cost our economy $58 \nbillion.\n  The RAND report I mentioned earlier found the economic damage could \neasily top more than $1 trillion. Of course, we would soon realize we \nhave no plan for resuming trade after an attack. We have no plan today \nfor how we would resume trade, no protocol for what would be searched. \nWe wouldn't know what would be allowed in or even who was in charge, \nand there would be a mass scramble to create a new system in a crisis \natmosphere. Eventually, we would begin the slow process of manually \ninspecting all the cargo waiting to enter the United States. One report \nfound it could take as long as 4 months to get all the cargo inspected \nand moving again.\n  Finally, we would have to set up a new regime for port security. You \ncan bet that any kind of rushed plan we put together in this kind of \nscenario would not balance strong security with efficient trade.\n  This is a realistic portrayal of events that could happen tomorrow. \nFive years after September 11, we have not closed a major loophole that \nthreatens our lives and our economy. Time is not on our side. We have \nto act, and we need to act now.\n  I approach this as someone who really understands the importance of \nboth improving our security and maintaining the flow of commerce. My \nhome State of Washington is the most trade-dependent State in the \nentire country. We know what is at stake if there is an incident at one \nof our ports. That is why I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce to \nhelp us find where we are vulnerable and to evaluate the best security \npractices. It is why I worked hard to boost funding for the Coast \nGuard, and I fought to keep the Port Security Grant Program from being \neliminated year after year.\n  Right after September 11, 5 years ago, I started talking with \nsecurity and trade experts to find out what we needed to be doing to \nboth improve security and keep our commerce going. Last year, I sought \nout Senator Collins as a partner in this effort. I approached Senator \nCollins because I knew she cared about this issue. I knew she had done \na lot of work on it already, and I knew she was someone who could get \nthings done. Since that day, she and I have worked hand in hand to \ndevelop this bill and to move it forward.\n  The reason we worked so hard on this bill is because we know how \nvulnerable we are. Terrorists have a lot of opportunities to introduce \ndeadly cargo into a container. It can be tampered with at any time from \nwhen it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it arrives at a \nconsolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port. It could even be \ntampered with while it is en route to the United States. There are \nseveral dangers. I outlined what would happen if terrorists exploded a \ncontainer, but they could just as easily use cargo containers to \ntransport weapons or personnel into the United States to launch an \nattack anywhere on American soil. In fact, in April, 22 Chinese \nstowaways were found at the Port of Seattle. They reached the United \nStates inside a cargo container. In that case, they were stowaways, but \nthey could easily have been terrorists sneaking into this country.\n\n  The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate. Last \nyear, thanks to the insistence of Senator Collins and Senator Coleman, \nthe Government Accountability Office found its C-TPAT was not even \nchecking to see if companies were doing what they promised they would \nin their security plans. Even when U.S. Customs inspectors do find \nsomething suspicious today at a foreign port, they can't force a \ncontainer to be inspected. So we have a clear and deadly threat, and we \nknow that current programs are inadequate. So what are we going to do \nabout it? We could manually inspect every container coming into our \nports, but that would cripple our economy.\n  The real challenge we face is how to make our trade more secure \nwithout slowing it to a crawl. That is why the Homeland Security, \nCommerce, and Finance Committees, through the leadership of Senators \nCollins and Lieberman, Senators Stevens and Inouye, and Senators \nGrassley and Baucus and I, have worked with stakeholders and experts to \nstrike the right balance. The result is the bill that we are now \nconsidering. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we improve \nsecurity while keeping our trade efficient. At its heart, this \nchallenge is about keeping the good things about trade--speed and \nefficiency--without being vulnerable to the bad things about trade, \nwhich is the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce.\n  The GreenLane bill does five things. First of all, it creates tough \nnew standards for all cargo. Today, we don't have any standards for \ncargo security.\n  Second, it creates a GreenLane option which provides for an even \nhigher level of security. Companies have the\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\noption to follow the higher standards of the GreenLane. Their cargo \nwill be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves the factory \nfloor overseas until it reaches the United States. We will know \neverywhere their cargo has been. We will know every person who has \ntouched it, and we will know whether it has been tampered with. The \nGreenLane pushes our borders out by conducting inspections overseas \nbefore cargo is even loaded into a ship bound for the United States, \nand we will provide incentives for the companies that use this highest \nstandard of GreenLane.\n  Third, our bill sets up a plan to resume trade quickly and safely, to \nminimize the impact of a terrorist attack on our economy.\n  Fourth, our bill will secure our ports here at home by authorizing \nand funding port security grants. This funding will help our ports and \nport operators to develop and implement security plans. They could use \nthis funding to strengthen their perimeter security, which would help \nprevent a number of security lapses that were highlighted in a recent \nSeattle Times article in which a reporter was able to enter a port and \nwalk around the containers without anybody stopping him.\n  Finally, our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo \nsecurity. DHS is long overdue in establishing cargo security standards \nand transportation worker credentials. We need to hold DHS accountable, \nand our bill provides the infrastructure to ensure accountability and \ncoordination.\n  Let me take a few minutes to share a few ways that our bill does make \nAmerica safer. First of all, we close the loopholes that leave us \nvulnerable today. Senator Collins and I have studied the 9/11 \nCommission Report and the various GAO reports and we worked very hard \nto put their recommendations into this bill. The 9/11 Commission \nexamined what went wrong 5 years ago and how we can prevent another \nterrorist attack. We listened to the 9/11 Commission and we worked very \nhard to incorporate their recommendations and to close the loopholes \nthat the Commission identified. The 9/11 Commission said we needed a \nlayered security system. Our bill adopts that layered approach.\n  Here is what we envision as the Secretary of Homeland Security \nimplements this bill. Each step in the GreenLane system will have \nmultiple and redundant security layers. Cargo would be monitored and \nsecured starting at a foreign factory overseas. In addition, containers \nwill be sealed with high-tech container security devices, such as e-\nseals, to protect against their being tampered with or compromised. \nThen, before that container is ever loaded onto a ship, its manifest is \nreviewed and the container is inspected for radiation, seal tampering, \nand x-rayed. Finally, the cargo will be secured with access controls, \nensuring anyone with access to GreenLane cargo has undergone a \nbackground check and possesses verifiable identification. Those \nmultiple layers provide the type of layered security that the 9/11 \nCommission called for.\n  Now, the 9/11 Commission also said we have to centralize authority \nand responsibility so that there is finally someone accountable in our \nGovernment. Our bill does that. It centralizes authority by \nestablishing the Office of Cargo Security Policy within the Department \nof Homeland Security to coordinate Federal cargo security programs and \nto advance security research and development.\n  The 9/11 Commission also said we need to do a better job sharing \ninformation throughout our Government. Our bill promotes coordination \nby establishing regional interagency operational centers to enhance \ncooperation between our Federal agencies. So our bill is responsive to \nthe problems and the loopholes that the 9/11 Commission identified.\n  Our bill gives us new tools so we can approach cargo security in new \nways. It gives U.S. officials in foreign ports the authority to inspect \nsuspicious containers before they are loaded for departure into the \nUnited States. Our bill makes the haystack of containers smaller. It \nallows the Government to focus on suspicious cargo that enters our \nports, and it ensures that we are inspecting and stopping cargo that \nposes a threat. And it cuts down on the smuggling of weapons, people, \ndrugs, and other illegal cargo.\n  This bill will also protect America's economy in the event of a \nterror attack, and that is because it provides a secure, organized way \nto quickly resume cargo operations after any emergency shutdown because \nany shutdown of our ports has the potential to cost the U.S. economy \nbillions of dollars a day. Our bill would minimize the economic impact \nof a terrorist attack.\n\n  So I am very proud of this bill, and I thank all of our partners and \nall of our supporters. I especially thank Senator Collins for her \ntremendous leadership and work on this very complex issue, and I \ncommend her for the job she has done. I thank Senator Coleman for his \nwork as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I \nthank Senator Lieberman and all of our cosponsors, and I thank the \nCommerce and Finance Committees, especially Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus.\n  We have also seen tremendous progress on the House side with the Safe \nPort Act, and I want to thank Representatives Dan Lundgren and Jane \nHarman for their leadership. Finally, I especially tonight thank the \nnumerous Federal, State and local officials and all of the industry \nrepresentatives for their tremendous assistance in helping us craft \nthis legislation. They truly are at the front lines of securing our \nNation's ports, and I have been very proud to work with all of them and \nto get to know them and see their dedication and commitment to making \nour country more secure.\n  Today, we have a choice in how we deal with the cargo security \nchallenges that face us, but if we wait for a disaster, our choices are \ngoing to be pretty stark. So I think we have to make the changes now, \non our terms, before there is a deadly incident. Let's protect America \nbefore an image like this appears on our television screens. Let's not \nwait until a terrorist incident strikes again to protect our people and \nto protect our economy.\n  Earlier this year, the American people woke up, and they spoke out \nwhen they heard that a foreign government-owned company could be \nrunning our ports. That sparked a very critical debate. Now we need to \nset up a security regime that will actually make us safer. Until we do \nso, none of us should sleep well at night. A terrible image like this \nof a burning container ship with a dirty bomb in one of America's \nharbors could be on our TV screens tomorrow. So this Congress needs to \nact today. We only have a few days to get this right, and I hope that \nall of our colleagues will work with all of us to move this bill \nquickly and expeditiously and pass a GreenLane bill before it is too \nlate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator for her \nexcellent statement, for her leadership, and for getting us to where we \nare today. It has been a long journey, but with her leadership we were \nable to craft this bill, work out the many compromises, and come to the \nfloor. I hope we can do this bill relatively quickly. It has been the \nsubject of an awful lot of discussion and review, and it would be \nterrific if we can show the American people that we can act in a \nbipartisan way on an issue that really matters to their security.\n  It is appropriate that the Presiding Officer tonight is the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Allen. I know that port security has been a \nmajor priority of his. Earlier in my statement, I mentioned that \nCalifornia, New York, and Virginia are the three States that receive \nthe greatest number of containers, although actually I would think that \nWashington State has to be in there, too, given the size of Seattle and \nTacoma's ports as well. So I know they should be in there as well. But \nVirginia is a major player in port security, and I want to commend the \nSenator from Virginia for his leadership on this issue. I know that \nthis has been of great concern to him. He has talked to me as this bill \nhas been making its way through the process, and I publicly thank him \nfor caring about this issue and making it a priority as well.\n  Mr. President, I am not aware of further Members who are seeking to \nspeak on my side, and I see no indication of further Members on the \nother side. I am going to, very briefly, put in a quorum call so that \nwe can check, but\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\nI believe we are very close to concluding our business for tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men \nand women in uniform serving the United States around the world, and \nobserve a somber milestone in Michigan's contribution to Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  In August, the 100th member of the U.S. Armed Forces from Michigan \nmade the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Iraq. U.S. Army 1SG Aaron \nJagger of Hillsdale died when a roadside bomb detonated near his \nvehicle in Ramadi, Iraq. Sergeant Jagger was serving his second tour in \nIraq. I offer my heartfelt condolences to Sergeant Jagger's family.\n  As of the first week of September, 104 members of the U.S. Armed \nforces with ties to Michigan have lost their lives while serving in \nIraq. I will ask that a list of their names be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  No words can express our country's gratitude for the dedicated \nservice and ultimate sacrifice of Sergeant Jagger or the other \nAmericans who have lost their lives. I am also thankful for the \nsacrifice all the men and women in the U.S. military have made for \ntheir country while serving in Iraq. They are selfless patriots that \ngive their time and too often their lives to preserve the freedoms we \nhold so dear.\n  I know that condolences offered to these brave families and words \nspoken on the floor of the Senate cannot possibly make up for their \nloss. But it is important that they know we remember them and that our \nprayers and thoughts are with those that have lost loved ones, and \nthose that still have family and friends serving in harm's way.\n  I will remain committed to honoring their memory and ensuring that \ntheir families and their comrades who return from battle receive the \nsupport and respect they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Major Kevin Nave, Union Lake; Private Brandon Sloan, \n     Fraser; Sergeant Todd Robbins, Pentwater; Sergeant Michael \n     Pedersen, Flint; Private First Class Juan Garza, Jr., \n     Temperance; Private First Class Jason Meyer, Howell; Staff \n     Sergeant Scott Sather, Clio; Specialist Richard Goward, \n     Midland; Sergeant Sean Reynolds, East Lansing; Master \n     Sergeant William Payne, Otsego; Staff Sergeant Brett \n     Petriken, Flint; Specialist Corey Hubbell, Holly; Captain \n     Paul Cassidy, Laingsburg; Sergeant Trevor Blumberg, Canton; \n     Specialist Donald Wheeler, Concord; Specialist Artimus \n     Brassfield, Flint; Staff Sergeant Paul Johnson, Calumet; \n     Staff Sergeant Mark Vasquez, Port Huron; Staff Sergeant Paul \n     Neff, II, West Branch; Private First Class Damian Bushart, \n     Waterford.\n       Private First Class Jason Wright, Luzerne; Staff Sergeant \n     Thomas Christensen, Atlantic Mine; Staff Sergeant Stephen \n     Hattamer, Gwinn; Private First Class Holly J.

Mr. President, next week marks the fifth anniversary \nof the attacks of September 11. On this solemn occasion, we reflect \nupon the lives of those who were lost and the families they left \nbehind. Images of the planes hitting the two massive towers filled with \ninnocent Americans are emblazoned in our minds and stir our conscience. \nHeroic tales of firefighters, police officers and first responders \nfalling in the line of duty evoke deep pangs of sadness yet fill our \nhearts with great pride for our country.\n  It is important that during this time we remember the families of \nthese victims of terror. They have suffered greatly, and we continue to \nmourn for their loved ones and honor their memories. But there are some \nfamilies whose grief is also mixed with fear. The victims for whom they \ngrieve were immigrants working in the World Trade Center, and the \nfamilies that are left behind face potential deportation. Thus, in \naddition to the already incalculable loss inflicted upon them by the \nterrorists, these relatives face yet another hardship.\n  It is in the context of this situation that I wish to recognize the \nwork of Debra Brown Steinberg. For the past 5 years, Ms. Steinberg has \ntirelessly sought to undo this injustice and allow these relatives to \ngrieve alongside the thousands of other victims' families without fear \nof arrest and removal. Ms. Steinberg has dedicated her time--pro bono--\nto this cause and has been recognized time and again for her efforts.\n  My colleagues and I introduced legislation, known as the September 11 \nFamily Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act, which would provide the \nnecessary relief for these families. Now that a year has passed since \nthe bill's introduction, and as we approach the fifth anniversary of 9/\n11, it is time to bring closure for the sake of the families and for \nthe sake of honoring the memories of those killed.\n  Our tradition teaches us to have compassion for the widow, the \norphan,\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nand the stranger among us. Debra Steinberg's action on behalf of the \nimmigrant victims' families exemplifies such compassion.

On Friday, September \n9, 2006, the 300th AFA Battalion will gather for a reunion 56 years \nafter the Battle at Soyang during the Korean war.\n  In 1951, the members of the battalion put down their plowshares and \npicked up their rifles and arrived in Korea to push back three corps of \nthe Chinese People's Volunteers that launched a major offensive against \nthe 2d Infantry Division, to which the 300th was attached. In his \nmemoir, a Wyoming National Guardsman, William W. Day IV, described his \nearly days in combat:\n\n       The guns are hot and ammo can't be uncrated fast enough. \n     The motor pool is using every truck to haul ammo. The cooks, \n     clerks and everyone available are preparing ammo while the \n     gun crews stay at their posts and continue to pour a \n     withering fire on the enemy.\n\n  The 300th provided devastating artillery fire support that pounded \nenemy positions for 7 days inflicting thousands of enemy casualties. \nDuring the morning of May 18, 1951, the battalion was given the mission \nof destroying an enemy roadblock allowing retreating U.N. forces to \nfall back to more secure positions. The heroic and determined stand of \nthe 2d Division and its attached units allowed the Eighth Army to \nregroup and outflank the enemy.\n  Among many others, the battalion has been awarded the Presidential \nUnit Citation for its valiant efforts in the struggle for the freedom \nwe all enjoy. Today, the Wyoming Army National Guard carries on the \ncourageous traditions of the Cowboy Artillery.\n  Mr. President, the 300th AFA Battalion epitomized the ethos of the \nCitizen Soldier. It is because of folks like the members of the 300th \nthat we continue to live safe and free. America's men and women who \nanswer the call of service and wear our Nation's uniform deserve \nrespect and recognition for the enormous burden that they are willingly \nbare. They put everything on the line every day, and as a result, our \nNation remains free and strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9105-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  COMMENDING HAWAII'S WORLD CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Hilo All-\nStars, the 2006 Cal Ripken Baseball World Champions. This is the second \nconsecutive year that a team from Hawaii captured the 12-and-under \ntitle. Last year, a Honolulu squad defeated Mexico, by a score of 1 to \nnothing, to win the championship game.\n  On Sunday, August 20, Hilo won the Ripken World Series in Aberdeen, \nMD against international champions Mexico, by the score of 5 to 2. \nRidge Hoopii-Haslam hit a two-run homer, and Kawika Pruett added a two-\nrun single to rally Hilo against Mexico's powerful pitching staff that \nallowed only three runs in the tournament. Mexico threatened in the \nthird inning, but Kean Wong came in to pitch out of a bases loaded jam, \nholding Mexico to just one run.\n  The Hilo All-Star team members are Anson Arruda, Ridge Hoopii-Haslam, \nDean Hosaka, Jordan Jinbo, Chayce Kaaua, Kian Kurokawa, Rylan Malakaua, \nEkolu Martins, Cody Ray Okabayashi, Kawika Pruett, Kean Wong, and Kiani \nWong. Kaha Wong manages the All-Stars and Wardell ``Baba'' Lancaster \nand Jason Jinbo are team coaches.\n  I am proud of Hilo's impressive wins and the humility and \nsportsmanship they displayed as they won with aloha. Hilo represented \nthe State of Hawaii and the United States very well. Many family \nmembers and friends made sacrifices to support the team. I applaud \nthese efforts and wish all the players and their families the best in \nfuture endeavors.\n  I look forward to hearing more about the success of our players as \nthey continue to pursue their education and baseball ambitions in the \nfuture, and I extend the same congratulations and best wishes to all \nplayers and coaches who participated in this year's Cal Ripken Baseball \nWorld Series.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9105-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO EAGLE-PICHER TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize San \nBernardino Valley College. This academic year, the campus celebrates \nits 80th anniversary.\n  San Bernardino Valley College was founded in 1926, when 140 students \nmet at San Bernardino or Colton High Schools for classes. Later that \nyear, construction began in the city of San Bernardino on a campus that \nwould come to educate 700,000 students and play a central role in the \ngrowth of Inland southern California.\n  San Bernardino Valley College has educated generations of the \nregion's future leaders and workforce. Over the years, San Bernardino \nValley College has anticipated and planned for the changes that took \nplace in California and our Nation. During World War II, the campus \nplayed an instrumental role in assisting with the war effort. In the \nyears following the war, a number of celebrities visited the campus, \nand in 1947 the campus hosted the Bob Hope show that featured Desi \nArnaz, his orchestra, and others. In 1950, the campus played a central \nrole in the race for U.S. Senate, hosting senatorial candidates Richard \nNixon and Helen Gahagan Douglas.\n  San Bernardino Valley College also has worked to meet the ever-\nchanging needs of a diverse population. The civil rights era brought \nforth increased cultural awareness, and the campus responded by hosting \ndiversity programs. Today the campus has an enrollment of over 12,000 \nstudents, three quarters of which are non-White students. The campus is \nrecognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution by the Hispanic \nAssociation of Colleges and Universities, HACU, and continues to \nreceive title V funding for its pursuit of ethnic diversity.\n  In the past 80 years, technology has also impacted education. Faculty \nand staff have worked to help San Bernardino Valley College grow and \nadapt to this ever-growing need. College classes and degree programs \nare now offered not only on campus but at alternative community sites \nand on television and the Internet. The campus has also responded to \ntoday's need for quality science education and important student \nservices.\n  San Bernardino Valley College has produced influential leaders in \nCalifornia and abroad, with prestigious alumni emerging each year. Dr. \nCharles Young attended Valley College before and after serving in the \nKorean war and went on to become the youngest chancellor of a \nUniversity of California campus at age 36, taking charge of UCLA from \n1968 until 1997, completing the longest tenure of any University of \nCalifornia chancellor. Judith Valles, former mayor of the city of San \nBernardino, attended Valley College and served as both faculty and \nstaff on campus. Graduating in 1966, Dr. Yolanda Moses went on to serve \nas the president of the City College of New York and was named the 74th \npresident of the American Anthropological Association. And graduating \nas a business administration major in 1959, Jack Brown went on to \nbecome the president and CEO of Stater Bros. Markets, one of the \nNation's largest supermarket chains.\n  Today San Bernardino Valley College can look back on a proud history \nof growth and change in the San Bernardino Valley and California. I \napplaud the service and dedication of the faculty, staff, and students \nof San Bernardino Valley College as they celebrate 80 years of \nimproving lives and education to the people of the Inland Empire and \nsouthern California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9106-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORIAM: MARY BOURDETTE\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on Tuesday, September 5, our \nNation lost a great American and our Nation's children lost a great \nfriend and advocate in Mary Bourdette.\n  Mary Bourdette was a woman who dedicated her working life to \nimproving the lives of children and families. As a public interest \nadvocate and public servant, she played critical roles in the enactment \nof the Act for Better Child Care, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act, the expansions of the earned-income tax \ncredit, and the child care and development block grant. She worked to \nimprove the Head Start Program by increasing funds dedicated to \nstrengthening its quality and maintaining its comprehensive approach to \nhelping our poorest children and families. Most recently, I had the \npleasure of partnering with Mary in her capacity as director of \ngovernment relations for Parents Action for Children to highlight the \ndangers to children of exposure to violent and explicit video games.\n  Those of us fortunate enough to have worked closely with Mary \nBourdette and to have enjoyed her friendship will dearly miss her keen \nunderstanding of policy, her gentle manner and humor. Mary seemed to \nwake up every day believing that it held an opportunity to make the \nworld better for children.\n  For her passion, commitment, and service, our country owes Mary \nBourdette a great debt of gratitude. We have lost a caring, creative, \nand effective ally in our work to protect children and empower their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9106-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ROLLA NOLTING McCLANAHAN\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a wonderful \nOhioan who has recently been ill. Rolla Nolting McClanahan never asked \nfor anything special, but she deserves to be recognized today for the \nyears she has spent generously serving others. Throughout her life, \nRolla has been a productive, giving member of her community who quietly \ncontributed a great deal both to her hometown of Cincinnati, and to her \nhome county, Hamilton County. Rolla is the kind of American who makes \nup the backbone of our country.\n  Rolla is the beloved wife of Donald E. McClanahan, mother of Michele \nL. McClanahan, and sister of John A. Nolting.\n  As a student, Rolla was very bright. She graduated with honors from \nboth Withrow High School and the University of Cincinnati, where she \nwas active in Mortar Board, Delta Delta Delta, the Cincinnatus Society, \nand the Union Committee.\n  After graduation, Rolla became involved in her community as a member \nof Kindervelt, a volunteer organization that serves as the largest \nauxiliary of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. She was \nalso Chairman of the Board of Directors of Deaconesses of the Mt. \nWashington Presbyterian Church and Chairman of the Board of Directors \nof Tri Deltas House Board Corporation.\n  Since 1973, Rolla has been a Salvation Army volunteer for the \nSalvation Army Federation of Women's Auxiliaries, where she served in \nseveral official positions, including President of the Board and \nPresident of the Toy Shop Auxiliary. In 1987, she was a featured \nspeaker at the Salvation Army's National Advisory Organization \nConference in Dallas. In May of 1993, she was presented with the \nWilliam Booth Award, bestowed by the Salvation Army for commitment and \ndedication.\n  Mr. President, Rolla Nolting McClanahan is a wonderful person who has \nspent a great deal of her life working to improve the lives of those \nless fortunate. Today, I want to thank Rolla for her selflessness and \ncommitment to others, and wish her well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9106-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9106-S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN PARRY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I congratulate my friend John \nParry on his retirement after 16 years as director of athletics at \nButler University.\n  Since joining Butler in 1990, John has overseen a remarkable period \nof growth and success, adding three varsity athletic teams and winning \nthe Horizon League James J. McCafferty Trophy for all-sports excellence \nfor the first time and on five subsequent occasions. During this time, \nButler also witnessed extraordinary success in the classroom, leading \nthe Horizon League in the number of student-athletes named to the \nacademic honor roll 9 out of the last 10 years. In 2003 he was \nrecognized as National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics \nI-AA/I-AAA Athletic Director of the Year for the Central Region.\n  John's leadership has extended beyond Butler University. He is a past\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\npresident of the Pioneer Football League and past chair of the NCAA \nDivision I Men's Lacrosse Committee. Especially important in the \nIndianapolis community, he served as a cochairman of the Local \nOrganizing Committee for the 1997, 2000, and 2006 NCAA Men's Final Four \nand the 2005 NCAA Women's Final Four.\n  Personally, I have enjoyed working closely with John each year as \nButler hosts the annual Dick Lugar Run and Walk. John's enthusiasm has \nensured the success of this special tradition as so many from all over \ncentral Indiana come together to enjoy a day of competition and \nfitness.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to congratulate John, and I look \nforward to many more opportunities to work closely with him as he \npursues new challenges and adventures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ANGELS OF ADOPTION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, later this month, the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption will host a gala to honor \nindividuals from across the country that have contributed greatly to \nprograms that strive to keep our most vulnerable children safe and \nhealthy in permanent homes.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Coalition and this \nevent marks a true celebration for individuals we call Angels of \nAdoption. The Angel of Adoption awards recognize individuals who are \ndedicated to the welfare of children. It should be noted that our \n``Angels'' often forgo lucrative positions in law firms and other \nprivate sector work because of their commitment to provide legal \nprotection for thousands of children.\n  This year I am delighted to honor Mary Ellen Griffith as our West \nVirginia Angel of Adoption. Mary Ellen Griffith is the founder and past \ndirector of ChildLaw Services in Princeton, WV. Ms. Griffith has \nearnestly provided policy and legal advocacy for West Virginia children \nduring her tenure as a legal service lawyer. Her direct representation \nof children has been complimented by faculty appointments to university \nprograms where she has lectured on topics such as family law, \nguardianship, and custody issues. She certainly is well prepared for \nher recent appointment as a family law judge. Her work on the bench \nwill offer the court the high level knowledge, experience and \nsensitivity required to safeguard the well-being of children.\n  I am well aware that the essential efforts of the courts can go \nunrecognized. But I maintain a very high regard for the courts because \nthey regularly play a vital role in adoption and child protection. That \nis why I introduced the We Care Kids Act with Senator Mike DeWine of \nOhio last year, and was proud when it was incorporated into the law \nearlier this year. This act now gives our local courts the necessary \nresources and training through Federal grants issued by the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  Dedicated judges like Mary Ellen Griffith will play a pivotal role in \nprompting adoptions and working to ensure that our most vulnerable \nchildren are safe, healthy and have a permanent home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MAYOR BOB O'CONNOR\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today in sadness I acknowledge \nthe passing of a fine man, a great Pennsylvanian, a life-long \nPittsburgher, Robert E. O'Connor, Jr, mayor of Pittsburgh.\n  Bob O'Connor loved Pittsburgh. He was born in Pittsburgh, graduated \nfrom the city's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1962, and lived, with \nhis wife Judy, in Squirrel Hill for 41 years. Like so many Pittsburgh \nsons, Bob began his working life in the steel mills, where he worked \nfor 5 years before moving on, entering the family restaurant business. \nAfter 29 years in the private sector, Bob decided to enter the public \nsquare, and was elected to Pittsburgh's City Council in 1991.\n  In a testament to both his effectiveness as a city legislator and the \nprofessional manner in which he always conducted himself, Bob became \nCity Council President 7 years after he first joined the Council. For 5 \nyears, he served Pittsburgh as its highest ranking legislative \nofficial, resigning only when Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell tapped \nBob to serve, as the face of his administration in the southwestern \nPennsylvania. Two years later, in November of 2005, Bob was elected the \n58th mayor of Pittsburgh.\n  There was much he sought to do as mayor, much he had planned for our \nproud city. Tragically, he never got the chance. Merely 7 months after \nhe took office, Bob O'Connor was diagnosed with brain cancer. He \nimmediately began to undergo aggressive treatment, working to get \nhealthy enough to return to serving his city. Sadly, his illness \nprogressed, and on September 1, Mayor O'Connor passed away.\n  Today, September 7, Mayor Bob O'Connor was laid to rest in \nPittsburgh, the city he served for 15 years, the city he loved his \nwhole life. I joined his family, his friends, and many others at his \nfuneral service, paying our last respects to a man taken from us far \ntoo soon.\n  Robert E. O'Connor, Jr., survived by his wife, Judy, and three \nchildren, will be sorely missed. May God bless the entire O'Connor \nfamily during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONSTITUTION WEEK\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nFort Miro Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in \nMonroe, LA. Beginning September 17 and ending September 23, this great \norganization will observe its annual Constitution Week. Today, I'd like \nto spend a few moments highlighting the importance of their efforts.\n  The Daughters of the American Revolution petitioned Congress in 1955 \nto set aside a week to celebrate the Constitution. Thanks to their \npetition, Congress through a joint resolution on August 2, 1956, \nrequested that the president declare September 17 to 23 as Constitution \nWeek.\n  This week sets out to emphasize citizens' responsibilities for \nprotecting and defending the Constitution, inform people that the \nConstitution is the basis for America's great heritage, and encourage \nthe study of the historical events surrounding its framing in September \n1787.\n  This year on September 17 at 3:00 pm, this long-time chapter of the \nDaughters of the American Revolution will participate in ``Bells Across \nAmerica'' to commemorate the signing of the Constitution and to \nrecognize all citizens of the United States of America.\n  I applaud the Daughters of the American Revolution for their \ncontinued dedication to celebrating the importance of the Constitution \nthrough education and activism. Moreover, I commend the Fort Miro \nChapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Monroe, LA, for \ndoing this fine work on behalf of the State of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9107-6", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9107-S9108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 3534.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Terrorists to \n     Justice Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than 10 years, the al Qaeda terrorist \n     organization has waged an unlawful war of violence and terror \n     against the United States and its allies. Al Qaeda was \n     involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York \n     City in 1993, the bombing of the United States Embassies in \n     Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole \n     in Yemen in 2000. On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda launched \n     the most deadly foreign attack on United States soil in \n     history. Nineteen al Qaeda operatives hijacked four \n     commercial aircraft and piloted them into the World Trade \n     Center Towers in New York City and the headquarters of the \n     United States Department of Defense at the Pentagon, and \n     downed United Airlines Flight 93. The attack destroyed the \n     Towers, severely damaged the Pentagon, and resulted in the \n     deaths of approximately 3,000 innocent people.\n       (2) Following the attacks on the United States on September \n     11th, Congress recognized the existing hostilities with al \n     Qaeda and affiliated terrorist organizations and, by the \n     Authorization for the Use of Military Force Joint Resolution \n     (Public Law 107-40), recognized that ``the President has \n     authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and \n     prevent acts of international terrorism against the United \n     States'' and authorized the President ``to use all necessary \n     and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \n     or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001 . . . in order to prevent any future acts of \n     international terrorism against the United States by such \n     nations, organizations or persons.''\n       (3) The President's authority to convene military \n     commissions arises from the Constitution's vesting in the \n     President of the executive power and the power of Commander \n     in Chief of the Armed Forces. As the Supreme Court of the \n     United States recognized in Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U.S. 341, \n     346-48 (1952), ``[s]ince our nation's earliest days, such \n     commissions have been constitutionally recognized agencies \n     for meeting many urgent governmental responsibilities related \n     to war. . . . They have taken many forms and borne many \n     names. Neither their procedure nor their jurisdiction has \n     been prescribed by statute. It has been adapted in each \n     instance to the need that called it forth.''\n       (4) In exercising the authority vested in the President by \n     the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, and \n     in accordance with the law of war, the President has detained \n     enemy combatants in the course of this armed conflict and \n     issued the Military Order of November 13, 2001, to govern \n     the ``Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-\n     Citizens in the War Against Terrorism.'' This Order \n     authorized the Secretary of Defense to establish military \n     commissions to try individuals subject to the Order for \n     any offenses triable by military commission that such \n     individuals are alleged to have committed.\n       (5) The Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S. Ct. \n     2749 (2006), held that the military commissions established \n     by the Department of Defense under the President's Military \n     Order of November 13, 2001, were not consistent with certain \n     aspects of United States domestic law. The Congress may by \n     law, and does by enactment of this statute, eliminate any \n     deficiency of statutory authority to facilitate bringing \n     terrorists with whom the United States is engaged in armed \n     conflict to justice for violations of the law of war and \n     other offenses triable by military commissions. The \n     prosecution of such individuals by military commissions \n     established and conducted consistent with this Act fully \n     complies with the Constitution, the laws of the United \n     States, treaties to which the United States is a party, and \n     the law of war.\n       (6) The use of military commissions is particularly \n     important in this context because other alternatives, such as \n     the use of courts-martial, generally are impracticable. The \n     terrorists with whom the United States is engaged in armed \n     conflict have demonstrated a commitment to the destruction of \n     the United States and its people, to the violation of the law \n     of war, and to the abuse of American legal processes. In a \n     time of ongoing armed conflict, it generally is neither \n     practicable nor appropriate for combatants like al Qaeda \n     terrorists to be tried before tribunals that include all of \n     the procedures associated with courts-martial.\n       (7) Many procedures for courts-martial would not be \n     practicable in trying the unlawful enemy combatants for whom \n     this Act provides for trial by military commission. For \n     instance, court martial proceedings would in certain \n     circumstances--\n       (A) compel the Government to share classified information \n     with the accused, even though members of al Qaeda cannot be \n     trusted with our Nation's secrets and it would not be \n     consistent with the national security of the United States to \n     provide them with access to classified information;\n       (B) exclude the use of hearsay evidence even though such \n     evidence often will be the best and most reliable evidence \n     that the accused has committed a war crime. For example, many \n     witnesses in military commission trials are likely to be \n     foreign nationals who are not amenable to process or may be \n     precluded for national security reasons from entering the \n     United States or Guantanamo Bay to testify. Other witnesses \n     may be unavailable because of military necessity, \n     incarceration, injury, or death. In short, applying the \n     hearsay rules from the Manual for Courts-Martial or from the \n     Federal Rules of Evidence would make it virtually impossible \n     to bring terrorists to justice for their violations of the \n     law of war;\n       (C) specify speedy trials and technical rules for sworn and \n     authenticated statements when, due to the exigencies of \n     wartime, the United States cannot safely require members of \n     the armed forces to gather evidence on the battlefield, \n     including civilian eyewitness testimony, as though they \n     were police officers. Nor can the United States divert \n     members from the front lines and their duty stations to \n     attend military commission proceedings. Therefore, strict \n     compliance with such rules for evidence gathered on the \n     battlefield would be impracticable, given the preeminent \n     focus on military operations and the chaotic nature of \n     combat.\n       (8) The exclusive judicial review for which this Act, and \n     the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, provides is without \n     precedent in the history of armed conflicts involving the \n     United States, exceeds the scope of judicial review \n     historically provided for by military commissions, and is \n     channeled in a manner appropriately tailored to--\n       (A) the circumstances of the conflicts between the United \n     States and international terrorist organizations; and\n       (B) the need to ensure fair treatment of those detained as \n     enemy combatants, to minimize the diversion of members of the \n     armed forces from other wartime duties, and to protect the \n     national security of the United States.\n       (9) In early 2002, as memorialized in a memorandum dated \n     February 7, 2002, the President determined that common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions did not apply\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\n     with respect to the United States conflict with al Qaeda \n     because al Qaeda was not a party to those treaties and the \n     conflict with al Qaeda was an armed conflict of an \n     international character. That was the interpretation of the \n     United States prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan \n     on June 29, 2006. Hamdan's statement to the contrary makes it \n     appropriate to clarify the standards imposed by common \n     Article 3. This Act makes clear that the prohibitions against \n     cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment found in the Detainee \n     Treatment Act of 2005 fully satisfy the obligations of the \n     United States with respect to the standards for detention and \n     treatment established by section 1 of common Article 3, \n     except for those obligations arising under paragraphs (b) and \n     (d). In addition, the Act makes clear that the Geneva \n     Conventions are not a source of judicially enforceable \n     individual rights, thereby reaffirming that enforcement of \n     the obligations imposed by the Conventions is a matter \n     between the nations that are parties to them.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Although \n     military commissions traditionally have been constituted by \n     order of the President, the decision of the Supreme Court in \n     Hamdan v. Rumsfeld makes it both necessary and appropriate to \n     codify procedures for military commissions as set forth \n     herein.\n       ``(b) Rule of Construction.--The procedures for military \n     commissions set forth in this chapter are modeled after the \n     procedures established for courts-martial in the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice. However, it would be neither desirable \n     nor practicable to try unlawful enemy combatants by court-\n     martial procedures. The trial of such persons by military \n     commission presents new challenges that require that \n     interpretations of this Act not be unduly influenced by the \n     rules and procedures developed for courts-martial. Therefore, \n     no construction or application of chapter 47 of this title \n     shall be binding in the construction or application of this \n     chapter.\n       ``(c) Alien unlawful enemy combatants may be tried for \n     violations of the law of war and other offenses triable by \n     military commissions committed against the United States or \n     its co-belligerents before, on, or after September 11, 2001.\n       ``(d) A military commission established under this chapter \n     is a regularly constituted court, affording all the necessary \n     `judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by \n     civilized peoples' for purposes of common Article 3 of the \n     Geneva Conventions.\n\n     ``Sec. 948c.

Lawful enemy combatants who violate the law of \n     war are subject to chapter 47 of Title 10, United States \n     Code.

This bill is a product of revisions suggested by the\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\nJump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy and the American \nSavings and Education Council, as well as consultation with other \ncommunity groups such as the National Association of Securities Dealers \nand National Council on Economic Education.\n  As noted in the bill's findings, high levels of personal debt and \nbankruptcy filings combined with a negative personal savings rate in \n2005 have put more and more individuals on the edge of financial \ninsolvency. Individuals who are already living with less-than-ideal \nfinancial circumstances--such as most Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, TANF, recipients and others who are not financially self-\nsufficient and live outside the financial mainstream--apply to \npredatory lenders for short-term loans with comparatively high interest \nrates or fees, or are able to save little or nothing for emergencies or \nfuture events. A lack of basic consumer finance education, including \nlack of familiarity with how a checking or savings account works, has \nbeen cited as a major reason millions of Americans do not set up \nmainstream accounts and, thus, put themselves into greater financial \nperil.\n  Economic and financial education can help individuals and families \nmeet short-term obligations and maximize their well-being in the long-\nterm, particularly in populations traditionally underserved by \nmainstream financial systems. Such education can provide access to the \ntools needed to create household budgets, initiate savings plans, and \nbuild assets, as well as keep vulnerable individuals from unknowingly \nentering or being forced into financially devastating credit \narrangements. Core goals of economic and financial literacy activities \ncomplement TANF's aims to reduce welfare dependency, helping people \nachieve self-sufficiency.\n  For families transitioning from welfare into work, challenges \ncontinue to abound, including obtaining child care and transportation. \nAnother challenge that is often overlooked, however, is the difficulty \nof transitioning from a benefits- to a wage-based income. Financial and \neconomic literacy programs that educate families through this \ntransition about taxes and tax benefits that they may be eligible for, \nsuch as the Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, \ncan help to ensure that they have access to these important work \nbenefits.\n  The bill we are introducing today would tackle this problem for a \ntargeted group of Americans by making economic and financial education \nan allowable use of federal TANF funds and a qualified work activity \nunder the law. The bill would also require States, through \ncollaborations with local banks, community-based organizations, \nbusiness entities, and members of the Federal Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission, to promote financial education in their state \nTANF plans. States must ensure that such activities are accessible to \nthe target population by way of appropriately-geared curriculum, \nprovide relevant and practical information to participants, include a \ndirect delivery component, and, to the extent practicable, work with an \nasset building program conducted in that state. This bill aims to make \na big difference for one of our country's most vulnerable populations \nand provide them access to tools that can allow them to stand on their \nown feet, for themselves and their families.\n  I thank my cosponsors for joining me in introducing this bill, and I \nurge other colleagues to support this meaningful legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TANF Economic and Financial \n     Education Promotion Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Most recipients of assistance under the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program established \n     under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and individuals moving toward self-\n     sufficiency operate outside the financial mainstream, paying \n     high costs to handle their finances and saving little for \n     emergencies or the future.\n       (2) Personal debt levels and bankruptcy filing rates are \n     high and savings rates are at their lowest levels in 70 \n     years. In 2005, the savings rate was negative. The inability \n     of many households to budget, save, and invest prevents them \n     from laying the foundation for a secure financial future.\n       (3) Financial planning can help families meet near-term \n     obligations and maximize their longer-term well being, \n     especially valuable for populations that have traditionally \n     been underserved by our financial system.\n       (4) Economic and financial education can give individuals \n     the necessary financial tools to create household budgets, \n     initiate savings plans, and acquire assets.\n       (5) Economic and financial education can prevent vulnerable \n     customers from becoming entangled in financially devastating \n     credit arrangements.\n       (6) Economic and financial education that addresses abusive \n     lending practices targeted at specific neighborhoods or \n     vulnerable segments of the population can prevent \n     unaffordable payments, equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n       (7) Economic and financial education speaks to the broader \n     purpose of the TANF Program to equip individuals with the \n     tools to succeed and support themselves and their families in \n     self-sufficiency.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To promote economic and financial literacy among \n     individuals receiving assistance under Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families programs funded under part A of title IV \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) by \n     permitting States to include economic and financial literacy \n     education that is provided directly to individuals as a work \n     activity under such programs.\n       (2) To provide individuals receiving assistance under \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs funded under \n     part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 \n     et seq.) with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively \n     address personal financial matters and to make financial \n     choices that will lead such individuals toward becoming \n     financially self-sufficient.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend part A of title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to improve supplemental educational \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss a topic that \nwill always have incredible meaning to American families: educating our \nchildren. We all want what is best for our children, and we all want to \nmake sure that we provide them with the tools that they need to succeed \nin tomorrow's workforce.\n  While there are many different components to our education system \nhere in America, today I want to concentrate on a particular point of \nconcern, an area where, with some improvement, can be a key tool \nensuring that our children are meeting their educational goals.\n  Today, along with Senator John Cornyn of Texas, I rise to introduce \nthe Raising Achievement through Improving Supplemental Education Act of \n2006--or the RAISE Act for short.\n  The RAISE Act seeks to improve the Supplemental Educational Services, \nSES, program and clears the way for this program to become well-known, \nwidely available, and easily accessible to eligible students.\n  It seeks to broaden eligibility requirements and prioritization of \nthe program, and to target all low-performing students regardless of \nincome status.\n  Let me take a step back and talk about the Supplemental Education \nService program, or SES program, for those who might not be familiar \nwith it.\n  SES was implemented as part of No Child Left Behind and designed to \nbe an innovative tool to help meet the academic needs of low-income \nstudents attending continuously failing schools.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act requires school districts to utilize 20 \npercent of their Federal funds for after-school tutoring programs at \nconsistently failing schools.\n  Under this program, low-income parents can choose free private \ntutoring from the provider of their choice. School districts then use \ntheir 20 percent allocation to pay the providers for their tutoring \nservices. Any part of these funds that are not used for tutoring can be \ntransferred into other district programs.\n  By providing direct tutoring after school, the SES program can help \nstudents who are behind catch up with their peers. This in turn also \nimproves the overall school performance.\n  While the intent of the SES program has been pure, there have been \nnumerous shortfalls nationwide--these shortfalls have much to do with a \nlack of implementation which the RAISE Act would seek to correct.\n  For example, in the 2003-2004 school year, only 17 percent of the \neligible 1.4 million students participated in SES programs. That means \nthat hundreds of thousands of children are not being provided with \ntutoring help where funding has already been set aside for that \npurpose.\n  Some parents reported that they did not sign up because they lacked \nthe transportation to get their students to the providers, the \nproviders were not tutoring on-site at the schools. Also, there were \nsome conflicts with other, better established after-school programs.\n  States have reported that many school districts with low turnout have \nfailed to communicate with parents or implement the program in a way \nthat ensures its success. The reports further indicate that some of the \ndistricts have openly undermined the program in letters to parents.\n  In my own State of Florida for instance, one county sent a letter \nhome to parents this past April about the SES services that would be \nprovided for the current school year that sent quite a mixed signal.\n  The letter stated that although parents might be able to secure SES \nprogram assistance for their children, the district believed that the \nfunds could be better spent elsewhere and went as far to, quote \nunquote, ``strongly urge parents'' not to utilize their SES and school \nchoice options under No Child Left Behind.\n  So, what we are seeing is that with all the good intentions behind \nthe SES program, we are having some problems with implementation.\n  In Florida, we have already implemented SES improvements. As a \nresult, Florida will see a higher SES program success rate, stronger \nguidelines, and better State oversight.\n  Many of the provisions of the RAISE Act are modeled after the \nsuccesses already occurring in my home State.\n  In our school districts where SES programs are thriving, good \ncommunication with both parents and providers has been emphasized, as \nwell as access to on-site tutoring at school facilities.\n  One prominent Florida-based example is the SES program in Marion \nCounty, located in central Florida. Schools there have utilized all \ntheir funds to maximize student enrollment, which also increases the \nprogram's chances of greater overall success.\n  Other good examples of SES program progress include Escambia County, \nFlorida, where the city of Pensacola is located--to best utilize their \nSES dollars, they hosted a successful summer tutoring program.\n  School Districts in the Palm Beach and Miami-Dade areas have SES \nprograms that bode well on a national level for the strong parental \noutreach efforts they have instituted, which enable all eligible \nstudents the ability to enroll in SES.\n  In Hillsborough County, FL--where Tampa is located--their success \nwith SES enrollment brought the U.S. Department of Education to grant \nthe district a special provision, whereby they can provide SES tutoring \nin addition to the private providers that most of the money is \nallocated for.\n  This will allow Hillsborough County to make SES available to more \nstudents, and I look forward to seeing what their efforts bring.\n  The RAISE Act will help make possible nationwide the kind of SES \nprogram success we have experienced in Florida. This success will come \nabout because of stricter implementation standards and program \noverview.\n  Another important component of the RAISE Act is eligibility for SES. \nCurrently, SES targets low-income, low-performing students.\n  I think we should be targeting all low-performing students, \nregardless of income status.\n  By overlooking many middle-class families who do not have the money \nto put their children into private tutoring or after-school programs, \nmany of those children are falling through the cracks.\n  This bill is meant to ensure that all of our low-performing students \nhave an opportunity to succeed academically.\n  We are going to help out those in need such as Ms. Carla Garcia of \nGibsonton, FL--a part of Hillsborough County. She is a single mother \nstruggling to provide her family with the basics.\n  She does not qualify for the low-income programs at her school, so \nher\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\nson is not currently eligible for SES services even though he is \nfalling behind academically.\n  Ms. Garcia strongly believes that if her son was able to receive \ntutoring under SES, he would be better able to excel and perform at \ngrade level.\n  Under the RAISE Act, Ms. Garcia would be able to receive SES services \nfor her son--as would many other parents for their children--because my \nbill would make SES tutoring available to all students who are \nstruggling to meet grade level proficiency.\n  The RAISE Act aims to make sure that every child in the school yard \nhas an equal opportunity at scholastic growth and advancement.\n  So, to summarize: The RAISE Act will require better parental \nnotification of eligibility and program availability; we streamline the \napplication and registration process; and we level the playing field--\nmaking school facilities as available for tutoring as they are for \nother after-school activities.\n  The RAISE Act will broaden eligibility requirements and \nprioritization. Right now SES targets low-income, low-performing \nstudents; I think we ought to target all low-performing students, \nregardless of income status.\n  In Florida, we have already implemented SES improvements. As a \nresult, Florida's SES program has stronger guidelines and better State \noversight. Many of the provisions of the RAISE Act are modeled after \nthe successes already occurring in the state of Florida.\n  The RAISE Act will provide the guidance and tools states and school \ndistricts need to increase participation and produce results. Stronger \ncoordination, communication, and guidance will make SES programs more \neffective.\n  The RAISE Act will help raise the success of all students, in turn \nraising the academic achievement of our schools. The Act was developed \nin consultation with school administrators, state education officials, \nand non-profit and research groups. This is a nationwide imperative and \nI urge my colleagues to support this innovative set of reforms.\n  Let us continue to make improvements to the success that is No Child \nLeft Behind, by providing the necessary funding, regulation, and \nimplementation of Supplemental Educational Services across this great \nland.\n  Together, we can make the RAISE Act a reality and improve the \nacademic lives of countless American schoolchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3864\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentive for employers to hire service-\nconnected disabled veterans and to improve adjustment assistance and \njob-training transition for injured and disabled veterans, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about one tribute we can \nmake to the brave men and women who have put their lives on the line \nand returned home wounded. We need to ensure that those who have \nsacrificed for our country receive their due benefits. We need to see \nthat they are taken care of when they return home.\n  As of July 2006, nearly 20,000 members of our Armed Forces have been \nwounded in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Many of these soldiers are now permanently disabled. Of these \nbrave soldiers who have been wounded, nearly 5,000 are members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Our National Guard and Reserves are \ncarrying a huge burden in our current conflicts abroad.\n  Ninety-five percent of America's National Guard combat battalions and \nspecial operations have been mobilized since September 11, 2001.\n  Many of these wounded soldiers come from rural States such as my home \nState of Montana. In Montana, we have the highest proportion of \nveterans per capita of any State. According to the most recent census, \nveterans account for nearly one out of every six people in Montana. And \nveterans and families of veterans constitute a significant portion of \nthe population in rural States throughout the country.\n  When not deployed, many National Guardsmen and reservists in my home \nState support their families with second and even third jobs. At any \ntime, they can be deployed overseas, to our borders, or even to aid \nwith national disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires. If they are \ninjured or disabled, however, many become unable to perform the jobs \nthey did before deployment. They will need to transition into\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\na new job or career. It is our duty to provide the proper means for \nsoldiers to make that transition. It is our duty to help them to live \nas independent citizens. It seems that the opposite is true.\n  Since August 2002, the share of veterans collecting unemployment \ninsurance has nearly doubled. During any given year, half a million \nveterans across the Nation experience homelessness. We are not \nproviding enough resources for veterans looking for work. We are too \noften failing our injured and our disabled veterans.\n  Many seriously injured and disabled veterans simply do not know what \nthey are going to do once they return home. We need to help these young \nmen and women. That is why today I offer a special tribute.\n  Today I am introducing the Help Our Patriots Employment Act of 2006, \nand I call it the HOPE Act. The HOPE Act would provide a tax incentive \nto employers to hire service-connected disabled veterans, and the HOPE \nAct would increase funding for job training transition services for \ninjured and disabled veterans.\n  The work opportunity and the welfare-to-work tax credits expired at \nthe end of 2005. We all hope these credits can be extended soon. They \nhave gone without extension for too long now. In addition, I introduced \nlegislation that would permanently extend and improve upon the work \nopportunity and welfare-to-work tax credits.\n  My HOPE Act provides employers with a graduated tax credit equal to \n25 percent of wages for disabled veterans working between 120 hours and \n399 hours, and a 40-percent tax credit on wages for disabled veterans \nworking more than 400 hours, on up to $12,000 in wages per employee. In \naddition to this tax credit for businesses, my bill would increase \nfunding for the Veterans' Employment and Training Service Program, the \nVETS Program, under the Department of Labor.\n  In my home State of Montana, the VETS Program has two staff members \nto cover the entire State. Montana covers more than 145,000 square \nmiles. It is simply not possible for this essential program to reach \nevery veteran who needs career help--not with two people.\n  For many injured veterans, it will be a long journey simply to get \nback on their feet. My legislation will not address all their needs, \nbut it will help. One thing is clear: This problem is not going away. \nIt is getting worse. That is why we need to make sure we are doing \neverything we can to help injured and disabled veterans.\n  These heroes have given so much for our country--so much. They have \nsacrificed so much on the battlefield. They return to a life much \ndifferent from the one they left. We need to ensure they are given the \nresources to transition and succeed in life when they return home.\n  Mr. President, let me close where I began. Let me honor those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I close by reading \nthe names of those from Montana who have died fighting for our country \nsince September 11:\n  PVT Krostofor Stonesifer, SGT Michael Bews, LT Edward Saltz, PVT Owen \nWitt, LTC Benjamin Watson, CPL Dean Pratt, CPL Kane Funke, SGT Aaron \nHolleyman, CPL Nathan Wood, SGT Robbie McNary, CPL Bill Ellingham, CPL \nJosh Timmerman, SGT Jack Tankersly, CPL Steve Slavik, CPL Nicholas \nBloem, LT Josh Hyland, SGT Travis Arndt, PVT Andrew Bedard, CPT Michael \nMacKinnon, CPL Raleigh Smith, and CPL Phillip Baucus.\n  May their memory be a blessing in the lives of all of our families. \nMay our Nation never forget their sacrifice. And may we always honor \nthose who have fought to defend our freedom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 3866. A bill to establish a grant program to enhance the economic \nand financial literacy of midlife and older Americans so as to enhance \ntheir retirement security and to reduce financial abuse and fraud among \nsuch Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Education for \nRetirement Security Act of 2006, with my colleagues Senators \nLautenberg, Stabenow, Sarbanes and Baucus. I thank our former \ncolleague, Senator Corzine, for initiating this important financial and \neconomic literacy bill, of which I had been an original cosponsor. This \nbill is a product of revisions suggested by the Jump$tart Coalition for \nPersonal Financial Literacy and the American Savings and Education \nCouncil, as well as consultation with other community groups such as \nthe National Association of Securities Dealers and National Council on \nEconomic Education.\n  Americans are not saving enough for retirement. Longer life spans, \ncombined with low savings and high consumer debt, are putting many mid-\nlife and older Americans on the path to entering retirement years with \na lower quality of life, delaying their retirement to catch up with \ninadequate savings, or becoming a significant financial burden on their \nloved ones. In 2005, only 42 percent of workers or their spouses \ncalculated the amount they needed to save for retirement a major \ndecrease from 53 percent in 2000. Only about half of working Americans \nare covered by a pension plan.\n  Inadequacy of retirement nest eggs and other preparation for \nretirement will certainly impact the U.S. economy and government \nservices, as we know that the number of older individuals in the U.S. \nis projected to more than double over the next 30 years, from 35 \nmillion to 75 million people. We will inevitably see serious increases \nin long-term care and other health costs.\n  Furthermore, individuals of questionable moral character are \ndetermined to erode older Americans' lifetime savings through fraud or \naggressive marketing tactics selling unnecessary products or those with \nexorbitant and hidden fees. The Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft \nData Clearinghouse reported that incidents of identity theft targeting \nindividuals age 60 and older increase from 1,821 victims in 2000 to a \nstartling 21,084 victims in 2004. More people in the U.S. should have \nbasic competency in money management to avoid becoming victims of \nfinancial fraud and abuse.\n  The Education for Retirement Security Act is intended to address both \nthe lagging savings rate and increases in fraud and abuse by \nestablishing a grant program to arm midlife and older individuals with \ncritical information and knowledge. It would do this by authorizing a \ngrant program similar in structure to one which has proven successful \nin the Excellence in Economic Education Act, which awards a grant to a \nnational entity that provides subgrants to community organizations to \ncarry out programs that enhance economic, financial, and retirement \nliteracy, and reduce financial abuse and fraud among the target \npopulation. The national entity would evaluate subgrantees on the \nperformance and effectiveness of their programs, identify best \npractices and programs for replication, and assess any behavioral \nchange, including asset accumulation, made by program participants. The \nbill would also create a national training and technical assistance \ngrant program toward creating and making available instructional \nmaterials and information promoting economic and financial education, \nand providing training and other related assistance to subgrantees.\n  Economic and financial education can lead individuals to avoid scams \nand bad decisions about investments, mortgages, and pension plans, and \nensure that they have access to tools they need to make sound financial \ndecisions and prepare adequately for retirement. The limited timeframe \nthat midlife and older Americans have in which to assess the realities \nof their individual circumstances, recover from bad economic choices, \nand benefit from more informed financial practices, makes critical the \ntype of education that this bill would support.\n  I thank my cosponsors for joining me in introducing this bill, and I \nurge other colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9128]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement \n     Security Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Improving economic and financial literacy is a critical \n     and complex task for Americans of all ages.\n       (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n     real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n     nearing retirement.\n       (3) Historically, Americans are living longer than ever \n     before. However, most Americans are retiring before the age \n     of 65.\n       (4) Research suggests that many Americans are not prepared \n     to plan for their retirement and may have to work far longer \n     than they expect in order to be financially secure in \n     retirement.\n       (5) In 2005, only 42 percent of workers or their spouses \n     calculated the amount they needed to save for retirement, \n     down from 53 percent in 2000.\n       (6) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n     pension coverage. Three out of 4 women aged 65 or older \n     receive no income from employer-provided pensions.\n       (7) The limited timeframe that midlife and older \n     individuals and families have to assess the realities of \n     their individual circumstances, to recover from \n     counterproductive choices and decisionmaking processes, and \n     to benefit from more informed financial practices, has \n     immediate impact and near-term consequences for Americans \n     nearing or of retirement age.\n       (8) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n     of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n     security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n     coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n     necessary earnings from working during one's retirement \n     years.\n       (9) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n     in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 \n     to nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected \n     to skyrocket.\n       (10) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n     of abuse against older individuals and this population \n     comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n     United States.\n       (11) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n     Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n     targeting individuals older than the age of 60 increased from \n     1,821 victims in 2000 to 21,084 victims in 2004, an increase \n     of more than 11 times in number.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the Federal courthouse located at 555 \nIndependence Street, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, as the ``Rush H. \nLimbaugh, Sr., Federal Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesignating the new Federal Courthouse in Cape Girardeau, MO, as the \nRush H. Limbaugh, Sr., Federal Courthouse.\n  When people talk about the American Dream, the ``Spirit of America'' \nand the people who helped make this country great, all one really has \nto do is mention the name of the late Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr.\n  Mr. Limbaugh led an extraordinary life in which he practiced law for \nalmost 80 years until his death at age 104 in 1996. At the time of his \ndeath, Mr. Limbaugh was the Nation's oldest practicing lawyer and still \ncame into work about twice a week at the law firm he founded over 50 \nyears before in Cape Girardeau, MO.\n  Known by his peers as a superb trial lawyer with impeccable character \nand integrity, he was a beloved icon of the Missouri legal community, \nespecially in southeast Missouri where he lived all his life.\n  Born in 1891, on a small farm in rural Bollinger County, he was the \nyoungest of eight children and attended school in a one room primary \nschool house. It is said that a passion for the law first developed in \nRush as a 10-year-old boy when a Daniel Webster oration that he \nmemorized inspired him to become a lawyer. Fourteen years later, he \nbegan a legal career that lasted eight decades. Throughout those 80 \nyears, his interest in the law and his dedication to his clients never \nwavered.\n  Rush paid his way through college at the University of Missouri at \nColumbia by working on the university farm and doing odd jobs such as \ncarpentry, firing up furnaces, caring for animals and waiting tables. \nWhile in college, his oratory skills won him awards which he later \nutilized with great success in the courtroom.\n  In 1914, he entered law school, and after two years, he skipped the \nthird year and passed the Missouri Bar examination. In 1916, he was \nadmitted into the Missouri Bar and his long distinguished legal career \nbegan in Cape Girardeau.\n  Over his career, Rush argued more than 60 cases in front of the \nMissouri Supreme Court along with many prominent civil cases. He was a \nspecialist in probate law and helped draft the 1955 Probate Code of \nMissouri. He also tried cases before the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, the U.S. Labor Board and the Internal Revenue Appellate \nDivision.\n  From 1955 through 1956, he was president of the Missouri Bar and \nlater served as president of the State Historical Society of Missouri. \nIn addition to this, Mr. Limbaugh was a leading member of numerous \nlegal and civic organizations including the American Bar Association, \nthe Missouri Bar Foundation, the Missouri Human Rights Commission, the \nCape Girardeau Board of Education and the Salvation Army Advisory Board\n  However, Rush's contributions were not just limited to Missouri. In \nthe late 1950s, Rush served as a U.S. State Department special envoy to \nIndia where he promoted American jurisprudence and constitutional \ngovernment among lawyers, judges and university students in that newly \nformed country. And in the 1960s, he served as chairman of the American \nBar Association's special committee on the Bill of Rights.\n  Rush was truly an inspiration and mentor to many aspiring lawyers, \nespecially the ones in his own family. His two sons, Rush, Jr., and \nSteven, both practiced law with him for many years. His son, Steven N. \nLimbaugh, currently serves as a Senior Federal Judge in St. Louis. Four \nof his grandsons followed in his footsteps and pursued legal careers \nincluding his grandson Steven, Jr., who is now a Missouri Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Perhaps the best measure of Rush Hudson Limbaugh's legacy as a lawyer \nand as a human being comes from the praise and admiration of his peers \nin the legal community. ``A top notch allaround lawyer; the epitome of \nwhat a lawyer ought to be,'' said one colleague. ``A legend in his \ntime,'' said another.\n  However, his grandson Steven may have offered the best possible \ndescription of this great citizen: ``He was an extraordinary man, \nexemplary in every way, yet very humble. He was a lawyer's lawyer, a \ncommunity servant and a gentle and kind man whose family was the very \ncenter of his life.''\n  It is only fitting that the new Federal courthouse in Cape Girardeau, \nMO, be named after this great hero of American Jurisprudence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RUSH H. LIMBAUGH, SR., FEDERAL COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Federal courthouse located at 555 \n     Independence Street, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Rush H. Limbaugh, Sr., Federal \n     Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     Federal courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     deemed to be a reference to the Rush H. Limbaugh, Sr., \n     Federal Courthouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3868. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to encourage the most \npolluted areas in the United States to attain clean air standards; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

A bill to improve the quality of, and access to, \nsupplemental educational services in effort to increase student \nachievement; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp ensure students attending low-performing schools have access to \nhigh quality tutoring programs. If enacted, The Improving Quality of \nand Access to Supplemental Educational Services, the IQ Act, would \nensure that supplemental educational services, free tutoring offered \nthrough the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, are effective in and \naccountable for increasing student academic achievement.\n  One of the many ways that NCLB aims to close the achievement gap is \nthrough the provision that allows low-income children attending poorly \nperforming school to enroll in supplemental educational services, SES. \nThese programs hold the promise of helping schools to increase student \nachievement by offering additional academic support for students in \nunderperforming schools. Unfortunately, the scope of the impact of SES \nremains to be seen due to low student participation rates and lack of \nevaluation of supplemental educational services.\n  Improving the quality of and access to these programs should be a \nshared responsibility between the Department of Education, State and \nlocal educational agencies, as well as the SES providers themselves. By \nworking together we can create tutoring programs that truly supplement \nthe instruction that students receive during regular school hours and \nallow for more time to master the educational standards set by the \nstate.\n  Unfortunately, few States have assessed SES providers on the basis of \nimproving student achievement. A recent study by the GAO found that not \na single State has produced a report that provides a conclusive \nassessment of providers' effect on student achievement. Without these \nState evaluations, students, parents and policymakers are blind as to \nwhich programs are effective in raising academic achievement and are \ntherefore unable to replicate their success.\n  I strongly believe that if NCLB holds our teachers and schools \naccountable for increasing student achievement, then we must also hold \nSES providers to similar accountability standards. That is why The IQ \nAct requires States to use their current standardized test to evaluate \nprovider performance. This legislation also provides States with \nadditional funding to improve their data systems to manage these \nevaluations with no additional cost to the taxpayer.\n  Maximizing the full potential of SES will not only require consistent \nevaluation of provider performance to ensure quality, but also \nincreasing the number of students participating in these services. \nUnfortunately, only 19 percent of eligible students participated in SES \nin the 2004-2005, an abysmally low turnout for programs that offer free \nafter school tutoring. Many districts find challenges in providing \nservices for students in rural schools and students with limited \nEnglish proficiency or disabilities.\n  Although there are many other factors that determine why parents and \nstudents are not participating in these services, The IQ Act will \nprovide additional opportunities for more students to participate in \nthese tutoring programs that fit the needs of all children. This \nlegislation requires districts to supply a choice of providers for \nstudents with limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, \nand students in rural districts. If enacted, this bill would help \nStates and school districts build capacity to effectively implement \nsupplemental educational services.\n  The Improving the Quality of and Access to Supplemental Educational \nServices Act is a positive step forward in providing more opportunities \nfor students to participate in quality after school tutoring programs. \nI am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nwill join me today to move this legislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3872. A bill to prohibit cigarette manufacturers from making \nclaims regarding tar or nicotine yield levels of cigarettes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce and discuss my \nbill, the ``Truth in Cigarette Labeling Act.'' I wish to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Clinton, Harkin, Menendez, Reed, Durbin, Kennedy \nand Leahy for co-sponsoring this important legislation.\n  My bill bans the tobacco industry from using deceptive cigarette \nmarketing terms such as ``light'' and ``low tar'' to imply health \nbenefits and it prohibits cigarette manufacturers from making any \nclaims based on the cigarette testing method established by the Federal \nTrade Commission called the ``FTC Method,'' which measures tar and \nnicotine yields.\n  My legislation is consistent with the recent court ruling issued by \nU.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler. Kessler's ruling says cigarette \nmanufacturers must stop labeling cigarettes as `'low tar'' or `'light'' \nor `'natural'' or with other `'deceptive brand descriptors which \nimplicitly or explicitly convey to the smoker and potential smoker that \nthey are less hazardous to health than full-flavor cigarettes.''\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\n  The tobacco companies are appealing that ruling, which will likely \ntie it up in the courts for a while. This makes it necessary for \nCongress to act now and pass my bill.\n  Many smokers switch to cigarette brands advertised as ``low tar'' or \n``light'' out of concern for their health, believing that such \ncigarettes are less risky or a step toward quitting. These claims are \nbased on the FTC tar ratings, which are now known to be inaccurate in \nassessing the behavior of actual smokers. Some 85 percent of all \nsmokers today smoke these so-called safer cigarettes.\n  FTC officials admit the agency's test is flawed. Former FTC \nCommissioner Timothy Muris testified at a Senate Commerce Committee \nhearing on June 11, 2003, that the tar rating system is ``broken.'' The \nFTC has also published a warning to consumers called ``Up In Smoke: The \nTruth About Tar and Nicotine Ratings.'' This alert concludes that \n``cigarette tar and nicotine ratings can't predict the amount of tar \nand nicotine you get from any particular cigarette.'' It is absurd that \nthe FTC permits a testing method that FTC officials admit is flawed.\n  According to the National Cancer Institute, cigarette tar and \nnicotine yields as measured by the FTC Method don't give smokers a \nmeaningful measure with regard to how much tar and nicotine they are \nlikely to inhale from smoking a cigarette, and that marketing \ncigarettes as delivering lower amounts of tar using the FTC Method is \ndeceptive to consumers.\n  Not surprisingly, the tobacco companies have known since 1975 that \nthis test doesn't work. The tobacco companies' internal documents show \nthat people actually get more tar and the same amount of nicotine when \nthey smoke light cigarettes than from smoking regular cigarettes. \nThat's because smokers will inhale more deeply and/or frequently to \ndraw out the nicotine they're addicted to.\n  So, the FTC, the National Cancer Institute and the tobacco companies \nall agree that the FTC testing method doesn't work.\n  And all the while, the tobacco companies have been taking advantage \nof this fact and using it to spike the nicotine yield in cigarettes and \nmake them more addictive.\n  A recently released report by the Massachusetts Department of Public \nHealth shows that from 1998 through 2004 cigarette manufacturers \nincreased the amount of addictive nicotine delivered to the average \nsmoker by 10 percent. Of 179 cigarette brands tested in 2004, an \nastonishing 166 brands fell into the State's highest nicotine yield \nrange, including 59 brands that the manufacturers had labeled ``light'' \nand 14 described as ``ultra-light.''\n  The increase in nicotine levels went unnoticed because the standard \ngovernment test--the flawed FTC Method--uses a smoking machine that \nfails to mimic real-life smoking behavior. A manufacturer, for example, \ncan design a cigarette that will score low in nicotine delivery to the \nmachine by placing tiny ventilation holes in the filter to dilute the \nsmoke. But in real life, a smoker will often cover the vents with his \nor her lips or fingers, thereby inhaling a higher dose of nicotine.\n  Everyone knows nicotine is a highly addictive drug. For tobacco \ncompanies to spike the amount nicotine at a time when States and the \nFederal Government are creating public health campaigns to curb smoking \nis absolutely deplorable.\n  I used to smoke--a lot. Fortunately, my daughter, when she was a \nyoung girl, convinced me to quit. She said, ``Daddy, they told me at \nschool that if you smoke, they will have to put a black box in your \nthroat. I don't want you to get a black box in your throat.''\n  From that day forward I quit.\n  Across America, smokers--men, women, and kids--have their own reasons \nfor quitting. I know it's tough to quit. But I want Americans to be \nhealthy.\n  ``Big Tobacco'' doesn't. They make their money off an addictive \nproduct that kills people. They have known for decades that their \nproduct is lethal. They need our kids sick and addicted to make a dime.\n  When I came to the Senate, I was determined to do everything I could \nto protect Americans--especially our youth--from the dangers of \ntobacco. I'm proud to say that my work on tobacco control started long \nbefore it became a mainstream issue.\n  I've been protecting Americans from Big Tobacco's lies since 1987, \nwhen I wrote the bill that banned smoking on planes. In 1989, I wrote \nthe requirement that all federally-funded programs for children provide \na smoke-free environment.\n  Those laws changed our culture. Today, we'll try and change it again. \nI urge my colleagues to support my legislation and stop cigarette \nmanufacturers from lying to the public.\n  My legislation can help America's smokers kick the habit by putting \nout more of big tobacco's big lies. Tobacco-related illnesses kill over \n400,000 Americans every year. My bill can help save America $89 billion \na year in health care costs. Most important, it can save people's \nlives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Cigarette Labeling \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CLAIMS REGARDING TAR OR NICOTINE YIELD \n                   LEVELS OF CIGARETTES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cigarette manufacturers (through use of words, \n     graphics, and color) have sold, distributed, and falsely \n     marketed brands of cigarettes to consumers as ``light'', \n     ``low-tar'', ``ultra light'', ``mild'', ``natural'', and \n     ``low-nicotine'' cigarettes, implying that the cigarettes are \n     less harmful than other brands of cigarettes.\n       (2) The National Cancer Institute has found that many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that cigarettes with the labels \n     described in paragraph (1) cause fewer health problems than \n     other cigarettes, and this belief misleads smokers who may \n     choose these cigarettes as an alternative to not smoking.\n       (3) The Federal Trade Commission has concluded that \n     ``cigarette tar and nicotine ratings cannot predict the \n     amount of tar and nicotine [a person] get[s] from any \n     particular cigarette.''.\n       (4) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been no \n     reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from the \n     cigarettes described in paragraph (1), and such cigarettes \n     may actually increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (5) The dangers of marketing one brand of cigarettes as \n     less harmful than another brand of cigarettes when in fact \n     there are no reduced risks, is a compelling reason for the \n     Government to ensure statements, claims, or other \n     representations about cigarettes are truthful and not \n     deceptive.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Health descriptor.--The term ``health descriptor'' \n     includes the words ``light'', ``low'', ``low tar'', \n     ``ultralight'', ``mild'', ``natural'', or any other word, or \n     any graphic or color, which reasonably could be expected to \n     result in a consumer believing that smoking such brand may \n     result in a lower risk of disease or be less hazardous to \n     health than smoking another brand of cigarette.\n       (2) Brand.--The term ``brand'' means a variety of tobacco \n     product distinguished by the type of tobacco used, tar \n     content, nicotine content, the flavoring used, size, \n     filtration, packaging, logo, registered trademark or brand \n     name, identifiable pattern of colors, or any combination \n     thereof.\n       (3) Cigarette.--The term ``cigarette'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette \n     Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. 1332(1)), but also \n     includes tobacco, in any form, that is functional in the \n     product, which, because of its appearance, the type of \n     tobacco used in the filler, or its packaging and labeling, is \n     likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a \n     cigarette or as roll-your-own tobacco.\n       (4) Roll-your-own tobacco.--The term ``roll-your-own \n     tobacco'' means any tobacco which, because of its appearance, \n     type, packaging, or labeling, is suitable for use and likely \n     to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco for \n     making cigarettes.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Health Descriptors and Federal \n     Trade Commission Testing Method.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, effective 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, a cigarette manufacturer may not use a health \n     descriptor on the label or the advertising of any brand of \n     cigarette.\n       (2) Prohibition on use of federal trade commission testing \n     method.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     effective 120 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, a cigarette manufacturer may not make any claims or any \n     other representations based on data derived from the \n     cigarette testing method established by the Federal Trade \n     Commission in effect on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Enforcement.--\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\n       (A) Unfair or deceptive act or practice.--A violation of \n     the prohibition described in paragraphs (1) or (2) shall be \n     treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or \n     deceptive act or practice prescribed under section \n     18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     57a(a)(1)(B)).\n       (B) Actions by the commission.--The Federal Trade \n     Commission shall enforce this section in the same manner, by \n     the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and \n     duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the \n     Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were \n     incorporated into and made a part of this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3873. A bill to protect private property rights; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. INHOFE: Mr. President, Alexander Hamilton declared:\n\n       The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, \n     among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as \n     with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the \n     hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or \n     obscured by moral power.\n\n  I believe, and I speak on behalf of the people of Oklahoma, in the \nright to own private property, and I believe in the right to enjoy it \nand not be harassed, especially by the government.\n  There are three issues that the Private Property Protection Act of \n2006 that I am introducing today addresses: it protects the right to \nown and enjoy private property, one of our Government's core purposes; \nit directly confronts the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of \nNew London, Connecticut, which allows local governments to take private \nproperty for economic reasons, by forcing the Court to reign in its \nincessant judicial activism and return to the true intent of the fifth \namendment; it limits government intervention into the private market.\n  However, my bill does not attempt to encroach on a State's right to \nconduct business and levy taxes; it simply makes clear that the \nNational Government will not fund these blatant abuses of private \nproperty. There is no violation of State sovereignty.\n  The Constitution is not really an allocation of Government-determined \nrights to the people as much as it is a limitation on the Government \nfrom interfering with our inherent rights. The presumption is that \npeople are ``endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights'' \nand that the Government's fundamental role is to protect those rights.\n  Sometimes a person's rights do have to be limited in order to protect \nthe rights of everyone else. But there must be a strong reason to \nrestrict or limit those rights, and even when this is done, the rights \nare still there, they do not just disappear.\n  Ask any elementary school child what the main reason for the \nRevolutionary War was and they will probably respond, ``Taxation \nwithout Representation!'' Consider the spirit of the Declaration of \nIndependence, and then see what is going on with eminent domain today. \nIt does not go together. I can only imagine what the Founding Fathers \nand colonists would think if they read the Supreme Court's Kelo \ndecision. There is a huge rift in the intention of eminent domain at \nour Nation's founding and today. Taking away rights, especially \nproperty rights, is a serious matter, but what is worse, thanks to \nKelo, is that a city can now seize a person's land solely for financial \ngain.\n  In Kelo, the Supreme Court gave the legal mandate that the ``broad \nreading'' of the takings clause of the fifth amendment includes taking \nfrom one private citizen and giving it to another as long as the city \nclaims an economic benefit. Changing the definition of the fifth \namendment to mean ``more tax dollars for the city,'' is not only \nincongruous, it is outrageous.\n  This philosophy comes out of a socialistic presumption that all \nproperty really belongs to the State, that the State is the true \nlandlord, and that people are allowed to use the land until the State \ngets a better offer. The Supreme Court is opening up the gate of \nopportunity to these cities essentially saying: ``Hey, if you need \nmoney, just condemn some property . . . bulldoze the houses and sell \nthe land to a giant retail store or factory that will generate lots of \ntax dollars.''\n  Once again, the courts have taken the Constitution and twisted it, \nactively and willfully pursuing their own radical and elitist policy, \nusurping the will of the people, and their elected representatives. The \nSupreme Court's Kelo decision is the pinnacle of a mutation of its \ntakings clause jurisprudence, and essentially extends a government's \ncondemnation power to include taking private property and giving it to \nanother private party who will raise revenue for a city or town.\n  Justice Thomas, in his dissent, quoted renowned legal scholar William \nBlackstone whose ``Commentaries on the Laws of England'' eloquently \ndescribed the authority of the law at the time the fifth amendment was \ndrafted: ``The law of the land . . . postpone[s] even public necessity \nto the sacred and inviolable rights of private property.'' Justice \nThomas continued, agreeing with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's well-\nstated warning taken from her dissenting opinion:\n\n       If such ``economic development'' takings are for a ``public \n     use,'' any taking is, and the Court has erased the Public Use \n     Clause from our Constitution.\n\n  Justice O'Connor also explained that historically, the ``Government \nmay compel an individual to forfeit her property for the public's use, \nbut not for the benefit of another private person. This requirement \npromotes fairness as well as security.''\n  Professor Bradley Jacob, a constitutional law professor at Regent \nUniversity School of Law, is gravely concerned by the Court's decision \nin Kelo. He observed:\n\n       What the Court ruled in Kelo is not consistent with the \n     Constitution, it is not consistent with the Declaration of \n     Independence, and it is not consistent with the principles of \n     liberty that underlie free Republican government. It was \n     valid only in the eyes of those who accept the idea that the \n     Supreme Court is our national super-legislature, imposing its \n     views of wise social policy on an unwilling nation.\n\n  The Court calls this kind of taking ``economic development.'' I call \nit robbery and wealth redistribution. If the cities are suffering from \nfailed economies because of poor decisionmaking, inefficient zoning, \nand financial irresponsibility, that is unfortunate; however, unchecked \neiminent domain power is not the answer.\n  According to economic greats, such as Adam Smith and John Locke, \nthere are two types of property: private and public. Property is \nprivate when others are prevented from using or benefiting from it. It \nis exclusive to the owner. He or she is entitled to the fruits it \nbears. Examples of this are homes, farms, and stores. Conversely, \npublic property is property that is opened up and common to the public, \nfrom which all have equal access to its fruits, and equal access to use \nit and benefit from it. Examples of this are roads, power lines, and \nwaterways.\n  The fifth amendment recognizes the Government's power to take private \nproperty when necessary, and open it up to the public, for true public \nuse. The idea of interpreting the fifth amendment in a ``broad'' manner \nto allow, and thus, encourage taking private property from one and \ngiving it to another private owner is foreign and hostile to the \nprinciples that make this nation great.\n\n  I believe that economic development belongs to the private market. \nCondemnation power for economic development will have devastating and \nparalyzing effects on the market. This is extreme artificial \ninterference in the market that will only encourage more irresponsible \ndecisionmaking by cities.\n  When a private citizen steals a person's private property, the victim \nhas a cause of action against the culprit to try to right the wrong and \nthe State has an interest in prosecuting that wrong as well, as \nstealing is against the law. But what is so dangerous here is that it \nis the State that is facilitating the wrong. My bill will ensure a \nprivate cause of action for the citizen whose property is taken away \nfrom him or her by the State for economic development.\n  Recognition and protections of the right to own private property is \nthe driving force of our Nation and the fuel of the free market. The \nGovernment should be the staunchest defender of private property, not \nthe thief that steals it. My legislation will prevent States that allow \ntheir cities or other municipal bodies to carry out this type of \neminent domain, that is, the kind based solely on economic development, \nfrom receiving Federal economic development funds. I simply do not \nthink that we should be funding economic development for those States \nthat are\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\nwilling to steal private property from their citizens.\n  As Alexis de Tocqueville predicted, the unique private property \nrights in America would set it apart from and above the nations of the \nworld, mainly by facilitating a thriving, land-owning middle class, the \nbackbone of a successful free market. The Kelo decision is a crippling \nblow to our middle class, and our Constitutional Republic as a whole, \nand must be dealt with immediately.\n  I ask my colleagues in this body to stand with me and protect the \nprivate property rights of Americans across this great land. We owe it \nto the citizens of our States; we owe it to the Constitution and our \nliberty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 3875.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Faster and Smarter \n     Funding for First Responders Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 112. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In order to achieve its objective of preventing, \n     minimizing the damage from, and assisting in the recovery \n     from terrorist attacks, the Department of Homeland Security \n     must play a leading role in assisting communities to reach \n     the level of preparedness they need to prevent and respond to \n     a terrorist attack.\n       (2) First responder funding is not reaching the men and \n     women of our Nation's first response teams quickly enough, \n     and sometimes not at all.\n       (3) To reform the current bureaucratic process so that \n     homeland security dollars reach the first responders who need \n     it most, it is necessary to clarify and consolidate the \n     authority and procedures of the Department of Homeland \n     Security that support first responders.\n       (4) Ensuring adequate resources for the new national \n     mission of homeland security, without degrading the ability \n     to address effectively other types of major disasters and \n     emergencies, requires a discrete and separate grant making \n     process for homeland security funds for first response to \n     terrorist acts, on the one hand, and for first responder \n     programs designed to meet pre-September 11 priorities, on the \n     other.\n       (5) While a discrete homeland security grant making process \n     is necessary to ensure proper focus on the unique aspects of \n     terrorism preparedness, it is essential that State and local \n     strategies for utilizing such grants be integrated, to the \n     greatest extent practicable, with existing State and local \n     emergency management plans.\n       (6) Homeland security grants to first responders must be \n     based on the best intelligence concerning the capabilities \n     and intentions of our terrorist enemies, and that \n     intelligence must be used to target resources to the Nation's \n     greatest threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.\n       (7) The Nation's first response capabilities will be \n     improved by sharing resources, training, planning, personnel, \n     and equipment among neighboring jurisdictions through mutual \n     aid agreements and regional cooperation. Such regional \n     cooperation should be supported, where appropriate, through \n     direct grants from the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (8) An essential prerequisite to achieving the Nation's \n     homeland security objectives for first responders is the \n     establishment of well-defined national goals for terrorism \n     preparedness. These goals should delineate the essential \n     capabilities that every jurisdiction in the United States \n     should possess or to which it should have access.\n       (9) A national determination of essential capabilities is \n     needed to identify levels of State and local government \n     terrorism preparedness, to determine the nature and extent of \n     State and local first responder needs, to identify the human \n     and financial resources required to fulfill them, to direct \n     funding to meet those needs, and to measure preparedness \n     levels on a national scale.\n       (10) To facilitate progress in achieving, maintaining, and \n     enhancing essential capabilities for State and local first \n     responders, the Department of Homeland Security should seek \n     to allocate homeland security funding for first responders to \n     meet nationwide needs.\n       (11) Private sector resources and citizen volunteers can \n     perform critical functions in assisting in preventing and \n     responding to terrorist attacks, and should be integrated \n     into State and local planning efforts to ensure that their \n     capabilities and roles are understood, so as to provide \n     enhanced State and local operational capability and surge \n     capacity.\n       (12) Public-private partnerships, such as the partnerships \n     between the Business Executives for National Security and the \n     States of New Jersey and Georgia, can be useful to identify \n     and coordinate private sector support for State and local \n     first responders. Such models should be expanded to cover all \n     States and territories.\n       (13) An important aspect of terrorism preparedness is \n     measurability, so that it is possible to determine how \n     prepared a State or local government is now, and what \n     additional steps it needs to take, in order to prevent, \n     prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, and recover from \n     acts of terrorism.\n       (14) The Department of Homeland Security should establish, \n     publish, and regularly update national voluntary consensus \n     standards for both equipment and training, in cooperation \n     with both public and private sector standard setting \n     organizations, to assist State and local governments in \n     obtaining the equipment and training to attain the essential \n     capabilities for first response to acts of terrorism, and to \n     ensure that first responder funds are spent wisely.\n\n     SEC. 113.

PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``9/11 \n     Commission Civil Liberties Board Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004 the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States issued a report that included \n     41 specific recommendations to help prevent future terrorist \n     attacks, including details of a global strategy and \n     government reorganization necessary to implement that \n     strategy.\n       (2) One of the recommendations focused on the protections \n     of civil liberties. Specifically the following recommendation \n     was made: ``At this time of increased and consolidated \n     government authority, there should be a board within the \n     executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we \n     recommend and the commitment the government makes to defend \n     our civil liberties.''.\n       (3) The report also states that ``the choice between \n     security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more \n     likely to endanger America's liberties than the success of a \n     terrorist attack at home. Our History has shown that the \n     insecurity threatens liberty at home. Yet if our liberties \n     are curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to \n     defend.''.\n       (4) On December 17, 2004, Public Law 108-458, the National \n     Intelligence Reform Act, was signed into law. This law \n     created a civil liberties board that does not have the \n     authority necessary to protect civil liberties.\n       (5) The establishment and adequate funding of a Privacy and \n     Civil Liberties Oversight Board was a crucial recommendation \n     made by the 9/11 Commission.\n       (6) In its Final Report on 9/11 Commission Recommendations, \n     the Commission noted ``very little urgency'' and \n     ``insufficient'' funding as it relates to the establishment \n     of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n       (7) While the President's budget submission for fiscal year \n     2006 included $750,000 for the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board, the President's budget submission for fiscal \n     year 2007 does not contain a funding line for the Board.\n       (c) Making the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \n     Independent.--Section 1061(b) of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended by striking \n     ``within the Executive Office of the President'' and \n     inserting ``as an independent agency within the Executive \n     branch''.\n       (d) Requiring All Members of the Privacy and Civil \n     Liberties Oversight Board Be Confirmed by the Senate.--\n     Subsection (e) of section 1061 of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(e) Membership.--\n       ``(1) Members.--The Board shall be composed of a full-time \n     chairman and 4 additional members, who shall be appointed by \n     the President, by and with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate.\n       ``(2) Qualifications.--Members of the Board shall be \n     selected solely on the basis of their professional \n     qualifications, achievements, public stature, expertise in \n     civil liberties and privacy, and relevant experience, and \n     without regard to political affiliation, but in no event \n     shall more than 3 members of the Board be members of the same \n     political party. The President shall, before appointing an \n     individual who is not a member of the same political party as \n     the President consult with the leadership of that party, if \n     any, in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n       ``(3) Incompatible office.--An individual appointed to the \n     Board may not, while serving on the Board, be an elected \n     official, officer, or employee of the Federal Government, \n     other than in the capacity as a member of the Board.\n       ``(4) Term.--Each member of the Board shall serve a term of \n     six years, except that--\n       ``(A) a member appointed to a term of office after the \n     commencement of such term may serve under such appointment \n     only for the remainder of such term;\n       ``(B) upon the expiration of the term of office of a \n     member, the member shall continue to serve until the member's \n     successor has been appointed and qualified, except that no \n     member may serve under this subparagraph--\n       ``(i) for more than 60 days when Congress is in session \n     unless a nomination to fill the vacancy shall have been \n     submitted to the Senate; or\n       ``(ii) after the adjournment sine die of the session of the \n     Senate in which such nomination is submitted; and\n       ``(C) the members initially appointed under this subsection \n     shall serve terms of two, three, four, five, and six years, \n     respectively, from the effective date of this Act, with the \n     term of each such member to be designated by the President.\n       ``(5) Quorum and meetings.--The Board shall meet upon the \n     call of the chairman or a majority of its members. Three \n     members of the Board shall constitute a quorum.''.\n       (e) Subpoena Power for the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board.--Section 1061(d) of the Intelligence Reform \n     and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended--\n       (1) so that subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) reads as \n     follows:\n       ``(D) require, by subpoena issued at the direction of a \n     majority of the members of the Board, persons (other than \n     departments, agencies, and elements of the executive branch) \n     to produce any relevant information, documents, reports, \n     answers, records, accounts, papers, and other documentary or \n     testimonial evidence.''; and\n       (2) so that paragraph (2) reads as follows:\n       ``(2) Enforcement of subpoena.--In the case of contumacy or \n     failure to obey a subpoena issued under paragraph (1)(D), the \n     United States district court for the judicial district in \n     which the subpoenaed person resides, is served, or may be \n     found may issue an order requiring such person to produce the \n     evidence required by such subpoena.''.\n       (f) Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Duties of board.--Paragraph (4) of section 1061(c) of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Reports.--\n       ``(A) Receipt, review, and submission.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The Board shall--\n\n       ``(I) receive and review reports from privacy officers and \n     civil liberties officers described in section 212; and\n       ``(II) periodically submit, not less than semiannually, \n     reports to the appropriate committees of Congress, including \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on \n     Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the President.\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\n     Such reports shall be in unclassified form to the greatest \n     extent possible, with a classified annex where necessary.\n       ``(ii) Contents.--Not less than 2 reports the Board submits \n     each year under clause (i)(II) shall include--\n\n       ``(I) a description of the major activities of the Board \n     during the preceding period;\n       ``(II) information on the findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice and \n     oversight functions under subsection (c);\n       ``(III) the minority views on any findings, conclusions, \n     and recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice \n     and oversight functions under subsection (c); and\n       ``(IV) each proposal reviewed by the Board under subsection \n     (c)(1) that the Board advised against implementing, but that \n     notwithstanding such advice, was implemented.\n\n       ``(B) Informing the public.--The Board shall--\n       ``(i) make its reports, including its reports to Congress, \n     available to the public to the greatest extent that is \n     consistent with the protection of classified information and \n     applicable law; and\n       ``(ii) hold public hearings and otherwise inform the public \n     of its activities, as appropriate and in a manner consistent \n     with the protection of classified information and applicable \n     law.''.\n       (2) Privacy and civil liberties officers.--Section 1062 of \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1062.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Loose nuclear weapons and materials in the former \n     soviet union.--\n       (A) There are in the world today enormous stockpiles of \n     nuclear weapons and the materials required to make them. \n     Counting materials both in assembled warheads and in other \n     forms, worldwide totals are estimated to encompass some 1,900 \n     tons of highly enriched uranium (enough for 143,000 nuclear \n     weapons) and 1,855 tons of plutonium (enough for 330,000 \n     nuclear weapons).\n       (B) The Russian Federation alone is estimated to have over \n     1,000 tons of highly enriched uranium (enough for over 80,000 \n     nuclear weapons) and 140 tons of plutonium (enough for over \n     30,000 nuclear weapons).\n       (C) The United States has been working for over a decade to \n     eliminate stockpiles of loose nuclear weapons and materials \n     in the former Soviet Union, but the Department of Energy \n     acknowledges that there is still a need to properly secure \n     about 460 tons of weapons-usable Russian nuclear material \n     (outside of warheads), enough for more than 35,000 nuclear \n     weapons.\n       (D) A recent report by the Central Intelligence Agency \n     faulted the security of nuclear arsenal facilities in the \n     Russian Federation and assessed that ``undetected smuggling \n     has occurred.''\n       (E) There are at least 18 documented incidents of \n     ``proliferation significant'' fissile material trafficking \n     from facilities in the former Soviet Union between 1991 and \n     2001. In one incident in 1998, an inside conspiracy at a \n     Russian nuclear weapons facility attempted to steal 18.5 \n     kilograms of highly enriched uranium. In another incident, 2 \n     kilograms of highly enriched uranium taken from a research \n     facility in Sukhumi, Georgia, has never been recovered.\n       (F) In May 1994, German police found a small but worrisome \n     quantity of supergrade plutonium in the garage of Adolf \n     Jackle. Extremely expensive to produce, this rare item was \n     likely stolen from one of Russia's two premier nuclear \n     weapons laboratories.\n       (G) Comprehensive security upgrades are not yet completed \n     at 90 percent of Russian nuclear warhead bunkers for Russia's \n     Strategic Rocket Forces.\n       (H) Border security in the former Soviet Union is \n     inconsistent at best. Existing infrastructure helps at the \n     outer borders of the former Soviet Union but many borders \n     internal to the former Soviet Union, such as the border \n     between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, exist only on \n     a map.\n       (2) Loose nuclear materials around the globe.--\n       (A) Dangerous caches of weapons-usable nuclear materials, \n     much of it poorly secured and vulnerable to theft, exist in a \n     multitude of facilities around the world. For example, there \n     are over 130 research reactors in over 40 countries that \n     house highly enriched uranium, some with enough to \n     manufacture an atomic bomb. In total, about 40 tons of highly \n     enriched uranium, enough for over 1,000 nuclear weapons, is \n     estimated to remain in civilian research reactors.\n       (B) Over the last 50 years, the United States is known to \n     have exported about 27.5 tons of highly enriched uranium to \n     43 countries to help develop nuclear power production or \n     bolster scientific initiatives. In 1996, the United States \n     began an effort to recover the more than 17.5 tons of the \n     nuclear material that was still overseas, but has recovered \n     only about 1 ton, according to the Department of Energy and \n     the Government Accountability Office.\n       (C) It is especially important to keep highly enriched \n     uranium out of terrorists' hands because, with minimal \n     expertise, they could use it to make the simplest, gun-type \n     nuclear weapon--a device in which a high explosive is used to \n     blow one subcritical piece of highly enriched uranium from \n     one end of a tube into another subcritical piece held at the \n     opposite end of the tube.\n       (D) To Osama bin Laden, acquiring weapons of mass \n     destruction is a ``religious duty''. Al Qaeda and more than \n     two dozen other terrorist groups are pursuing capability to \n     use weapons of mass destruction.\n       (E) Osama bin Laden's press spokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, \n     has announced that the group aspires ``to kill 4 million \n     Americans, including 1 million children,'' in response to \n     casualties supposedly inflicted on Muslims by the United \n     States and Israel.\n       (F) Al Qaeda documents recovered in Afghanistan reveal a \n     determined research effort focused on nuclear weapons.\n       (3) Security standards for all nuclear weapons and \n     materials.--\n       (A) There are no international binding standards for the \n     secure handling and storage of nuclear weapons and materials.\n       (B) Making a nuclear weapon requires only 4 to 5 kilograms \n     of plutonium or 12 to 15 kilograms of highly enriched \n     uranium.\n       (C) In October 2001, the United States Government became \n     very concerned that Al Qaeda may have smuggled a 10-kiloton \n     Russian nuclear warhead into New York City. If placed in \n     lower Manhattan, such a device would probably kill 100,000 \n     people instantly, seriously injure tens of thousands more, \n     and render the entire area uninhabitable for decades to come.\n       (4) Russia's nuclear expertise.--\n       (A) Employment at the large nuclear facilities in the \n     Russian Federation's 10 closed nuclear cities is estimated to \n     be in the range of 120,000 to 130,000 people, of whom \n     approximately 75,000 were employed on nuclear weapons-related \n     work.\n       (B) Poor wages and living conditions in Russian ``nuclear \n     cities'' have inspired protests and strikes among the \n     employees working in them.\n       (C) Insiders have been caught attempting to smuggle nuclear \n     materials out of these facilities, presumably to sell on the \n     lucrative black market.\n\n     SEC. 323.

STRENGTHENING THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons (commonly referred to as the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty or NPT) (21 UST 483) states that \n     countries that are parties to the treaty have the \n     ``inalienable right . . . to develop research, production and \n     use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \n     discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of \n     this treaty.''.\n       (2) The rights outlined under article IV include all fuel \n     cycle activities, despite the fact that uranium enrichment \n     and plutonium production potentially put a country in a \n     position to produce weapons usable material.\n       (3) David Bergmann, former chairman of the Israeli Atomic \n     Energy Commission, stated: ``. . . by developing atomic \n     energy for peaceful uses, you reach the nuclear weapon \n     option. There are not two atomic energies''.\n       (4) The wording of article IV has made it possible for \n     countries that are parties to the NPT treaty to use peaceful \n     nuclear programs as a cover for weapons programs. In \n     particular, the misuse by North Korea and Iran of these \n     provisions threatens to undercut the viability of the nuclear \n     nonproliferation regime and the entire system of \n     international nuclear commerce.\n       (5) If the international community fails to devise \n     effective measures to deal with the ``loophole'' in article \n     IV, then there is a great likelihood that the ranks of \n     countries possessing nuclear weapons will increase markedly \n     in the next decade.\n       (b) Presidential Report on Control of Nuclear Fuel Cycle \n     Technologies and Material.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit \n     to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     identifying ways to more effectively control nuclear fuel \n     cycle technologies and material, including ways that the \n     United States can mobilize the international community to \n     close the ``loophole'' of article IV of the NPT, without \n     undermining the treaty itself.\n\n     SEC. 337. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on International Relations, the Committee \n     on Armed Services, the Committee on Homeland Security, and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate.\n       (2) Cooperative threat reduction programs.--The term \n     ``Cooperative Threat Reduction programs'' means programs and \n     activities specified in section 1501(b) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law \n     104-201; 110 Stat. 2731; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note).\n\n                    DIVISION B--COMBATTING TERRORISM\n\n     SEC. 1001.

FOREIGN LANGUAGE EXPERTISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Success in the global war on terrorism will require a \n     dramatic increase in institutional and personal expertise in \n     the languages and cultures of the societies where terrorism \n     has taken root, including a substantial increase in the \n     number of national security personnel who obtain expert \n     lingual training.\n       (2) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States identified the countries in the Middle East, \n     South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Africa as countries that \n     serve or could serve as terrorist havens.\n       (3) Although 22 countries have Arabic as their official \n     language, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States found that a total of only 6 undergraduate \n     degrees for the study of Arabic were granted by United States \n     colleges and universities in 2002.\n       (4) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States contained several criticisms \n     of the lack of linguistic expertise in the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and called \n     for the Central Intelligence Agency to ``develop a stronger \n     language program, with high standards and sufficient \n     financial incentives''.\n       (5) An audit conducted by the Department of Justice in July \n     2004, revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a \n     backlog of hundreds of thousands of untranslated audio \n     recordings from terror and espionage investigations.\n       (6) The National Security Education Program Trust Fund, \n     which funds critical grant and scholarship programs for \n     linguistic training in regions critical to national security, \n     will have exhausted all its funding by fiscal year 2006, \n     unless additional appropriations are made to the Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject terrorism \n     and a small, radical minority has grossly distorted the \n     teachings of one of the world's great faiths to seek \n     justification for acts of terrorism, such radical Islamic \n     fundamentalism constitutes a primary threat to the national \n     security interests of the United States, and an effective \n     strategy for combating terrorism should include increasing \n     the number of personnel throughout the Federal Government \n     with expertise in languages spoken in predominately Muslim \n     countries and in the culture of such countries;\n       (2) Muslim-Americans constitute an integral and cherished \n     part of the fabric of American society and possess many \n     talents, including linguistic, historic, and cultural \n     expertise that should be harnessed in the war against \n     radical, fundamentalist terror; and\n       (3) amounts appropriated for the National Flagship Language \n     Initiative pursuant to the amendments made by subsection \n     (e)(2) should be used to support the establishment, \n     operation, and improvement of programs for the study of \n     Arabic, Persian, and other Middle Eastern, South Asian, \n     Southeast Asian, and West African languages in institutes of \n     higher education in the United States.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) National security education trust fund.--Section 810 of \n     the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1910) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations for the Fund for \n     Fiscal Year 2007.--\n       ``(1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Fund $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n       ``(2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in paragraph (1) shall \n     remain available until expended and not more than $15,000,000 \n     of such amounts may be obligated and expended during any \n     fiscal year.''.\n       (2) National flagship language initiative.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 811(a) of the David L. Boren \n     National Security Education Act of 1991 (50 U.S.C. 1911(a)) \n     is amended by striking ``there is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary for each fiscal year, beginning \n     with fiscal year 2003, $10,000,000'' and inserting ``there \n     are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for each \n     fiscal year 2003 through 2006, $10,000,000, and for each \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2006, $20,000,000,''.\n       (B) Availability of funds.--Section 811(b) of such Act (50 \n     U.S.C. 1911(b)) is amended by inserting ``for fiscal years \n     2003 through 2006'' after ``this section''.\n       (3) Demonstration program.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Director of National Intelligence such \n     sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2007, 2008,\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\n     and 2009 in order to carry out the demonstration program \n     established under subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 1103.

S. and international policies, programs, \n     structures, and organizations will be inadequate to assure \n     sustained results commensurate with the ongoing threat posed \n     to the national security of the United States''.\n       (3) The report of the Independent Task Force contained the \n     conclusion that ``[l]ong-term success will depend critically \n     upon the structure, integration, and focus of the U. S. \n     Government--and any intergovernmental efforts undertaken to \n     address this problem''.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to work with the Government of Saudi Arabia to curtail \n     terrorist financing originating from that country using a \n     range of methods, including diplomacy, intelligence, and law \n     enforcement;\n       (2) to ensure effective coordination and sufficient \n     resources for efforts of the agencies and departments of the \n     United States to disrupt terrorist financing by carrying out, \n     through the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in \n     the Department of the Treasury, a comprehensive analysis of \n     the budgets and activities of all such agencies and \n     departments that are related to disrupting the financing of \n     terrorist organizations;\n       (3) to provide each agency or department of the United \n     States with the appropriate number of personnel to carry out \n     the activities of such agency or department related to \n     disrupting the financing of terrorist organizations;\n       (4) to centralize the coordination of the efforts of the \n     United States to combat terrorist financing and utilize \n     existing authorities to identify foreign jurisdictions and \n     foreign financial institutions suspected of abetting \n     terrorist financing and take actions to prevent the provision \n     of assistance to terrorists; and\n       (5) to work with other countries to develop and enforce \n     strong domestic terrorist financing laws, and increase \n     funding for bilateral and multilateral programs to enhance \n     training and capacity-building in countries who request \n     assistance.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations To Provide Technical \n     Assistance To Prevent Financing of Terrorists.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the President for the ``Economic Support Fund'' to provide \n     technical assistance under the provisions of chapter 4 of \n     part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 \n     et seq.) to foreign countries to assist such countries in \n     preventing the financing of terrorist activities--\n       (A) for fiscal year 2007, $300,000,000; and\n       (B) for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, such sums as may be \n     necessary.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in this subsection are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n       (3) Additional funds.--Amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under this subsection are in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available for such purposes.\n\n     SEC. 1104.

These efforts are beginning to \n     reach large audiences. The Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     has asked for much larger resources. It should get them.''.\n       (4) A significant expansion of United States international \n     broadcasting would provide a cost-effective means of \n     improving communication with countries with significant \n     Muslim populations by providing news, information, and \n     analysis, as well as cultural programming, through both radio \n     and television broadcasts.\n       (b) Special Authority for Surge Capacity.--The United \n     States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 316.

TREATMENT OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Carrying out the global war on terrorism requires the \n     development of policies with respect to the detention and \n     treatment of captured international terrorists that are \n     adhered to by all coalition forces.\n       (2) Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment \n     of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3316), was specifically designed for cases in which the usual \n     rules of war do not apply, and the minimum standards of \n     treatment pursuant to such Article are generally accepted \n     throughout the world as customary international law.\n       (3) The Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States urged to the United States to engage its friends to \n     develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and \n     humane treatment of captured terrorists. The 9/11 Public \n     Discourse Project went on to give the Administration a \n     ranking of ``unfulfilled'' in this area, commenting that \n     ``[d]issession either at home or abroad on how the United \n     States treats captured terrorists only makes it harder to \n     build the diplomatic, political and military alliance \n     necessary to fight the war on terror effectively''.\n       (b) Policy.--The policy of the United States is as follows:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to treat all \n     foreign persons captured, detained, interned, or otherwise \n     held in the custody of the United States (hereinafter \n     ``detainees'')\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\n     humanely and in accordance with the legal obligations under \n     United States law and international law, including the \n     obligations in the Convention Against Torture, the Geneva \n     Conventions, and the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that all \n     officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and \n     in peacetime by the legal prohibitions against torture, \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment set out in the \n     Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, as \n     reiterated by the Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (126 S. \n     Ct. 2749 (2006)).\n       (3) If there is any doubt as to whether a detainee is \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, it is the policy of the United States that such \n     detainee shall enjoy the protections of the Convention \n     Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva \n     August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316) until such time as the \n     detainee's status can be determined pursuant to the \n     procedures authorized by Army Regulation 190-8, Section 1-6.\n       (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously \n     process and, if appropriate, prosecute detainees in the \n     custody of the United States, including detainees in custody \n     at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (c) Reporting.--The Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees the following:\n       (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, a report setting forth the number of individuals \n     currently held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the number of such \n     individuals who are unlikely to face a military commission in \n     the next six months, and each reason for not bringing such \n     individuals before a military commission.\n       (2) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, a report setting forth all interrogation \n     techniques approved, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, by officials of the United States for use with \n     detainees.\n       (d) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Director \n     shall prescribe the rules, regulations, or guidelines \n     necessary to ensure compliance with the standards of the \n     Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and Common Article 3 of the \n     Geneva Conventions by all personnel of the United States \n     Government and by any person providing services to the United \n     States Government on a contract basis.\n       (2) Report to congress.--The Secretary and the Director \n     shall submit to Congress the rules, regulations, or \n     guidelines prescribed under paragraph (1), and any \n     modifications to such rules, regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In a report entitled ``Emergency First Responders: \n     Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared'', an \n     independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign \n     Relations found that ``America's local emergency responders \n     will always be the first to confront a terrorist incident and \n     will play the central role in managing its immediate \n     consequences. Their efforts in the first minutes and hours \n     following an attack will be critical to saving lives, \n     establishing order, and preventing mass panic. The United \n     States has both a responsibility and a critical need to \n     provide them with the equipment, training, and other \n     resources necessary to do their jobs safely and \n     effectively.''.\n       (2) The task force further concluded that many state and \n     local emergency responders, including police officers and \n     firefighters, lack the equipment and training needed to \n     respond effectively to a terrorist attack involving weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (3) The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure \n     that the people of the United States are protected to the \n     greatest possible extent against a terrorist attack, \n     especially an attack that utilizes nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, or radiological weapons, and consequently, the \n     Federal Government has a critical responsibility to address \n     the equipment, training, and other needs of State and local \n     first responders.\n\n     SEC. 1322. RESTORATION OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) State and local police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency responders play an essential role in the efforts of \n     the United States to prevent terrorist attacks and, if an \n     attack occurred, to address the effects of the attack.\n       (2) An independent task force has concluded that hundreds \n     of local police offices and firefighting and emergency \n     response units throughout the United States are unprepared \n     for responding to a terrorist attack involving nuclear, \n     chemical, biological, or radiological weapons.\n       (3) The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \n     Program provides critical Federal support for personnel, \n     equipment, training, and technical assistance for the \n     homeland security responsibilities of local law enforcement \n     offices.\n       (4) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law \n     108-447) appropriated funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program, a program that resulted \n     from the combination of the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant \n     Program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program.\n       (5) Funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \n     Assistance Grant Program, as provided in the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 2005, has been reduced by nearly 50 \n     percent since fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should request in the annual budget proposal, \n     and Congress should appropriate, the full amount authorized \n     to be appropriated in subsection (c).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \n     Assistance Grant Program--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2007, $1,250,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2008, $1,400,000,000; and\n       (3) for fiscal year 2009, $1,600,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 1323.

Offenses \n     against the Law of Nations'', as well as the power ``To \n     declare War . . . To raise and support Armies . . . [and] To \n     provide and maintain a Navy.''.\n       (2) On November 13, 2001, the President issued a military \n     order establishing military commissions to try individuals \n     detained in the global war on terrorism.\n       (3) On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court held in Hamdan v. \n     Rumsfeld (126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006)) that--\n       (A) the authority to establish military commissions ``can \n     derive only from the powers granted jointly to the President \n     and Congress in time of war'';\n       (B) the military commission established by the President to \n     try Hamdan ``lacks the power to proceed'' because the \n     procedures governing the commission departed impermissibly \n     from the procedures governing courts martial and the \n     requirements of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions; \n     and\n       (C) procedures governing military commissions may depart \n     from the procedures governing courts martial ``only if some \n     practical need explains deviations from court-martial \n     practice''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) aliens detained by the United States who are alleged to \n     have violated the law of war should be tried for their \n     offenses;\n       (2) it is in the national interest for Congress to exercise \n     its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation \n     authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to \n     try and punish offenders against the law of war;\n       (3) procedures established by Congress for the use of \n     military commissions should be consistent with the decision \n     of the Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld;\n       (4) in drafting legislation for the use of military \n     commissions, the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives should take into account the \n     views of professional military lawyers who have experience in \n     prosecuting, defending, and judging cases under chapter 47 of \n     title 10, United States Code (the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice);\n       (5) the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate is \n     drafting a bipartisan proposal on military commissions that \n     reflects the views of senior military lawyers, and this \n     process must be allowed to move forward; and\n       (6) as the Judge Advocate General of the Navy explained in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on July 13, 2006, ``[w]e need to think in terms of the \n     long view, and to always put our own sailors, soldiers, \n     Marines, and airmen in the place of an accused when we're \n     drafting these rules to ensure that these rules are \n     acceptable when we have someone in a future war who faces \n     similar rules''.\n\n                DIVISION C--INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n     SEC. 2001.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States government authorities should have the \n     legal authority to engage in electronic surveillance of any \n     telephone conversation in which one party is reasonably \n     believed to be a member or agent of a terrorist organization.\n       (2) Absent emergency or other appropriate circumstances, \n     domestic electronic surveillance should be subject to \n     judicial review in order to protect the privacy of law \n     abiding Americans with no ties to terrorism.\n       (3) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     (FISA) authorizes the President to obtain a warrant for the \n     electronic surveillance of any telephone conversation in \n     which one party is reasonably believed to be a member or \n     agent of a terrorist organization. That Act also establishes \n     procedures for engaging in electronic surveillance without a \n     warrant on a temporary basis when emergency circumstances \n     make obtaining a warrant impractical.\n       (4) During the quarter century since the enactment of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court has issued a warrant for \n     electronic surveillance in response\n\n[[Page S9169]]\n\n     to all but 5 of the approximately 19,000 applications for \n     such a warrant.\n       (5) Congress has amended the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 numerous times, including six times \n     since September 11, 2001, to streamline the procedures for \n     obtaining a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and \n     the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House \n     of Representatives must be fully briefed on the history, \n     operation, and usefulness of the warrantless wiretapping \n     program carried out by the National Security Agency;\n       (2) Congress should modify the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 as needed to ensure that the \n     government may engage in electronic surveillance of telephone \n     conversations in which one party is reasonably believed to be \n     a member or agent of a terrorist organization;\n       (3) the requirement that the government must, absent \n     emergency or other appropriate circumstances, obtain a \n     judicial warrant prior to engaging in electronic surveillance \n     of a United States person should remain in place to protect \n     the privacy of law abiding Americans with no ties to \n     terrorism; and\n       (4) the President is not above the law and must abide by \n     congressionally-enacted procedures for engaging in electronic \n     surveillance.\n\n TITLE XXIV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n      Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\n     SEC. 2401.

UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United \n     States Policy on Iraq Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Global terrorist networks, including those that \n     attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, continue to \n     threaten the national security of the United States and are \n     recruiting, planning, and developing capabilities to attack \n     the United States and its allies throughout the world.\n       (2) Winning the fight against terrorist networks requires \n     an integrated, comprehensive effort that uses all facets of \n     power of the United States and the members of the \n     international community who value democracy, freedom, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (3) The United States Armed Forces, particularly the Army \n     and Marine Corps, are stretched thin, and many soldiers and \n     Marines have experienced three or more deployments to combat \n     zones.\n       (4) Sectarian violence has surpassed the insurgency and \n     terrorism as the main security threat in Iraq, increasing the \n     prospects of a broader civil war which could draw in Iraq's \n     neighbors.\n       (5) United States and coalition forces have trained and \n     equipped more than 129,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, and \n     airmen, and more than 165,000 Iraqi police, highway patrol, \n     and other Ministry of Interior forces.\n       (6) Of the 106 operational Iraqi Army combat battalions, 85 \n     are either in the lead or operating independently, according \n     to the August 2006 report of the Administration to Congress \n     entitled ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'';\n       (7) Congress expressed its sense in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (119 Stat. 3466) that \n     ``calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq''.\n       (8) Iraq's security forces are heavily infiltrated by \n     sectarian militia, which has greatly increased sectarian \n     tensions and impeded the development of effective security \n     services loyal to the Iraq Government.\n       (9) With the approval by the Iraqi Council of \n     Representatives of the ministers of defense, national \n     security, and the interior on June 7, 2006, the entire \n     cabinet of Prime Minister Maliki is now in place.\n       (10) Pursuant to the Iraq Constitution, the Council of \n     Representatives is to appoint a Panel which will have 4 \n     months to recommend changes to the Iraq Constitution.\n       (11) Despite pledges of more than $8,000,000,000 in \n     assistance for Iraq by foreign governments other than the \n     United States at the Madrid International Donors' Conference \n     in October 2003, only $3,500,000,000 of such assistance has \n     been forthcoming.\n       (12) The current open-ended commitment of United States \n     forces in Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis \n     making the political compromises and personnel and resource \n     commitments that are needed for the stability and security of \n     Iraq.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     order to change course from an open-ended commitment and to \n     promote the assumption of security responsibilities by the \n     Iraqis, thus advancing the chances for success in Iraq--\n       (1) the following actions need to be taken to help achieve \n     the broad-based and sustainable political settlement so \n     essential for defeating the insurgency and preventing all-out \n     civil war--\n       (A) there must be a fair sharing of political power and \n     economic resources among all the Iraqi groups so as to invest \n     them in the formation of an Iraqi nation by either amendments \n     to the Iraq Constitution or by legislation or other means, \n     within the timeframe provided for in the Iraq Constitution;\n       (B) the President should convene an international \n     conference so as to more actively involve the international \n     community and Iraq's neighbors, promote a durable political \n     settlement among Iraqis, reduce regional interference in \n     Iraq's internal affairs, encourage more countries to \n     contribute to Iraq's extensive needs, and ensure that pledged \n     funds are forthcoming;\n       (C) the Iraq Government should promptly and decisively \n     disarm the militias and remove those members of the Iraqi \n     security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq Government is in \n     doubt; and\n       (D) the President should--\n       (i) expedite the transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     to a limited presence and mission of training Iraqi security \n     forces, providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces, \n     protecting United States infrastructure and personnel, and \n     participating in targeted counterterrorism activities;\n       (ii) after consultation with the Government of Iraq, begin \n     the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq \n     this year; and\n       (iii) submit to Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with \n     estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \n     United States forces from Iraq, with the understanding that \n     unexpected contingencies may arise;\n       (2) during and after the phased redeployment of United \n     States forces from Iraq, the United States will need to \n     sustain a nonmilitary effort to actively support \n     reconstruction, governance, and a durable political solution \n     in Iraq; and\n       (3) the President should carefully assess the impact that \n     ongoing United States military operations in Iraq are having \n     on the capability of the United States Government to conduct \n     an effective counterterrorism campaign to defeat the broader \n     global terrorist networks that threaten the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4002. SENSE OF SENATE ON NEED FOR A NEW DIRECTION IN \n                   IRAQ POLICY AND IN THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP OF \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces of the United States have served \n     honorably and courageously in Iraq, with more than 2,600 \n     brave Americans having made the ultimate sacrifice and more \n     than 20,000 wounded.\n       (2) The current ``stay the course'' policy in Iraq has made \n     America less secure, reduced the readiness of our troops, and \n     burdened America's taxpayers with more than $300,000,000,000 \n     in additional debt.\n       (3) With weekly attacks against American and Iraqi troops \n     at their highest levels since the start of the war, and \n     sectarian violence intensifying, it is clear that staying the \n     course in Iraq is not a strategy for success.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) our troops deserve, and the American people expect, the \n     George W.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 4102.

which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n       Whereas the Darfur Peace Agreement, signed on May 5, 2006, \n     between the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur has not \n     resulted in a cessation of hostilities in Darfur;\n       Whereas, although the United Nations Security Council \n     approved Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), which \n     provides for a United Nations peacekeeping presence in Darfur \n     to replace the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), the \n     Government of Sudan has rejected the deployment of United \n     Nations peacekeepers;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan is engaged in a major \n     offensive in Darfur, in direct violation of the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas violence in the Darfur region has increased since \n     the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement;\n       Whereas Jan Egeland, the United Nations Under-Secretary \n     General for Humanitarian Affairs, has stated that the coming \n     weeks may result in a ``man-made catastrophe of an \n     unprecedented scale'' in Darfur;\n       Whereas the African Union has decided to terminate the \n     African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) at the end of September \n     2006;\n       Whereas it is unlikely that the United Nations will have \n     the logistical means or capability to deploy peacekeepers to \n     Sudan until the end of 2006;\n       Whereas the people of Darfur cannot wait that long for \n     security to be re-established; and\n       Whereas the international community must renew its efforts \n     to stop genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in \n     Darfur:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly condemns--\n       (A) the current military offensive of the Government of \n     Sudan in Darfur in violation of the terms of the May 5, 2006, \n     Darfur Peace Agreement and the April 8, 2004, N'Djamena \n     cease-fire accord; and\n       (B) the rejection by the Government of Sudan of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006);\n       (2) commends the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) for \n     its actions to date in monitoring the April 8, 2004, \n     N'Djamena cease-fire agreement in Darfur and encourages the \n     African Union to leave the AMIS force in place until a United \n     Nations peacekeeping mission is deployed to Darfur;\n       (3) calls upon the Government of Sudan to immediately--\n       (A) cease its military offensive in Darfur; and\n       (B) comply with the deployment of United Nations \n     peacekeepers to Darfurt called for by the United Nations \n     Security Council;\n       (4) calls upon the United Nations--\n       (A) to deploy as quickly as practicable peacekeeping troops \n     as authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706 (2006) that are well trained and equipped; and\n       (B) to begin considerations of sanctions as called for by \n     paragraphs 6 and 7 of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1556 (2004) and paragraph 14 of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004);\n       (5) urges the President to take urgent steps to help \n     improve the security situation in Darfur, including by--\n       (A) pursuing the imposition of a ``no-fly zone'' in Darfur \n     in cooperation with the United Nations, NATO, or NATO allies;\n       (B) garnering support for NATO assistance with the handover \n     by the African Union of the AMIS mission to the United \n     Nations;\n       (C) working through diplomatic channels to obtain the \n     support of China, Russia, and United States allies in the \n     Arab League in securing the compliance of the Government of \n     Sudan with the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers as \n     provided by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 \n     (2006);\n       (D) supporting full funding for the United Nations \n     Peacekeeping Mission in Sudan;\n       (E) securing the necessary support from United Nations \n     member states to schedule a special session on Sudan in the \n     United Nations Human Rights Council; and\n       (F) appointing a Special Envoy to Sudan to head the Office \n     of the Presidential Special Envoy established pursuant to \n     chapter 6 of title I of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n     Hurricane Recovery, 2006 (Public Law 109-234; 120 Stat. 439); \n     and\n       (6) urges the international community--\n       (A) to support the deployment of United Nations \n     peacekeepers to Darfur financially, with logistical and \n     equipment support, or through troop contributions;\n       (B) to fulfill financial obligations to United Nations and \n     international humanitarian aid agencies for responding to \n     thepiis in Darfur or addressing humanitarian needs throughout \n     Sudan;\n       (C) to impose targeted sanctions against members of the \n     National Congress Party determined to be responsible for \n     human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against \n     humanity; and\n       (D) to impose sanctions consistent with paragraphs 6 and 7 \n     of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004) and \n     paragraph 14 of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1564 (2004)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution along \nwith my colleague Senator DeWine urging the President to take immediate \naction to avert a looming tragedy in Darfur, Sudan. The government of \nSudan has launched an all-out military offensive in Darfur that could \nresult in hundreds of thousands of additional deaths. The United States \nmust lead the international community to save those lives. It is urgent \nthat we act.\n  How did we arrive at such a situation? And what must we do to stop \nit?\n  Over the past two years the situation in Sudan has remained dire. As \nmany as 400,000 people may be dead. Two million people have been \ndisplaced from their homes, over 200,000 are refugees in Chad, and \nthree million rely on international aid. Those numbers haven't \ndiminished over time, they have gotten worse. And now, they may be on \nthe brink of becoming even more catastrophic.\n  In May of this year, the government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur--\nspecifically the Minni Minnawi faction of the Sudan Liberation Army, \nSLA,--signed a peace agreement. Rather than improving the security \nsituation, the Darfur Peace Agreement has made things worse. The \nagreement never had the support of the entire SLA, or the other major \nrebel movement in Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement. Nor did it \nhave the support of people living in displaced camps in Darfur. In the \ndays and weeks after news of the agreement spread, violence in camps \nincreased either because people misunderstood what was in the \nagreement, or they felt the agreement was flawed. And violence on the \nground became worse, as the rebel factions split and fighting erupted \nbetween those who had signed the Darfur Peace Agreement and those who \nhad not.\n  Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in fighting since \nMay--fifty thousand in the last two months alone. Many of them have \ntaken refuge in camps for the internally displaced. Attacks on \nhumanitarian aid convoys have increased by a factor of more than ten \ncompared to this time last year. Twelve humanitarian workers have been \nkilled in the past four months--more than during the previous year. Two \nhundred internally displaced women have been raped and another two \nhundred violently assaulted in over the course of the past five weeks.\n  The United Nations, after months of delay, finally extended the \nmandate of the U.N. Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) to Darfur at the end of \nAugust. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1706 authorizes the deployment \nof over 17,000 peace keepers and 3000 civilian police to Darfur. \nRegrettably, however, the government of Sudan has rejected the \ndeployment of the U.N. force, instead launching a military offensive in \nDarfur. African Union officials have stated that they will not extend \nthe mission in Sudan past the end of this month. And even if the \naforementioned impediments did not exist, it would be months before a \nU.N. mission could fully deploy.\n  Just to make absolutely sure a peacekeeping force is never deployed, \nthe government of Khartoum has gone on the offensive. If it scorches \nenough earth--and people--there will be no need for the peacekeeping \nforce because there will be no one left to protect and no peace to \nkeep.\n  We are at a pivotal moment. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are in \ncamps, vulnerable to aerial and ground attacks from government forces. \nWe cannot stand by and do nothing.\n  This resolution is straightforward. It calls on the President to \nundertake three key actions, some of which the Senate has asked him to \ndo before: First, it once again calls on him to pursue the imposition \nof a no-fly zone through the U.N., NATO or NATO allies. The Senate \nasked the President to propose that NATO consider how to implement and \nenforce such a no-fly zone in March of this year. If anything, the need \nto enforce a no-fly zone has increased.\n  Second, it asks that the President secure the necessary support from \nUnited Nations member states to schedule a special session on Sudan in \nthe United Nations Human Rights Council. The international community \nmust speak out on the atrocities which continue to unfold in Sudan--and \nit must act.\n  Third, it asks the President to appoint a Special Envoy to Sudan to \nhead the office that Senator DeWine and I\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\nestablished at the State Department through a provision in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that was signed into law in June. The \nadministration has avoided doing so for years, and our diplomatic \nefforts have suffered as a result.\n  I'm under no illusion that these actions alone will stop the Sudanese \ngovernment. The international community must put a credible force on \nthe ground as soon as possible. NATO should be prepared to help the \nAMIS hand-off to the United Nations. It is imperative that the \nPresident pick up the phone and talk to our NATO allies about how to do \nthat. He should also call the president of the African Union and the \nU.N. Secretary General about going to Khartoum to talk to President \nBashir about his government's rejection of the U.N. Security Council \nresolution. And the Secretary of State must get involved in diplomatic \nefforts to convince the Sudanese to cooperate with the implementation \nof Security Council resolution. I understand that Assistant Secretary \nof State Frazer was sent to Khartoum over the Labor Day weekend. She \nmet with President Bashir, but according to all reports, the meeting \ndid not result in any change in Khartoum's posture towards the \ndeployment of U.N. troops. I applaud the administration for sending Dr. \nFrazer. But with all due respect I think we need to be engaged at \nhigher levels.\n  It has been 12 years since the international community watched nearly \na million people get killed in Rwanda, and 11 years since the world \nstood by as the massacres in Srebrenica occurred. Since then, President \nClinton took decisive action to stop ethnic cleansing act in Bosnia, \nand then in Kosovo.

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall require the disclosure of \n     classified information.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, S. 2590, that \nI have brought before the Senate this evening. This is a simple bill, \nyet a profound bill, designed to simply shine more sunlight, shine that \nlight that we all know is so necessary, on Federal spending. I am \nabsolutely convinced that this bill will go a long way in ultimately \nreflecting greater fiscal discipline and greater accountability.\n  This is a simple bill but profound, profound in the sense of what it \nrequires. One way to think of the bill is that it will create, for the \nvery first time in the Executive Office of the President, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the equivalent of a Google search engine for all \nAmericans to see how their Federal tax dollars are being expended. That \nis the simplicity of it all.\n  I congratulate my colleagues, Senators Coburn and Obama--I just \ntalked to Senator Coburn on the phone--who are the original sponsors of \nthis very important, commonsense piece of legislation. I do \ncongratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, Senators Collins and Lieberman, for \ntheir expeditious consideration and reporting of this legislation.\n  Once this bill is enacted, taxpayers will have the ability to know \nexactly how their money is being spent and, with that greater \ntransparency, will come greater accountability.\n  The bill expands upon E-Government management tools that were enacted \nin 2002 by making all Federal funding awards, grants, contracts and \nloans, easily searchable on a public Web site. Only transactions under \n$25,000 would be exempt from this reporting requirement, as well as \nawards that are classified for national security purposes.\n  This new tool will be a valuable asset in the continuing effort to \nspend the taxpayers' dollars wisely, without waste and without misuse.\n  Again, congratulations to Senators Coburn and Obama for their \nuntiring work on this bill. It is my honor to join them as an original \ncosponsor of this simple, commonsense but important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud to support S. 2590, the \nFederal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. This important \nlegislation requires the Office of Management and Budget to create an \nonline searchable Web site to allow Americans to understand who is \ngetting Federal money.\n  This legislation has broad support from across the political \nspectrum. Whether we believe we spend too much or we should be doing \nmore to help people in need, we can all agree that we ought to get \nvalue from the dollars we spend. Transparency is the first step in that \nprocess.\n  I believe that S. 2590 is only the first step. I am excited that \nSenators Coburn and Obama have endorsed the concept of creating a \nsimilar database for targeted tax benefits that go to companies or \nindustries who are adept enough at Washington politics to get them \nenacted.\n  Like the spending to be disclosed in S. 2590, many targeted tax \nbreaks are good policy. But the American people deserve to know who is \npaying less in taxes and causing them to pay more. They have a right to \nknow who is getting benefits from Congress.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to have a bill, hold \nhearings, bring the bill to the floor, and make information on tax \nbenefits public and easily accessible.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senators Barack Obama, Tom Carper, John \nMcCain, and I earlier this year introduced S. 2590, the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act of 2006, to bring increased \ntransparency to the way the Federal Government spends taxpayer money. \nTransparency means allowing citizens to access accurate information on \nFederal spending decisions in a timely fashion for the purpose of \nkeeping their elected officials accountable. Outside of protecting \nnational security and individual privacy, there is no reason why the \noperations of all Federal agencies should not be widely known by as \nmany as would like to know. It is because this belief is widely shared \nby the American people as well as many in this body that S. 2590 has \ngained the cosponsorship of dozens of Senators.\n  I believe, though, that transparency in Government decisionmaking \nshould not be limited simply to spending, but should also be extended \nto the decisions Congress makes about the Tax Code. The Tax Code is \ncurrently tens of thousands of pages in length and far too confusing \nfor even IRS customer service agents to understand, let alone the \naverage citizen with far less expertise. Because I believe that \ntransparency is one of the best tools we have to curb wasteful \nbehavior, I look forward working with Senator Frank Lautenberg to \ndevelop bipartisan legislation like S. 2590 that will bring increased \ntransparency to the Tax Code by allowing the American public to \nunderstand the real world effects of the Tax Code. Tax Code matters are \nextremely complex and the American public has a right to know how the \nTax Code affects them. American taxpayers also deserve to know if they \nare paying higher taxes in order to offset the loss of revenue due to \nspecial treatment for special interest groups. This is a complex issue \nthat will require careful study. It is my intention to address this \nissue in a future hearing of the Subcommittee on Federal Financial \nManagement, Government Information, and International Security. I \nbelieve that a hearing addressing this issue will help us all to better \nunderstand the ultimate effects of targeted tax expenditures. Further \nstudy will also help to inform us on how to fully address the issue of \ngreater transparency.\n\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg for his attention to this issue and I look \nforward to working with him and Senator Obama to promote increased \nGovernment transparency. As Thomas Jefferson wrote back in 1802, ``We \nmight hope to see the finances of the Union as clear and intelligible \nas a merchant's books, so that every member of Congress and every man \nof any mind in the Union should be able to comprehend them, to \ninvestigate abuses, and consequently to control them.''\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues from \nNew Jersey and Oklahoma. It has been a pleasure to work with them on \nimportant legislation to improve Federal financial transparency and \naccountability. The American people have a right to know how Federal \nresources are being used. Congress and the President should make it as \neasy as possible for taxpayers to see how well we are doing our jobs as \nstewards of Federal revenues and administrators of Federal spending. \nAll of us should have adequate tools to monitor and evaluate how \ndepartments and agencies are performing their important functions. The \nWeb site our legislation calls for will be an important tool in \nreducing wasteful earmarks and unjustified pork barrel spending. \nTransparency of spending is an important step in improving \naccountability and performance.\n  I agree with Senators  Lautenberg and Coburn that we also need \ntransparency in Federal tax policy. The same way taxpayers should be \nable to see which companies and organizations receive Federal grants or \ncontracts or other forms of financial assistance, Americans should be \nable to see which companies and organizations are receiving narrowly \ntargeted tax credits and deductions. A tax break for one taxpayer often \nmeans higher taxes for everybody else. It is our duty to make sure that \ntax breaks that only benefit a few taxpayers at the expense of \neverybody else are legitimate and appropriate. I have no doubt that \ngreater transparency of targeted tax benefits can help us simplify and \nimprove the fairness of the Federal Tax Code.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to develop bipartisan legislation \nto address this issue, and I thank my colleagues for their wonderful \nleadership.\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will continue to work on the \nport security bill, which we began tonight. As I announced earlier in \nthe evening, there will not be any rollcall votes tomorrow or on \nMonday. That being said, the managers will be here and we do hope to \nmove forward with this bill and have amendments offered. Opening \nstatements on the port security bill have begun tonight and will \ncontinue in the morning and over the course of the morning and maybe \nafternoon. I do encourage Senators with amendments to this bill to \nbegin working with the managers in order to get these amendments in the \nqueue.\n  Today, a very important bill was passed 98 to 0, the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. As we have done on the floor previously, I \nthank the chairman and ranking member, Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye, for their perseverance in passing this critical spending bill, \na bill we completed today but we began prior to the August recess.\n  We, earlier today, recognized Senator Domenici for passing a very \nsignificant milestone with 13,000 votes. As we reviewed the records, \nthere have been only seven other Senators who have met that milestone. \nHe is No. 8. As we said, there are four other Senators currently \nserving who have met that milestone, so we have a lot of competition \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  As I said earlier, and as was spoken in the tributes to him, he has \nbeen a steadfast leader, a bold leader here in the U.S. Senate, \nsomebody who--I did not say earlier today--has offered me counsel from \nday one over the last 12 years since I have been in the U.S. Senate, \ncounsel that I respect. And I have tremendous admiration for him.\n  Several of my colleagues did mention Nancy, his wife. She has been \nright at his side throughout each of his endeavors and, as he has told \nme so many times, does provide the anchor for everything he \naccomplishes. They are a great couple, a great pair, and are great \nfriends to Karyn and myself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/07/senate-section/article/S9216-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
