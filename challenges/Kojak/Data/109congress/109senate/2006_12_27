Mr. President, it has been an honor and a \nprivilege to work with Senator Bill Frist for the past 12 years. Bill \nhas been a solid leader for our party and he has served the people of \nTennessee with distinction.\n  Senator Frist came to politics through a nontraditional route--\nthrough the operating room. Bill got involved in politics because he \nbelieved he could do even more for his patients--and the people of \nTennessee--in the Senate. And he was right. Bill's meticulous approach \nto this job is exactly what you would expect of a person with his \ntraining. He never gave up on his goals and worked tirelessly to see \nthem into law.\n  I became President Pro Tempore of the Senate close to the time when \nBill became our majority leader. I enjoyed working by his side and \nthank Leader Frist for including me--as President Pro Tempore--in all \nleadership meetings. Senator Frist also traveled with us to China for \nU.S. Interparliamentary Group meetings. Once our meetings were \nfinished, he continued on to Africa for medical mission work.\n  As majority leader, Bill carried the administration's message. He \nfought hard for the President's judicial nominees. And as we saw \nyesterday during his farewell address, Bill leaves us with great honor \nand recognition. Our leader will now return to where, in some ways, his \nheart has always been--the practice of medicine. But deep in my heart, \nI feel that public service will again call Bill to give of his time and \ntalents to help preserve our democracy and our freedoms. Catherine and \nI will miss being with Bill and Karyn.\n\n\n                             rick santorum\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday I was moved by the emotional farewell of \nSenator Rick Santorum. He said he still feels the thrill of coming to \nwork in this building every day. The energy he put toward his work in \nthis Chamber, I will remember as one of Senator Santorum's most \nstriking qualities.\n  Senator Santorum's enthusiastic direction of the Republican \nconference rallied our majority. I believe he jeopardized his own \nfuture in Pennsylvania by urging us to think and act for the national \ngood. Pennsylvania has been served well during his time in Congress and \nso has our Nation.\n  Rick's energy has been of great benefit to many charities, and he has \ntaken a special interest in helping those affected by autism. His \nefforts on behalf of each of these causes have been exceptional. And \ndespite his many commitments, Rick's dedication to his family and \npersonal convictions never wavered. Catherine and I wish Rick and his \nfamily well.\n\n\n                              george Allen\n\n  Mr. President, Senator George Allen has served the Commonwealth of \nVirginia with honor and integrity. George is a principled person, \nfollowing bedrock beliefs gained growing up in a strong family.\n  These principles have led George to promote and defend freedom in \nthis country and around the world. His legislative accomplishments are \naligned with this philosophy.\n  Senator Allen's major accomplishments include the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and \nDevelopment Act, increased benefits for the families of fallen troops, \nfunding to upgrade telecommunications infrastructure for minority-\nserving institutions, and greater protections for intellectual \nproperty.\n  In all of this, Senator Allen has not forgotten who his real boss is: \nthe American people. He has always, and will continue, to put the \ninterests of this country above his own. That is a true mark of a \nleader, ald all Virginians can be proud to have been represented by a \nman with Senator Allen's character.\n  As many of his constituents, colleagues, and friends know, Senator \nAllen closed much of his correspondence with the words ``keep \nwinning.'' Just like his dad, a Hall of Fame coach who reached great \nheights and suffered tough losses on the gridiron, we know George won't \nlet this setback define him. We all expect him to ``keep winning'' for \nVirginia.\n  Catherine and I wish him and Susan the very best. We know we will \nhear\nN O T I C E\n\nThe Government Printing Office will publish corrections to the \nCongressional Record as a pilot program that has been authorized by \nthe U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

His loss will be \nfelt in Montana and here in the Senate. Conrad is a man of the West and \nworked hard to make sure those values were represented in the Senate.\n  Senator Burns, a marine with a background in radio and TV and as an \nauctioneer, came to the Senate in 1988. He, his wonderful wife Phyllis, \nand their family have become close friends with Catherine and me and to \nAlaska. In fact, Conrad's daughter, Dr. Keely Burns, spent time in \nAlaska after medical school working as a resident. Conrad is a great \nauctioneer and fine fisherman who often joined me in Alaska.\n  Conrad served with me on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee as well as the Committee on Appropriations. During his time \non those committees he accomplished a great deal for Montana, the West, \nand our Nation.\n  Conrad worked to ensure more than 70 rural Montana communities have \nenforceable safe drinking water programs and protected the Big Sky \nthrough the Land and Water Conservation Fund. He authored section 706 \nof the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a provision which ensures \nadvanced telecommunications are accessible in our schools and \nclassrooms. And as chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, he helped to secure funding for the Bureau of Land \nManagement to expedite land conveyances in Alaska, which my State has \npushed for since statehood. He worked hard to bring infrastructure and \nhigh tech to rural Montana. He worked to create E-911 legislation for \nthe Nation.\n  Conrad Burns is a hard worker, but he has an easy going way about \nhim. Many Senators and staff know that he used to pick up carpoolers on \nhis way to work. Few probably know about his protecting penguins in \nAntarctica. During a trip to our research station, there was a group of \nus watching penguins shuffling nervously near the water's edge. Conrad \ngot the group together to pose for a photo, when suddenly all of the \npenguins jumped between us and the edge of the water. Conrad just \nsmiled and took the photo, never mentioning the large killer whale that \nwas circling behind the Senators.\n  Conrad's humor is legendary and he can often spring it on you when \nyou least expect it. As President pro tempore, I opened the Senate on \nmy 80th birthday, dreading any birthday greetings I might receive. The \nfirst Member seeking recognition after the prayer was Conrad. Sure \nenough, Conrad launched into a long speech about a great American icon, \na fighter, a scrappy character. I got more and more uncomfortable in \nthe chair, but Conrad knew something I didn't--Mickey Mouse and I share \na birthday. Conrad knew I would think all this high-minded talk was \nabout me, but instead he was praising America's most lovable cartoon \ncharacter. That's Conrad Burns. A man who loves to laugh, loves people, \nand loves his home state of Montana.\n  We will miss the good Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                              mike dewine\n\n  Mr. President, I will always remember Senator Mike DeWine for his \ncommitment to his family. Mike pursued his own conscience until the end \nof his tenure in this Chamber. That conscience led Mike DeWine to be a \nstaunch defender for the people of Haiti.\n  In a time of constant conversation about the importance of family \nvalues and community standards, Mike has led by example. As a member of \na large family, the father of six, and grandfather of eleven, I admire \nMike's ability to balance the needs of his family with the demands of \nhis position in the Senate.\n  The senior Senator from Ohio has also devoted much of his time and \nenergy to causes often overlooked. Senator DeWine's tireless work for \nthe people of Haiti demonstrated his commitment. I believe his \ncommitment to those who need a defender and protector should be \ncommended.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Jim Talent has served the people of Missouri \nwith great distinction. He is a hard worker, and while he never sought \nthe spotlight, Jim quickly earned the respect of his colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  It has been my privilege to work with Jim on a number of issues. He \nunderstood the threat methamphetamines pose to our Nation and helped \nestablish the Senate's anti-meth caucus to fight this epidemic.\n  Jim has also been a determined leader on defense and energy issues. \nWe worked together to secure the funding required to modernize the \nDepartment of Defense and sought to ensure our troops have the \nresources they need. Jim, also, understands the importance of \ndiversifying our energy resources. His leadership on renewable energy \ngreatly benefited his constituents and the rest of our Nation.\n  We will all miss Senator Talent's intelligence and knowledge of the \nissues. I wish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. President, I have known Senator Lincoln Chafee and his family for \na long time. I met his father, our former colleague, Senator John \nChafee, while standing in line to register for Harvard Law School in \n1947. Lincoln's uncle, Zachariah Chafee, was one of my law professors \nat Harvard. John and I served together in the Senate for more than 20 \nyears.\n  When John passed away in 1999, Lincoln chose to continue his family's \ntradition of excellence in public service. Senator Chafee and I have \nnot always agreed on the issues, but I have always respected the \ncourage of his convictions and his firm commitment to his ideals.\n  Senator Chafee, it's been my good fortune to serve alongside you and \nyour father for nearly 30 years. It's hard to imagine this Chamber \nwithout a member of your family. We will miss your spirit and \ndedication.\n\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Mr. President, I've come to the floor to pay tribute to Senator Paul \nSarbanes for his outstanding service. The senior Senator from Maryland \nhas served longer than any other Senator from his State. Throughout the \nyears, I have been jealous of one thing--his short ride home. There \nare, actually, other things I admire about Paul. For instance, we are a \nChamber with many lawyers, and I can say Paul has been one of our best.\n  Senator Sarbanes has used his skill to greatly benefit his State. We \nrecently worked together on a bill that will enhance the security of \nour Nation's ports. As a Senator, Paul Sarbanes has worked tirelessly \nto ensure the ports in his home State, and all ports in America, are \nsafe.\n  This distinguished gentleman from Maryland has served his \nconstituents admirably and I wish him well.\n\n\n                              jim jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Jim Jeffords' service has been unique but no \ndoubt beneficial to his home State of Vermont and to our country. On \nMay 21, 2001, Senator Jeffords pursued his conscience and made a \ndifficult decision to leave our party. While unexpected, I respect \nSenator Jeffords for following his heart and doing what he thought was \nbest for his constituents in Vermont.\n  Jim has now served three full terms in the Senate. Over the years, he \nhas stood out as a champion for education and the disabled. In 2004, he \nco-authored the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. His work \nhere has helped improve millions of lives.\n  I wish the distinguished gentleman from Vermont well in his future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Mark Dayton's path to the Senate was marked by \nyears spent in service to others. As a teacher, a counselor to troubled \nchildren, and then as an administrator of a Boston social service \nagency, Mark has long fought for those less fortunate--and his service \nin the Senate reflects this commitment.\n  It was my pleasure to travel to China with him this past August for \nmeetings with the U.S.-China Interparliamentary Group. He was a fine \naddition to our bipartisan delegation. During those meetings he brought \na unique insight and perspective to many issues.\n  I commend Senator Mark Dayton on his public service to the people of \nMinnesota. Catherine and I wish him the best in the years \nahead.\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\n                       tribute to senator chafee\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Lincoln Chafee came to the Senate \nin 1999 under the most difficult of circumstances. He had just lost his \nbeloved father, and was being asked to fill the shoes of one of the \nmost noble and principled Members ever to serve in this Chamber. He \nrose to that challenge, and I have been honored to work alongside him.\n  Like the illustrious Senator John Chafee, Senator Lincoln Chafee came \nfrom a political tradition I am proud to share--that of the New England \nmoderate. This tradition stands for a strong defense of freedom and for \nfiscal responsibility, for government that is unobtrusive in people's \nlives when it can be, yet compassionate and involved when it must be.\n  Lincoln Chafee was a quiet voice of moderation, but spoke with a \nstrong voice, a voice of conviction and integrity, on such issues of \ncritical importance to our Nation as environmental protection and \nenergy independence. When, in the spring of 2005, the very fabric of \nthe Senate was threatened by a bitter impasse over the issue of \njudicial filibusters, I was proud to join Senator Chafee in the so-\ncalled gang of 14 that forged a productive, bipartisan solution.\n  I had the opportunity to work closely with Linc in the 109th Congress \nwhen he joined the Homeland Security Committee. The committee brought \nabout great progress during that Congress with successful legislation \non port security, chemical security, and rebuilding our Nation's \nemergency management structure after the catastrophic government \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. Linc's steady, thoughtful, and informed \napproach to the issues greatly aided these endeavors.\n  I was especially impressed by Linc's understanding that true homeland \nsecurity begins at home. As the 2006 hurricane season approached, and \nas we were still struggling to overcome the failures of government in \nthe 2005 season, he called for and organized a Homeland Security field \nhearing in Rhode Island so his colleagues could better appreciate the \ndaunting challenges faced by our first responders in coastal States and \ncommunities. That hands-on approach, devoid of pretense and directed \ntoward results, exemplifies Lincoln Chafee's approach to government.\n  I know that the father would be proud of the son. And I know that all \nAmericans join me in thanking Lincoln Chafee for 7 years of outstanding \nservice, and in wishing him the very best in the years to come.\n\n\n                        tribute to senator frist\n\n  Mr. President, As we come to the close of a Congress that has seen \ntoo much partisan struggle, it has been heartening to observe the \nbipartisan outpouring of deep respect and kind regard for the retiring \nsenior Senator from Tennessee, Doctor Bill Frist.\n  I join in that praise. Senator Frist has exemplified the collegial \ntraditions of the Senate, balancing forthright advocacy for his views \nand for his party's positions with courtesy and respect for those who \ndisagreed with him. He has been an effective Senator for his beloved \nState of Tennessee, a skillful leader for his party caucus, and a \ngentleman in his dealings with Senate colleagues.\n  We all know that many of our fellow citizens are cynical about \nCongress, seeing this branch of government as a haven for politicians \nfixated on short-term political advantage and personal aggrandizement. \nThey should take note of people like Senator Frist, who is truly an \nexample of a Renaissance man in government.\n  If a writer created a protagonist with the interests and \naccomplishments that Senator Frist has shown, an editor would be \nnervous about taxing readers' credulity. Yet the facts are plain. Our \nfriend from Tennessee is not only a hard-working and successful \npolitical leader, but also a surgeon, a teacher, a philanthropist, an \nauthor, an aircraft pilot, a marathon runner, and a devoted family man.\n  Members of Congress have many opportunities to enact measures that \nwill protect, enrich, and save lives. But we usually act at a distance, \nas agencies use the authorities and carry out the mandates we create. \nFew of us can take credit for personally saving lives as Doctor Frist \nhas done many times at the operating table. And few of us can bring to \nbear the combination of professional training and personal dedication \nthat he has displayed on his repeated medical missions to Africa and in \nhis policy work on the HIV-AIDS crisis. He was also the first doctor on \nthe spot for the 1998 shootings of two Capitol Police officers, and he \nably served as an informed spokesman for Congress during the 2001 \nanthrax attacks in the Capitol mail system.\n  Senator Frist has served his party well. As chair of the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee in 2002, he helped restore the party's \nmajority in the Senate. As the unanimously elected majority leader, he \nserved both his party and his country well on policy matters like tax-\nlaw changes that eased burdens on citizens and encouraged growth in \nbusiness activity and employment.\n  Senator Frist also supported the Medicare prescription-drug benefit \nand the creation of Health Savings Accounts--measures that have saved \nbillions of dollars for the elderly and given millions of Americans new \nopportunities for controlling their health-care costs. These are \nespecially helpful legislative initiatives in States like my native \nMaine, where the proportions of senior citizens, small-business owners, \nand the self-employed are significant.\n  Senator Frist leaves this chamber with an overflowing and bipartisan \nstore of goodwill and gratitude. I am pleased to be among the many \nSenators offering thanks for his years of service and best wishes for \nmany years of good works to come.\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SANTORUM\n\n  Mr. President. In his eloquent and touching farewell address \ndelivered to this body on December 6, 2006, Senator Rick Santorum began \nwith one word to describe his feelings as he concluded this phase of \nhis life. The word was ``gratitude,'' and it describes the feeling I \nhave for his 12 years of outstanding service here.\n  Rick Santorum is a person of strong convictions--convictions that are \nbuilt upon a solid foundation of faith, love of country, and devotion \nto the people of Pennsylvania. But as he stood firm for his political \nphilosophy, Rick Santorum recognized the obligation we all share to \novercome our differences to work on behalf of our citizens. He spoke \nhis mind, but he acted from his heart.\n  Two issues in particular exemplify Rick's dedication to meeting the \nreal needs of real people. Like Maine, Pennsylvania is a large rural \nState in which access to home health care services is essential for our \nolder and disabled Americans. Home health has become an increasingly \nimportant part of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled, \nand often technically complex, services that our Nation's home health \ncaregivers provide have enabled millions of our most frail and \nvulnerable citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just \nwhere they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  When Medicare payments for home health care were in jeopardy, Rick \nSantorum joined me as an original cosponsor of bipartisan legislation \nto restore funding, and he was a key to its success. Throughout his \nSenate career, he has been a compassionate champion of quality health \ncare for those in need. It is telling that his Senate career, which \nincluded so much valuable work in this area, ended with passage of his \nlandmark bipartisan Combating Autism Act, which will do much to improve \nthe quality of life for children with autism and their families.\n  The second issue I would like to highlight is education. Rick \nSantorum has been a leader in making our schools safer, and in \nstrengthening math and science education. But he also understands that \nquality education begins not in Washington or in the State capitals, \nbut in the classroom. From my talks with teachers throughout Maine, I \nknow that a great many of them expend not just great amounts of energy \nto educate our children, but often dig deep into their own pockets to \nbuy classroom supplies and to advance their own professional \ndevelopment. The $250 tax deduction I authored in 2001 for educators \nwho use their own funds to cover these expenses would not have become \nlaw without the strong advocacy of Rick Santorum with his former \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives.\n  And, finally, when the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee held hearings in early\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\n2006 in response to the lobbying scandals in Washington, one of our \nfirst witnesses was Rick Santorum, a long-time advocate of lobbying \nreform. When our reform legislation passed our Chamber overwhelmingly, \nSenator Santorum said the Senate ``stepped up in a big way.'' The \nSenate stepped up in large part because this person of high ideals was \npushing it along.\n  Mr. President, in his farewell address, Senator Santorum stated that \nalthough he often disagreed--often vigorously--with many of his Senate \ncolleagues on the issues, he never doubted the sincerity of their \nconvictions. Staunch advocacy tempered with respect for the views of \nothers is the hallmark of the Senate, and it is a central part of Rick \nSantorum's legacy. I thank him for his service, and wish him and his \nfamily all the best in the future.\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TALENT\n\n  Mr. President. As the 109th Congress draws to a close, I want to say \nthanks and farewell to one of its hardest-working and most dedicated \nmembers, Senator Jim Talent of Missouri.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Talent as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee and its Seapower Subcommittee, which he \nhas chaired.\n  Working with Senator Talent has always been rewarding. He has been a \nprodigious Senator and brings to bear on defense issues both detailed \nknowledge and long-range vision. His final speech on the floor of the \nSenate displayed those qualities, as he surveyed the state of readiness \nand equipment in our national defense, and persuasively warned of the \ndangers of under-investment in personnel and material.\n  Senator Talent's focus on seapower issues may seem to go against \ntype. Missouri does not spring readily to mind in a word-association \ntest for ``Navy'' or ``shipbuilding,'' as Maine or Mississippi might. \nBut the Senator from Missouri has been as dedicated to working through \nseapower issues as any coastal Senator.\n  Senator Talent was a key player in settling on a dual-lead shipyard \nstrategy for the Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyers, formerly known as \nthe DD(X). As a Senator from a shipbuilding State, I am naturally well \npleased with this policy. But as a United States Senator, I also share \nSenator Talent's conviction that it is a wise national strategy to \npreserve shipbuilding capabilities in multiple locations. He has also \nbeen a leading voice in deliberations on the CGX ship class that will \nconstitute our next generation of guided-missile cruisers.\n  Senator Talent brought extraordinary intellectual gifts to the \nSenate. After distinguishing himself in undergraduate work at \nWashington University and in legal studies at the University of \nChicago, he clerked for Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit and \ntaught at the Washington University School of Law.\n  His academic prowess was reinforced with practical political \nexperience. After winning a seat against long odds in the Missouri \nlegislature, he established himself as a popular and respected \npolitical figure. Moving on to the U.S. House, he was an early and \ninfluential voice in the debate that ultimately led to a fundamental \nreform of Federal welfare law. This combined 16 years of legislative \nservice served him well when he took his seat in the Senate.\n  Besides his dedication to chairing the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator \nTalent has been a leading advocate for promoting alternative energy, \nfor helping small businesses form associations to buy health insurance, \nand for expanding the Federal fight against sickle-cell blood disease. \nTo these and other issues he brings a powerful combination of \nintellect, research, deliberation, and collegiality.\n  In November, Senator Talent lost a close contest for reelection in a \ndifficult campaign year. We cannot quarrel with the decision of the \nvoters, but we can respectfully regret that the Senate will lose the \nbenefit of Jim Talent's wise and gentlemanly presence. I join my \ncolleagues in wishing him and his family well, and in expecting many \nmore contributions to the public good from this man of many gifts and \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/27/senate-section/article/S11854-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11854-S11855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       VETERANS BENEFITS, HEALTHCARE, AND INFORMATION ACT OF 2006\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to support our veterans, \ncurrent servicemembers, and their families by supporting S. 3421, an \nomnibus veterans measure entitled Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and \nInformation Technology Act of 2006.\n  This measure is a compromise agreement between the House Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs and the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and is \nbased on several pieces of legislation. Like all compromises, no one \ngot all he or she wanted, but in the end, I believe that it represents \na good package of provisions. This legislation would improve and expand \na wide variety of services to our veterans, and includes provisions \nrelating to veterans benefits, health care, and information technology \nmatters for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Of particular \nimportance are provisions to enhance mental health and readjustment \nservices for veterans returning to civilian life, to improve long-term \ncare services for aging veterans, and to modify the State veterans' \nhome program.\n  At the outset, I note my dissatisfaction with the undue haste with \nwhich the legislative package, the bill itself and the accompanying \nexplanatory statement that my colleague, the committee chairman, \nSenator Craig, will include at the end of his remarks, was assembled.\n  Because of the way this legislation was negotiated, we were not able \nto reach final agreement on its contents until Wednesday morning, just \ntwo days ago. At that time, the chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee for the first time agreed to negotiate on a particular \nprovision passed by the House relating to a construction project in \nSouth Carolina. As a consequence of his belated agreement to enter into \ndiscussions, we were able to arrive at a compromise, a result that we \ncould have achieved in September.\n  Because the final agreement was reached so late in the session, staff \nof the two committees and from the two Offices of Legislative Counsel, \nworked many long hours trying to accomplish the nearly impossible task \nof assembling the bill, which is over 160 pages, and then drafting an \nexplanatory statement on the legislation.\n  In the best of times, such a process can easily take a week or more. \nWe were forced to try to do it all in just 2 days. It is near certainty \nthat this haste has led to the inclusion of errors in both the \nlegislation and the explanatory statement, errors which could have been \ncaught and remedied had there been sufficient time. This is certainly \nno way to do our business and, to the extent it will be in our power, \nwe will not legislate this way in the future.\n  That said, the bill is now before the Senate, and I will touch on \nsome of the key provisions.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has been tasked with meeting the \nneeds of those who serve in the military, with a particular emphasis on \nthose injured during their service. A number of provisions in the \ncompromise agreement are intended to help VA fulfill that obligation.\n  Often, the types of injuries endured in combat are invisible in \nnature. We must make sure that returning servicemembers receive the \nreadjustment and mental health care services they need for a seamless \nreintegration to civilian life. Provisions in the compromise agreement \nseek to do just that by establishing VA systemwide guidelines for \nscreening primary care patients for potential mental health issues, as \nwell as appropriately training clinicians to carry out mental health \nconsultations. Identifying the need for assistance is the first step; \nthis measure also provides for the next step by ensuring that VA has \nthe capacity to furnish mental health services at every VA community-\nbased outpatient clinic.\n  Because veterans often seek readjustment counseling and other mental \nhealth care in their own communities, it is imperative that VA's \nveterans centers are able to provide needed services. The compromise \nagreement contains provisions, derived from S. 716, legislation I \nintroduced which cleared the Senate nearly a year ago, which would \nauthorize resources needed by\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nveterans centers to carry out their long standing mission of helping \nveterans. These provisions would also help ensure that VA has \nsufficiently trained outreach workers to encourage veterans to seek \nassistance. Veterans centers provide veterans with a safe place to turn \nfor readjustment counseling or assistance; they make over 100,000 \nreferrals a year for benefits and VA medical services. In addition to \nproviding counseling services to veterans, family members too can find \nsolace at veterans centers. This legislation would clarify that parents \nof those servicemembers who have died would be eligible to receive \nbereavement counseling at veterans centers.\n  The compromise agreement also addresses the goal of encouraging and \nsupporting alternatives to institutional long-term care. It includes \nprovisions derived from S. 2753, a bill I introduced, that was designed \nto promote assistance to those who look after veterans, especially in \nnoninstitutional, home-based settings. The relevant provision in the \ncompromise agreement would authorize VA to carry out a pilot program to \nassist family members who care for their disabled loved ones. \nCaregivers, particularly those who live in rural and geographically \nremote areas, would receive a helping hand through services such as \nadult day care and respite care.\n  Furthermore, the compromise agreement seeks to ensure more \nappropriate payment for the cost of long-term care provided to certain \nseriously disabled veterans who are receiving care in State veterans' \nhomes. In January 2006, the committee held field hearings in my home \nState of Hawaii. Tom Driskill, the president and CEO of Hawaii Health \nSystems Corporation, testified about the soon-to-be-built State home in \nHilo. He said, ``The synergy of a combined Federal and State funding of \nthe home has been the catalyst for making this dream a reality.'' The \nadjustments this legislation would make to the current cost-sharing \narrangement between VA and the States, which are derived from S. 2762, \nlegislation I introduced, will help ensure high quality care in State \nhomes not only in Hawaii, but across the entire Nation.\n\n  Currently, care is provided at no cost to the veteran when VA \nprovides institutional, long-term care services to those with service-\nconnected disabilities rated 70 percent or higher in a VA nursing home \nor a private nursing care facility with which VA contracts. However, \nwhen the care is provided in a State veterans' home, VA pays only a per \ndiem to the State, which then may bill the veteran for the remaining \ncosts. This measure would provide for the same payment to State \nveterans' homes that is provided to community nursing homes.\n  This compromise agreement also includes a provision from a bill I \nintroduced, S. 1537, that would authorize VA to designate at least two \nMultiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence and six Parkinson's Disease \nResearch, Education and Clinical Centers. VA centers of excellence have \nbeen the model of innovation in the delivery of highly specialized \nhealth care and research for chronic disease in the veteran population. \nProviding a statutory basis for these centers will ensure continued \nresearch and development of progressive treatments to help reduce \nsymptoms and improve the quality of life for veterans battling with \nthese neurological diseases. This provision is especially significant \nas it will be part of Congressman Lane Evans' legislative legacy, as \nranking member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It is \nfitting that we pay tribute to his service through this measure. I \nthank my good friend and colleague for his leadership on this issue and \nfor his service to our great Nation, as a marine and in Congress.\n  The compromise agreement includes a provision that would allow VA to \nextend its State Cemetery Grants Program to tribal organizations. This \nchange, derived from my bill, S. 2659, would allow for the \nestablishment, expansion, and improvement of veterans cemeteries on \ntrust lands. If enacted, it will enable veterans living on trust lands \nto have an option for burial much closer to their family members and \nother loved ones.\n  Another provision in the compromise would authorize VA to provide \nhome loan guarantees to veterans who want to use their home loan \neligibility to purchase stock in a cooperative housing corporation. \nUnder current law, VA is authorized to guarantee loans for eligible \nveterans and their survivors to build or buy a home, including \nresidential condominiums. In many large cities, housing cooperatives \nmake up a large percentage of available affordable housing. This \nprovision, derived originally from legislation introduced by Senator \nSchumer, would give veterans greater housing choice by allowing them to \nuse their hard-earned benefits to buy shares in a housing cooperative.\n  In response to the concerns of some individuals, the provisions in \nthe compromise agreement related to allowing veterans and other \nclaimants to hire attorneys to represent them before VA have been \nmodified from what originally passed the Senate earlier this year, so \nas to allow individuals to hire attorneys only after a notice of \ndisagreement has been filed in a case. This change should result in \nthere being no impact on the claims adjudication system until after VA \nrenders its first final decision. Currently, veterans are prohibited \nfrom retaining counsel until after the Board of Veterans' Appeals \nrenders a final decision.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that we were able to reach a compromise on \ninformation security matters. I remain committed to ensuring that VA \ntakes aggressive action to protect our veterans' personal information, \nand in the event of a data breach, that they provide the affected \nveterans with appropriate identity and credit protection services.\n  I also express my satisfaction at our success in maintaining the \nprovisions in current law which prohibit the use of appropriated VA \nhealth care funds for conducting public and private cost comparison \nstudies. This prohibition protects veterans by precluding the use of \nscarce health care dollars for other purposes and protects VA employees \nfrom efforts to privatize their duties.\n  This legislation is appropriate and needed at a time when our \nservice-members are in harm's way. We must always remember the \nsacrifices that our servicemembers, both past and present, have made on \nbehalf of this great Nation, and we must do our part to respond to \ntheir service by remaining strong in our support of veterans services.\n  I am proud that our committee continues its tradition of \nbipartisanship. The effort that produced the final version of this \nlegislation, vital to the continued provision of quality health care \nand benefits to our Nation's veterans, is just the latest example of \nthat spirit. I thank Senator Craig for his leadership and for his \ncooperation and assistance. I also thank the staff of the majority, \nespecially Bill Cahill, Jon Towers, Amanda Meredith, Helen Walker, and \nLupe Wissel, as well as those on the Democratic staff, Kim Lipsky, \nAlexandra Sardegna, Dahlia Melendrez, Ted Pusey, Michelle Moreno, and \nBill Brew for their hard work on this legislation.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nwish my warmest aloha to Senator Jim Jeffords, who is retiring after 32 \nyears in Congress. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs will be losing \none of its finest and most esteemed members. A veteran himself, Senator \nJeffords has been a strong voice and advocate for veterans. I thank \nSenator Jeffords for his service. He will truly be missed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this compromise agreement on behalf \nof America's veterans and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/27/senate-section/article/S11855-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11855-S11856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF ANTHONY J. ZAGAMI\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, a well-respected public servant \nwill soon retire after 40 years of outstanding service to our \nGovernment and the American people.\n  Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami first came to Capitol Hill in 1965, at the \nage of 13, to serve as a page in the United States Senate. Several \nyears later, Tony returned as an assistant to the Secretary of the \nSenate. I was the whip for the Republican party at the time, and in \nthis capacity, it was my privilege to work closely with Tony and the \nSecretary. Tony also spent 9 years as the general counsel to the Joint \nCommittee on Printing, which I was ranking member of from 1987 to 1992.\n  Tony left the halls of Congress in 1990 to become general counsel at \nthe U.S.\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\nGovernment Printing Office, and he has remained in this post for the \npast 16 years. Tony's legislative background has proven to be a \ntremendous asset during his tenure as general counsel. His leadership \nand vision have helped transform the GPO into a profitable, efficient, \nand thoroughly modern organization.\n  In January, Tony will retire as the longest serving general counsel \nin the GPO's 145-year history. In honor of his many accomplishments, \nTony has also been named the first general counsel emeritus of the GPO.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in Congress, I thank Tony for his \ndedication and hard work over the years. We all wish Tony, his wife, \nand their three children the very best.\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the 109th Congress comes to a \nclose, I would like to recognize a longtime public servant and Maryland \nresident. Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami will soon retire as the general \ncounsel of the U.S. Government Printing Office after more than 40 years \nof Federal service. I met Tony during my first term in the Senate while \nhe was finishing law school and working as a young intern in the Senate \nDemocratic Cloakroom. Tony went on to serve in a number of other \npositions here on Capitol Hill before leaving in 1990 to become the \ngeneral counsel for the GPO.\n  Tony Zagami began his Federal service as a page in the U.S. Senate \nduring the 1960s and will end it as the longest serving general counsel \nin GPO history. Along the way, he also earned degrees from the \nUniversity of Maryland School of Business and Public Administration and \nthe George Mason University School of Law. Tony has earned the respect \nand admiration of many of us here in the Congress as well as his \ncolleagues in other legislative branch agencies and the executive \nbranch. I know that my colleagues here in the Senate would join me in \nwishing him all the best in health and happiness as he completes a very \nlong and noteworthy career. In retirement, I'm sure that Tony will \nremain a very active citizen of Montgomery County, MD, where he resides \nwith his wife, Erin, and three children. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/27/senate-section/article/S11856-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11856-S11857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED SUBSEQUENT TO SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2005, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on December 12, 2006, subsequent to the \nsine die adjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House \nof Representatives announcing that the Speaker had signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 214.
