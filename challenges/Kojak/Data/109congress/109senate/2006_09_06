Mr. President, the remarks President Bush delivered \nyesterday\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\nabout the war against the radical Islamist terrorists was a historic \nspeech, the clearest statement to date of the nature of the struggle we \nface.\n  Probably there were two factors that entered the President's decision \nto give the remarks today: First, the fact that we will soon, next \nMonday, have the fifth anniversary of the heinous attack of September \n11 on the United States of America; second, because of the increasing \ncalls by partisans to abandon part of the conflict--namely, the Iraq \nfront--in this war.\n  It was important for the President to define who the enemy is and to \nmake it clear that the enemy is not terrorism. People in the media have \ncalled this the war on terrorism. We could have just as easily called \nthe war in the Pacific and World War II the war on kamikaze terrorism, \nas kamikaze is a suicide tactic by evil people. The war, then, was \nagainst Nazism, Fascism, the imperial Japanese, and later communism. It \nwas not against a tactic.\n  The same thing is true today. It was important for the President to \ndefine the nature of the enemy we face in order to be able to \nadequately confront that enemy. The President made a comparison with a \ncouple of the enemies in World War II. He talked about Adolph Hitler \nand the fact he was not taken seriously at first. At first, Adolph \nHitler was a crazy paper hanger. Then he was greatly underestimated. \nEventually, there were those who thought he could be appeased because \nthe world did not want to fight again, with World War I so fresh in \neveryone's mind. But he did have to be confronted.\n  And the same later with respect to communism. At first it was Uncle \nJoe Stalin who helped us win World War II. But it became clear, after \nthe Berlin blockade and his explosion of an H bomb, that communism was \na clear and present danger for the United States. Eventually, America \nunderstood, and the cold war confronted communism, eventually \nsucceeding in defeating that threat.\n  There is a big difference between the Soviets of the Communist era \nand the radical Islamists. One difference is that the Soviets could be \ndeterred. Radical Islamists are not going to be deterred. There is a \nparticular reason why. The Soviets were rational about life itself. \nRadical Islamists seek to bend us to their will, to kill us or to die \ntrying. Either way, in their view, they win.\n  I ask my colleagues: What did Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig have to do \nbefore they were released in Gaza just a couple of weeks ago? They had \nto bend to the will of Allah. They had to convert to Islam before they \nwere released. This is the goal of these radical Islamists, as the \nPresident explained--to either bend the rest of the world to their \nwill, to kill us or to die trying.\n  We will only win this war if we take the threat seriously. The sooner \nwe commit to victory, the fewer our losses will be. The best strategy \nis to take the fight to the enemy. The worst strategy is to leave in \nthe middle of a battle, for example, in Iraq. It would be difficult, if \nnot impossible, to win the war if we abdicate the battle. What ally in \nthe war will stand with us if we decide that the fight is too tough? \nHow would that help us influence the mullahs who rule in Iran?\n  I will read from parts of the President's speech to illustrate the \nclarity with which he described the nature of our enemy, the nature of \nthis conflict, and the absolute necessity that we confront it strongly \nnow in order to save future generations from the scourge of this \ncontinuing conflict.\n  The President said:\n\n       Five years after our nation was attacked, the terrorist \n     danger remains. We're a nation at war.\n\n  And he said:\n\n       . . . we've also learned a great deal about the enemy we \n     face . . .\n\n  We know what the terrorists intend to do because they've told us--and \nwe need to take their words seriously.\n  And he proceeded to describe, in the terrorists' own words, what they \nbelieve, what they hope to accomplish, and how they intend to \naccomplish it.\n  Listen to these words of the President:\n\n       The terrorists who attacked us on September 11, 2001, are \n     men without conscience--but they're not madmen. They kill in \n     the name of a clear and focused ideology, a set of beliefs \n     that are evil, but not insane. These al Qaeda terrorists and \n     those who share their ideology are violent Sunni extremists. \n     They're driven by a radical and perverted vision of Islam \n     that rejects tolerance, crushes all dissent, and justifies \n     the murder of innocent men, women, and children in the \n     pursuit of political power. They hope to establish a violent \n     political Utopia across the Middle East, which they call a \n     ``caliphate,'' where all the world would be ruled according \n     to their hateful ideology. Osama bin Laden has called the 9/\n     11 attacks--in his words--``a great step toward the unity of \n     Muslims and establishing the righteous caliphate.''\n\n  The President went on to describe that this caliphate would be a \ntotalitarian Islamic empire, and using the words of the terrorist \nZawahiri, al-Qaida second in command, declaring that al-Qaida intends \nto impose its rule ``in every land that was a home for Islam, from \nSpain to Iraq.'' And he went on to say:\n\n       The whole world is an open field for us.\n\n  The President also described what such a world would look like, \nreferring to the situation in Afghanistan before its liberation as \nexemplifying the rule of these kinds of terrorists: Under the Taliban \nand al-Qaida, Afghanistan was a nightmare, a land where women were \nimprisoned in their homes, girls could not go to school, religious \npolice roamed the streets, and women were publicly whipped. In fact, \nsummary executions were held in Kabul's soccer stadium in front of \ncheering mobs. And Afghanistan was turned into a launching pad for the \nhorrific attacks against America and other parts of the civilized \nworld.\n  The President said:\n\n       The goal of these Sunni extremists is to remake the entire \n     Muslim world in their radical image. In pursuit of their \n     imperial aims, these extremists say there can be no \n     compromise or dialogue with those they call ``infidels''. . . \n     .\n       These radicals have declared their uncompromising hostility \n     to freedom.\n\n  And the President said:\n\n       It is foolish to think that you can negotiate with them.\n\n  The President also quoted from some of the al-Qaida documents that \nillustrate the precise nature of this threat. One is the al-Qaida \ncharter that was secured by coalition forces searching a terrorist safe \nhouse. The charter states:\n\n       There will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in \n     Allah. We will not meet the enemy halfway. There will be no \n     room for dialogue with them.\n\n  The President also noted that the goal of al-Qaida is to cause \nAmericans to tire of the conflict, ``hoping that the American people \nwill grow tired of casualties and give up the fight.''\n  The President said:\n\n       And they are targeting America's financial centers and \n     economic infrastructure at home, hoping to terrorize us and \n     cause our economy to collapse.\n\n  He quoted the words of Osama bin Laden, who calls this his ``bleed-\nuntil-bankruptcy plan,'' and noted that Osama bin Laden was very \nimpressed with the relatively small investment he had to make to cause \nsuch a large amount of damage to the United States and to our economy.\n  The President also noted the enemy has a propaganda strategy. Osama \nbin Laden says al-Qaida intends to ``launch,'' in his words, ``a media \ncampaign to create a wedge between the American people and their \ngovernment.''\n  I would submit that the evidence of that campaign is there for all to \nsee.\n  The President said:\n\n       Bin Laden and his allies are absolutely convinced they can \n     succeed in forcing America to retreat and causing our \n     economic collapse. They believe our nation is weak and \n     decadent, and lacking in patience and resolve.\n\n  The President also said that ``they've made clear that the most \nimportant front in their struggle against America is Iraq--the nation \nbin Laden has declared the `capital of the caliphate.'\n  The President said:\n\n       Hear the words of bin Laden: ``I now address the whole \n     Islamic nation. Listen and understand. The most serious issue \n     today for the whole world is this Third World War that is \n     raging in Iraq.'' He calls it ``a war of destiny between \n     infidelity and Islam.'' He says, ``The whole world is \n     watching this war,'' and that it will end in ``victory and \n     glory, or misery and humiliation.''\n\n  The President noted:\n\n       For al Qaeda, Iraq is not a distraction from their war on \n     America--it is the central battlefield where the outcome of \n     this struggle will be decided.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their \n     intentions as clear as Lenin and\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\n     Hitler before them. The question is: Will we listen? Will we \n     pay attention to what these evil men say?\n\n  And then the President noted that there is a second group of these \nradical Islamists who, combined with the first, represent the axis of \nevil that we face in this war, the threat posed by Shia extremists.\n  The President said:\n\n       The Shia strain of Islamic radicalism is just as dangerous, \n     and just as hostile to America, and just as determined to \n     establish its brand of hegemony across the broader Middle \n     East. And the Shia extremists have achieved something that al \n     Qaeda has so far failed to do: In 1979, they took control of \n     a major power, the nation of Iran, subjecting its proud \n     people to a regime of tyranny, and using that nation's \n     resources to fund the spread of terror and pursue their \n     radical agenda.\n\n  Then the President went on to describe the clear aims of the Iranian \nregime: wanting to drive America out of the region, to destroy Israel, \nand to dominate the broader Middle East. Among the ways in which they \nintend to achieve their goals is by the creation and supporting of \nterrorist groups such as Hezbollah.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Just as we must take the words of the Sunni extremists \n     seriously, we must take the words of the Shia extremists \n     seriously.\n\n  He went on to quote the Hezbollah leader, the terrorist Nasrallah, \nand also the President of Iran, President Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, who \ndeclared in a speech that some people ask, and I am quoting, ``whether \na world without the United States and Zionism can be achieved. I say \nthat this goal is achievable.''\n  Everyone is aware of Ahmadi-Nejad's threats to wipe Israel off the \nface of the Earth.\n  He said:\n\n       If you do not abandon the path of falsehood, your doomed \n     destiny will be annihilation.\n\n  He delivered this message to the American people. And I am quoting:\n\n       If you would like to have good relations with the Iranian \n     nation in the future, bow down before the greatness of the \n     Iranian nation and surrender. If you don't accept to do this, \n     the Iranian nation will force you to surrender and bow down.\n\n  The language is always: Bow down. Surrender to their radical, \nperverted view of Islam.\n  And now the Iranian regime is pursuing nuclear weapons. Imagine if \nthis nation acquires nuclear weapons, a nation that sponsors terrorism \naround the world, is the chief sponsor of terrorism, according to the \nU.S. State Department. And were they to provide nuclear weaponry to \nterrorists, the result is unthinkable.\n  What the President concluded was:\n\n       The Shia and Sunni extremists represent different faces of \n     the same threat. They draw inspiration from different \n     sources, but both seek to impose a dark vision of violent \n     Islamic radicalism across the Middle East.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       And armed with nuclear weapons, they would blackmail the \n     free world, and spread their ideologies of hate, and raise a \n     mortal threat to the American people. If we allow them to do \n     this, if we retreat from Iraq, if we don't uphold our duty to \n     support those who are desirous to live in liberty, 50 years \n     from now history will look back on our time with unforgiving \n     clarity, and demand to know why we did not act.\n\n  The President then went on to reiterate the five basic elements of \nthe strategy he has discussed before. He pointed out that the enemy is \na flexible and agile enemy that adapts and changes its ways of dealing \nwith us, and that we have to do the same, and pointed out how we are \ndoing that.\n  In fact, the President said:\n\n       During the last five years we've learned a lot about this \n     enemy. We've learned that they're cunning and sophisticated. \n     We've witnessed their ability to change their methods and \n     their tactics with deadly speed--even as their murderous \n     obsessions remain unchanging.\n\n  He also noted--and I think this is important--that one of the things \nthey have accomplished over the last several years is the slaughtering \nof huge numbers of innocent Muslim men and women around the world. And \nyou have but to look at the daily casualty count in Iraq, where it is \nprimarily violence on other Muslims in Iraq that represents this \nterrible news we wake up to every morning.\n  The President said, as he has said before:\n\n       The road ahead is going to be difficult, and it will \n     require more sacrifice. Yet we can have confidence in the \n     outcome, because we've seen freedom conquer tyranny and \n     terror before.\n\n  I would say that we have a choice to make. We can understand the \nnature of this conflict and its seriousness and the required sacrifice \nnow or we can come to that realization after we have suffered far too \nmany more casualties and far too much loss in blood and treasure. \nEventually the world will join us in this struggle and we will succeed. \nBut the question is, How many have to die? How much loss has to occur \nbefore the world wakes to the nature of this threat?\n  I harken back to the days just before World War II as a good lesson \nin history to remind us that we need to take the words of these \nevildoers to heart. They just may mean what they say. History has \nproven that to be the case in the past, and recent history leaves no \ndoubt that this is what they mean today.\n  Next Monday, we will stand on the Capitol steps at 6 o'clock, as we \ndid exactly 5 years before, to demonstrate to the American people that \nthe attacks on America will not deter us from our business or our \ncommitment to protect the American people. When we do that, we need to \nmean what we say. Our ability to make good on that commitment will \ndepend, first and foremost, on our understanding of the nature of this \nthreat and our ability and willingness to confront it.\n  The President concluded his remarks with these statements. He said:\n\n       This time, we're confronting them--\n\n  Meaning the enemy--\n\n     before they gain the capacity to inflict unspeakable damage \n     on the world, and we're confronting their hateful ideology \n     before it . . . takes root.\n\n  That is the point I was making, that we have a choice today to take \nthis fight to the enemy and win rather than waiting until more damage \nhas been inflicted upon us to understand and appreciate the nature of \nthe threat.\n  The President concluded by saying:\n\n       This is the great ideological struggle of the 21st \n     century--and it is the calling of our generation. All \n     civilized nations are bound together in this struggle between \n     moderation and extremism.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the challenge which confronts us. It confronts \nus as leaders of this country, and it requires of us the discussion, \nhonestly and forthrightly, of the serious nature of this struggle. It \nwill not be won by papering over differences. It will not be won by \ndeciding that the fight is too difficult and that there are places \nwhere this struggle is occurring where we just cannot prevail. We \ncannot send a message to our enemies, let alone to our allies, that we \nare not up to the struggle, wherever it may break out.\n  The way to win this struggle is to win it. And that is the point the \nPresident was making in his remarks yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review the President's \nremarks. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the speech he \nmade yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                President Discusses Global War on Terror\n\n       The President: Thank you all very much.

The Chairman of the\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\n     Armed Services Committee, John Warner of Virginia. \n     (Applause.)\n       I thank Norb Ryan, as well, for his leadership. I do \n     appreciate all the folks that are at Walter Reed who have \n     joined us today. I'm going to tell the parents of our troops, \n     we provide great health care to those who wear the uniform. \n     I'm proud of those folks at Bethesda and Walter Reed--are \n     providing you the best possible care to help you recover from \n     your injuries. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for \n     joining us here today. May God bless you in your recovery. \n     (Applause.)\n       Next week, America will mark the fifth anniversary of \n     September the 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. As this day \n     approaches, it brings with it a flood of painful memories. We \n     remember the horror of watching planes fly into the World \n     Trade Center, and seeing the towers collapse before our eyes. \n     We remember the sight of the Pentagon, broken and in flames. \n     We remember the rescue workers who rushed into burning \n     buildings to save lives, knowing they might never emerge \n     again. We remember the brave passengers who charged the \n     cockpit of their hijacked plane, and stopped the terrorists \n     from reaching their target and killing more innocent \n     civilians. We remember the cold brutality of the enemy who \n     inflicted this harm on our country--an enemy whose leader, \n     Osama bin Laden, declared the massacre of nearly 3,000 people \n     that day--I quote--``an unparalleled and magnificent feat of \n     valor, unmatched by any in humankind before them.''\n       In five years since our nation was attacked, al Qaeda and \n     terrorists it has inspired have continued to attack across \n     the world. They've killed the innocent in Europe and Africa \n     and the Middle East, in Central Asia and the Far East, and \n     beyond. Most recently, they attempted to strike again in \n     the most ambitious plot since the attacks of September the \n     11th--a plan to blow up passenger planes headed for \n     America over the Atlantic Ocean.\n       Five years after our nation was attacked, the terrorist \n     danger remains. We're a nation at war--and America and her \n     allies are fighting this war with relentless determination \n     across the world. Together with our coalition partners, we've \n     removed terrorist sanctuaries, disrupted their finances, \n     killed and captured key operatives, broken up terrorist cells \n     in America and other nations, and stopped new attacks before \n     they're carried out. We're on the offense against the \n     terrorists on every battlefront--and we'll accept nothing \n     less than complete victory. (Applause.)\n       In the five years since our nation was attacked, we've also \n     learned a great deal about the enemy we face in this war. \n     We've learned about them through videos and audio recordings, \n     and letters and statements they've posted on websites. We've \n     learned about them from captured enemy documents that the \n     terrorists have never meant for us to see. Together, these \n     documents and statements have given us clear insight into the \n     mind of our enemies--their ideology, their ambitions, and \n     their strategy to defeat us.\n       We know what the terrorists intend to do because they've \n     told us--and we need to take their words seriously. So today \n     I'm going to describe--in the terrorists' own words, what \n     they believe... what they hope to accomplish, and how they \n     intend to accomplish it. I'll discuss how the enemy has \n     adapted in the wake of our sustained offensive against them, \n     and the threat posed by different strains of violent Islamic \n     radicalism. I'll explain the strategy we're pursuing to \n     protect America, by defeating the terrorists on the \n     battlefield, and defeating their hateful ideology in the \n     battle of ideas.\n       The terrorists who attacked us on September the 11th, 2001, \n     are men without conscience--but they're not madmen. They kill \n     in the name of a clear and focused ideology, a set of beliefs \n     that are evil, but not insane. These al Qaeda terrorists and \n     those who share their ideology are violent Sunni extremists. \n     They're driven by a radical and perverted vision of Islam \n     that rejects tolerance, crushes all dissent, and justifies \n     the murder of innocent men, women and children in the pursuit \n     of political power. They hope to establish a violent \n     political utopia across the Middle East, which they call a \n     ``Caliphate''--where all would be ruled according to their \n     hateful ideology. Osama bin Laden has called the 9/11 \n     attacks--in his words--``a great step towards the unity of \n     Muslims and establishing the Righteous... [Caliphate].''\n       This caliphate would be a totalitarian Islamic empire \n     encompassing all current and former Muslim lands, stretching \n     from Europe to North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast \n     Asia. We know this because al Qaeda has told us. About two \n     months ago, the terrorist Zawahiri--he's al Qaeda's second in \n     command--declared that al Qaeda intends to impose its rule in \n     ``every land that was a home for Islam, from [Spain] to Iraq. \n     He went on to say, ``The whole world is an open field for \n     us.''\n       We know what this radical empire would look like in \n     practice, because we saw how the radicals imposed their \n     ideology on the people of Afghanistan. Under the rule of the \n     Taliban and al Qaeda, Afghanistan was a totalitarian \n     nightmare--a land where women were imprisoned in their homes, \n     men were beaten for missing prayer meetings, girls could not \n     go to school, and children were forbidden the smallest \n     pleasures like flying kites. Religious police roamed the \n     streets, beating and detaining civilians for perceived \n     offenses. Women were publicly whipped. Summary executions \n     were held in Kabul's soccer stadium in front of cheering \n     mobs. And Afghanistan was turned into a launching pad for \n     horrific attacks against America and other parts of the \n     civilized world--including many Muslim nations.\n       The goal of these Sunni extremists is to remake the entire \n     Muslim world in their radical image. In pursuit of their \n     imperial aims, these extremists say there can be no \n     compromise or dialogue with those they call ``infidels''--a \n     category that includes America, the world's free nations, \n     Jews, and all Muslims who reject their extreme vision of \n     Islam. They reject the possibility of peaceful coexistence \n     with the free world. Again, hear the words of Osama bin Laden \n     earlier this year: ``Death is better than living on this \n     Earth with the unbelievers among us.''\n       These radicals have declared their uncompromising hostility \n     to freedom. It is foolish to think that you can negotiate \n     with them. (Applause.) We see the uncompromising nature of \n     the enemy in many captured terrorist documents. Here are just \n     two examples: After the liberation of Afghanistan, coalition \n     forces searching through a terrorist safe house in that \n     country found a copy of the al Qaeda charter. This charter \n     states that ``there will be continuing enmity until everyone \n     believes in Allah. We will not meet [the enemy] halfway. \n     There will be no room for dialogue with them.'' Another \n     document was found in 2000 by British police during an \n     anti-terrorist raid in London--a grisly al Qaeda manual \n     that includes chapters with titles such as ``Guidelines \n     for Beating and Killing Hostages.'' This manual declares \n     that their vision of Islam ``does not . . . make a truce \n     with unbelief, but rather confronts it.'' The \n     confrontation . . . calls for . . . the dialogue of \n     bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing, and \n     destruction, and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine \n     gun.''\n       Still other captured documents show al Qaeda's strategy for \n     infiltrating Muslim nations, establishing terrorist enclaves, \n     overthrowing governments, and building their totalitarian \n     empire. We see this strategy laid out in a captured al Qaeda \n     document found during a recent raid in Iraq, which describes \n     their plans to infiltrate and take over Iraq's western Anbar \n     Province. The document lays out an elaborate al Qaeda \n     governing structure for the region that includes an Education \n     Department, a Social Services Department, a Justice \n     Department, and an ``Execution Unit'' responsible for \n     ``Sorting out, Arrest, Murder, and Destruction.''\n       According to their public statements, countries that have--\n     they have targeted stretch from the Middle East to Africa, to \n     Southeast Asia. Through this strategy, al Qaeda and its \n     allies intend to create numerous, decentralized operating \n     bases across the world, from which they can plan new attacks, \n     and advance their vision of a unified, totalitarian Islamic \n     state that can confront and eventually destroy the free \n     world.\n       These violent extremists know that to realize this vision, \n     they must first drive out the main obstacle that stands in \n     their way--the United States of America. According to al \n     Qaeda, their strategy to defeat America has two parts: First, \n     they're waging a campaign of terror across the world. They're \n     targeting our forces abroad, hoping that the American people \n     will grow tired of casualties and give up the fight. And \n     they're targeting America's financial centers and economic \n     infrastructure at home, hoping to terrorize us and cause our \n     economy to collapse.\n       Bin Laden calls this his ``bleed-until-bankruptcy plan.'' \n     And he cited the attacks of 9/11 as evidence that such a plan \n     can succeed. With the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden says, \n     ``al Qaeda spent $500,000 on the event, while America. . . \n     lost--according to the lowest estimate--$500 billion . . . \n     Meaning that every dollar of al Qaeda defeated a million \n     dollars'' of America. Bin Laden concludes from this \n     experience that ``America is definitely a great power, with . \n     . . unbelievable military strength and a vibrant economy, but \n     all of these have been built on a very weak and hollow \n     foundation.'' He went on to say, ``Therefore, it is very easy \n     to target the flimsy base and concentrate on their weak \n     points, and even if we're able to target one-tenth of these \n     weak points, we will be able [to] crush and destroy them.''\n       Secondly, along with this campaign of terror, the enemy has \n     a propaganda strategy. Osama bin Laden laid out this strategy \n     in a letter to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, that \n     coalition forces uncovered in Afghanistan in 2002. In it, bin \n     Laden says that al Qaeda intends to ``[launch],'' in his \n     words, ``a media campaign . . . to create a wedge between the \n     American people and their government.'' This media campaign, \n     bin Laden says, will send the American people a number of \n     messages, including ``that their government [will] bring them \n     more losses, in finances and casualties.'' And he goes on to \n     say that ``they are being sacrificed . . . to serve . . . the \n     big investors, especially the Jews.'' Bin Laden says that by \n     delivering these messages, al Qaeda ``aims at creating \n     pressure from the American people on the American government \n     to stop their campaign against Afghanistan.''\n       Bin Laden and his allies are absolutely convinced they can \n     succeed in forcing America to retreat and causing our \n     economic collapse. They believe our nation is weak and \n     decadent, and lacking in patience and resolve. And they're \n     wrong. (Applause.) Osama bin Laden has written that the \n     ``defeat of . . . American forces in Beirut'' in 1983 is \n     proof America does not have the stomach to stay in the fight. \n     He's declared that ``in Somalia . . . the United States \n     [pulled] out,\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\n     trailing disappointment, defeat, and failure behind it.'' And \n     last year, the terrorist Zawahiri declared that Americans \n     ``know better than others that there is no hope in victory. \n     The Vietnam specter is closing every outlet.''\n       These terrorists hope to drive America and our coalition \n     out of Afghanistan, so they can restore the safe haven they \n     lost when coalition forces drove them out five years ago. But \n     they've made clear that the most important front in their \n     struggle against America is Iraq--the nation bin Laden has \n     declared the ``capital of the Caliphate.'' Hear the words of \n     bin Laden: ``I now address. . . the whole . . . Islamic \n     nation: Listen and understand . . . The most . . . serious \n     issue today for the whole world is this Third World War . . . \n     [that] is raging in [Iraq].'' He calls it ``a war of destiny \n     between infidelity and Islam.'' He says, ``The whole world is \n     watching this war,'' and that it will end in ``victory and \n     glory or misery and humiliation.'' For al Qaeda, Iraq is not \n     a distraction from their war on America--it is the central \n     battlefield where the outcome of this struggle will be \n     decided.\n       Here is what al Qaeda says they will do if they succeed in \n     driving us out of Iraq: The terrorist Zawahiri has said that \n     al Qaeda will proceed with ``several incremental goals. The \n     first stage: Expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage: \n     Establish an Islamic authority or amirate, then develop it \n     and support it until it achieves the level of Caliphate . . . \n     The third stage: Extend the jihad wave to the secular \n     countries neighboring Iraq. And the fourth stage: . . . the \n     clash with Israel.''\n       These evil men know that a fundamental threat to their \n     aspirations is a democratic Iraq that can govern itself, \n     sustain itself, and defend itself. They know that given a \n     choice, the Iraqi people will never choose to live in the \n     totalitarian state the extremists hope to establish. And that \n     is why we must not, and we will not, give the enemy victory \n     in Iraq by deserting the Iraqi people. (Applause.)\n       Last year, the terrorist Zarqawi declared in a message \n     posted on the Internet that democracy ``is the essence of \n     infidelity and deviation from the right path.'' The Iraqi \n     people disagree. Last December, nearly 12 million Iraqis from \n     every ethnic and religious community turned out to vote in \n     their country's third free election in less than a year. Iraq \n     now has a unity government that represents Iraq's diverse \n     population--and al Qaeda's top commander in Iraq breathed his \n     last breath. (Applause.)\n       Despite these strategic setbacks, the enemy will continue \n     to fight freedom's advance in Iraq, because they understand \n     the stakes in this war. Again, hear the words of bin Laden, \n     in a message to the American people earlier this year. He \n     says: ``The war is for you or for us to win. If we win it, it \n     means your defeat and disgrace forever.''\n       Now, I know some of our country hear the terrorists' words, \n     and hope that they will not, or cannot, do what they say. \n     History teaches that underestimating the words of evil and \n     ambitious men is a terrible mistake. In the early 1900s, an \n     exiled lawyer in Europe published a pamphlet called ``What Is \n     To Be Done?''--in which he laid out his plan to launch a \n     communist revolution in Russia. The world did not heed \n     Lenin's words, and paid a terrible price. The Soviet Empire \n     he established killed tens of millions, and brought the world \n     to the brink of thermonuclear war. In the 1920s, a failed \n     Austrian painter published a book in which he explained his \n     intention to build an Aryan super-state in Germany and take \n     revenge on Europe and eradicate the Jews. The world ignored \n     Hitler's words, and paid a terrible price. His Nazi regime \n     killed millions in the gas chambers, and set the world aflame \n     in war, before it was finally defeated at a terrible cost in \n     lives.\n       Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their \n     intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them. The \n     question is: Will we listen? Will we pay attention to what \n     these evil men say? America and our coalition partners have \n     made our choice. We're taking the words of the enemy \n     seriously. We're on the offensive, and we will not rest, we \n     will not retreat, and we will not withdraw from the fight, \n     until this threat to civilization has been removed. \n     (Applause.)\n       Five years into this struggle, it's important to take stock \n     of what's been accomplished--and the difficult work that \n     remains. Al Qaeda has been weakened by our sustained \n     offensive against them, and today it is harder for al Qaeda's \n     leaders to operate freely, to move money, or to communicate \n     with their operatives and facilitators. Yet al Qaeda remains \n     dangerous and determined. Bin Laden and Zawahiri remain in \n     hiding in remote regions of this world. Al Qaeda continues to \n     adapt in the face of our global campaign against them. \n     Increasingly, al Qaeda is taking advantage of the Internet to \n     disseminate propaganda, and to conduct ``virtual \n     recruitment'' and ``virtual training'' of new terrorists. Al \n     Qaeda's leaders no longer need to meet face-to-face with \n     their operatives. They can find new suicide bombers, and \n     facilitate new terrorist attacks, without ever laying eyes on \n     those they're training, financing, or sending to strike us.\n       As al Qaeda changes, the broader terrorist movement is also \n     changing, becoming more dispersed and self-directed. More and \n     more, we're facing threats from locally established terrorist \n     cells that are inspired by al Qaeda's ideology and goals, but \n     do not necessarily have direct links to al Qaeda, such as \n     training and funding. Some of these groups are made up of \n     ``homegrown'' terrorists, militant extremists who were born \n     and educated in Western nations, were indoctrinated by \n     radical Islamists or attracted to their ideology, and joined \n     the violent extremist cause. These locally established cells \n     appear to be responsible for a number of attacks and plots, \n     including those in Madrid, and Canada, and other countries \n     across the world.\n       As we continue to fight al Qaeda and these Sunni extremists \n     inspired by their radical ideology, we also face the threat \n     posed by Shia extremists, who are learning from al Qaeda, \n     increasing their assertiveness, and stepping up their \n     threats. Like the vast majority of Sunnis, the vast majority \n     of Shia across the world reject the vision of extremists--and \n     in Iraq, millions of Shia have defied terrorist threats to \n     vote in free elections, and have shown their desire to \n     live in freedom. The Shia extremists want to deny them \n     this right. This Shia strain of Islamic radicalism is just \n     as dangerous, and just as hostile to America, and just as \n     determined to establish its brand of hegemony across the \n     broader Middle East. And the Shia extremists have achieved \n     something that al Qaeda has so far failed to do: In 1979, \n     they took control of a major power, the nation of Iran, \n     subjugating its proud people to a regime of tyranny, and \n     using that nation's resources to fund the spread of terror \n     and pursue their radical agenda.\n       Like al Qaeda and the Sunni extremists, the Iranian regime \n     has clear aims: They want to drive America out of the region, \n     to destroy Israel, and to dominate the broader Middle East. \n     To achieve these aims, they are funding and arming terrorist \n     groups like Hezbollah, which allow them to attack Israel and \n     America by proxy. Hezbollah, the source of the current \n     instability in Lebanon, has killed more Americans than any \n     terrorist organization except al Qaeda. Unlike al Qaeda, \n     they've not yet attacked the American homeland. Yet they're \n     directly responsible for the murder of hundreds of Americans \n     abroad. It was Hezbollah that was behind the 1983 bombing of \n     the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Americans. \n     And Saudi Hezbollah was behind the 1996 bombing of Khobar \n     Towers in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans, an attack \n     conducted by terrorists who we believe were working with \n     Iranian officials.\n       Just as we must take the words of the Sunni extremists \n     seriously, we must take the words of the Shia extremists \n     seriously. Listen to the words of Hezbollah's leader, the \n     terrorist Nasrallah, who has declared his hatred of America. \n     He says, ``Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the \n     Great Satan [America] is absolute . . . Regardless of how the \n     world has changed after 11 September, Death to America will \n     remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to \n     America.''\n       Iran's leaders, who back Hezbollah, have also declared \n     their absolute hostility to America. Last October, Iran's \n     President declared in a speech that some people ask--in his \n     words--``whether a world without the United States and \n     Zionism can be achieved . . . I say that this . . . goal is \n     achievable.'' Less than three months ago, Iran's President \n     declared to America and other Western powers: ``open your \n     eyes and see the fate of pharaoh . . . if you do not abandon \n     the path of falsehood . . . your doomed destiny will be \n     annihilation.'' Less than two months ago, he warned: ``The \n     anger of Muslims may reach an explosion point soon. If such a \n     day comes . . . [America and the West] should know that the \n     waves of the blast will not remain within the boundaries of \n     our region.'' He also delivered this message to the American \n     people: ``If you would like to have good relations with the \n     Iranian nation in the future . . . bow down before the \n     greatness of the Iranian nation and surrender. If you don't \n     accept [to do this], the Iranian nation will . . . force you \n     to surrender and bow down.''\n       America will not bow down to tyrants. (Applause.)\n       The Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies have \n     demonstrated their willingness to kill Americans--and now the \n     Iranian regime is pursuing nuclear weapons. The world is \n     working together to prevent Iran's regime from acquiring the \n     tools of mass murder. The international community has made a \n     reasonable proposal to Iran's leaders, and given them the \n     opportunity to set their nation on a better course. So far, \n     Iran's leaders have rejected this offer.\n       Their choice is increasingly isolating the great Iranian \n     nation from the international community, and denying the \n     Iranian people an opportunity for greater economic \n     prosperity. It's time for Iran's leader to make a different \n     choice. And we've made our choice. We'll continue to work \n     closely with our allies to find a diplomatic solution. The \n     world's free nations will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear \n     weapon. (Applause.)\n       The Shia and Sunni extremists represent different faces of \n     the same threat. They draw inspiration from different \n     sources, but both seek to impose a dark vision of violent \n     Islamic radicalism across the Middle East. They oppose the \n     advance of freedom, and they want to gain control of weapons \n     of mass destruction. If they succeed in undermining fragile \n     democracies, like Iraq, and drive the forces of freedom out \n     of the region, they will have an open field to pursue their \n     dangerous goals. Each strain of violent Islamic radicalism \n     would be emboldened in their efforts to topple moderate \n     governments and establish terrorist safe havens.\n       Imagine a world in which they were able to control \n     governments, a world awash with oil\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\n     and they would use oil resources to punish industrialized \n     nations. And they would use those resources to fuel their \n     radical agenda, and pursue and purchase weapons of mass \n     murder. And armed with nuclear weapons, they would blackmail \n     the free world, and spread their ideologies of hate, and \n     raise a mortal threat to the American people. If we allow \n     them to do this, if we retreat from Iraq, if we don't uphold \n     our duty to support those who are desirous to live in \n     liberty, 50 years from now history will look back on our time \n     with unforgiving clarity, and demand to know why we did not \n     act.\n       I'm not going to allow this to happen--and no future \n     American President can allow it either. America did not seek \n     this global struggle, but we're answering history's call with \n     confidence and a clear strategy. Today we're releasing a \n     document called the ``National Strategy for Combating \n     Terrorism.'' This is an unclassified version of the strategy \n     we've been pursuing since September the 11th, 2001. This \n     strategy was first released in February 2003; it's been \n     updated to take into account the changing nature of this \n     enemy. This strategy document is posted on the White House \n     website--whitehouse.gov. And I urge all Americans to read it.\n       Our strategy for combating terrorism has five basic \n     elements:\n       First, we're determined to prevent terrorist attacks before \n     they occur. So we're taking the fight to the enemy. The best \n     way to protect America is to stay on the offense. Since 9/11, \n     our coalition has captured or killed al Qaeda managers and \n     operatives, and scores of other terrorists across the world. \n     The enemy is living under constant pressure, and we intend to \n     keep it that way--and this adds to our security. When \n     terrorists spend their days working to avoid death or \n     capture, it's harder for them to plan and execute new \n     attacks.\n       We're also fighting the enemy here at home. We've given our \n     law enforcement and intelligence professionals the tools they \n     need to stop the terrorists in our midst. We passed the \n     PATRIOT Act to break down the wall that prevented law \n     enforcement and intelligence from sharing vital information. \n     We created the Terrorist Surveillance Program to monitor the \n     communications between al Qaeda commanders abroad and \n     terrorist operatives within our borders. If al Qaeda is \n     calling somebody in America, we need to know why, in order to \n     stop attacks. (Applause.)\n       I want to thank these three Senators for working with us to \n     give our law enforcement and intelligence officers the tools \n     necessary to do their jobs. (Applause.) And over the last \n     five years, federal, state, and local law enforcement have \n     used those tools to break up terrorist cells, and to \n     prosecute terrorist operatives and supporters in New York, \n     and Oregon, and Virginia, and Texas, and New Jersey, and \n     Illinois, Ohio, and other states. By taking the battle to the \n     terrorists and their supporters on our own soil and across \n     the world, we've stopped a number of al Qaeda plots.\n       Second, we're determined to deny weapons of mass \n     destruction to outlaw regimes and terrorists who would use \n     them without hesitation. Working with Great Britain and \n     Pakistan and other nations, the United States shut down the \n     world's most dangerous nuclear trading cartel, the AQ Khan \n     network. This network had supplied Iran and Libya and North \n     Korea with equipment and know-how that advanced their efforts \n     to obtain nuclear weapons. And we launched the Proliferation \n     Security Initiative, a coalition of more than 70 nations that \n     is working together to stop shipments related to weapons of \n     mass destruction on land, at sea, and in the air. The \n     greatest threat this world faces is the danger of extremists \n     and terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction--and \n     this is a threat America cannot defeat on her own. We applaud \n     the determined efforts of many nations around the world to \n     stop the spread of these dangerous weapons. Together, we \n     pledge we'll continue to work together to stop the world's \n     most dangerous men from getting their hands on the world's \n     most dangerous weapons. (Applause.)\n       Third, we're determined to deny terrorists the support of \n     outlaw regimes. After September the 11th, I laid out a clear \n     doctrine: America makes no distinction between those who \n     commit acts of terror, and those that harbor and support \n     them, because they're equally guilty of murder. Thanks to our \n     efforts, there are now three fewer state sponsors of terror \n     in the world than there were on September the 11th, 2001. \n     Afghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from terrorist \n     states into allies in the war on terror. And the nation of \n     Libya has renounced terrorism, and given up its weapons of \n     mass destruction programs, and its nuclear materials and \n     equipment. Over the past five years, we've acted to disrupt \n     the flow of weapons and support from terrorist states to \n     terrorist networks. And we have made clear that any \n     government that chooses to be an ally of terror has also \n     chosen to be an enemy of civilization. (Applause.)\n       Fourth, we're determined to deny terrorist networks control \n     of any nation, or territory within a nation. So, along with \n     our coalition and the Iraqi government, we'll stop the \n     terrorists from taking control of Iraq, and establishing a \n     new safe haven from which to attack America and the free \n     world. And we're working with friends and allies to deny the \n     terrorists the enclaves they seek to establish in ungoverned \n     areas across the world. By helping governments reclaim full \n     sovereign control over their territory, we make ourselves \n     more secure.\n       Fifth, we're working to deny terrorists new recruits, by \n     defeating their hateful ideology and spreading the hope of \n     freedom--by spreading the hope of freedom across the Middle \n     East. For decades, American policy sought to achieve peace in \n     the Middle East by pursuing stability at the expense of \n     liberty. The lack of freedom in that region helped create \n     conditions where anger and resentment grew, and radicalism \n     thrived, and terrorists found willing recruits. And we saw \n     the consequences on September the 11th, when the \n     terrorists brought death and destruction to our country. \n     The policy wasn't working.\n       The experience of September the 11th made clear, in the \n     long run, the only way to secure our nation is to change the \n     course of the Middle East. So America has committed its \n     influence in the world to advancing freedom and liberty and \n     democracy as the great alternatives to repression and \n     radicalism. (Applause.) We're taking the side of democratic \n     leaders and moderates and reformers across the Middle East. \n     We strongly support the voices of tolerance and moderation in \n     the Muslim world. We're standing with Afghanistan's elected \n     government against al Qaeda and the Taliban remnants that are \n     trying to restore tyranny in that country. We're standing \n     with Lebanon's young democracy against the foreign forces \n     that are seeking to undermine the country's sovereignty and \n     independence. And we're standing with the leaders of Iraq's \n     unity government as they work to defeat the enemies of \n     freedom, and chart a more hopeful course for their people. \n     This is why victory is so important in Iraq. By helping \n     freedom succeed in Iraq, we will help America, and the Middle \n     East, and the world become more secure.\n       During the last five years we've learned a lot about this \n     enemy. We've learned that they're cunning and sophisticated. \n     We've witnessed their ability to change their methods and \n     their tactics with deadly speed--even as their murderous \n     obsessions remain unchanging. We've seen that it's the \n     terrorists who have declared war on Muslims, slaughtering \n     huge numbers of innocent Muslim men and women around the \n     world.\n       We know what the terrorists believe, we know what they have \n     done, and we know what they intend to do. And now the world's \n     free nations must summon the will to meet this great \n     challenge. The road ahead is going to be difficult, and it \n     will require more sacrifice. Yet we can have confidence in \n     the outcome, because we've seen freedom conquer tyranny and \n     terror before. In the 20th century, free nations confronted \n     and defeated Nazi Germany. During the Cold War, we confronted \n     Soviet communism, and today Europe is whole, free and at \n     peace.\n       And now, freedom is once again contending with the forces \n     of darkness and tyranny. This time, the battle is unfolding \n     in a new region--the broader Middle East. This time, we're \n     not waiting for our enemies to gather in strength. This time, \n     we're confronting them before they gain the capacity to \n     inflict unspeakable damage on the world, and we're \n     confronting their hateful ideology before it fully takes \n     root.\n       We see a day when people across the Middle East have \n     governments that honor their dignity, and unleash their \n     creativity, and count their votes. We see a day when across \n     this region citizens are allowed to express themselves \n     freely, women have full rights, and children are educated and \n     given the tools necessary to succeed in life. And we see a \n     day when all the nations of the Middle East are allies in the \n     cause of peace.\n       We fight for this day, because the security of our own \n     citizens depends on it. This is the great ideological \n     struggle of the 21st century--and it is the calling of our \n     generation. All civilized nations are bound together in this \n     struggle between moderation and extremism. By coming \n     together, we will roll back this grave threat to our way of \n     life. We will help the people of the Middle East claim their \n     freedom, and we will leave a safer and more hopeful world for \n     our children and grandchildren.\n       God bless.

Mr. President, at this moment in history our Nation faces \nenormous challenges from terrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Israel \nand the occupied territories, Sudan's Darfur region, Iran, North Korea, \nSyria, HIV/AIDS, global health generally, climate change, energy \nsecurity, and the list seems endless. These are all important issues \nthat call out for important action and leadership from the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\n  America's capacity to respond to this global clarion call has been \nseriously circumscribed, in my view, by the Bush administration's \npreemptive war of choice in Iraq--circumscribed militarily, \npolitically, and economically. The options have become fewer since \nMarch 19, 2003, as the world has become more dangerous, and the \nreputation and global standing of the United States has become weaker.\n  Our friends know this. More importantly, so do our adversaries, \napparently.\n  That is why it is imperative that we make the most of the options \nstill available to respond to these challenges. Diplomacy is one of the \nfew options that remain available with a reasonable political and \nminority pricetag. As John Kennedy said so eloquently more than 45 \nyears ago, this Nation should never fear to negotiate but never \nnegotiate out of fear. It is going to take effective and pragmatic \ndiplomacy to build the kinds of international partnerships and \ncoalitions to address the challenges that confront us so that America \ncan feel safe and be safer and more secure.\n  While the United Nations isn't the only forum for the conduct of that \ndiplomacy, it is very clear that President Bush has placed much more \nreliance on the United Nations Security Council in his second term in \noffice than he certainly did in the first. Be it Iran, North Korea, \nDarfur, or Lebanon, the United States has turned to the Security \nCouncil to respond to humanitarian crises and other threats to \ninternational peace and stability.\n  That is why, more than at any other time in recent years, since the \nfounding of the United Nations, that it matters who sits in the United \nStates chair on that Council. In my view, Mr. John Bolton does not fit \nthe bill.\n  Based on information developed by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee last year from unprecedented committee testimony by former \nAssistant Secretary of State Carl Ford and more than 30 staff \ninterviews of then-current and former colleagues of Mr. Bolton in the \nBush administration--in the Bush administration, I might add--the \nSenate made the decision not to act on that nomination.\n  Carl Ford and 12 of those interviewed were extremely critical of Mr. \nBolton, including retired COL Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff to \nSecretary Powell; Thomas Fingar, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Intelligence and Research; former Deputy Director of the CIA, \nStuart Cohen; and Robert Hutchings, former acting head and head of the \nNational Intelligence Council, respectively; and Jamie Miscik, former \nDeputy Director of Intelligence at the CIA.\n  These are not light people; these are serious people, all of whom \nserved in the Bush administration. Here is what some of them had to say \nabout this nomination. Again, these were Bush appointees, people who \nserved in the Bush administration. Listen to Carl Ford, the Assistant \nSecretary of State for Intelligence in his testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee:\n  Mr. Bolton is a ``quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.''\n  Mr. Bolton has ``a bigger kick and it gets bigger and stronger the \nfurther down the bureaucracy he's kicking.''\n  Mr. Bolton is a ``serial abuser.''\n\n       I have never seen anyone quite like Secretary Bolton--\n     doesn't even come close. I don't have a second and third or \n     fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and \n     authority with little people.\n       I consider myself to be a loyal Republican and conservative \n     to the core. I'm a firm and enthusiastic supporter of \n     President Bush and his policies, and I'm a huge fan of Vice \n     President Cheney, who I worked with when he was Secretary of \n     Defense.\n\n  With respect to the Bolton's treatment of Westermann, Mr. Ford went \non:\n\n       The attitude, the volume of his tone, and what I \n     understand, the substance of the conversation, he was so far \n     over the line that he meets--he's one of the sort of \n     memorable moments in my 30-plus-year career [in public \n     service for the Federal Government.]\n\n  Again, this is a Bush appointee about whom we are talking.\n  Listen further. Larry Wilkerson, lieutenant colonel, chief of staff \nto Secretary of State Colin Powell in a telephone interview, Lieutenant \nColonel Wilkerson said:\n\n       Do I think John Bolton would make a good ambassador to the \n     United Nations? Absolutely not.\n       He is incapable of listening to people and taking into \n     account their views.\n       He would be an abysmal ambassador.\n\n  Listen further to Mr. Wilkerson:\n\n       I differ from a lot of people in Washington, both friend \n     and foe of Under Secretary Bolton, as to his ``brilliance.'' \n     I didn't see it.\n       I saw a man who counted beans, who said ``98 today, 99 \n     tomorrow, 100 the next day,'' and had no willingness--and, in \n     many cases, no capacity--to understand the other things that \n     were happening around those beans. And that is just a recipe \n     for problems at the United Nations.\n\n  Lastly, Mr. McLaughlin, Deputy Director of the CIA, responding to a \nquestion as to whether other policymakers had sought to remove CIA \nanalysts:\n\n       No. This is the only time I had ever heard of such a \n     request . . . I reacted strongly to it. I didn't think it was \n     appropriate.\n\n  I will return to that particular point in a few minutes, this idea of \nattempting to fire intelligence analysts.\n  These are just some of the quotes, again, of people who served in the \nBush administration commenting on the nomination of John Bolton to be \nour ambassador to the United Nations.\n  There have been some excellent U.S. representatives to the United \nNations over the years: Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson, Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, or former colleague Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Richard \nHolbrooke, just to name a few. Each and every one of these individuals \npossessed a certain skill and ability to work with others, our \nadversaries as well as our friends, in order to stretch the U.N. as an \ninstitution in ways that supported U.S. interests. None of them were \nshrinking violets, to put it mildly.\n  It is very clear that Mr. Bolton does not possess that skill set. \nOver the years, Mr. Bolton evidenced great skepticism and disdain for \nthe United Nations and multilateral diplomacy generally.\n  Nothing he has said or done since assuming his current position in \nNew York suggests that he has altered his views on the United Nations \nor on multilateral diplomacy generally.\n  Once again, it is those who have worked most closely with him who are \nhis biggest critics. More than 30 ambassadors with whom Mr. Bolton \nserves at the United Nations--all supportive of U.N. reform--questioned \nhis leadership abilities.\n  In a July 21, 2006, New York Times article, one U.N. colleague \ncharacterized Mr. Bolton as ``intransigent and maximalist.'' Another \nsuggested that Mr. Bolton's ``high ambitions are cover-ups for less \nnoble aims, and oriented not at improving the United Nations, but at \nbelittling and weakening it.'' A third has essentially written off \nworking with Mr. Bolton. ``He's lost me as an ally now, and that's what \nmany other ambassadors who consider themselves friends of the United \nStates are saying.''\n  Mr. Bolton's response to a question posed by Senator Coleman at his \nJuly nomination hearing was stunning to me. Our colleague, Norm \nColeman, asked the following question:\n\n       Mr. Coleman. You knew the organization, you were involved \n     in it, then you were on the outside. Now you're there. Is \n     there--has your impression of the U.N. changed? Has there \n     been anything that surprised you in the last year?\n       Mr. Bolton. Not really.\n\n  That is a response of an individual who is so entrenched in his views \nthat he is incapable of the kind of openness and flexibility that I \nthink most in this Chamber believe is essential if the United Nations \nSecurity Council is going to be made to work to serve our interests \naround the globe.\n  Mr. Bolton clearly has an aversion to being diplomatic. He has even \nbeen called a bully by some of his harshest critics. Mr. Bolton's \npersonality is really not the issue as far as I am concerned. There are \na lot of bullies in this town, and I suspect in New York as well. My \nobjection isn't that he is a bully, but that he has been an ineffective \nbully. He can't win the day for the United States when it really \ncounts. He isolates the United States rather than builds consensus \naround U.S. positions.\n  Mr. Bolton showed his colors, in my view, as soon as he arrived in \nNew York after receiving his recess appointment last August 2005. After \nthe U.S. mission had worked for months to negotiate a 2-year reform \neffort that was to be endorsed by President Bush and other heads of \nState 2 weeks later, Mr. Bolton almost destroyed the consensus\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\naround the document by tabling 705 separate amendments to the text. It \ntook the involvement of the President of the United States and the \nSecretary of State to cobble the agreement back together at the last \nminute at a price of losing some of the provisions that the United \nStates had sought be included with respect to management reforms.\n  The Bush administration has made the ongoing crisis in Darfur a key \nconcern. Yet when in June of this year members of the Security Council \nvisited the Sudan to send a signal to the Government of Khartoum that \nit was on the wrong track, Mr. Bolton thought it more important to \ntravel to London to deliver a U.N. bashing speech to a private \nthink tank rather than join his colleagues on a visit to Sudan and \ncarrying on a message of how important we think the genocidal behavior \nis.\n\n  On another occasion, prior to a vote last July on a U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution intended to sanction North Korea for its provocative \nFourth of July missile launches, Mr. Bolton publicly assured anyone who \nwould listen that he could get support for a resolution with teeth, \nwith the so-called chapter 7 obligations. It turns out he couldn't. The \nresolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council fell far short of that.\n  Last September, Mr. Bolton told the House International Relations \nCommittee that the negotiation of an effective Human Rights Council was \na key objective of the United States and that it was a ``very high \npriority, and a personal priority of mine.''\n  There were 30 negotiating sessions held to hammer out the framework \nof this new Human Rights Council, and Ambassador Bolton managed to \nattend just one or two of those sessions.\n  In the end, the United States was one of four countries to vote \nagainst the approval of the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n  When the tally is taken on how effective Mr. Bolton has been at the \nU.N., in my view he gets a failing grade overall.\n  These are key positions that help to strengthen the United States, \nand yet in case after case, from reform, to Darfur, to North Korea, to \nthe U.N. Human Rights Council--critical issues to strengthen the United \nStates--our ambassador has failed in getting the kind of results that \nare critically important.\n  But there is more.\n  On the basis of those issues, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nMr. Bolton, but I am going to go a step further because I believe other \nactions taken by Mr. Bolton are so outrageous that Mr. Bolton does not \neven deserve a vote, in my view.\n  There is Mr. Bolton's well-documented attempts to manipulate \nintelligence to suit his world view and seek the removal of at least \ntwo intelligence analysts who wouldn't play ball. When these analysts \nrefused to support intelligence conclusions not supported by available \nintelligence, Mr. Bolton mounted a concerted effort to have them fired. \nThe fact they were not removed does not excuse his actions.\n  I don't mind a heated debate. I don't mind people having serious \ndisagreements with conclusions. But when you attempt to fire lower \nlevel employees who are responsible for gathering intelligence for the \nUnited States because you don't like their results, that is dangerous \nbusiness indeed.\n  I do not care in which administration you may serve. Any individual, \nin my view, who attempts to doctor evidence to fire people whose \nconclusions they disagree with when it comes to intelligence gathering \ndoes not deserve to be promoted to the high position of ambassador to \nthe United Nations.\n  His behavior, in my view, endangers our national security because it \ngoes to the very heart of what we depend upon to protect that \nsecurity--unbiased professional intelligence collection and analysis. \nMr. Bolton stepped away and he stepped over the line and committed an \noffense so grievous, in my view, it warrants that this Senate deny him \nan up-or-down vote on his nomination.\n  In concluding, Mr. President, I return to the point I made earlier; \nnamely, that Mr. Bolton has largely burned his bridges with his \ncolleagues in New York and is not likely to be an effective diplomat \nwhen his diplomacy is increasingly becoming the coin of the realm in \nprotecting and advancing U.S. interests at this very unstable moment in \nthis country.\n  Fifty nine former U.S. Ambassadors and diplomats who have served in \nfive administrations, Democratic and Republican, agree. Yesterday, they \nsent a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee strongly \nopposing this nomination--59 former U.S. Ambassadors.\n  I mentioned earlier the number of people in the Bush administration \nwho are outspokenly critical of this nomination. What more do we need \nto hear, what more do we need to hear that this is a bad nomination and \none that is going to jeopardize the interests of the United States? \nThose Ambassadors recognize, as do I, that at this critical moment in \nour Nation's future, the President should put the Nation's interests \nfirst and nominate an individual with strong diplomatic skills who \nbelieves in diplomacy rather than placating his conservative base by \ncontinuing to push for the nomination of an unsuitable nominee.\n  I believe it is time for the Senate to send that message loudly and \nclearly to the President by rejecting efforts to ramrod this nomination \nthrough in the closing days of this session.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly opposing this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S8992-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under previous order, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 5631, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5631) to make appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kennedy-Reid amendment No. 4855, to include information on \n     civil war in Iraq in the quarterly reports on progress toward \n     military and political stability in Iraq.\n       Allen modified amendment No. 4883, to make available from \n     Defense Health Program up to $19,000,000 for the Defense and \n     Veterans Brain Injury Center.\n       Feinstein-Leahy amendment No. 4882, to protect civilian \n     lives from unexploded cluster munitions.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the pending business on this \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Kennedy amendment still set aside following that \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4882\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand it is appropriate for me \nnow to speak on an amendment I offered yesterday having to do with \ncluster bombs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss again the amendment \noffered by myself and Senator Leahy to this bill on the use of a \nmunition called a cluster bomb. Our amendment is very simple. It \nprevents any funds from being spent to purchase, use, or transfer \ncluster munitions until rules of engagement have been adopted by the \nDepartment of Defense to ensure that such munitions will not be used in \nor near any concentration of civilians.\n  That is not a difficult requirement. It seems to me, because of the \nwidespread damage caused by these munitions, that there ought to be \nspecific rules of engagement which ban their use in areas where \ncivilian death or maiming might result.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions or individual bomblets. \nThey are intended for attacking enemy troop formations, and they \nrelease these small\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nbomblets over the radius of a half mile. In practice, they pose a real \nthreat to the safety of civilians when used in populated areas because \nthey leave hundreds of unexploded bomblets over a large area, and they \nare often inaccurate. In some cases, up to 40 percent of cluster bombs \nfail to explode, posing a particular danger to civilians long after the \nconflict has ended.\n  Bomblets are no bigger than a D battery and in some cases resemble a \ntennis ball, so they are attractive to small children who pick them up \nto play with them. Then the bomblet explodes and the individual is \neither killed or maimed.\n  I would like to show three photographs.\n  On March 25, 2003, a youngster by the name of Abdallah Yaqoob was \nsleeping in his bed in his home in Basra, Iraq when he was hit with \nshrapnel from a cluster munitions strike that hit his neighborhood. He \nlost his arm, and his abdomen was severely damaged. He was hit by a \nBritish L20A1/M85 munition--a cluster bomb.\n  Second, Falah Hassan, 13, was injured by an unexploded ground-\nlaunched submunition in Iraq on March 26, 2003. The explosion severed \nhis right hand and spread shrapnel throughout his body. He lost his \nleft index finger and soft tissue in his lower limbs.\n  This is a photo of an unexploded M42 cluster submunition found on a \nbarbed-wire fence in southern Iraq in August 2006. As you will see, \nthis is the bomblet and this is a small pinecone. You will see how \nsmall this bomblet is, hanging on the barbed wire.\n  These unexploded cluster bombs become, in essence, de facto \nlandmines.\n  The issue was first brought to my attention by a 2005 PBS documentary \nentitled ``Bombies'' which chronicled the impact of unexploded cluster \nbombs in Laos. This is startling. In Laos alone, there are between 9 \nand 27 million unexploded cluster bombs. They are leftovers from U.S. \nbombing campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s. Approximately 11,000 people, \n30 percent of them children, have been killed or injured since that war \nended--11,000 killed or injured by cluster bombs. So 40 to 50 years \nafter these munitions were used, their deadly force remains active.\n  As the documentary showed, these unexploded cluster bombs have ended \nup in bamboo trees, in playgrounds, in houses, on rice paddies, and in \nschools. They have been found in the ground where farmers prepare their \nfields to plant. They have threatened their lives and their livelihood. \nAs one farmer from northern Laos put it, ``Working in these fields is a \nproblem. There are lots of bombies. But we work very carefully. If we \nwork fast, we are afraid we'll hit a bombie.''\n  These farmers have to tend the fields and put their lives at risk \nbecause they have to grow food to feed their families. Decades after \nthe last bomb was dropped, they are still threatened by death and \nserious injury. A cluster bomb is lethal for up to 150 yards. It will \nkill or maim the person who picks it up and those nearby.\n  I remind my colleagues, these munitions have been used in many \nbattles in many wars.\n  In the first gulf war, 60,000 cluster bombs were used, containing 20 \nmillion bomblets. Since 1991, unexploded bomblets have killed 1,600 \ninnocent men, women, and children and injured more than 2,500.\n  In Afghanistan in 2001, 1,228 cluster bombs with nearly a quarter of \na million--248,056--bomblets were used.\n  Between October of 2001 and November of 2002--that is just 1 year--\n127 civilians were killed, 70 percent of them under the age of 18.\n  In Iraq in 2003, 13,000 cluster bombs with nearly 2 million bomblets \nwere used. Combining the first and second gulf wars, the total number \nof unexploded bomblets in the region is approximately 1.2 million. An \nestimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed since \n1991 by these discarded munitions.\n  Here we have it: In Iraq, 13,000 cluster bombs, two million bomblets; \nin Afghanistan, 1,200 cluster bombs, a quarter of a million bomblets, \nnumbers killed in a year, 127 civilians; in the first gulf war, 61,000 \nused, 20 million bomblets lying around, 1,600 innocent, men, women, and \nchildren killed, more than 2,500 wounded since 1991.\n  This gives rise to recent developments in Lebanon. Throughout \nsouthern Lebanon, more than 405 cluster bomb sites containing \napproximately 100,000 unexploded bomblets have been discovered. Each \nsite covers a radius of 220 yards. As Lebanese children and families \nreturn to their homes and begin to rebuild, they will be exposed to the \ndanger of these unexploded bomblets lying in the rubble. Thirteen \npeople already, including three young children, have been killed, and \n48 injured. One United Nations official estimates that the rate of \nunexploded bomblets is 40 percent in southern Lebanon. So far, more \nthan 2,900 exploded bomblets have been destroyed. It will take 12 to 15 \nmonths to complete that effort.\n  The State Department is looking into charges that the cluster bombs \nfound in southern Lebanon were American-made and that they were used in \nviolation of agreements between the United States and Israel that \ngovern their use. I do not know whether that is true. We have tried to \nfind out. At this time, and despite repeated inquiries, I am unaware \nwhat those agreements actually say and what conditions they place on \nIsrael. It seems to me we ought to know. It seems to me this \ninformation ought to be transparent and that the Congress of the United \nStates, in the process of lawmaking, is entitled to that information.\n  By passing this information and codifying this language in statute we \nwill help ensure that civilian populations will be protected by \nadequate rules of engagement that accompany the sale or transfer of \nthese weapons to another country and the rules of engagement that \ncondition their use by our military in foreign countries.\n  Each death that results from an unexploded bomblet weakens American \ndiplomacy and American values. How do people in Laos feel when they \nlive and farm with the daily threat of running into one of these \nbomblets? How do they feel in Afghanistan, Iraq, in southern Lebanon, \nin any other place where civilians can be wounded and killed by these \nbomblets?\n  Simply put, unexploded cluster bombs fuel anger and resentment. They \nmake security, stabilization, and reconstruction efforts that much \nharder.\n  Senator Leahy and I are not the only ones that feel this way. Former \nSecretary of Defense Bill Cohen recognized the threat that cluster \nbombs pose to civilians and U.S. troops alike because they litter a \nbattlefield. He issued a memorandum which became known as the Cohen \npolicy. It stated that beginning in 2005 all new cluster bombs would \nhave a failure rate of less than 1 percent.\n  This was an important step forward. But we still have 5\\1/2\\ million \ncluster bombs containing 728 million bomblets. They are aging in the \nAmerican arsenal. This indicates we are still prepared to use, \ntransfer, or sell an enormous number of cluster bombs that have \nsignificant failure rates.\n  I ask this question: Is this the source of legacy we want to leave \nbehind in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n  Let me be clear, this amendment does not place a ban on cluster \nbombs. It is a simple step that will give the Pentagon time to develop \nspecific guidelines to ensure that cluster bombs are not used in or \nnear populated areas. Does anyone in this Senate believe that a cluster \nmunition should be used in a civilian populated area? That person can \nstand up and talk to that point of view. It is unconscionable. It is \nimmoral. It is beyond the laws of warfare. If somebody wants to argue \nthat point of view, so be it. If that is the kind of country a Member \nwants to represent, so be it. It is not the country I want to \nrepresent.\n  This is a simple amendment which says no funds will be used until \nthere are rules of engagement that say that these munitions will not be \nused in civilian areas where death and maiming is apt to result.\n  This amendment will go a long way toward ensuring only prudent \nbattlefield use. I hope this amendment has an opportunity to pass.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I cannot support this amendment. It is \nnot\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\nenforceable. It establishes policies that may in some situations \ndangerously restrict the options available to our commanders on the \nbattlefield.\n  I do share the Senator's concern about potential use on the \nindiscriminate manner of these antipersonal weapons. Protecting \ninnocent civilians from the violence and destruction of war is our \ngoal. It is a laudable goal.\n  Of course, the consequences of using cluster munitions must be \ncarefully considered before such weapons are engaged. This is a complex \npolicy area. It deserves comprehensive review by the relevant policy \ncommittees, not only the Committee on Armed Services but also the \nForeign Relations Committee. As the Senator has said, it has already \nbeen reviewed on a secretarial level several times in the Department of \nDefense.\n  This amendment is just not acceptable. It legislates the rules of \nengagement for an entire class of weapon. The task of settling the \nrules of engagement properly belongs to the military and to the \ncommander and ultimately to the Commander in Chief.\n  In an extreme situation the commander must be able to use all options \nto shape the battlefield to protect our forces and those allied with \nus. Restricting the deployment of cluster munitions could severely \nhinder aviation and artillery capabilities and reduce the commander's \ncapability to wage war successfully. It could severely degrade our \nallies' capability to defend themselves in threatening situations.\n  The Department of Defense already has guidance and target \nmethodologies that emphasize minimizing dangers to civilians in or near \nthe zone of conflict. This amendment requires that prior to the sale or \ntransfer, the Department ensures that munitions will not be used in or \nnear populations, including villages, camps, and groups of refugees, \nevacuees, or nomads. This could be obtained at the point of sale.\n  Once the weapons are transferred, it would be impossible to enforce. \nThey place a burden on the military that is impossible to achieve.\n  The Arms Export Control Act already has broad guidelines on the use \nof weapons sold by the United States, and press reports indicate the \nState Department has opened an investigation into use of cluster bombs \nby Israel against Hezbollah to determine if those guidelines were \nviolated. If it has, the United States may impose sanctions. This was \ndone in 1982. The Department of State already has tools to enforce the \nhumanitarian considerations and sanction wanton use of cluster \nmunitions.\n  The Senate should recall the use of cluster munitions is consistent \nwith the convention on certain conventional weapons and international \nhumanitarian law, including the Geneva and Hague Conventions. I \nrecommend the Senate refuse to accept this amendment.\n  I do support the Defense appropriations bill as drafted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I share the concerns that prompted the \nintroduction of this amendment, but I am not prepared to approve such a \nfar-reaching measure without a clear legislative record regarding the \nneed for it and its likely impact on U.S. and allied forces.\n  Cluster bombs have always posed problems for responsible military \nforces like those of the United States. The weapons are very useful \nmilitarily, but they also carry a real risk of causing civilian \ncasualties if they are used where civilians are present or if too many \nsubmunitions fail to explode when they hit the ground. This is a \nlegitimate issue to consider and, perhaps, to legislate. But it should \nbe done in a careful manner, after holding hearings and with proper \npreparation.\n  I urge the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the \nissue of cluster munitions so that we can all gain a better \nunderstanding of how to maintain their usefulness while minimizing \ntheir risks. The committee should also make sure the Defense Department \nlives up to its claim that it ``is working towards minimizing `dud' \ncluster munitions by phasing cluster munitions systems with more \nreliable or self-destructing fuzes.'' Success in that effort would go \nfar to reduce the risks of postwar casualties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee is here, Senator Leahy of Vermont, someone whose leadership \non the landmine issue has been unparalleled in the Senate. He is a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  I yield the Senator the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. I have had a chance to work with the Senator on this \namendment. It is an extremely important amendment. I have spent decades \non the question of landmines. We use the Leahy War Victims Fund in \nparts of the world to aid landmine victims. I have visited these field \nhospitals. I have seen the damage, usually to children, overwhelmingly \nto civilians. My wife is a registered nurse. She has gone into the \nsurgeries and watched the amputations.\n  The problem of cluster bombs which maim and kill the innocent has \nbeen known for many years. Probably one of the most egregious examples \nwas in Laos, where millions of the explosives were dropped by U.S. \nplanes during the Vietnam war. Unfortunately, what happens with \nlandmines, the war ends, the landmines stay. The peace treaties are \nsigned and civilians continue to die; 30 years after those were dropped \nthere are horrific casualties of civilians.\n  I have urged the Pentagon both in Democratic and Republican \nadministrations to address this problem for nearly a decade. While they \nhave acknowledged the problem, and they do acknowledge it, they have \nnot taken effective steps to solve it.\n  We have used massive numbers of cluster munitions in the invasion of \nIraq, including in densely inhabited areas. Civilians paid the price \nand continue to pay the price.\n  Israel used these weapons in Lebanon. Again, it has been innocent \ncivilians who have suffered disproportionately.\n  Now, cluster munitions, like any weapon, of course, have military \nutility. They can be effective against armor or military \ninfrastructure, but they are in effect indiscriminate because they \nscatter thousands of lethal bomblets over wide areas. There are many \nweapons that can be effective. Used right, I suppose, poison gas is \neffective, but we have banned it since World War I. We have urged other \ncountries to ban it.\n  On these cluster munitions, between 1 and 40 percent, depending on \nthe type or the condition of the terrain, fail to explode on contact. \nRemember, there are thousands of these coming down. So if anywhere from \neven 1 percent fail, and as high as 40 percent fail, they remain as \nhazardous duds indefinitely, no different than scattering landmines, \nsomething we do not do.\n  And those who come in contact with them activate them. That could \nvery well be a child out walking to school. It can be someone playing. \nIt can be someone going to tend their animals, their crops, and they \nend up with lifelong disfigurement or disability, often death.\n  No one argues it is possible to completely avoid civilian casualties \nin a war.\n  Such casualties are inevitable. They have been tragic consequences in \nall wars. But this amendment should not be necessary. Weapons that are \nso disproportionately hazardous to civilians should be subject to \nstrict rules of engagement.\n  The Feinstein-Leahy amendment is fully consistent with the laws of \nwar and international humanitarian law. It uses the same standard as \nfor incendiary weapons, which are also notoriously hazardous to \ncivilians. Rather than prohibit cluster munitions, the amendment says \nonly that they should not be used where there are concentrations of \ncivilians.\n\n  This is a moral issue and it is an issue of our own self interest. \nUsing or selling weapons that are so indiscriminate, without strict \nrules of engagement, is immoral. It is immoral. Anyone who has seen the \nhorrific consequences of children with an arm or a leg blown off, or a \npart of their face, or their lifeless body cut to pieces by the \nshrapnel, knows that.\n  But it is also contrary to our own interest to be using or selling \nweapons which, without strict controls on their use, cause such \nappalling casualties of\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\ninnocent people who are not the enemy. It fuels anger and resentment we \ncan ill afford among the very people whose support we need.\n  So again I commend the Senator from California and strongly support \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from USA \nToday, dated December 11, 2003, about cluster bombs be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Dec. 11, 2003]\n\n          Cluster Bombs Kill in Iraq, Even After Shooting Ends\n\n                           (By Paul Wiseman)\n\n       Baghdad.--The little canisters dropped onto the city, white \n     ribbons trailing behind. They clattered into streets, landed \n     in lemon trees, rattled around on roofs, settled on lawns.\n       When Jassim al-Qaisi saw the canisters the size of D \n     batteries falling on his neighborhood just before 7 a.m. \n     April 7, he laughed and asked himself: ``Now what are the \n     Americans throwing on our heads?''\n       The strange objects were fired by U.S. artillery outside \n     Baghdad as U.S. forces approached the Iraqi capital. In the \n     span of a few minutes, they would kill four civilians in the \n     ai-Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad and send al-Qaisi's \n     teenage son to the hospital with metal fragments in his foot.\n       The deadly objects were cluster bomblets, small explosives \n     packed by the dozens or hundreds into bombs, rockets or \n     artillery shells known as cluster weapons. When these weapons \n     were fired on Baghdad on April 7, many of the bomblets failed \n     to explode on impact. They were picked up or stumbled on by \n     their victims.\n       The four who died in the al-Dora neighborhood that day \n     lived a few blocks from al-Qaisi's house. Rashid Majid, 58, \n     who was nearsighted, stepped on an unexploded bomblet around \n     the corner from his home. The explosion ripped his legs off. \n     As he lay bleeding in the street, another bomblet exploded a \n     few yards away, instantly killing three young men, including \n     two of Majid's sons--Arkan, 33, and Ghasan, 28. ``My sons! My \n     sons!'' Majid called out. He died a few hours later.\n       The deaths occurred because the world's most modern \n     military, one determined to minimize civilian casualties, \n     went to war with stockpiles of weapons known to endanger \n     civilians and its own soldiers. The weapons claimed victims \n     in the initial explosions and continued to kill afterward, as \n     Iraqis and U.S. forces accidentally detonated bomblets lying \n     around like small land mines.\n       A four-month examination by USA Today of how cluster bombs \n     were used in the Iraq war found dozens of deaths that were \n     unintended but predictable. Although U.S. forces sought to \n     limit what they call ``collateral damage'' in the Iraq \n     campaign, they defied international criticism and used nearly \n     10,800 cluster weapons; their British allies used almost \n     2,200.\n       The bomblets packed inside these weapons wiped out Iraq \n     troop formations and silenced Iraqi artillery. They also \n     killed civilians. These unintentional deaths added to the \n     hostility that has complicated the U.S. occupation. One anti-\n     war group calculates that cluster weapons killed as many as \n     372 Iraqi civilians. The numbers are impossible to verify: \n     Iraqi records are incomplete, and many Iraqi families buried \n     their dead without reporting their deaths.\n       In the most comprehensive report on the use of cluster \n     weapons in Iraq, USA Today visited Iraqi neighborhoods and \n     interviewed dozens of Iraqi families, U.S. troops, teams \n     clearing unexploded ordnance in Iraq, military analysts and \n     humanitarian groups. The findings:\n       The Pentagon presented a misleading picture during the war \n     of the extent to which cluster weapons were being used and of \n     the civilian casualties they were causing. Gen. Richard \n     Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters \n     on April 25, six days before President Bush declared major \n     combat operations over, that the United States had used 1,500 \n     cluster weapons and caused one civilian casualty. It turns \n     out he was referring only to cluster weapons dropped from the \n     air, not those fired by U.S. ground forces.\n       In fact, the United States used 10,782 cluster weapons, \n     according to the declassified executive summary of a report \n     compiled by U.S. Central Command, which oversaw military \n     operations in Iraq. Centcom sent the figures to the Joint \n     Chiefs in response to queries from USA Today and others, \n     but details of the report remain secret.\n       U.S. forces fired hundreds of cluster weapons into urban \n     areas. These strikes, from late March to early April, killed \n     dozens and possibly hundreds of Iraqi civilians. Forty \n     civilians were killed in one neighborhood in Hillah, 60 miles \n     south of Baghdad, say residents and Saad Khazal al-Faluji, a \n     surgeon at Hillah General Hospital who tracked casualties.\n       The attacks also left behind thousands of unexploded \n     bomblets, known as duds, that continued to kill and injure \n     Iraqi civilians weeks after the fighting stopped. U.S. \n     officials say they sought to limit civilian casualties by \n     trying to avoid using cluster munitions. But often \n     alternative weapons were not available or would not have been \n     as effective during the invasion.\n       Unexploded U.S. cluster bomblets remain a threat to U.S. \n     forces in Iraq. They have killed or injured at least eight \n     U.S. troops.\n       The U.S. Air Force, criticized for using cluster bombs that \n     killed civilians during the wars in Vietnam, Kosovo and \n     Afghanistan, has improved its cluster bombs. But U.S. ground \n     forces relied on cluster munitions known to cause a high \n     number of civilian casualties.\n       The Air Force, responding to the criticism, began working \n     on safer cluster bombs in the mid-1990s and started using \n     them in Afghanistan. But the Army started a program to \n     install self-destruct fuses in existing cluster bomblets only \n     after former Defense Secretary William Cohen called in \n     January 2001 for dud rates of no more than 1% after 2005. The \n     safer bomblets won't be available for at least two years. \n     During the war in Iraq, U.S. ground forces dipped into \n     stockpiles of more than 740 million cluster bomblets, all \n     with a history of high dud rates.\n       Senior Army officials in Washington would not answer \n     questions about the Army's use of cluster weapons in Iraq. \n     Maj. Gary Tallman, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said \n     such weapons are effective ``against enemy troop formations \n     and light-skinned vehicles'' and are used only after ``a \n     deliberate decision-making process.''\n\n\n                      Why cluster bombs are deadly\n\n       Cluster bombs have been controversial since they killed \n     thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian civilians \n     during and after the Vietnam War. They have since been used \n     by armies around the world, including Russian forces in \n     Chechnya and Sudanese government troops fighting rebels in a \n     long-running civil war. But their use in urban areas of \n     Iraq has given new momentum to a movement to restrict the \n     use of cluster bombs.\n       Last month, dozens of activist groups hoping to duplicate \n     the success of the campaign to ban land mines formed a \n     coalition aimed at getting a worldwide moratorium on cluster \n     weapons. After seeing the toll the weapons took on Iraqi \n     civilians and their own forces, even some U.S. soldiers have \n     misgivings about using cluster weapons, at least in urban \n     areas.\n       As the war in Iraq approached, humanitarian groups warned \n     the Pentagon against using cluster weapons, especially in \n     urban areas. New York-based Human Rights Watch predicted on \n     March 18, a day before the war began with an airstrike in \n     Baghdad: ``The use of cluster munitions in Iraq will result \n     in grave dangers to civilians and friendly combatants.'' \n     Cluster weapons are especially dangerous to civilians because \n     they spray wide areas with hundreds of bomblets. Most are \n     unguided ``dumb'' weapons, so they can miss their target, and \n     many of the bomblets don't explode immediately.\n       The U.S. military was aware of the threat cluster munitions \n     posed and was determined to minimize them. Col. Lyle Cayce, \n     an Army judge advocate general (JAG), led a team of 14 \n     lawyers providing advice on the battlefield to the 3rd \n     Infantry Division on the use of cluster munitions, as well as \n     other weapons, during its 21-day, 450-mile drive north from \n     Kuwait to Baghdad. The goal was to ensure that U.S. forces \n     complied with international humanitarian law, enshrined in \n     the Geneva Conventions. ``No other army in the world does \n     that,'' Cayce says. ``We value the rule of law.''\n       The Geneva Conventions hold that when choosing which \n     targets to hit and which weapons to use, armies must make \n     sure they do not ``cause superfluous injury or unnecessary \n     suffering'' and ensure that the harm to civilians does not \n     outweigh the military advantages.\n       U.S. forces relied on sophisticated radar to pinpoint the \n     sources of Iraqi fire, then cross-checked them against a \n     computerized list of about 10,000 sensitive sites, such as \n     mosques and schools. Cayce and the other lawyers looked at \n     potential targets and advised U.S. commanders whether the \n     military benefits of using specific weapons against those \n     targets justified the risks to civilians.\n       Cayce gave advice 512 times during the war, usually in \n     cases involving cluster munitions. Most involved sites \n     outside populated areas. Cayce estimates he dealt with only \n     25 to 30 ``controversial missions.'' For example: He approved \n     a strike against an Iraqi artillery battery in a soccer field \n     next to a mosque because it was firing on the 3rd Infantry \n     Division's artillery headquarters.\n       The choices could be agonizing. He says he asked himself, \n     ``How many Americans do I have to let get killed before I \n     take out that (Iraqi) weapons system?'' Ten to 15 times, \n     Cayce advised commanders against firing on a target; they \n     never overruled him. Five times, in fact, they decided \n     against using cluster munitions even after he gave them the \n     go-ahead because they believed the risk to civilians was too \n     great. ``We didn't just shoot there willy-nilly,'' he says.\n       ``It was the enemy who was putting his civilians at risk. . \n     . . They put their artillery right in town. Now who's at \n     fault there?''\n       Rather than call upon their artillery to hit a target with \n     cluster munitions, U.S. ground forces preferred either to use \n     other weapons, such as M-16 rifles or tank rounds, or to \n     summon the Air Force to hit Iraqi targets from the sky with \n     precision bombs. ``Cluster munitions were the last choice, \n     not the first,'' Cayce says.\n       But aircraft frequently were unavailable. Sometimes the \n     weather was bad or sandstorms were swirling. Sometimes Air \n     Force pilots insisted on seeing targets instead of relying on \n     radar readouts. The cluster munitions, especially M26 rockets \n     fired by a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS), had\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\n     greater range than other weapons and were more reliable in \n     bad weather.\n       Commanders also thought an MLRS was better at returning \n     fire and killing the enemy. ``MLRS is ideal for \n     counterfire,'' says Col. Ted Janosko, artillery commander for \n     the Army's V Corps. In fighting on March 31 around Karbala, \n     50 miles south of Baghdad, U.S. forces came under heavy \n     artillery fire from the Iraqis. ``We used (MLRS) rockets to \n     fire back,'' Janosko says. ``As soon as we started using \n     rockets, guess what? We never heard from that unit again. I'm \n     not going to say we killed them all . . . but believe me, \n     they did not fire again from that position.''\n       The 3rd Infantry Division also used MLRS frequently. The \n     rockets can go more than 20 miles, and they spray a wider \n     area than other weapons. The 3rd Infantry fired 794 MLRS \n     rockets during the Iraq war, according to an assessment by \n     two high-ranking division artillery officers in the U.S. Army \n     journal Field Artillery, published at Fort Sill, Okla.\n       As they raced north from Kuwait toward Baghdad in late \n     March and early April, U.S. forces fired rockets and \n     artillery shells loaded with bomblets into Iraqi troop and \n     artillery positions in Hillah, in Baghdad and in other \n     cities. U.S. aircraft sometimes dropped cluster bombs as \n     well.\n       Just before U.S. forces' ``thunder run'' into Baghdad on \n     April 7, the 3rd Infantry Division fired 24 MLRS cluster \n     rockets into Iraqi positions at an important intersection in \n     the capital. The damage assessment, recounted in the Field \n     Artillery article: ``There's nothing left but burning trucks \n     and body parts.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reiterate my opposition to this \namendment. The rules of engagement properly belong with the Department \nof Defense and the Commander in Chief. This amends and sets forth \nrestrictions on the ability of our military to use these munitions to \nprotect our people in the future. It also would put on our military and \nour executive branch the duty of trying to determine how weapons might \nbe used in the future, should they sell these weapons to other \ncountries.\n  We have been informed that this amendment is opposed by the \nDepartment of Defense. It is their determination that once the weapons \nhave been transferred to a country under a sale that is permitted, it \nwould not be possible to enforce this restriction. They point out the \nArms Export Control Act already has broad guidelines on the use of \nweapons sold by the United States. And if that act is violated, the \nUnited States may impose sanctions and deny sale or transfer of weapons \nin the future, and has, as it did in 1982, sanctioned a country for \nmisusing such weapons, not these in particular but the weapons that had \nbeen sold.\n  The Senator from California said if anyone wants to stand up and talk \nabout using these munitions, they ought to defend them. Some of the \ninstances which the Senator from California mentioned were years ago \nwhen the areas were not occupied by civilians at all. And later the \ncivilians moved into the areas, areas that had not been cleared \nproperly by the country involved. I think that is a dangerous \nsituation. Obviously, it is a difficult situation.\n  But I would urge her to go back to the countries she mentioned and \nreconsider the reason for the use of these weapons in the past--in \nKorea, in Vietnam. I do not think we used them in Spain. But they were \nused in Spain after having been sold to Spain. The concepts here are \nimpossible for our commanders to protect our forces with the \nprohibitions that are involved. It is impossible for us to enforce.\n  We have a population of approximately 300 million people. We are \ninvolved in situations throughout the world and have been. Just \nremember the ``Marines' Hymn: From the halls of Montezuma to the shores \nof Tripoli.'' We have been doing this for years, protecting our system \nabroad and protecting freedom abroad. It is not the province of the \nSenate to enact rules of engagement. We authorize people to do it, and \nwe review them--if you want to have a hearing on it and review the \nrules of engagement, I will be pleased to participate in such a \nhearing--but we do not write them. And we should not attempt to \nrestrict them. I think this would place a dangerous restriction on the \noptions available to our commanders, as I have said.\n  If the issue is a relatively high rate of existing inventory, as the \nSenator indicates, then the solution is to replace these munitions with \nimproved items, many of which are not possible to manufacture now \nbecause of existing restrictions on such manufacturing.\n  I do not believe it can be shown we have used these weapons \nindiscriminately in civilian areas. I believe civilians have moved into \nareas where they have been used in defense of our country and defense \nof our people.\n  So under the circumstances, I oppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is my understanding this is the time \nset for the vote on Senator Feinstein's amendment. Have the yeas and \nnays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am here to join with my colleague, \nSenator Paul Sarbanes, to offer an amendment, which we have at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, and \n     Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 4895.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n  made available by this Act may be used to enter into or carry out a \n  contract for the performance by a contractor of any base operation \n  support service at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital pursuant to a \n  private-public competition conducted under Office of Management and \n Budget Circular A-76 that was initiated on June 13, 2000, and has the \n                 solicitation number DADA 10-03-R-0001)\n\n       On page 218, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8109. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to enter into or carry out \n     a contract for the performance by a contractor of any base \n     operation support service at Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Hospital pursuant to a\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\n     private-public competition conducted under Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular A-76 that was initiated on \n     June 13, 2000, and has the solicitation number DADA 10-03-R-\n     0001.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSarbanes be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thought we had an agreement to stand \nin recess at 12:30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I thought \nthere was an agreement for us to offer this amendment and not ask for a \nvote on this amendment. Had the Senate followed the regular order, we \nwould have been done with the other business, the pending business on \ncluster bombs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Was there an order for the recess at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order to recess. The Senator from \nMaryland will need unanimous consent in order to proceed beyond the \nhour of 12:30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I apologize. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the session be extended for 10 additional minutes so that Senator \nSarbanes and I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield? I thought the amendment had been \noffered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No, it has not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Is the \namendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And we have this unanimous consent request to take 10 \nminutes in order to proceed; we are trying to help the chairman move \nthis process along.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have no objection to offering the \namendment and making comments about its introduction. The Senator wants \n10 minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We will move briskly. This is to fix a terribly botched \ncompetition for Federal jobs at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. \nThis competition has wasted taxpayer money. It is unfair to Federal \nemployees, and we urge that it stop. We are opposed to this because it \nhas gone on too long, it is unfair, it has broken the rules, and cost \ntaxpayers an incredible amount of money.\n  I do wish at this time, though, to pay tribute to the distinguished \nSenators, the chair and the ranking member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. We \nhave had no finer, more hard-working champions for Walter Reed and \nmilitary medicine than those two men. So in raising this amendment, we \nunderstand where they are and why they also don't want to get into \nindividual privatization issues, but this was such an egregious, unfair \nprocess, we felt we had to do this.\n  This amendment would privatize 350 jobs at Walter Reed, mostly \nlandscapers and maintenance workers.\n  Why is this A-76 so flawed? Well, the competition has broken the \nrules. It has gone on and on and on. It is deeply flawed. It is \ndisastrous. It started in June of 2000. It has lasted more than 6 \nyears, beyond a full Senate term and longer than a President's term. \nOMB says that it should not have gone on more than 12 months, but this \ncompetition has gone on for more than 6 years. Federal employees in \n2004 September were declared the winner of this competition, only to \nhave the decision reversed 2 years later--not 2 days, not 2 weeks, but \n2 years. Then DOD kept putting out new plans. They announced a new plan \nwhere they amended it 16 times. Every time the Federal employees won, \nthe Army came up with a new rule. The last amendment included 1,500 \nchanges. This was the 49th month of this solicitation, and once again \nthey said: Let's start over. They keep changing the rules every time \nthe Federal employees win, and then finally they lost it in 2006 after \nthis chaos.\n  Now, does contracting out save money? You bet, sometimes, but not \nthis time. It has already cost the military $7 million to conduct this \nprivatization. It is going to cost another $5 million to implement. \nWhen the demands on Walter Reed are so high, when we have a war that \nhas no line item, should we be spending tax dollars to implement a \nprogram that will not save it? This will not save the taxpayers' money.\n  Also, I bring to my colleagues' attention that Walter Reed will be \nclosing in just a couple of years. Why privatize now? It is a solution \nthat is wrong. The competition was flawed. It does not save taxpayers' \nmoney. Sure, we understand contracting out when it is legal, when it is \nfair, when it saves taxpayers' money and maintains integrity. This \namendment will eliminate the funding to carry this out, and we urge its \nadoption at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I wish to very strongly underscore the \narguments made by my very able colleague, Senator Mikulski, with \nrespect to this amendment. I am very pleased to join with her in \noffering it.\n  This amendment would put an end to a very costly and flawed A-76 \ncompetitive sourcing study at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which \nis, of course, one of our foremost military hospitals. There have been \nnumerous and serious flaws in the conduct of this A-76 study. The study \nhas been going on now for 6 years--contrary to law governing the A-76 \nprocess. As a result, it has been extraordinarily expensive and \npromises to be even more expensive if completed.\n  The Federal employees actually were declared the winner of this \ncompetition in September of 2004, only to have that decision reversed \nearlier this year. The decision was reversed after a whole new set of \namendments were made with respect to the bidding process. In fact, the \nsolicitation has been amended a number of times with hundreds of \nchanges, making the process terribly unfair to everyone involved. This \nparticular A-76 is so egregious that it ought to be brought to an end, \nand that is what this amendment proposes to do.\n  I believe the situation as it currently stands is also having a \ndetrimental impact on the work being done at Walter Reed. The A-76 \nstudy covers base operation support services--workers who deal in \nlandscaping and maintenance. The requirements now are that these A-76 \nprocesses cannot go on for more than 30 months--in part to avoid such a \ndisruption in the workforce. However, this study has been going on for \nmore than 6 years. Obviously it is having an impact on the morale of \nthe employees and resulting in a loss in productivity. So I urge my \ncolleagues to be supportive of this amendment, which will bring this \ncostly and flawed A-76 study to an end and help Walter Reed maintain \nthe high level of services which characterizes that fine institution.\n  I would also add that the BRAC Commission has recommended the \nconsolidation of Walter Reed with the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. \nThat is supposed to take place over the next few years. That seems to \nme to be an additional argument for adopting this amendment.\n  In other words, in a very short period of time, Walter Reed will move \nto a new campus where we will be developing a new, more modern, \nmilitary hospital. At that point, the base operations workforce will \nhave to be reshaped to fit the needs of this new facility.\n  So I urge my colleagues to respect the reasonable rules of the \nbidding process, rules which have been so departed from in this \ninstance. We should adopt this amendment to ensure that this and other \ncompetitive sourcing studies are conducted pursuant to the laws and \nregulations governing the A-76 process.\n  I very strongly support my colleague. I commend her for her important \nleadership on this issue. Let's be fair to the employees. Let's honor a \nreasonable bidding process with its own rules and requirements.\n  If Federal jobs are to be subject to the competitive sourcing \nprocess, Federal agencies should follow the rules and requirements \ngoverning that process. That has not been done in this instance, which \nis the reason I support\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nthe amendment that is pending before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S8998-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the distinguished Democratic leader seeks \nrecognition now. I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader be \nrecognized immediately following Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will at an appropriate time send an \namendment to the desk. The amendment will read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate on the Need for a New \n     Direction in Iraq Policy and in the Civilian Leadership of \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n  Here are the findings.\n\n       1. U.S. forces have served honorably and courageously in \n     Iraq, with over 2,600 brave Americans having made the \n     ultimate sacrifice and over 20,000 wounded.\n       2. The current ``stay the course'' policy in Iraq has made \n     America less secure, reduced the readiness of our troops, and \n     burdened America's taxpayers with over $300 billion in \n     additional debt.\n       3. With weekly attacks against American and Iraqi troops at \n     their highest levels since the start of the war, and \n     sectarian violence intensifying, it is clear that staying the \n     course in Iraq is not a strategy for success.\n       Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       1. Our troops deserve and the American people expect the \n     Bush Administration to provide competent civilian leadership \n     and a true strategy for success in Iraq.\n       2. President Bush needs to change course in Iraq to provide \n     a strategy for success. One indication of a change of course \n     would be to replace the current Secretary of Defense.\n       In war, strategy is the searchlight that illuminates the \n     way ahead. In its absence, the U.S. military would fight hard \n     and well but blindly and the noble sacrifices of soldiers \n     would be undercut by the lack of thoughtful leadership at the \n     top that soberly assessed the realities of the situation and \n     constructed a response.\n\n  That is a direct quote from a book called ``Fiasco,'' which was \nwritten by Washington Post senior Pentagon correspondent, Thomas Ricks. \nThe quote concerns a war and a Secretary of Defense I would like to \ntalk about today. The war is Iraq, the Secretary of Defense is Donald \nRumsfeld.\n  For me, it was not a quick or easy decision to come to the floor to \ndemand that President Bush replace Secretary Rumsfeld. I have always \nheld the opinion that the President of the United States deserves ample \nleeway in determining who serves in his Cabinet. Regrettably, after 5 \nyears of mismanagement and mistakes in Iraq that have made America less \nsafe, the time for that leeway has passed. So, today, as I have \nindicated, I will offer an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat President Bush replace Secretary Rumsfeld immediately.\n  This amendment is bigger than Donald Rumsfeld. This is about changing \ncourse in Iraq and the President demonstrating to the American people \nhe understands America cannot stay the course when the present course \nis taking our country in the wrong direction. The United States \ncurrently has about 140,000 soldiers serving in far away Iraq. \nThousands have served coming from Nevada. Hundreds are there right now. \nThey are bravely performing their jobs, but it is time for the \nPresident to do his and chart a new direction in that far away land \ncalled Iraq.\n  In the last month, scores of U.S. soldiers and marines have been \nkilled. Hundreds of U.S. troops have been wounded. More than a thousand \nIraqis have been killed. American taxpayers have lost another $12 \nbillion to this mismanaged war. The totals for this conflict now \napproach 2,700 Americans killed and over 20,000 Americans wounded. A \nthird of these wounded soldiers and marines are missing arms, legs, \neyes. They are paralyzed or coping with brain injuries, and over $300 \nbillion of debt already has been expended for which the American \ntaxpayer must foot the bill.\n  Today, because of Iraq, the readiness of our troops has declined to \nlevels not seen since Vietnam. There is not a single Army nondeployed \ncombat brigade that is currently prepared to meet its wartime mission. \nI repeat, not a single nondeployed combat brigade is currently prepared \nto meet its wartime mission. And the Chief of the National Guard has \nsaid the Guard is ``even further behind or in an even more dire \nsituation than the Army.''\n  In peacetime such a state of our military would be disturbing. At a \ntime of war, this is unacceptable. The facts on the ground do not lie. \nAll the speeches by President Bush, all the speeches by the Vice \nPresident, all the speeches by Secretary Rumsfeld do not change what is \ntaking place on the ground in that desert called Iraq. The current \ncourse in Iraq is not working, not for our military, not for the Iraqi \npeople, and not for our security.\n  Five years after the attacks of September 11, 2001, America is not as \nsafe as it needs to be. Secretary Rumsfeld and the Bush White House \nhave mastered the politics of national security, but as we have seen \nday after day, week after week, month after month, in Iraq they have \nfailed to do what it takes to make America safe.\n\n  This is not a personal attack. I am not looking to pick a fight with \nSecretary Rumsfeld or the President of the United States, but it is \nabout making America as safe as we can and should be. Secretary \nRumsfeld's failed track record is well documented, and the consequences \nof his mismanagement on American national security are well known. \nSecretary Rumsfeld was a leading participant in the administration's \ncherry-picking and manipulation of intelligence in the run-up to the \nwar, exaggerating Iraq's connections to al-Qaida and the threat posed \nby its weapons of mass destruction--which didn't exist.\n  As a result of his and others' actions, our Nation was rushed to war \nbased on faulty facts, and the Pentagon is now spending $20 million on \na public relations campaign to rebrand the war to the American people. \nNew money, $20 million--public relations.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld was one of those who ignored the advice of the \nuniformed military and went into battle in Iraq with too few troops and \nno plan--no plan to win the peace. As a result, the insurgency was able \nto gain a foothold in Iraq, and now even the Pentagon is forced to \nconclude that civil and sectarian strife threatens our troops and the \nfuture of the country of Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld was the one who \ndirected disbanding the Iraqi Army and purging of all Baath Party \nofficials from the Iraqi Government. His lack of preparation delayed \nthe training of Iraqi security forces for untold time.\n  As a result, here we are, more than 3 years later, with not a single \nIraqi Army battalion that can operate independently--not one. We should \nremember the Secretary's mistakes are not all buried in the past. Just \nlast week he demonstrated again he is not the man for the job. As he \nspoke to the American Legion this became very clear. His remarks were \nwrong, they were unnecessary, and they were a slap in the face to every \nAmerican.\n  Rumsfeld's speech was filled with reckless, irresponsible assertions, \nbut the most insulting and misguided words compared the critics of the \nBush administration's Iraq policy to those who appeased the Nazis, \nleading to World War II--a statement made by our Secretary of Defense. \nThese assertions were offensive and indicative of a Secretary of \nDefense who has lost his way, who is not capable of overseeing \nAmerica's defense or certainly a new direction in Iraq; who is more \nconcerned, it seems, with the Bush administration's political fortunes \nthan the safety and security of the American people; and who must be \nreplaced.\n  Keith Olbermann of NBC observed, after Rumsfeld's comments, as \nfollows:\n\n       [His speech] did not merely serve to impugn the morality or \n     intelligence--indeed the loyalty--of the majority of \n     Americans who oppose the transient occupants of the highest \n     offices in the land. Worse, still, it credits those same \n     transient occupants--our\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\n     employees--with a total omniscience; a total omniscience \n     which neither common sense, nor this administration's track \n     record abroad, suggests they deserve.\n\n  We need to change course, and it starts at the top with President \nBush.\n  Before anyone dismisses this amendment as partisan politics, I would \nlike to remind my colleagues that Democrats are not alone in \ncriticizing the poor performance, the faulty performance, the \nunfortunate performance of Secretary Rumsfeld. In fact, on page 18 of \nthe Hill newspaper today, there is a full story on all the Republicans \nwho oppose Secretary Rumsfeld and say that he should leave.\n  From the military we have heard from at least eight retired generals \nhave called for his resignation. These are some of the best of the \nbest. Who are these eight? Are they fly-by-nighters? Do they have any \nability to speak, to say Rumsfeld should go? Who are they?\n  Retired MG Charles Swannack, former commander of the Army's 82nd \nAirborne Division--that is a real soldier; retired MG John Batiste--\nwhom we have all met; he used to come and brief us here--who commanded \nthe Army's 1st Infantry Division in Iraq in 2003 and 2004. I would \nthink he would know or have some idea of the competency of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Third, Marine LTG Greg Newbold; No. 4, MG Paul Eaton, who was in \ncharge of training Iraqi troops in 2003 and 2004; Former NATO Commander \nWesley Clark, a four-star general; Army MG John Riggs; Marine GEN \nAnthony Zinni, the former Commander of the United States Central \nCommand; LTG Paul van Riper, United States Marine Corps, Director of \nthe Command and Staff College, Quantico, VA.\n  Those are just eight. There are many more.\n  From the Republican side of the aisle, we not only have page 18 of \nthe Hill--anyone within sound of my voice can read that. I am not going \nto go through all the names. We have heard, though, from Senators in \nthis body--Senators McCain and Hagel, two war heroes from Vietnam. John \nMcCain served in a prison war camp for years--not months, years. \nSenator Hagel saved his brother from death in the battlefields of \nVietnam. Both are highly decorated. I repeat, two heroes of Vietnam who \nhave been harsh critics of the Secretary of Defense have said they have \nno confidence in Rumsfeld. Senator Hagel said:\n\n       The concern I've had is, at a very dangerous time, (the) \n     Secretary of Defense does not command the respect and \n     confidence of our men and women in uniform . . . There is no \n     real question about his capacity to lead at this critical \n     time.\n\n  This is Senator Hagel quoted in the Lincoln Journal Star.\n  In the House of Representatives, the list is very long. I will not \nname all of the Members. Longtime Congressman Chris Shays from \nConnecticut, who has been in Iraq 14 times, is quoted in today's New \nYork Times as saying he would vote for an amendment of ``no \nconfidence'' if it came to the House of Representatives.\n  These men are card-carrying conservatives. If we go out of Congress, \nwe can find other leading conservatives. How about William Kristol?\n\n       Actually, we have a pretty terrific Army. It's performed a \n     lot better in this war than the secretary of defense has . . \n     . Surely Don Rumsfeld is not the defense secretary Bush \n     should want to have for the remainder of his second term.\n\n  From the Washington Post, that is a direct quote.\n  Across the country and in my own State of Nevada, people from all \nwalks of life have called for Donald Rumsfeld to step down, asking the \nPresident to make a change. This would be a start in the change of \ndirection. There is a reason for this bipartisan groundswell: Having \nthe right leadership to keep America safe is not a partisan issue; it \nis a national priority.\n  Today in the Senate, I hope we see similar bipartisan support for \nthis amendment, this vote of no confidence. There is no better way for \nthe Senate to show the American people and, indeed, the world that we \nare committed to success in Iraq and a more secure America than by \ndemanding that President Bush find leadership from the Pentagon that \nmatches the skill, determination, and commitment of our valiant troops. \nWe need a vote on this amendment. It cannot fall to parliamentary \ntricks. Our troops and the American people must be given the \nopportunity to see that the Senate stands with them in seeking a new \ndirection for our country.\n  This amendment, which I will send to the desk later, says:\n\nSense of the Senate on the Need for a New Direction in Iraq Policy and \n        in the Civilian Leadership of the Department of Defense\n\n     Findngs:\n       1. U.S. forces have served honorably and courageously in \n     Iraq, with over 2,600 brave Americans having made the \n     ultimate sacrifice and over 20,000 wounded.\n       2. The current ``stay the course'' policy in Iraq has made \n     America less secure, reduced the readiness of our troops, and \n     burdened America's taxpayers with over $300 billion in \n     additional debt.\n       3. With weekly attacks against American and Iraqi troops at \n     their highest levels since the start of the war, and \n     sectarian violence intensifying, it is clear that staying the \n     course in Iraq is not a strategy for success.\n\n       Therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       1. Our troops deserve and the American people expect the \n     Bush Administration to provide competent civilian leadership \n     and a true strategy for success in Iraq.\n       2. President Bush needs to change course in Iraq to provide \n     a strategy for success. One indication of a change of course \n     would be to replace the current Secretary of Defense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, the Democrat \nleader, the Senator from Nevada, is a close friend. I am sad to \ndisagree with him as violently as I do.\n  I have known Secretary Rumsfeld, Don Rumsfeld, for many years. He \ncame to Washington with Congressman Jerry Ford. He has been in and out \nof Washington. He has done a great many things, committed a great \nportion of his life to the service of this country. He is highly \nintelligent. He is one of the first persons to serve as Secretary of \nDefense twice. He served previously as Secretary of Defense. He was a \nperson who served in the White House. He has been a very impressive \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Since 1981, either Senator Inouye or I have been the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. During that time, we have met with \nSecretaries of Defense. I met with them prior to that time, and I \nserved in the Eisenhower administration and knew the Secretaries of \nDefense then and knew them personally. I can think of no one who has \nworked harder as Secretary of Defense than Don Rumsfeld.\n  I have been in meetings with him and members of the Joint Chiefs--\nwith all of the Joint Chiefs--with other members of the defense and \nintelligence establishment. The rapport he has built up among those who \nserve this country in uniform and serve this country in the \nintelligence field is overwhelming. I have been to meetings he has held \nwith the Chiefs, just quiet dinner meetings, to discuss basic subjects \nthat were part of our jurisdiction, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee jurisdiction. I have seen the way those people interact \nwith Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  I know some people say there are dissidents in the Department of \nDefense. It would be surprising in a country as large as ours, with a \nDefense Department as large as ours, if there were not some. I do \nbelieve he has the support of those who are involved in managing our \nactivities at home and abroad now in the defense area. He has a steady \nhand. I know he has the trust of the President. I admire the work he \nhas done.\n  I find it unfortunate that this bill will be held up now for a period \nof time debating the future of Secretary Rumsfeld. I say categorically \nthat this amendment is nongermane to this bill. It is subject to a \npoint of order. I will make the point of order when the amendment is \nlaid down. Everyone realizes that.\n  The time we take to discuss this subject is going to delay getting \nthis bill to the President to be signed. I repeat what I have been \nsaying for over a month: it must be to the President and signed and the \nmoney ready to be allocated on October 1. The funds are absolutely \nnecessary this time. There will be no bridge for this period. These \nmoneys must be available. I hope Members of the Senate will be brief. I \nwill be reasonably brief in terms of what I am saying about my good \nfriend, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\n  He has forged close relationships. He has earned senior military \nleaders' confidence. Just 2 weeks ago, I was in Fairbanks with him when \nhe dedicated the Lend-Lease Memorial, the memorial to those Army Air \nCorps pilots who flew planes to Fairbanks and the Russian pilots who \nflew the planes on into Russia, going across the Bering Strait, going \nacross Siberia, going across the Urals and into the area where they \ncould be used in the defense of the Allies against the Nazi challenge \nto the world. Secretary Rumsfeld was overwhelming.\n  The interesting thing was our partner at the dinner table was the \nSecretary of Defense from Russia--a gentleman with a great deal of \ncapability, by the way. He speaks English very well. We had a \ndelightful conversation about the past, about the war.\n  It was my honor to serve in World War II as an Army Air Corps pilot. \nI was pleased to see so many of my colleagues. Everyone was delighted \nwith Secretary Rumsfeld and was overwhelmed to have their pictures \ntaken with him.\n  This man deserves the support of the Senate. He does not deserve the \nopposition, I am sad to say, in my opinion, on a purely political \nbasis. There may be some on this side of the aisle who have lost \nconfidence, but this Senator has not.\n  I hope and I pray that Members of the Senate will be reasonably brief \nin their comments on this proposal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will eventually address my own remarks, \nbut as the distinguished Democratic leader spoke, we had the majority \nleader here. It was his intention, of course, to follow the Democratic \nleader with his remarks. He was called to the White House, and \ntherefore we will have to hear from our distinguished majority leader \nlater in the day on this matter.\n  If I could ask my colleagues across the aisle, perhaps we could \nalternate. Senator Stevens has spoken; perhaps I could follow your next \nspeaker as a matter of comity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say initially----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still have the floor. I am happy to yield. I want to \nhave the consent entered into. If the Senator from Illinois is willing \nto enter into the agreement, we can go back and forth across the aisle. \nI am happy to agree to that unanimous consent with that understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say initially that I am sure during the course of \nthe debate there will be many raising the question of whether we should \nspend this time on this debate. The fact that we might spend 4 hours on \nthe debate over a war we are now facing for our fourth year indicates \nthat it truly is appropriate.\n  What we would like to do is ask unanimous consent that the following \nDemocratic Senators be recognized in the order as stated with the \nunderstanding that if a Republican Senator seeks recognition, they \nwould be recognized in alternating fashion.\n\n  I will read the list of Democratic Senators in the order in which \nthey will speak: Senators Schumer, Durbin, Levin, Reed of Rhode Island, \nKerry, Clinton, Kennedy, Harkin, Boxer, Dayton, Carper, Dorgan, Murray, \nand Mikulski.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point in time, I reserve, with the \nunderstanding that I encourage it be agreed to, but the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, the Senator from Alaska, and others are going to \nwork on the sequencing over here, so I wonder if we could just \ninformally say we will follow that until such time as one of these two \ncome over and agree.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Virginia, this only \nreflects the order of the Democratic speakers, but if the Senator would \nlike to withhold the agreement of this until the Senator has his \ncomplete list----\n  Mr. WARNER. A list, thank you.\n  Mr. DURBIN.--I am happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer from New \nYork be recognized for this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know we have a long \nlist of Members who wish to speak on this weighty and important matter.\n  First, I compliment the minority leader. The resolution he has put \nforward is well thought out and covers a range of issues for those who \nbelieve the war in Iraq needs a new direction; therefore, I am proud to \nsupport this resolution. I hope we can get bipartisan support for it. \nMost Americans--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--believe we \nneed a new direction in Iraq. That is what this resolution personifies.\n  Our troops on the ground and their loved ones here at home deserve a \nclear policy, a plan, from this administration--not rhetoric, not name-\ncalling, not ``kneecapping''--a plan, a direction. We cannot continue \nto pour lives and resources into Iraq without a clear plan for \ntransitioning the security of Iraq to Iraqis. With the insurgency \ndiving into civil war, we need to come up with this plan now.\n  No Americans anticipated that the main goal of our troops would be to \npolice a civil war, knowing the longtime hatred between the Shiites and \nthe Sunnis, between the Shiites and the Kurds, and the Sunnis and the \nKurds. Yet that is what this war is devolving into right now.\n  In sum, to fight a war on terror, we need to be both strong and \nsmart. With Secretary Rumsfeld and this administration, you do see a \ngreat deal of strength, but we do not see enough of the smarts. We can \nhave both. The two are not contradictory.\n  Furthermore, Secretary Rumsfeld's comments last month before the \nAmerican Legion show he does not get it. The President's comments \nyesterday show he doesn't get it. We do not need to be reminded that \nOsama bin Laden is still alive. It is 5 years since September 11, and \nhe is still alive. We will address that in an amendment both colleagues \nfrom North Dakota will bring up.\n  Certainly, when Secretary Rumsfeld tries to draw the analogy to World \nWar II, the analogy is flawed. Back in the late 1930s, indeed, there \nwere many Americans who wished to appease Hitler and thought he could \nbe won over. I don't know of an American who thinks we can appease the \nterrorists, al-Qaida and the others who strike against us. It is a \nfalse analogy. I dare them to name a single Member of this Senate or \nthe other body or anyone else who is seeking appeasements of the \nterrorists.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's speech in Utah was a low point. We got a lot of \nname-calling, more slogans, but for all the hype, we did not get any \nnew policies. One has to ask: Is the name-calling, is the hype--are \nthere imperfect historical analogies made because there is no plan? \nThat is what it seems to be.\n  When the American people--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--\nare crying out, in droves, for a change in direction and a new policy, \nwe hear none. We never get a plan. Unfortunately, we also often do not \nget straight answers.\n  When Secretary Rumsfeld was asked by a member of our Armed Forces \nabout the lack of body armor, he could not give a direct and forthright \nanswer. We must get answers on what has gone wrong. We need to hear a \nplan for getting it right. Unfortunately, we have heard neither from \nthis administration, and particularly our Secretary of Defense.\n  This is not even about the end game because that is the President's \nresponsibility. And we are going to be focusing on President Bush \nrepeatedly on that issue. This is also about the implementation of the \nadministration's own goals, and that falls on Secretary Rumsfeld's \nshoulders.\n  When a schoolteacher tells one of our colleagues, Senator Dorgan, \nthat she had to pay for the body armor for her son who was in Iraq, \nsomething is wrong with the implementation. That does not go to the \nplan. That does not go to whether you are a hawk or dove. Everyone \nwould think our troops would need body armor. Yet tens of thousands did \nnot get it on Secretary Rumsfeld's watch.\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\n  When Iraq was supposed to have, by now, a self-sufficient army that \ncould guard against a civil war, and it is not even close, the \nimplementation of that falls on Secretary Rumsfeld's shoulders. Not \neven discussing whether democratization is right, it has not been done \nappropriately or properly.\n  So to say that Secretary Rumsfeld should be removed from office does \nnot let the President off the hook. He is responsible for the policies, \nand those are not working. But Secretary Rumsfeld has not only gone \nalong with those policies, he has been the lead figure in the failure \nof the actual implementation of those policies.\n  Democrats want new strategies and new ideas to fight a strong war on \nterror, to secure the peace in Iraq. We certainly do not want the \ncontinuation of the status quo, which is clearly not moving Iraq in the \nright direction.\n  There have been major tactical failures which Secretary Rumsfeld and \nthe administration refuse to admit: failure to protect vital \ninfrastructure, failure to protect the streets from looters and \nviolence, failure to protect a strong Iraqi security force.\n  However, these failures are among many, and they are things that \nneither the President nor Secretary Rumsfeld will own up to, much less \naddress.\n  People in this administration, this week, are giving a lot of \nspeeches on this topic. But they never talk about a plan, a change in \ndirection, what we are doing wrong, why it has not worked, and what has \nto change to make it right. If you ignore the realities and simply \nengage in a game of name-calling and sloganeering, you are never going \nto solve the very real problems.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the bottom line is very simple: The \nAmerican people want some answers. What is the game plan in Iraq? How \nare we going to win the war on terror? We need answers to these \nquestions and a new direction in Iraq. Removing Secretary Rumsfeld from \noffice will be a first step to accomplishing that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am afraid if my Democratic colleagues spent half the time helping \nus fight this war on terror as they do attacking the administration we \nwould be a lot closer to winning this war. But, unfortunately, they are \nvery united in defeatism, in their negative attacks on the President, \nand, in the process, encouraging terrorists all around the world, \nsending the signal that America is frustrated and ready to quit.\n  America is not ready to quit.\n  As they continue their attacks, I would like to remind them of the \nprogress we have made since President Bush took office. Before \nPresident Bush took office, after 8 years of President Clinton's \nadministration, Afghanistan was a worldwide staging area for terrorism, \nwhere the training took place, communications were organized, financing \ntook place. Iraq was sitting on multiple chemical weapons in defiance \nof the United Nations resolution. Numerous terrorist attacks had \noccurred against our warships, our embassies. And our administration, \nunder President Clinton, did nothing.\n  Again, terrorism was unchallenged and undetected. President Clinton \nwas doing exactly what our Democratic colleagues want President Bush to \ndo now. They tried to stop the PATRIOT Act so that we would not have \nthe tools to fight terrorism. They have tried to stop the interception \nof communications from terrorists into this country so we could not \nfind out who they were and what they were planning. They have \ncomplained about tracing the financing of terrorism around the world--\nwhen this President took action.\n\n  We need to remind our Democratic colleagues that before President \nBush took office, 9/11 had already been planned under the Clinton \nadministration, been financed. The communication was set up. All the \ntools that the President needs and has used to protect us were not used \nthen. So 9/11 has happened.\n  But since 9/11, this President took action. And with the support of \nthis Congress, he along with his staff has changed Afghanistan. \nAfghanistan is no longer the staging area for terrorism. And a signal \nhas been sent to any country that does it.\n  Afghanistan is now a democracy. Women can vote and go to school. Iraq \nno longer has control of their arsenal of chemical weapons. Iraq is \nmoving toward a democracy, admittedly with many difficulties.\n  But if our Democratic colleagues had their way, Iraq would become the \nnew staging area for terrorists. Being between Iran and Syria, if we \nleave before this country can stand up on its own, everyone knows it \nwill be in the hands of terrorists.\n  We cannot retreat. We must fight this global war that has been \ndeclared on us. There is a reason there has been no attacks in this \ncountry since 9/11. It is because we have been attacking the terrorists \nall around the world.\n  The Democrats are united. They are united in the idea of retreat and \ndefeatism. They attack this President with no ideas of their own. They \nare trying to take the tools to fight terrorism away from this \nPresident--the PATRIOT Act, the interception of communications, tracing \nfinances. On every turn, the Democrats are obstructing the things that \nhave changed with this President that allowed terrorism to grow \nunchallenged for 8 years under the Clinton administration.\n  Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stooped to \nattacking members of the President's Cabinet. I think it is time to get \nthis amendment off the table. It is not germane. We need to get back to \nthe business of approving the resources that our soldiers need.\n  I would appeal to my Democratic colleagues to stop performing for an \naudience and help us fight this war on terror.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from South Carolina \nis still on the Senate floor because I want to make clear that debating \nthe war in Iraq is not a performance. It is part of our responsibility. \nThis is the world's, maybe the Nation's, greatest deliberative body. \nAnd if we do not take a few hours to address the policies and \nstrategies in Iraq, then we are not living up to our responsibility.\n  The Senator from South Carolina went on to say that we tried to stop \nthe PATRIOT Act. The Senator was not here when the PATRIOT Act was \nconsidered. He was still a Member of the House, and he may not know \nwhat happened. But with the exception of one Member on our side of the \naisle, every Senator voted for the passage of the PATRIOT Act. It was a \nstrong bipartisan vote. Also, for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct, it was a strong bipartisan vote.\n  When it came to obstructing the President's efforts in Iraq, I will \nconcede I was 1 of 23 Senators who voted against the authorization of \nforce. But I have voted for every penny this President has asked for to \nwage this war in Iraq. On a bipartisan basis, we have provided this \nPresident with every resource. So this version of the past which the \nSenator from South Carolina has recounted, I think, is deficient in \nmany respects. I hope when he reviews the record he will realize that.\n  I will also tell you that I believe this is an important debate \ntoday, and it is, of course, focused on the Secretary of Defense but, \nmore importantly, focused on our strategy in Iraq. The Democratic side \nof the aisle believes we need a strategy for success. We need to make \ncertain that when we do leave Iraq, it is with our mission truly \naccomplished. And that means, of course, changing direction on our \npolicies in Iraq.\n  As we pass this bill, which will add to the nearly $300 billion in \nour national security effort, we continue to make a great investment in \nIraq--no greater investment than the human lives that have been lost by \nour brave American soldiers who have served there. Yet it is our \nresponsibility, in fact I think it is our constitutional \nresponsibility, to question the policies of the administration when we \ndisagree with them.\n  Retired GEN Wesley Clark stated yesterday that our Nation made a \nstrategic mistake in invading Iraq.\n  We went into that war on the basis of poor intelligence, with too few \ntroops, and without the necessary equipment. Our troops paid a heavy \nprice for those decisions.\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n  Today, we face a situation in Iraq which the Pentagon told us last \nweek is dangerously close to civil war. We cannot continue along this \nsame pattern. Our soldiers deserve better.\n  If we are to change policy in Iraq, we need new leadership at the \nDepartment of Defense. We need a fresh start. We need a new team. We \nneed a new direction when it comes to our strategy in Iraq.\n  Our Armed Forces have shown extraordinary courage. They have done \neverything we have asked of them. With courage and with dedication they \nhave adapted to conditions on the ground with enormous skill and \ningenuity. But decisions by the leadership at the highest levels of the \nGovernment--at the White House and at the Department of Defense--\nhave magnified the challenges our troops face.\n\n  I listened as the Senator from South Carolina talked about nuclear \nweapons in Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. I am sure he did not \nmean to state that we found those weapons of mass destruction because, \ndespite the best efforts of our Government, we have found no evidence \nof the weapons of mass destruction we were told were the reason we had \nto invade this country. We have found no evidence of the nuclear \nweapons program which we were told threatened the United States with \nmushroom clouds.\n  So to suggest today, as some still do, that there really were weapons \nof mass destruction when we invaded Iraq, we have never found them, and \nit is an indication that the American people were misled, misled from \nthe highest levels of our Government as to the true threat against the \nUnited States. That is, indeed, unfortunate. And it is unfortunate, as \nwell, that the President, the Vice President, as well as the Secretary \nof Defense, and others, made statements that misled us into believing \nthat there were threats in Iraq that clearly did not exist.\n  But when we talk of the record of the Secretary of Defense, even \nbeyond the misleading statements which led to our war, the fact is that \nat a moment in time the Secretary of Defense said to the President: We \nare ready to go to war.\n  We know now we were not ready to go to war.\n  Do you recall on February 25, 2003, Army Chief of Staff GEN Eric \nShinseki testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee? He \nstated that, in an invasion of Iraq, ``any postwar occupying force \nwould have to be big enough to maintain safety in a country with ethnic \ntensions that could lead to other problems.''\n  He was asked how many troops were needed. General Shinseki said:\n\n       Something on the order of several hundred thousand \n     soldiers.\n\n  And he added:\n\n       Assistance from friends and allies would be helpful.\n\n  For his candor and his honesty, he was replaced. Instead of sending \nthe necessary troops to make sure we lived up to the Powell doctrine \nwith overwhelming force and responded to the possibilities that were \nahead of us after Saddam Hussein was deposed, for his candor and \nhonesty General Shinseki's command was replaced.\n  The administration was not about to stand still for someone in \nuniform telling them the stark, honest truth: that without enough \nsoldiers, the ones we sent to war would be in danger.\n  So we invaded with too few troops to secure the peace. As a result of \nthat decision, and the decision to disband the Iraqi Army, the initial \ninsurgency took hold in Iraq. The miscalculation by the planners and \nthe leaders made life more dangerous for our soldiers on the ground in \nIraq.\n  Since then, sectarian violence has exploded, creating conditions that \nnow approach civil war. And every one of us recalls the situation \ninvolving the equipment given our troops. I remember my first visit to \nWalter Reed Hospital, meeting a National Guardsman from Ohio who lost \nhis right leg at the knee. He said:\n\n       I was in one of those humvees that just had canvas on the \n     side. A bomb went off and I lost my leg. You have to do more \n     to protect those soldiers.\n\n  He wanted to go back, even with his amputation, just to show his \ncommitment to our Nation. The leadership under Secretary Rumsfeld \ndidn't show the same commitment when it came to protecting our troops \nas they road in humvees. I recall a friend of mine whose son is a \nmember of the military police with the U.S. Army. He told me he and his \nwife went out to buy the body armor that his son wasn't given when he \nwent to Iraq. Have we reached that point, spending billions of dollars, \nas we have, when individual families have to take up collections at \nchurches or reach into their savings accounts to provide the most basic \nequipment?\n  The fact is that that happened, and it happened under the watch of \nSecretary Rumsfeld. Today, we know the situation with our military. \nBrave men and women are still willing to serve, but we understand that \nreadiness is a serious issue. Bonuses are being given for those who \nwill join the military or stay in uniform. We understand that the \nstandards have changed because of the difficulty meeting enlistment \ngoals. But these are reality. We know that the National Guard across \nthe United States has 34 percent of the equipment they need to do their \njob.\n  Let me remind everybody that the decision to invade was the decision \nof this administration and this Secretary of Defense. They picked the \ndate, the time, and they established when readiness would be adequate. \nSadly, they were wrong. The administration chose to invade Iraq but \nfailed to plan for its aftermath. You have heard about the generals who \nspoke out, calling for a change in the leadership at the Department of \nDefense, calling for Secretary Rumsfeld to go. As Senator Reid said \nearlier, these generals were under his command. Many of them had \nimportant responsibilities and saw up close this Secretary in action.\n  I thought one of the most dramatic statements was made by retired LTG \nGregory Newbold, a Marine Corps general. He said:\n\n       We need fresh ideas and fresh faces. That means, as a first \n     step, replacing Rumsfeld and many others unwilling to \n     fundamentally change their approach. The troops in the Middle \n     East have performed their duty. Now we need people in \n     Washington who can construct a unified strategy worthy of \n     them. It is time to send a signal to our Nation, our forces \n     and the world that we are uncompromising on our security but \n     are prepared to rethink how we achieve it.\n\n  General Newbold went on to say, in some of the most touching and \ndramatic words I have read:\n\n       The cost of flawed leadership continues to be paid in \n     blood. . . . They must be absolutely sure [speaking of our \n     soldiers] that the commitment is for a cause as honorable as \n     the sacrifice.\n\n  Here is what Lieutenant General Newbold of the Marine Corps said in \nclosing:\n\n       My sincere view is that the commitment of our forces to \n     this fight was done with the casualness and a swagger that \n     are the special province of those who have never had to \n     execute these missions--or bury the results.\n\n  He is not alone in this assessment, nor is he alone calling for a \nchange in leadership at the Pentagon. For those who stand before us and \nsay that any time we are critical of the policy of this administration \nwe are somehow not standing behind the troops, I will tell you these \nare words spoken by troops, by soldiers and marines who have been \nthere, paid the price for swearing to stand by our Nation.\n  Now we have a report from the Pentagon that the situation on the \nground in Iraq is deteriorating--a grim portrait last week of Iraq--\nsaying violence has reached its highest level in the last 2 years, with \nexecutions, kidnappings, bombings, and torture killings of more than \n3,000 Iraqis a month. Ninety percent of the bodies coming into the \nBaghdad morgue are execution victims. Many were gruesomely tortured \nbefore being killed.\n  According to that assessment, the number of attacks in Iraq over the \nlast 4 months is up 15 percent, and the number of civilian casualties \nin the last 4 months is up 51 percent. Over 137,000 people have been \ninternally displaced in Iraq since last February, pushed out of their \nhomes. We know it is because of rising sectarian strife and violence. \nThe report from the Pentagon, for the first time, concedes that \n``conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq.''\n  Today, we have about 140,000 troops in Iraq, and 2,657 brave \nAmericans have given their lives in that conflict as of September 5. We \nowe it to those who gave their lives and who still serve, and their \nfamilies who stay behind and pray for their safety, to make sure they \nhave the right leadership.\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\n  This is not a question of will. This is a question of leadership and \nmission. Our soldiers deserve better. They deserve leadership from the \nPentagon that will provide them with the equipment they need, the \ndirection they need to make certain that they truly come home with \ntheir mission accomplished. We need to change the leadership in the \nDepartment of Defense, and we need to change the leadership of this \nSecretary.\n  The Pentagon's report makes it clear:\n\n       Since the last report, the core conflict in Iraq has \n     changed into a struggle between Sunni and Shia extremists. . \n     . .\n\n  Is that something we bargained for when we voted for this? Did we \nbargain for the fact that our soldiers are standing in the crossfire of \na civil war today? How many times have we been promised that the Iraqis \nwill come to the rescue? We are spending billions to train them and \nreplace our troops. It is not a credible statement until American \nsoldiers start coming home.\n  Many of us believe that the Iraqis will not stand and fight and \ndefend their own country as long as they believe the American soldiers \nwill do the job. The best military in the world is there to protect \nthem at no expense. We have to let the Iraqis know that this is their \nresponsibility.\n  I will close by saying this debate makes one thing very clear to the \npeople of America. Neither this Republican President nor this \nRepublican Congress will challenge, nor will they change a policy that \nhas cost us too many brave American lives, 2,657 sons and daughters, \nhusbands and wives, cousins and friends--the people we love who have \ngiven their lives so far. Sadly, last week, 18 were added to that list. \nMore were added yesterday.\n  We have now spent over $300 billion. We are in the fourth year of \nthis fight. There is no end in sight. Suggesting a change in leadership \nso we can start to move forward in a new direction toward a real \nvictory is long overdue.\n  Change may not take place in this Republican-controlled Senate. We \nhave been told they will object to even taking a vote on this issue \nabout whether we are confident in the leadership of Secretary Rumsfeld. \nBut even if change will not take place in this Chamber, the American \npeople will still have the last word on November 7.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, we seek the benefit of the \ncomments of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, listening to the comments of our friends \nacross the aisle, you would think this is more about an election than \nit is about winning a war. The problem is not so much in the eyes of \nthe critics or the Islamic extremists who attacked the United States \ntime and time again, until we finally woke up on September 11, 2001, \nand realized we were at war. The problem is not them; the problem is \nus. It is America. It is America's leaders. We are the problem.\n  This is more important than any party. This is more important than \nany election. This is more important than any single person. This is \nabout whether we will win this war that was declared against the United \nStates that we finally woke up and realized was going on, on September \n11. It dates back as long ago as 1979, when the U.S. embassy in Tehran \nwas overcome and for 444 days American citizens were held captive by \nIslamic militants.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle would like to claim that \nthis is all about Iraq and a mistake that was made going into Iraq, and \nbut for that mistake the world would be rosy and we would be at peace. \nBut that is revisionist history.\n  The fact is that in 1979, when our embassy was captured and Americans \nwere kidnapped in Tehran, and in 1983, when 241 marines were killed in \nBeirut by Hezbollah, the same terrorist organization that has been \nlobbing Katyusha rockets, supplied by Iran through Syria, into Israel--\nyes, this is the same enemy that continued to attack American embassies \nin Africa in 2000, and killed 17 American sailors on the USS Cole. Yes, \nthis is the same enemy that killed almost 3,000 Americans on September \n11, 2001, in New York City and Washington, DC, and but for the brave \nactions of a few on Flight 93, perhaps thousands more would have been \nkilled.\n  Recently, I attended a speech where the Deputy Secretary of Defense \nspoke. He asked the question:\n\n       Do you know why it was that these Islamic extremists killed \n     3,000 people on September 11, 2001? It was because they could \n     not kill 30,000, and because they could not kill 3 million. \n     Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that an ideology that \n     celebrates the murder of innocent civilians in order to \n     accomplish their objective would stop at anything, use any \n     weapon at its disposal to accomplish its ends?\n\n  Mr. President, I disagree with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle that this war is limited to Iraq and that if we were to \nwithdraw our troops precipitously, the world would suddenly be a rosy \nplace and we would live in peace.\n  Unfortunately, this debate seems to be more about criticizing those \nwho are prosecuting the war. No, we are not going to be critical of the \nmen and women in uniform, but our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are all too ready to criticize those who command them, the \ncivilian leadership in the Department of Defense and the Commander in \nChief. I am not saying they don't have a right to criticize them. I am \nnot saying that they have been perfect and haven't made mistakes. But I \nthink we need to keep our eye on the threat. The threat is not just \nIraq, the threat is in Afghanistan, it is in Madrid, it is in Beslan, \nit is in London. It is a threat driven by an extreme ideology that \ncelebrates the murder of innocent civilians to accomplish its goals. \nWhat would be the consequences of doing as our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle suggest, leaving before the Iraqi security forces are \nable to provide security for their fragile and fledgling democracy? It \nwould be the same mistake that we saw occur in Afghanistan. After the \nSoviet Union was defeated and Afghanistan became a failed state, we saw \nthe rise of the Taliban and saw its partners in al-Qaida and Osama bin \nLaden.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about a change in \ndirection, fresh ideas, new direction. Those are campaign slogans. They \nare not about solving the problem. They are not about beating the \nenemy, defeating the enemy who declared war on us as far back as 1979.\n  I know that our colleagues have been critical. Again, they have every \nright to be. This is America. We believe in free speech. We believe in \npeople being able to express their views no matter how mistaken, no \nmatter how naive.\n  This administration and the Secretary of Defense have been criticized \nfor saying we need to stay the course, we need to keep the faith, that \nwhat we are doing in Iraq and what we are doing in trying to fight and \ndefeat this enemy of Islamic extremism is important to the security of \nthis country because if we were to do as some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle suggest and leave Iraq before the Iraqis are \nable to provide basic security, it would become another failed state. \nAnd, no, this is not George Bush's Vietnam because after Vietnam, the \nVietcong did not follow us here. That is exactly the threat with which \nwe are confronted today.\n  The Islamic extremists who have declared war on America and the West \nwill follow us here unless we deal with them on the offensive there. \nAnd, yes, every time we seem to talk about the tools that are necessary \nto win this war, we run into a brick wall of opposition on the other \nside of the aisle, such as listening to international phone calls \nbetween al-Qaida operatives and their confederates here in the United \nStates. Yet our friends on the other side of the aisle said: Foul; the \nPresident doesn't have the authority to do that. Only Congress has the \nauthority to do that. So we get into a big food fight about who has the \npower, who has the authority, not about working together to solve the \nproblem.\n  When it comes to the issue of how do we deal with those who have been \ncaptured on the battlefield and detained in Guantanamo Bay--sources of \nimportant intelligence that have disrupted and deterred terrorist \nattacks and saved American lives--it seems as if the focus is all too \noften on what should we be doing to make the detainee's life better \nrather than what should we be doing to get that intelligence which will \nallow us to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist activities.\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n  Now the world has turned an anxious eye toward Tehran once again, \nwhere the same radical ideology has caused them to supply, through \nSyria, weapons to Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that has killed \nmore Americans than any other in the world, save and except al-Qaida.\n  Is there any doubt that if Iran had been able to supply biological, \nchemical or nuclear weapons to Hezbollah in order to achieve its stated \ngoal of wiping Israel off the map, is there any question that they \nwould have withheld their hand, that they would not have done so?\n  I have to say I think this must be a very strange picture to the \ncivilized world, those who actually believe we are serious about \nfighting this enemy who has declared war against the West and against \nour way of life and against our values, that instead of focusing \ntogether on how do we defeat this enemy who declared war on us, we have \nsomehow turned this into an election-year effort to discredit and vote \nno confidence for the Secretary of Defense. It is the wrong direction.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say there is no plan \nfor success and, of course, there is. It is to provide training to the \nIraqi security forces so they can provide security, and we can bring \nour troops home, allow this new Government in Iraq to resolve its \ndifferences after 30 years of tyranny, try to work through the \nsectarian conflicts by creating a coalition government, and then to \nallow the Iraqi people to enjoy the prosperity so they can see the \nbenefits of self-determination and free and fair elections.\n  But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be long on \ncriticism, long on complaints, and short on plans. They have yet to \noffer a single concrete idea about what they would do differently to \nwin this war and defeat this enemy. I, as one Senator, would welcome \ntheir ideas, if they have ideas, so we can work together to defeat the \ncommon enemy because, as I said, this is more important than any \nelection, than any party or any person. This is about the safety and \nsecurity of our Nation and our hope and dream that the values we \nrepresent can be exported--and the blessings of liberty along with it--\nto other nations that have never known anything but the boot heel of a \ntyrant.\n  I hope our colleagues will reconsider and will not pursue this \ndistraction, will not pursue this unwise and inappropriate vote of no \nconfidence against the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our current policy in Iraq has not been \nworking; it is not working. It is making us less secure against the \ncommon enemy which the Senator from Texas has correctly identified. It \nis, indeed, a common enemy. The question is whether the current course \nwe are on is contributing to the defeat of that enemy or whether the \ncurrent course we are on is making us less secure, as our resolution \nstates.\n  It is long past time for a change in course. When you find yourself \nin a hole, the first thing you should do is stop digging. \nUnfortunately, President Bush and the administration just keep digging \nus into a deeper and deeper hole.\n  The President has given the Iraqis the impression that our commitment \nin Iraq is open ended. He reinforced that impression when he said last \nmonth: We are not leaving so long as I am President.\n  The Iraqi leadership needs a wakeup call, a dose of reality. They \nneed to be told: If you don't get your political house in order, if you \ndon't reach a political settlement that leads to the end of the Sunni \ninsurgency and leads to the dismantling of the Shia militia, then we \ncannot save you from yourselves. It is in your hands, we must tell the \nIraqis, not ours. Whether you want to put together a nation or whether \nyou have a civil war is your choice. We have opened the door for you. \nWe have given you an incredible opportunity which no other country \nwould even consider giving but ours. We have paid for it in blood \nand treasure. But only the Iraqis can utilize that opportunity. We \ncannot force them through that door that we have opened for them.\n\n  The Iraqi leadership now is operating under the misconception that we \nare there as long as they want us or as long as they need us. That \nmisconception must end. They must be told that they must make the \npolitical compromises, they must share resources, they must share \npolitical power, that only they can decide if they are going to, in \nfact, avoid an all-out civil war and defeat the insurgency. We cannot \ndo that for them.\n  We have been there now longer than we fought the Korean war. They \nhave had an opportunity to create a constitution. By now, they were \nsupposed to consider amendments to that constitution. That apparently \nhas been shelved by the Iraqi political leadership. That is \nunacceptable to us; it is unacceptable to the American people. The \nAmerican people want the Iraqi leadership to make the compromises they \nneed to make to avoid an all-out civil war. They must take hold of \ntheir country.\n  We must begin, I believe, a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces from \nIraq this year, by the end of this year--and the Iraqis should be told \nby the end of this year that the phased withdrawal is going to begin. \nIt is essential to do this in order to prod the Iraqis to reach the \npolitical settlement which, according to our top commander in Iraq, is \nessential if all-out civil war is going to be avoided.\n  This cannot be won militarily. The military piece has been done. We \nhave 80 to 90 percent of the Iraqi military force now trained. It is \nthe political will in Iraq which is lacking, and that will must be \nbrought to bear. We must prod it, we must pressure it, we must push \nthem to do what only they, again, can do.\n  I believe they must face an abyss. These decisions are obviously \ndifficult, we know that. There is a long history there that needs to be \novercome. But the Iraqi leaders must face the abyss. They must face a \nvery stark choice: civil war or nationhood.\n  The American security blanket is now providing a negative incentive \nto reach those kinds of essential decisions. Instead, similar to a \nbroken record, President Bush and members of his administration keep \nsaying that the choice in Iraq is between staying the course or \nwithdrawing, cutting and running. That is not the choice. There is a \nthird choice: changing the course, changing the negative dynamic in \nIraq, which is the best and, I believe, only hope of achieving our \nmission. Staying on this downward spiral in Iraq makes no sense.\n  Some of the President's recent comments on Iraq sound as if he is out \nof touch with the reality on the ground. For example, the President was \nextremely naive when he said at a recent press conference that the \nviolence in Iraq, Lebanon, and Gaza was the result of ``groups of \nterrorists trying to stop the advance of democracy.'' But it is a \nterrorist group, Hezbollah, which is part of a democratically elected \nGovernment of Lebanon, and the democratically elected Government in \nIraq supported and identified itself with Hezbollah, a terrorist group, \nand its attacks on Israel.\n  The President also said at that August 21 news conference that \n``Saddam Hussein had relations with Zarqawi,'' a terrorist who was \nkilled in Iraq. That simply is not true. It continues an \nadministration's tactic of trying to link Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, \na link that our intelligence community has repeatedly said did not \nexist. It continues a pattern of this administration of falsely linking \nSaddam Hussein to the people who attacked us on 9/11 in an obvious \neffort to win public support for the administration's Iraq policy.\n  It is part of a continuing pattern of misleading and false \nstatements, such as the effort which lasted over years of making the \nAmerican people believe that there was a meeting in Prague between the \nhead of the Iraqi Secret Service and Mohammed Atta prior to 9/11, \nMohammed Atta being the lead hijacker and attacker on us on 9/11. That \nwas false. The intelligence community did not believe that meeting took \nplace. And yet month after month prior to the war and after the war, \nthe administration kept pointing to reports of the meeting that \nsuggested the link between the people who attacked us on 9/11 and \nSaddam Hussein, trying to create the impression that Saddam Hussein was \npart of that attack, to such an extent that over half the American \npeople believed that, in fact, there was such a link.\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\n  Finally, the President recently insisted there be no withdrawal of \nAmerican troops so long as he was President. He gave a long list of \nreasons for his statement, and one of those reasons was that it is what \nthe Iraqi people want, to quote the President. The President is badly \nmisinformed.\n  An April 2006 survey of Iraqi public opinion conducted by the \nUniversity of Michigan and reported in U.S. News leads to the opposite \nconclusion. This survey found that almost 92 percent of Iraqis oppose \nthe presence of coalition troops in Iraq. Even more disturbing than \nthat is the fact that this number was an increase from the 74 percent \nof Iraqi people who opposed the presence of coalition troops in Iraq in \n2004. So that in the 2 years from 2004 to 2006, the percentage of Iraqi \npeople who oppose the presence of coalition troops in their country \nincreased from 74 percent to 92 percent. And almost 85 percent of that \n92 percent--almost 85 percent of Iraqis--are ``strongly opposed to the \npresence of coalition troops.''\n  So our open-ended commitment of troops is not supported even by the \nIraqis, and it sends the wrong message to the Iraqi leadership.\n  Our strategy in Iraq is not succeeding. We need to change course. The \nlonger we maintain our failed stay-the-course approach, the weaker we \nare in the war on terrorism. The Iraqis need to hear a wake-up call \nfrom the President instead of a soothing message that we will be there \nso long as he is the President.\n  President Bush has repeatedly said that as the Iraqis stand up, we \nwill stand down. The Iraqi security forces are 85 percent stood up. \nWhere is the Presidential promised response that there be at least the \nbeginning of a standdown as the Iraqis have been standing up? Where is \nthat commitment being kept, so critically important to the American \npeople, so repeatedly made by the President of the United States: As \nthe Iraqis stand up, we will stand down? It doesn't say after all the \nIraqis have been fully trained, even though they are nearly there. It \nsays as they stand up. And the reason that is so critically important \nis because as long as the present policy continues, that the Iraqis \nbelieve we will be there as a security blanket even though they do not \nmake the political decisions and compromises which are essential to \ntheir success, our policy of staying the course, our open-ended \ncommitment makes it less likely that we are going to succeed in Iraq.\n  I think every Member of this Chamber believes we have a common enemy, \nand that is the religious fanatics who terrorize innocents. They are a \ncommon enemy and we all want to see them defeated. But the current \ncourse that we are on makes it more difficult for us to defeat that \nenemy where they are, and it makes it less likely that we will have the \nultimate success which is so essential to our own security.\n  The amendment that is being offered calls on the President to change \ncourse in Iraq. It also says that one important indication of that \nchange would be the replacement of the current Secretary of Defense. I \nhave said in the past that I would call for the changing of the \nSecretary of Defense if I thought it would represent a change in the \nadministration's policies in Iraq. I have focused on the policies, not \non the personalities. But, in my view, as the resolution says, \nreplacing Secretary Rumsfeld would be an indication, finally, that the \nBush administration recognizes the need to change course in Iraq, and \nbecause it is that policy change which is so essential, I will support \nthe resolution and hope that the Senate is allowed to vote on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe University of Michigan poll to which I made reference and which was \nreferred to and utilized, I believe, in U.S. News and World Report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     TABLE 3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Do you support or oppose the presence of coalition forces in\n                                                                               Iraq\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Strongly     Somewhat     Somewhat     Strongly      Total\n                                                   support      support       oppose       oppose     (percent)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSunni Arabs:\n    2004.......................................          1.8          3.8          5.5         89.0          100\n    2006.......................................          1.5           .4           .9         97.2          100\nShiiti Arabs:\n    2004.......................................          5.8         13.0         17.7         63.5          100\n    2006.......................................          3.1          2.3          4.9         89.7          100\nSunni Kurds:\n    2004.......................................         37.3         42.7          7.5         12.1          100\n    2006.......................................         10.6         26.1         32.7         30.6          100\nAll:\n    2004.......................................         10.0         15.7         13.3         61.0          100\n    2006.......................................          3.6          4.7          7.2         84.5          100\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my colleague departs, I wonder if I \nmight engage in a colloquy with him. I am the next speaker on this \nside. I have allowed my colleagues to go ahead of me to accommodate \nthem. If the Senator wants to recite his unanimous consent request, we \nhave absolutely no objection, and I would simply add to it that \nfollowing the speaker on the Democratic side who follows me, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire be recognized to speak on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I made an earlier unanimous consent \nrequest that we were going to alternate. I could read the list that we \ncurrently have subject, of course, to the arrival of Senators. But it \nis our hope that we would have Senator Kerry followed by Senator \nKennedy, and then Senators Jack Reed and Hillary Clinton, followed by \nSenators Harkin, Boxer, Dayton, Carper, Dorgan, Murray, Mikulski, and \nLautenberg.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have no objection. I would simply ask \nthat it be amended such that following my taking the floor on our side, \nas I understand it, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts will \nspeak, and then the Senator from New Hampshire on our side will be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend and colleague, we \nhave had 28 wonderful years together on the Armed Services Committee. \nNow, with the passage of time, the responsibility of the management of \nthat committee rests on our two shoulders, I as chairman at the present \ntime, incidentally succeeding my good friend as chairman before me for \na brief period, and he is now a distinguished ranking member. But I \nwould like to start my remarks with a question to my good friend by \nasking Senators as we participate in this debate to consider what I \nregard as a very interesting approach to this debate as characterized \nby our President in a news conference on August 21.\n  He said the following:\n\n       You know, it is an interesting debate we are having in \n     America about how we ought to handle Iraq. There is a lot of \n     people--good, decent people--saying: Withdraw now. They are \n     absolutely wrong. It would be a huge mistake for this \n     country.\n\n  And I continue to quote the President:\n\n       There are a lot of good, decent people saying, get out now. \n     Vote for me. I will do everything I can, I guess, to cut off \n     money, is what they will try to do to get our troops out. \n     That, too--\n\n  The President said--\n\n     is a big mistake. It would be wrong, in my judgment, for us \n     to leave before the mission is completed in Iraq.\n\n  I will refer to this later. But this is the tenor. It seems to me \nthat it is a very balanced and respectful tenor because the President \nwent on to say:\n\n       I will never question the patriotism of somebody who \n     disagrees with me. This debate has nothing to do with \n     patriotism.\n\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\n\n  I take my cues from his approach and the manner in which he addressed \nthe importance of the debate and how those who participate in it \nhopefully will be guided by his impressions.\n  To my good friend from Michigan, I listened very carefully to much of \nwhat he said, and I commend him in the sense that he is consistent in \nhis approach. But what I want to draw the Senator's attention to is, \nwhat are the consequences--to the whole region, to the people in Iraq, \nto the war we are waging against terrorism, to our people here at \nhome--what are the consequences if this somewhat fragile and new \nGovernment struggling to put down its roots and exercise the full \nreigns of sovereignty, what are the consequences should it fail to be \nable to exercise the full spectrum of responsibilities of a sovereign \nnation that Iraq is now? It is a sovereign nation. I believe those \nconsequences, of their inability to govern, the inability of those in \ncontrol of their armed forces--we are not in control of their armed \nforces--they are a sovereign nation. It is the Prime Minister who will \nissue the orders to their armed forces, not General Abizaid or General \nCasey. We work in concert with them, but they are a sovereign nation.\n  What are the consequences if this Government were not able to \nexercise the reins of sovereignty because of such conditions of further \ndeterioration in the security situation? What are the consequences, I \nask my good friend?\n  I would name several, in my judgment. First and foremost, that nation \nis sitting on the second largest oil reserve in the world--the second \nlargest oil reserve. There it is. It is not the property of the United \nStates. It is not the property of the coalition forces. We are not \nthere to fight over the oil. But we are there to try to elect a \ngovernment--or not elect, but let a government handle those natural \nresources which can quickly, if properly extracted, turn into hard \ncash. If those reserves fall into the wrong hands, hands which are \ndealing with terrorism, which support terrorism, which are antithetical \nto every principle of free democracies in the world, ours or other free \nnations, it would give terrorists unlimited cash to pursue their goals \non terrorism--unlimited. And you couple unlimited cash with the \ncruelest, yet regrettably most effective weapon of war of the \nterrorists; namely, the human bombers, who, regrettably, they can \npurchase for dollars--for Dinars--you are facing not only the coalition \nforces in Iraq but the forces of freedom the world over, a very \ndangerous combination of unlimited funding and the human bomber.\n  The world stood in awe as we watched the human bombers inflict time \nand time again disastrous consequences on Israel. Now we have watched \nhow they inflict disastrous consequences on our coalition forces in \nIraq and, unfortunately, in a growing number of instances in \nAfghanistan.\n  Secondly, if that Government were to fail after all of the courage \nthat the coalition of nations, working with the United States, has \nshown in trying to give the Iraqi people a sequence of free elections, \na freely elected government, a constitution; if that Government were to \nfail, it would seriously affect the credibility of the United States of \nAmerica in that region and complicate the already complicated problem \nposed by Iran, a nation that is thus far manifesting an unrelenting \nintent to acquire the capabilities to manufacture and possess nuclear \nweapons.\n  I would love to hear this Chamber debate what would be the \nconsequences to that region if Iran were to obtain that capability and \nput it in its arsenal. There is no chapter in world history to match \nthat threat--not the Cold War that our Nation and other nations faced \nwith the Soviet Union. We always knew the Soviet Union had a degree of \nrational, objective understanding of the consequences of the use of the \nnuclear weapon. I have not seen any manifestations of this current \nGovernment in Iran that they operate in any rational, objective way.\n  So I ask my friend, as you spell out your fervent belief that we \nshould begin, as you said just now--I copied it down--a ``phased \nwithdrawal,'' could that not trigger instability in that fragile \nGovernment? Take, for example, their legislative body which just \nconvened again this week. Each of us travels to and from this Chamber \nwith a sense of absolute security in this country that we can do so \nsafely. But each member of that legislative body, as they traverse \nIraq, given the instability of that country in many areas, questions \nthe personal safety of individuals serving in this Government. If the \nmessage were that we are going to start to withdraw, it might well \ncause that individual legislator or member of the Cabinet of the Maliki \ngovernment to say: Wait a minute. Am I going to take all these personal \nrisks to myself and to my family if this Government is not going to \nsucceed? And what if this withdrawal were to trigger, in the minds of \nmany of those brave people stepping up to serve in public service in \nIraq today--it might well trigger to them: I better consider my own \npersonal safety rather than trying to continue this public service.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will trigger exactly the opposite. If the Iraqis \nfinally recognize that our commitment is not open-ended, we are not \ngoing to be their security blanket, if they finally recognize we cannot \ndo for them what only they can do for themselves--share power, share \nresources, consider amendments to their Constitution, which were \nsupposed to have been considered by now--that statement to them will \ntrigger a reality in them that only they can save themselves; we cannot \nsave them. We can give them an opportunity--and we have, at great cost \nof blood and treasure. As I said before, I know of no other country \nthat would do what we did, what we have done for mankind, which is to \ngive people an opportunity for freedom.\n  I didn't vote for this war. I thought it would unleash forces which \nwould be very negative. But now that we are there, I have always \nbelieved--my dear friend from Virginia knows this--that we should \nmaximize the chances for success. The road we are on now is not a road \nto success. We are on a downward spiral now. Sectarian violence is \nincreasing, not decreasing. So the consequences are consequences which \nwe both want to avoid. The consequences which the Senator from Virginia \noutlined are consequences which are clearly negative, and every person \nin this Chamber and in this land would want to avoid those \nconsequences. But how do we best prod the Iraqis to take hold of their \nown situation and share power, share resources, recognize the rights of \neach other, become tolerant, give up the revenge slayings which are \ngoing on there? How do we force them to do that if we say we are here \nfor some open-ended time?\n  The President says some people want to withdraw now--and some do. \nWhat I believe is we should give fair notice to the Iraqis that in a \nreasonable period of time, since their army is now almost fully stood \nup, we are going to begin a phased withdrawal, and that should begin by \nthe end of the year so that it can be done in a way which is planned, \nthoughtful, but that it finally impress on the Iraqi leaders that: \nFolks, it has been 3 or 4 years. You have had elections. You have had \nan opportunity to pass the Constitution. You have a civil war some \nfolks say is going on. You and you alone can address the issues which \nare driving that civil conflict.\n  We cannot as Americans solve their political disputes. That is what I \nbelieve is at stake. We all want to avoid the consequences. The issue \nis, How do we best avoid the consequences which the Senator from \nVirginia has outlined? Stay the course? Is that avoiding the \nconsequences? I don't think so. We get deeper and deeper into that \nmire, and the very consequences, the consequences which the Senator \nfrom Virginia has outlined, are the consequences which are more likely \nto occur if we do not change that negative dynamic which exists in Iraq \nwith a wake-up call which the President alone can give to the Iraqis. \nOnly the President can tell the Iraqis: Folks, there is no open-ended \ncommitment here. You have to take hold of this situation. I think only \nthe President can do that.\n  We can try, and that is what we are doing. Some Senators believe we \nshould try to send that message to the Iraqis. I think the good Senator \nfrom Virginia was present at the White House when I urged the President \nto stop counseling patience when the Iraqis should understand that the \nAmerican people are impatient. We are impatient, and rightfully so, at \nthe failure of the Iraqi political leadership to reach those political \ncompromises\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nwhich are essential to avoiding an all-out civil war, and end the \ninsurgency.\n\n  The Senator was present when I urged the President: Please, Mr. \nPresident, you know I voted against the war. I am not expecting you to \ngrab on to my advice. I have been a critic. I have been a critic of the \nway the war has been handled. The Iraqi Army being disbanded was a \ntragic mistake. The failure to have a plan for the aftermath was a \nterrible mistake. There were a lot of mistakes. But to the extent you \nare willing to consider this message, Mr. President, let the Iraqis \nknow the American people are impatient, instead of counseling patience.\n  The President looked me in the eye and said: That is a useful \nmessage. In other words, it is a useful message for a Senator to be \ndelivering. But he implied--by implication--he is not willing to \ndeliver that message himself to the Iraqis.\n  What this argument is about, in my judgment, is that the President \nneeds to deliver that message to the Iraqis in order to help them \nrecognize that is the only way they can succeed--if they take hold. \nThey have to look into that abyss. They have to see some stark \nalternatives. They, the Iraqi leadership, have to see some very stark \nalternatives: settle the issues politically, defeat the insurgency \nthereby, avoid all-out civil war thereby. You have to do it, folks. We \ncan't do it for you. I believe that has to be laid before the Iraqis as \nthe best chance of avoiding those very negative consequences which the \nSenator from Virginia outlined.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I respect my colleague's views. We have \nhad this debate several times before. I recognize and feel, as do you, \nas do I and I think every Member of this Chamber, the extraordinary \nlosses in this country of 2,600-some men and women who have given their \nlives and some over 20,000 who are trying to recover from wounds and \nthe impact on their families. That is an enormous sacrifice.\n  But what I say to you, my dear friend: You pose a big gamble. If you \nare not right and this legislature interprets that as a signal, the \npublic servants in Iraq interpret that as a signal, the members of the \nIraqi security forces--namely, the army--hear that their support base, \nlogistically and other ways, the United States, that we are beginning a \nphased withdrawal, this could trigger the opposite reaction. If that \nGovernment were not able to function because of the lack of security \nand they lose reins of sovereignty, I ask my good friend, what happens? \nIf these oilfields--maybe not all at once but fractionally--what \nhappens if this country begins to divide in three parts: the Kurds in \nthe north, the Sunnis in al Anbar, and down south in the Bosra region, \nthe Shia? Iran is flexing its muscles in various ways, and as you and I \nknow their influence is being felt in that country. What happens if \nthey see we are not there with the resolve that our President, time and \ntime again, has stated?\n  Yesterday, I was privileged, along with others, to be in the audience \nwhen he delivered what I thought was one of his strongest and best \nspeeches, sketching the whole history of the war on terrorism and with \ndirect quotes of the principals who are fighting against our interests \nhere in this country. I ask, what happens if that Government fails to \nexercise the full range of democracy? What is your anticipation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it is more likely that the Government will succeed \nif they recognize that they are the ones who have to succeed and we \ncan't do it for them. The gamble that we are now taking is greater, \nwhich is continuing on a course of action which is failing.\n  You know, the first argument which was used to go to Iraq was there \nwere weapons of mass destruction. That was the first argument which was \nused. That didn't work out as the basis for the policy. The next one \nwas we are going to promote democracy in Iraq. Now the argument is \nthere were no weapons; we are not doing very well on the democracy side \nsince that democratic Government is supporting at least one terrorist \nand probably two terrorist groups, in Lebanon and in Gaza, so the \ndemocratically elected Government is giving substance and support to \nwhat we believe is terrorism. So now there is a third argument used for \nthis policy, that our leaving will create a huge problem.\n  First it was weapons of mass destruction. Then it was we were \npromoting democracy. Now it is we cannot leave because look what will \nhappen if we leave.\n  Look at what is happening because we are staying in an open-ended way \nbecause they don't see that stark choice they face because they are \nrelying on Uncle Sam's security blanket. That is what must be changed. \nThat is the dynamic which I believe must be changed, and the only way \nto change it is in a reasonable way, a thoughtful way, a planned way, \nto say: Folks, we have to do what we said we would do--as you stand up, \nwe are going to stand down. You have known that now for years. We are \ngoing to carry out that policy which the President has enunciated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have one other question for my \ncolleague, and let me preface it with the following. You are a \nsignatory of a letter, dated September 4, to the President, along with \na number of your colleagues and the distinguished Democratic leader and \nthe distinguished House Democratic leader and others. In it, you say \nthe following:\n\n       In short, Mr. President, the current path for our military, \n     for the Iraqi people and for our security is neither working \n     nor making us more secure.\n\n  That is your basic thesis. And you list in here:\n\n       Therefore, we urge you once again to consider changes to \n     your Iraq policy. We propose a new direction, which would \n     include: (1) transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq to \n     counter-terrorism, training, logistics and force protection; \n     (2) beginning the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from \n     Iraq before the end of this year; (3) working with Iraqi \n     leaders to disarm the militias and to develop a broad-based \n     and sustainable political settlement, including amending the \n     Constitution to achieve a fair sharing of power and \n     resources; and (4) convening an international conference and \n     contact group to support a political settlement in Iraq, to \n     preserve Iraq's sovereignty, and to revitalize the stalled \n     economic reconstruction and rebuilding effort. These \n     proposals were outlined in our July 30th letter and are \n     consistent with the ``U.S. Policy in Iraq Act'' you signed \n     into law last year.\n\n  In reply, a letter, a very respectful letter, was forwarded to all \nsignatories on September 5. It was signed by the Chief of Staff of the \nPresident, Joshua B. Bolton. It is interesting, his observations. You \nsay stay the course. Did you have an opportunity to look at this \nletter? Fine. Let me just read it. He cites as follows:\n\n       Thank you for your September 4 letter to the President. I \n     am responding on his behalf.\n       A useful discussion of what we need to do in Iraq requires \n     an accurate and fair-minded description of our current \n     policy: As the President has explained, our goal is an Iraq \n     that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself. In \n     order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing a strategy along \n     three main tracks--political, economic, and security. Along \n     each of these tracks, we are constantly adjusting our tactics \n     to meet conditions on the ground. We have witnessed both \n     successes and setbacks [acknowledging that, Senator] along \n     the way, which is the story of every war that has been waged \n     and won.\n       Your letter recites four elements of a proposed ``new \n     direction'' in Iraq.\n\n  This I think most important. He cites in this letter that three of \nthose elements reflect well-established administration policy and the \nfourth is dangerously misguided.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record following this \nparagraph.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. WARNER. He recites the changes in the administration adaptation \nto the ever-changing situation on the ground and with the Government. \nHe recites each of the four points raised in your letter and addresses \nhow this administration is pursuing a revised strategy.\n  To say we are staying the course is an inaccurate statement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the President says we should stay the course.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the President of the United States says we should stay \nthe course.\n  Mr. WARNER. This outlines the course we will embark on at this point \nin time. I urge my colleagues to read this letter in the context of our \ndebate today.\n  I thank my colleague.\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nExhibit 1--Response From the Chief of Staff Josh Bolten to a Democratic \n                                 Letter\n\n                                                September 5, 2006.\n     Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for your September 4 letter to \n     the President. I am responding on his behalf.\n       A useful discussion of what we need to do in Iraq requires \n     an accurate and fair-minded description of our current \n     policy: As the President has explained, our goal is an Iraq \n     that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself. In \n     order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing a strategy along \n     three main tracks--political, economic, and security. Along \n     each of these tracks, we are constantly adjusting our tactics \n     to meet conditions on the ground. We have witnessed both \n     successes and setbacks along the way, which is the story of \n     every war that has been waged and won.\n       Your letter recites four elements of a proposed ``new \n     direction'' in Iraq. Three of those elements reflect well-\n     established Administration policy; the fourth is dangerously \n     misguided.\n       First, you propose ``transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq \n     to counter-terrorism, training, logistics and force \n     protection.'' That is what we are now doing, and have been \n     doing for several years. Our efforts to train the Iraqi \n     Security Forces (ISF) have evolved and accelerated over the \n     past three years. Our military has had substantial success in \n     building the Iraqi Army--and increasingly we have seen the \n     Iraqi Army take the lead in fighting the enemies of a free \n     Iraq. The Iraqi Security Forces still must rely on U.S. \n     support, both in direct combat and especially in key combat \n     support functions. But any fair-minded reading of the current \n     situation must recognize that the ISF are unquestionably more \n     capable and shouldering a greater portion of the burden than \n     a year ago--and because of the extraordinary efforts of the \n     United States military, we expect they will become \n     increasingly capable with each passing month. Your \n     recommendation that we focus on counter-terrorism training \n     and operations--which is the most demanding task facing our \n     troops--tracks not only with our policy but also our \n     understanding, as well as the understanding of al Qaeda and \n     other terrorist organizations, that Iraq is a central front \n     in the war against terror.\n       Second, your letter proposes ``working with Iraqi leaders \n     to disarm the militias and to develop a broad-based and \n     sustainable political settlement, including amending the \n     Constitution to achieve a fair sharing of power and \n     resources.'' You are once again urging that the Bush \n     Administration adopt an approach that has not only been \n     embraced, but is now being executed. Prime Minister Nouri al-\n     Maliki is pursuing a national reconciliation project. It is \n     an undertaking that (a) was devised by the Iraqis; (b) has \n     the support of the United States, our coalition partners and \n     the United Nations; and (c) is now being implemented. \n     Further, in Iraq's political evolution, the Sunnis, who \n     boycotted the first Iraq election, are now much more involved \n     in the political process. Prime Minister Maliki is head of a \n     free government that represents all communities in Iraq for \n     the first time in that nation's history. It is in the context \n     of this broad-based, unity government, and the lasting \n     national compact that government is pursuing, that the Iraqis \n     will consider what amendments might be required to the \n     constitution that the Iraqi people adopted last year. On the \n     matter of disarming militias: that is precisely what Prime \n     Minister al-Maliki is working to do. Indeed, Coalition \n     leaders are working with him and his ministers to devise and \n     implement a program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate \n     members of militias and other illegal armed groups.\n       Third, your letter calls for ``convening an international \n     conference and contact group to support a political \n     settlement in Iraq, to preserve Iraq's sovereignty, and to \n     revitalize the stalled economic reconstruction and rebuilding \n     effort.'' The International Compact for Iraq, launched \n     recently by the sovereign Iraqi government and the United \n     Nations, is the best way to work with regional and \n     international partners to make substantial economic progress \n     in Iraq, help revitalize the economic reconstruction and \n     rebuilding of that nation, and support a fair and just \n     political settlement in Iraq--all while preserving Iraqi \n     sovereignty. This effort is well under way, it has momentum, \n     and I urge you to support it.\n       Three of the key proposals found in your letter, then, are \n     already reflected in current U.S. and Iraqi policy in the \n     region.\n       On the fourth element of your proposed ``new direction,'' \n     however, we do disagree strongly. Our strategy calls for \n     redeploying troops from Iraq as conditions on the ground \n     allow, when the Iraqi Security Forces are capable of \n     defending their nation, and when our military commanders \n     believe the time is right. Your proposal is driven by none of \n     these factors; instead, it would have U.S. forces begin \n     withdrawing from Iraq by the end of the year, without regard \n     to the conditions on the ground. Because your letter lacks \n     specifics, it is difficult to determine exactly what is \n     contemplated by the ``phased redeployment'' you propose. (One \n     such proposal, advanced by Representative Murtha, a signatory \n     to your letter, suggested that U.S. forces should be \n     redeployed as a ``quick reaction force'' to Okinawa, which is \n     nearly 5,000 miles from Baghdad).\n       Regardless of the specifics you envision by ``phased \n     redeployment,'' any premature withdrawal of U.S. forces would \n     have disastrous consequences for America's security. Such a \n     policy would embolden our terrorist enemies; betray the hopes \n     of the Iraqi people; lead to a terrorist state in control of \n     huge oil reserves; shatter the confidence our regional allies \n     have in America; undermine the spread of democracy in the \n     Middle East; and mean the sacrifices of American troops would \n     have been in vain. This ``new direction'' would lead to a \n     crippling defeat for America and a staggering victory for \n     Islamic extremists. That is not a direction this President \n     will follow. The President is being guided by a commitment to \n     victory--and that plan, in turn, is being driven by the \n     counsel and recommendations of our military commanders in the \n     region.\n       Finally, your letter calls for replacing Secretary of \n     Defense Rumsfeld. We strongly disagree. Secretary Rumsfeld is \n     an honorable and able public servant. Under his leadership, \n     the United States Armed Forces and our allies have overthrown \n     two brutal tyrannies and liberated more than 50 million \n     people. Al Qaeda has suffered tremendous blows. Secretary \n     Rumsfeld has pursued vigorously the President's vision for a \n     transformed U.S. military. And he has played a lead role in \n     forging and implementing many of the policies you now \n     recommend in Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld retains the full \n     confidence of the President.\n       We appreciate your stated interest in working with the \n     Administration on policies that honor the sacrifice of our \n     troops and promote our national security, which we believe \n     can be accomplished only through victory in this central \n     front in the War on Terror.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joshua B. Bolten,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n       Identical Letters Sent To:\n       The Honorable Harry Reid, Senate Democratic Leader.\n       The Honorable Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader.\n       The Honorable Dick Durbin, Senate Assistant Democratic \n     Leader.\n       The Honorable Steny Hoyer, House Minority Whip.\n       The Honorable Carl Levin, Ranking Member, Senate Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       The Honorable Ike Skelton, Ranking Member, House Armed \n     Services Committee.\n       The Honorable Joe Biden, Ranking Member, Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee.\n       The Honorable Tom Lantos, Ranking Member, House \n     International Relations Committee.\n       The Honorable Jay Rockefeller, Vice Chairman, Senate \n     Intelligence Committee.\n       The Honorable Jane Harman, Ranking Member, House \n     Intelligence Committee.\n       The Honorable Daniel Inouye, Ranking Member, Senate Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee.\n       The Honorable John Murtha, Ranking Member, House Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I thank my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. I return to the President's August 21 news conference. \nThat sets the tenor for how we should address this debate not only in \nthe Senate but across the land as we direct our attention to this \nimportant subject. The President concludes another paragraph in that \nnews conference:\n\n       And so we will continue to speak out in a respectful way, \n     never challenging somebody's love for America when you \n     criticize their strategies or their point of view.\n\n  That is the context in which I wish to address the Senate this \nafternoon and have tried to do so in a respectful way, just as the \nPresident said.\n  I turn to another part of the letter I referred to, written by the \nDemocratic leadership, in which they say:\n\n       We also think there is one additional measure you can take \n     immediately to demonstrate that you recognize the problems \n     your policies have created in Iraq and elsewhere, consider \n     changing the civilian leadership at the Defense Department.\n\n  Everyone has a perfect right to do that. That has been stated in this \nletter.\n  We go back to the basic strategy of this great republic, as laid down \nby our forefathers in the Constitution. The President was given the \nresponsibility as Commander in Chief, as President, to assemble the \nCabinet of his choosing--or her, in the future, if we have a female \nPresident. He has exercised that. This Senate has given its advice and \nconsent, as is required under the Constitution for each of the Members, \nincluding Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  I draw upon my distinguished colleague from Alaska, his comments \nabout Secretary Rumsfeld. Similar to the Senator from Alaska, I, too, \nhave known Secretary Rumsfeld for a very long time. When I was \nSecretary of the Navy, he was in the White House at that time. I had \nsome contact with him. In the ensuing years, I served under three \nSecretaries of Defense in my 5 years in the Department of Defense. In \nthe ensuing years, in my\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nyears in the Senate, I have worked with each and every one of the \nSecretaries of Defense, so I have some understanding, modest though it \nbe, with regard to that office and those who have served in that \noffice.\n  I find in my dealings with Secretary Rumsfeld over the years he has \nbeen in office--I worked on his confirmation, as a matter of fact, at \nthat time--I have found him, much like the Senator from Alaska, to be \nan individual with whom I could work very successfully. I have \nestablished a working relationship and a mutual respect. I believe it \nis a fundamental right of the President to make his choice.\n  This debate, in a way, is an attack on the President as to his choice \nand to his constitutional right to select his own Cabinet. In so doing, \nwe must respect that Constitution and his right to do so. He has chosen \nSecretary Rumsfeld. Within the past day or two, he has reiterated his \nunwavering support. Consequently, we must recognize it comes down to \nthe Constitution, the Presidential right to select members of his \nCabinet.\n  I join my colleague from Alaska and other colleagues in resisting, in \nevery way, any call by which to indicate a lack of confidence in the \nPresident's choice for the Office of Secretary of Defense.\n  I may have further remarks to deliver on this subject as the debate \ncontinues, but at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I begin by saying, I have been listening to \nthe debate for a good period of time. It is a pleasure to hear the \nSenator from Virginia, who is always civil in his approach to these \ndebates and who always asks intelligent and probing questions. The \ncolloquies I have had with him, and certainly the colloquy I listened \nto a moment ago, are what the Senate ought to be about. It has been an \nintelligent, healthy exchange with respect to policy in Iraq.\n  I will speak to the question of Secretary Rumsfeld in a few moments, \nbut I share some thoughts. Regrettably, the debate that preceded the \nSenator from Virginia, without mentioning Senators specifically, is \nrelatively insulting and is not worthy of the subject and its \nimportance.\n  One colleague talked about how war was declared against the United \nStates on September 11 and drummed up America's passion that we all \nshare about opposing terrorists. However, he did exactly what a lot of \npeople on the other side of the aisle have been doing for 4 or 5 years \nnow, which is conflating the war on terror into Iraq.\n  Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I have \nnot heard one person in this country who doesn't want to do everything \nin the power of our Nation in order to stand up to terrorists. We all \nvoted to go to Afghanistan. We all voted to take on the Taliban and al-\nQaida. If the President had kept his eye on the ball and done what was \nnecessary in Afghanistan and not outsourced the job to Afghan \nmercenaries, we would have perhaps used the 101st Airborne, the 82nd \nAirborne, the 10th Mountain Division, or the 1st Marines to do what the \nCIA, it is now known publicly, was arguing adamantly we ought to be \ndoing, which was surrounding Tora Bora and capturing or killing Osama \nbin Laden and those thousand or so people up there with him. The \nPresident wouldn't have had to quote Osama bin Laden yesterday if we \nhad done the job at Tora Bora. That is what we voted to do, every \nsingle one of us.\n\n  We gave the money. We have consistently voted for the PATRIOT Act--\nthe vast majority--and voted for the reorganization of our intelligence \ncommunity and done everything in our power to fight terrorists.\n  Let me remind our colleague who wanted to drum up the passion of the \nNation about being attacked on September 11, that it was not Saddam who \nattacked us. It was not anybody from Iraq. It was Osama bin Laden and \nother terrorists.\n  The fact is, there are more terrorists today in Iraq than there were \non September 11. There are more terrorists in the world today who want \nto kill Americans than there were on September 11. Is that a policy \nthat is working?\n  More terrorists today want to kill Americans than on September 11, \nwhen the whole world was united behind the United States of America, \nwhen newspapers across the world said, ``We are all Americans now,'' \nand everyone was ready to do what we needed to do in Afghanistan. We \nsquandered that. This administration has squandered it. There has been \na complete and total lack of accountability for what has happened in \nbetween.\n  I heard one of our colleagues come to the Senate and say it would be \na mistake to leave before Iraq can provide its own security. We are not \ntalking about leaving before they can provide their own security. I \nheard another colleague say what a mistake it would be to withdraw \nprecipitously. Precipitously? What is precipitous about saying we are \ngoing to set a target for withdrawal a year from now? A whole year from \nnow we are going to stand up their forces, to provide for the security \nof their nation. That is not precipitous.\n  I am tired of a whole bunch of people who want to conflate, distort, \nand mislead Americans with a phony debate about the war on terror.\n  Iraq was not the war on terror. Today it is not the center of the war \non terror. Are there some terrorists in Iraq? You bet there are. It is \nthe best training ground in the world for terrorists. It is a poster \nchild for recruitment for terrorists. And they are coming. And where \nare they going? They are going to Europe. Europe is now the center of \nal-Qaida. I don't know how many people know that. There are cells in \nGermany and elsewhere in Europe. We are providing the training ground.\n  The fact is that Iraqis themselves do not want al-Qaida there. If we \ncan provide them the capacity to provide for their own security, \nbelieve me, they will drive out whatever is left of the remnants of \nforeign tourists because the Shia don't like them, the Sunnis don't \nlike them, the Kurds don't need them and don't like them, and they will \nnot survive, except to the degree that they currently provide a \nconvenient connection between the interests of the different parties in \nIraq that can only be resolved politically.\n  Now, let's come back to that. Let's get away from this phony debate \nwe have had in the Senate and this country. Secretary Rice said this \ncan only be resolved politically and diplomatically. General Casey has \nsaid there is no military solution. If there is no military solution, \nwhat is the solution?\n  The Senator from Texas said: Give me a plan, give me an idea, one \nidea that is different. Well, we have done it. We have suggested, many \nof us, including distinguished people such as General Zinni, who knows \nthe region. He is about as good and as tough and as patriotic as there \nis a soldier in America. He believes, as I and others do, the only way \nto resolve what is happening in the Middle East and Iraq is through \ndiplomacy and political effort.\n  I suggested during the discussion of the amendment that I had several \nmonths ago we ought to have an international summit. The Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations believes it. The King of Jordan believes \nit. The President of Egypt believes it. A whole bunch of people in the \nregion believe that unless you get the full measure of all the parties \ntogether--the Sunni, the Shia, the Kurds, the factions of Iraq, the \nIraqis themselves, obviously as a government, the Arab League, the \nneighbor states, including Syria and Iran--you cannot begin to resolve \nthis problem.\n  Ask yourselves the simple question: How is this going to be resolved? \nHow are American forces going to come back? They are going to come back \nif you provide the measure of stability to Iraq that it deserves and \nneeds. How do you provide the measure of stability it deserves and \nneeds? By providing confidence to the people and confidence to the \nparties that the differences between them are adequately resolved, that \nthere is a level of investment, of a stakeholder investment in all of \nthose parties.\n  How do you get there? You don't get there by not talking to each \nother. You don't get there by not having the kind of summitry and \ndiplomacy that has guided the world through most of the last centuries \nof civilized behavior. That is not taking place. There is a total \nabsence of the kind of effort that can help to resolve what is \nhappening in Iraq.\n  Our soldiers have done their job. They have provided the opportunity \nfor\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\ndemocracy. They have provided for several elections, for the transfer \nof authority. And to measure plans--the Senator from Texas said: Give \nme a plan--what was the plan of the Republicans, of the administration? \nThe plan is: As they stand up, we will stand down. What American has \nnot heard those words from the President? ``As they stand up, we will \nstand down.''\n  Well, what has happened? Eighty-five percent of their forces are now \nsupposedly trained. You cannot have it both ways. At some point the \ngame has to stop. Either there really are 85 percent trained, and they \nare making progress--which they keep telling us--or they are not. If \nthey are, then why aren't we able to withdraw a few troops? Either they \nare or they are not. And you ought to be able to withdraw some of those \ntroops. The fact is, we are not standing down.\n  The violence over the last month was the worst. They have just upped \nthe number of people in the morgue, tripled it. It is the worst month \nin the last months. And each month keeps on being a worse month than \nthe month before.\n  Now, somewhere along the line, I learned in the military there is \naccountability. If a captain runs a ship aground, he is gone. That is \nit--usually with no questions asked. I noticed that the commander of \nthe Cole was held responsible, even though it was not his fault for \nwhat happened in the bombing of the Cole, and he is not going to be \npromoted. These things affect careers and they affect your tenure. Ask \nGeneral Shinseki. Ask the folks who were involved in Abu Ghraib, at \nleast at the lower levels.\n  What happened to the accountability in this administration, \nparticularly within the military branch, the Pentagon, for the \ndecisions that have been made along the way?\n  Our plan says we will set a date by which time the Iraqis have to \nassume responsibility so that we leverage the Iraqis to assume that \nresponsibility. Now, is that precipitous--a year from now? I do not \nthink so, particularly when you read the language of what we laid out, \nwhich says the President has the discretion to leave troops there to \ncomplete the training. There is nothing precipitous about allowing the \nPresident to have the discretion to complete the training and leave \ntroops there. That is not a withdrawal even, complete and total.\n  Secondly, we allow the President the discretion to keep sufficient \nspecial forces there to fight al-Qaida.\n  And, thirdly, we allow the President to be able to protect American \nfacilities and forces.\n  Now, that is pretty broad, folks. It is time we had a real debate \nabout what is going to empower the Iraqis to be able to take control \nover their own future, and we had a real debate that does not try to \nscare the American people. The way fear has been thrown around by this \nadministration is disgraceful. And they keep drumming up terrorism and \nsuggesting that Iraq is somehow the center of this war on terror, which \nit is not now today and never has been.\n  This administration has made our Nation less safe than it ought to be \nbecause they have focused so much time and energy and effort--and \nsquandered it--in Iraq. They have lost allies and regional links that \nwe ought to have traditionally because they have pushed people away \nfrom us. They do not have credibility in the region. It is extremely \ndifficult for them to conduct diplomacy with people who, frankly, do \nnot trust them.\n  In fact, they have empowered Iran. Iran is stronger today because of \nIraq than it would have been without Iraq. And there is no expert on \nIran who will not tell you that. Are we safer because Iran is stronger \ntoday? Because we are so bogged down in Iraq we do not have the ability \nto do what we need to do?\n  I listened to my colleagues talk about Secretary Rumsfeld. I heard \nthem say that they have known him a long time, that they have a good \nworking relationship, that there is a mutual respect, that they like \nhim, that he is smart, and a whole host of things that are part of \nworking with somebody through the years. I respect that.\n  But none of that goes to the fundamental question of whether you have \nconfidence in his judgment. None of that goes to the question of \nwhether he has made such a series of mistakes that he is a symbol, an \nemblem, of our failure in Iraq and is one of the reasons you cannot get \nother countries and other people to the table to help resolve the \ndifferences here.\n  I called for Secretary Rumsfeld to resign 3 years ago. Three years \nago I felt that the level of the mistakes were so significant--in the \ndeployment of troops, in the abandonment of a plan for postwar Iraq, in \nthe choices that were made--that I thought that track record exhibited \nterrible judgment, poor planning, and ideologically driven \ndecisionmaking, to which this administration has consistently turned a \ndeaf ear.\n  I think the office of Secretary of Defense ought to be above \npolitics. And I think it also ought to never be beyond accountability. \nBut under Secretary Rumsfeld it has been profoundly political, as we \nsaw last week reemphasized again, and it has been utterly \nunaccountable.\n\n  The Secretary's record says a lot about the question of \naccountability in this administration and certainly has not stopped him \nfrom speaking his mind.\n  A few days ago, Secretary Rumsfeld gave a low and ugly political \nspeech, smearing those who dissent from a catastrophic policy. And then \nhe spoke of moral confusion in our country. Well, there is some moral \nconfusion around.\n  I think it is immoral for old men to send young Americans to fight \nand die in a conflict with a strategy that is failing and a mission \nthat has not weakened terrorism but strengthened it.\n  I think it is immoral to not tell the truth to America about the \nprogress in that war just to get through a new cycle or an election.\n  I think it is immoral to treat 9/11 as a political pawn and to \ncontinue to excuse the invasion of Iraq by exploiting the 3,000 mothers \nand fathers, sons and daughters who were lost on September 11. They \nwere attacked and killed, I remind the Senate again, not by Saddam \nHussein but by Osama bin Laden.\n  And it is deeply immoral to compare a majority of Americans--a \nmajority of Americans--who oppose a failing policy and seek a winning \none; we do not seek to quit, as one Senator suggested--we seek to win. \nAnd we have a better strategy for winning. And to compare those who \nseek a better strategy to win to appeasers of fascism and Naziism is an \ninsult to the quality of debate we ought to have in this country. And \nit is overtly political.\n  The leaders in this administration have shown they will do anything, \nsay anything, twist any truth, and even endanger our Nation's character \nas one America simply to execute a political strategy for the election.\n  I heard one Senator talk about political strategy. Karl Rove has been \npretty open about expressing where the Republicans need to go in order \nto try to win; and it is to exploit security.\n  Americans, I believe, now see through this charade. They know the \ntruth. They know we have a ``Katrina'' foreign policy, a succession of \nblunders and failures that have betrayed our ideals, killed and maimed \nsoldiers, and widened the terrorist threat instead of defeating it.\n  In the place of accountability, we have vicious, partisan attacks on \nanyone who opposes those policies with a suggestion not for how you \nquit, not for how you run but for how you win--how you win.\n  We have watched Iraq sliding further and further into a bloody civil \nwar, with too few troops and no plan. Who is responsible for too few \ntroops and no plan? The President and Secretary of Defense.\n  I have heard Republican colleagues privately express their \nreservations about this policy and about this Secretary. Can we afford \nto trust our Pentagon to an individual who seems to be the last person \nto acknowledge the mistakes that have been made? Secretary Rice said \nthere have been thousands of mistakes.\n  Who admits to the fiasco of hubris and mismanagement that falls \nlargely at the Secretary's own doorstep, who can only reach for a sort \nof clumsy, rhetorical brick to hurl at the opponents, suggesting, \nwithout an ounce of shame, that they are soft on Hitler. Soft on \nHitler?\n  We are too long overdue for some accountability. But instead of the \npink slips that they so richly deserve, this\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nadministration's worst foreign policy failures are instead rewarded. \nYou get a Presidential Medal of Freedom. George Tenet, who presided \nover the intelligence failures leading up to 9/11, Medal of Freedom. \nPaul Bremer, who botched the occupation, Medal of Freedom. And somehow \nit seems the only people in this administration who are rewarded are \nthose who make the mistakes, while those who tell the truth are \npunished.\n  According to Secretary of State Rice, we know this has to be resolved \npolitically and diplomatically, but it is not.\n  Who is accountable for those mistakes? Who is accountable for young \npeople dying as a result of mistakes? Who is accountable for billions \nof dollars being spent as a result of mistakes?\n  We are all human. We all make mistakes. We understand that. But there \nis a point of accountability in the carrying out of a high public job, \nwhere mistake compounded on mistake compounded on mistake begs for \naccountability.\n  On issue after issue, Secretary Rumsfeld has made the wrong decision. \nYou may like him, respect him, admire his long years of public service, \nbut he has been wrong, when he could have listened to General Shinseki, \nand other generals, and put in enough troops to maintain order. We have \nheard a whole group of other generals speak out about what happened \nover there. He chose not to listen. He chose not to listen. He was \nwrong.\n  When he could have implemented a detailed State Department plan for \nreconstructing post-Saddam Iraq--guess what--he ignored it, threw it \naway, would not have anything to do with it. He was wrong, again.\n  When he could have ordered the protection of American forces by \nguarding the ammo dumps and making sure a plan was in place to move \nefficiently through the territory that they were taking, where there \nwere weapons of individual destruction, he chose not to. He was wrong. \nAnd he exposed our young men and women to the ammo that now maims and \nkills them because they chose not to act. Who is accountable for that?\n  When he could have imposed immediate order and structure in Baghdad \nafter the fall of Saddam, do you know what he did? He shrugged his \nshoulders publicly on television and he said Baghdad was safer than \nWashington, DC, and he chose not to act. He was wrong.\n  When the administration could have kept an Iraqi Army selectively \nintact, they chose not to. He was wrong.\n  When they could have kept an entire civil structure functioning and \nprovided basic services to Iraqi citizens, they chose not to. And they \nwere wrong.\n  When they could have accepted the offers of the United Nations and \nindividual countries that were provided at the time in order to give us \non-the-ground peacekeepers to help us and reconstruction assistance to \nhelp us so the American taxpayer and soldier did not carry the whole \nburden, he chose not to. They were wrong.\n  When they should have leveled with the American people that the \ninsurgency had grown--when many of us were on the floor of the Senate \nsaying the insurgency is growing, it is out of control--they ignored \nthe insurgency, chose to ignore it. And they were wrong.\n  Wrong decisions, wrong priorities, but, tragically, no \naccountability.\n  Some Republican Senators have had the courage to come to the floor \nand talk about this lack of accountability and talk about these \njudgments that were wrong. How did it get so wrong? It got so wrong \nbecause, in part, the Secretary became so enamored with ``new think'' \nand transformation at the Pentagon that he failed to see the limits. He \nbelieved the American military could operate lighter, smaller, leaner.\n  A lot of people spent a great deal of time in the 1990s thinking \nabout this. They looked at the first Persian Gulf war, and they saw how \nthe application of air power and stealth and precision munitions, \ncombined with the latest information technology, could radically change \nthe way wars are fought. And operationally they were right. But at the \noperational level, we had a military that emerged from the Clinton \nadministration prepared to apply its technological advantage against \nany enemy.\n  Witness the fact that it was the Clinton buildup and capacity that, \nin effect, was used because the President had only been President for \n10 months. They had not transformed the military. That was the military \nthat succeeded in routing the Iraqi Army. It was that military that \ndrove to Baghdad in 3 weeks. And that is an edge that we all want to \nmaintain forever.\n  But Secretary Rumsfeld failed to understand that the wars of the \nfuture would not be fought only at the operational level. He fell in \nlove with the vision of the Armed Forces of the future and lost track \nof the reality of the current threat.\n  He believed that a heavy dose of shock and awe was all it would take \nto break our adversary's will. That failure to see past the operational \nlevel was part and parcel of an administration that came to power with \nnothing but contempt for nation building. They scoffed at the lessons \nlearned previously. That is why the Secretary began his tenure trying \nto slash Army end strength and boots on the ground to fund missile \ndefense. He was betting, unwisely, that America would not find itself \nin anymore failed states.\n  So now we have the fifth summer of Mr. Rumsfeld's tenure coming to a \nclose, and we find ourselves engaged in massive stability operations in \ntwo failed states, Iraq and Afghanistan. In short, Mr. Rumsfeld was \nwrong again and again and again. American troops have had to pay the \nprice for that, as has the American taxpayer, and too many Americans \nhave paid with their lives.\n  I believe personally that Secretary Rumsfeld should be held \naccountable for this job. When faced with widespread looting in Iraq, \nthe Secretary quipped that freedom is messy. When he was asked by a \nsoldier why they were sent in without the necessary armor, he said that \nyou go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you want--despite \nthe fact that parents were able to buy armor for their kids on the \nInternet and elsewhere. He has dismissed international law regarding \nmilitary detainees and abuses at Abu Ghraib. He still refuses to \nacknowledge that the Army and Marine Corps are too small for the \nmissions they face. Earlier this year, he even supported cuts to the \nNational Guard.\n  Mr. President, I believe his stubbornness is our weakness. He likes \nto talk about the war on terror as the long war, but in this long war \nhe is stretching the Army to its limits. Its officers and \nnoncommissioned officers are sent on back-to-back deployments with \ninadequate resources. Despite their heroic service, they are leaving \nthis military. It is costing us enormous extra sums of money to hold it \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary's benefit of the doubt has come and \ngone. I think the moment of accountability is long overdue. Americans \ndeserve leadership they can trust. We need to change the course in \nIraq. We all want to be successful, but the current course is not \nleading to that success. And if it is, then there is no reason they \ncannot begin an adequate redeployment, as General Casey said--in fact, \nGeneral Casy's own dates coincide with the dates of those of us who \nsuggested to set a date about a year from now. You can always change a \ndate if you have to. If the situation on the ground doesn't change \nadequately, you have flexibility. But unless you leverage the \nwillingness of the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their own \nfuture, there is nothing that American troops can do except continue to \nbe sent out on missions where they discover improvised explosive \ndevices the hard way. We have too many young Americans who are in \nBethesda and Walter Reed as a consequence of that policy. I believe \nthere was a better policy to fight terror, to liberate us, and to fight \nbroadly in some 65 countries around the world where al-Qaida is \nembedded. We need to fight that, and we need a greater troop level and \ncapacity on the ground in Afghanistan.\n  All of these things are needed, and they are all suffering because of \ndecisions made and not made. I believe on credibility and the track \nrecord of decisions based on ideology, this Secretary is not the person \nfor the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from \nMassachusetts speaking. In many ways, I find it a bit disingenuous. I \nhad planned to speak specifically about other points relative to this \nresolution. I think it is appropriate to respond to some of what he has \nsaid. Of course, he is the former standard bearer of the party in the \nprior election and, therefore, a voice of considerable import on policy \nin this Nation relative to the position of the Democratic Party.\n  The Senator gave a litany of what he deemed to be errors--some of \nwhich I agree were errors--that have occurred relative to the way we \nhave pursued this battle in Iraq. It is a litany as if he is a Monday \nmorning quarterback and had the answer now to what would have been the \ncorrect process. It sort of makes you think that if he were giving a \ndiscussion about the Red Sox, he would not have put Bill Buckner at \nfirst. He would not have picked Bucky Dent. He would have given Carlton \nFisk his contract. Or he would not have traded Babe Ruth.\n  When you come to the Senate floor and pick out a series of events as \nunique items that flowed within the context of a major effort to \nconfront the terrorist threat to this Nation--he uses the term \n``hubris'' and mismanagement. I would say it is a bit of hubris to take \nthat position on the Senate floor.\n  The Senator failed to mention, for example, that as a result of the \ninitiatives of this administration, led by this President and this \nSecretary of Defense, over 50 million people today are free who were \nnot free; that women in Afghanistan are no longer closeted in their \nhomes and threatened with death if they wear the wrong garment on the \nstreet, or shot in soccer stadiums in Afghanistan, but women have the \nright to move about as they wish; that there have been elections in \nAfghanistan that have brought to power a democratic government, which \nis under pressure today, yes, because of those forces that represent \nour enemies, and our enemies seek to undermine that democracy. He \nfailed to mention that Iraq, which has suffered for 20 years from a \ngenocide executed by a homicidal leadership, is now free and that the \npeople of Iraq no longer have to fear mass murder of the proportions \nthat occurred under Saddam Hussein; that a government that was and had \nproduced chemical weapons and used them against their own people--\nspecifically the Kurds--was no longer in power; that we have had a \nseries of democratic actions in Iraq that have led to a freely elected \ngovernment, which involves a coalition of very disparate groups--\nSunnis, Shiites, Kurds, and subdivisions within those various clans of \npolitical purpose; that that government is moving forward, and that it \nhas stood up an army that is a responsible army, not one of threat to \nits people but an army of defense of its people. And it is in the \nprocess of taking responsibility or defending those people from forces \nin that nation who wish to return to chaos, to genocide, and to a \ngovernment that is lawless in the name of fanaticism.\n\n  He failed to mention any of that as the results of the efforts of \nthis administration. Those are pretty big things. Instead, he picks out \nthe little events--fairly big in some instances--of error. Yes, there \nhave been some errors, and nobody denies that for a second. But the \npurpose is to defeat our enemies, and we have set as a goal in that \nprocess setting up a government in the nation of Iraq that will speak \nto the basic values that are fundamentally western--individual liberty, \ndemocracy, rights for women, and a marketplace economy. And we have had \nconsiderable success in that effort. We are not there yet, and we do \nnot know if we will accomplish the final goal because, obviously, there \nare forces at work who do not wish to have us accomplish that goal.\n  But to dismiss this as a failure and to point to a series of \nincidents as an example of failure and never acknowledge the 50 million \nfree people, the fact that an entire half of the population that had \nbeen written out of the ability to participate in civilized life--\nspecifically women--are now brought into the process of having a decent \nlifestyle, the fact that we have had elections, the fact that we have \nan army in place that is their army, the fact that we are moving toward \na nation based on democracy and law--we have a long way to go, but we \nare moving that way--to dismiss that and say that because of a series \nof errors, which he deems to be errors--and in some instances I agree--\nwe should call for the removal of the Secretary of Defense because of \nthose events is just ignoring reality.\n  In fact, he used the terms on innumerable instances, saying he did \nnot want to see a partisan fight; he thought the Secretary of Defense \nshould be above politics. So how can you then come to the floor of the \nSenate and make the speech that was just made? It was ``overtly \npolitical,'' to use his term, which was for the purpose of exuding a \npolitical strategy that if you attack the Secretary of Defense, you \nweaken the Presidency and will do better in the election. It was, to \nuse his term, ``a viciously partisan attack.''\n  There is inconsistency which cannot go uncalled. So let me point it \nout. This proposal is not an attack on Donald Rumsfeld. That is not the \npurpose of this attack. That is the politics of this attack. It \ngenerates a good press release, and it is a sound bite event to call \nfor the Secretary of Defense to resign. But that is not what this is \nabout. We all know that.\n  This is about the policy of fighting people who have determined that \nAmerica should be extinguished from the face of the Earth, that \nAmericans should be killed and our culture should be destroyed, and \nwhether our efforts in Iraq are a legitimate part of that defense as we \nconfront that threat.\n  It is the position of the other side, it appears, that Iraq is not \npart of the battle or essential to the battle against Islamic fascism, \nIslamic fundamentalism. I find that position to be untenable. That is \nhardly the position taken by our enemies. The words of Zarqawi and the \nwords of bin Laden have been very specific: Iraq is where they see the \nwar being waged. Their purpose is to use Iraq as a bootstrap to pursue \ntheir goals of basically undermining and destroying western culture and \nkilling Americans. You need to believe their words. If your enemy tells \nyou what they are going to do, and your enemy then does what they tell \nyou they are going to do, you have to start taking them seriously when \nhe tells you something else. And when Osama bin Laden and Zarqawi say \nIraq is where the war is being fought, where the effort to pursue \nIslamic fundamentalism is being pursued and aggressively undertaken, \nthen you have to take that seriously.\n  But it appears that the other side believes that Iraq is a \ndistraction to our efforts. Well, the track record doesn't show that. \nHave we been attacked in the United States since 9/11? The reason we \nhave not been attacked, in some measure, is good luck, good fortune, \nbut it is also the fact that this administration has put into place an \naggressive effort to fight terrorism not in America--Islamic \nfundamentalism and fascism--not on our soil but to take the fight to \ntheir soil and to meet them where they are.\n\n  That policy appears to be working. We can't take great solace, \nobviously, because who knows when they will attack us again and when \nthey will breach our capacity to be secure.\n  I don't claim that we are anywhere near secure. In fact, I made it \nvery clear that I have serious reservations about things we still need \nto do to make ourselves secure. But the fact is that the concept, the \nbasic philosophy of pursuing the terrorists, the Islamic \nfundamentalists, the Islamic fascist movement, on their territory \nversus waiting for them to attack us and hoping to get them through our \nintelligence capability before they do that is a policy which is the \ncorrect policy.\n  Yet the other side of the aisle has had enough of it. They have had \nenough of it. So they want to use the stalking horse of attacking the \nSecretary of Defense as a process for basically undermining the \npolicies and efforts which have led us at least to this point to some \nlevel of security as a nation. They don't appear, from what I have \nheard here so far, to really even have an offer of an alternative that \nis specific enough that it could be said to be a real alternative.\n  A letter was sent to the President outlining their alternative. They \noutlined four initiatives in this alternative. Three of them we are \nalready pursuing and pursuing aggressively. The response from the \nadministration was put in the Record earlier today by the Senator from \nArizona.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n  The diplomatic process is going forward. I heard the Senator from \nMassachusetts talk extensively about the diplomatic need, that this \nshould be resolved diplomatically, and I believe his words were that \nthere is no military solution, there is only a diplomatic solution.\n  I only point out the obvious: You can't get to a diplomatic solution \nwithout having a military on the ground that makes things stable enough \nso that diplomacy can go forward. If you withdraw the military, you \nhave chaos, and there is no diplomacy that is going to straighten that \nout. So that argument is a little disingenuous, to say the least.\n  Sure, there isn't a military solution in the sense that this is a war \ninvolving nationhood, nation against nation in the tradition of the \nwars of the 20th century, but there are military actions that can be \ntaken and need to be taken which involve finding those people who wish \nto do us harm and eliminating them before they can do us harm. And a \nbig part of that involves the intelligence and the on-the-ground \ncapability which we gain by being in Iraq and having an influence in \nthat nation which is leading toward a form of democracy.\n  Another big part of that which is again military based is allowing \nIraq to evolve to the point where it can actually show the rest of the \nIslamic world that democracy is not an enemy, that democracy gives \npeople good options; that giving people rights, especially women, is \nnot bad for them but actually is good for them; that a culture which is \nopen, which is market oriented, which has a reasonable level of \nfreedom, is a better way of life than a culture which is closed and \nwhich denies people the rights to participate other than through some \nsort of extremist control, such as the Taliban had. It becomes a beacon \nof opportunity to look to. We are not there yet, but we are never going \nto get there if we don't make the effort.\n  So if we look at their proposals--and, as I said, three of them have \nalready been met. What is the fourth one? The fourth one is to begin \nwhat they refer to as--I will quote this. This is actually not their \nfourth one, it is their second one--although the other three have been \nmet--in their letter to the President:\n\n        . . . beginning the phased redeployment of U.S. forces \n     from Iraq before the end of this year.\n\n  This year. The Senator from Massachusetts kept saying a year from now \nto begin the redeployment. Their position is not a year from now; their \nposition is this year to begin redeployment.\n  What does this term ``phased redeployment'' mean? I wonder how many \nfocus groups they ran that one through before they decided to use that \nterminology, ``phased redeployment.'' I will tell you what it means. It \nis a phrase, the purpose of which is to give political cover to those \nwho wish to stand in opposition to the administration relative to what \nis happening in the war against the Islamic fascists.\n  In practice, were it ever to be executed--in other words, if you were \nactually to start pulling down troops before the end of this year--you \nwould have set an arbitrary date and you would start removing American \ntroops. What would happen to the troops left there? We all know Iraq is \nnot yet ready to defend itself. Would that not put at even greater risk \nAmerican soldiers left on the ground? How could you look the people in \nthe face who are in the divisions and who are in the brigades who have \nbeen left behind as you started to pull people out prematurely and \nsaid: Oh, good luck, you are now a bigger target because we aren't \nthere to give you the cover you need.\n  Phased redeployment before the end of this year, arbitrary date set \nfor the purposes of making a political statement as we head into an \nelection--it is not very good policy, to say the least, even if it is \npolicy. It isn't policy. It is just politics, a political statement.\n  With whom are they going to replace Donald Rumsfeld? Howard Dean? Ned \nLamont? I mean, these are the standard bearers of the position of their \nparty. They want to take out Donald Rumsfeld and I presume they want to \nput in Howard Dean and Ned Lamont, two people whose purpose it is to \nspeak for the party--one being the chairman of the party, one being the \nmost recent standard bearer of the party--to immediately withdraw, to \ntake our troops out of there now and to let happen what happens.\n  I am not going to use the pejorative to describe that. I think the \nAmerican people are sophisticated enough to recognize that policy makes \nno sense. Howard Dean as Secretary of Defense? Maybe we should amend \nthis and say ``and we shall replace him with Howard Dean.''\n  Howard Dean was a pretty good Governor from Vermont. I enjoyed \nworking with him when I was Governor of New Hampshire. He wouldn't be a \nvery good person in the Defense Department. He is not a very good \nperson on foreign policy, and he clearly does not understand the \nthreat, in my opinion, that the Islamic fundamentalists reflect.\n  The Howard Dean-Ned Lamont policy is a policy based on naivete. It is \na policy that rejects the reality of the situation, which is there are \npeople out there who wish to kill us and destroy our culture, and there \nare a lot of them, unfortunately. They feed off weakness, and they \nbelieve we are weak and will believe we are truly weak and will be able \nto make that case should we begin a phased withdrawal this year when we \nhave no military capability of covering that withdrawal and protecting \nour troops who are left behind. It is a policy that is firmly grounded \nin Birkenstocks and clearly not grounded in the reality of the world as \nit is but the world as they wish it were.\n\n  We have a truly extraordinary military. I recognize everybody on both \nsides of the aisle understands that. There isn't a Member in this \nChamber who hasn't been to a funeral and tried to console a member of a \nfamily of someone who has been lost in this war, in this battle. These \nare exceptional people who defend us and who carry forward our flag. \nThey need to understand that their purpose is good and their purpose is \nright. And it is. Their cause is to find the people who wish to do \nAmerica harm and who have said they intend to do America harm and to \neliminate them before they can attack us and do us further harm.\n  Iraq is an integral part of that cause. Have there been mistakes \nthere? Absolutely. Absolutely. It is terribly unfortunate, and we all \nrecognize that. But have there been successes there and very \nsignificant successes there? Yes, there have been. As I said before, 50 \nmillion people, between Iraq and Afghanistan, are now free, women \nbrought from behind the closeted doors of their houses into society, \npress availability, elections, governments formed, security forces who \nreport to a government. We have a long way to go, but these soldiers \nhave served extraordinarily well, and they have accomplished a great \ndeal. To use this attack on Donald Rumsfeld as a stalking horse as an \nattack on the policies of Iraq I don't believe does anybody any good.\n  If the other side of the aisle wishes to debate the Iraq issue in \ncontext of the policy, fine, but to personalize this in such a manner--\nto quote the Senator from Massachusetts--is viciously partisan and \novertly political and is not constructive to our ability to pursue this \nwar or to our need to assure our soldiers in the field that they fight \nfor our right and just cause.\n  Under the leadership of this President and the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Rumsfeld, the military has received the largest increases in \nresources since World War II. We have taken an approach to the military \nwhich has been to essentially get them whatever they need to do the job \nand do it right and make sure our soldiers are safe. Errors have been \nmade along the way in accomplishing that, but the attention and the \ncommitment to resources have been there, and this President and this \nSecretary of Defense take a second seat to no one in our history \nrelative to their commitment to the men and women who wear the uniform \nof the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, like others, I have had the good \nopportunity to listen with great interest during the course of the \nafternoon about the nature of the resolution which is before us which \nquestions the serious judgments of the Secretary of Defense in bringing \nus to where we are. He is the principal architect of the Iraq policy. I \nhave listened to others talk\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nabout the general nature of the threat in terms of our national \nsecurity.\n  In most recent times, we have an excellent Department of Defense \nstudy, some 63 pages long. We referenced it yesterday. It talks about \nthe principal challenges we are facing in Iraq. I will briefly mention \nparts of it.\n  It talks about sustained ethnosectarian violence is the greatest \nthreat to security and stability in Iraq; breaking the cycle of \nviolence is the most pressing immediate goal of the coalition in Iraqi \noperations; conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq, \nspecifically around Baghdad; concern about civil war with the Iraqi \ncivilian population has increased in recent months.\n  It goes on and talks about both Shia and Sunni death squads are \nactive in Iraq and responsible for the significant increase in \nsectarian violence; militias--small, illegally armed groups--operate \nopenly and often with popular support; civilian casualties increased by \napproximately 1,000 per month since the previous quarter; executions in \nparticular reached new highs in the month of July; and rising sectarian \nstrife defines the nature of violence in mid-2006.\n  Now we have to ask ourselves: How could all of this come to pass? Who \nwas the architect that brought us to this situation? Clearly, it is \nbecause of the persistent, stubborn insistence of those who believe \nthat we ought to stay the course, the principal architects being the \nSecretary of Defense and the President of the United States.\n  As has been mentioned here time in and time out, America was struck \nby al-Qaida, not Saddam Hussein. All of us gathered together to support \nthe attacks that took place in Afghanistan and the isolation of Osama \nbin Laden and the belief, as has been pointed out earlier in the course \nof the afternoon, we had a real opportunity to catch and to punish and \nto bring to justice the individual that was the principal architect of \n9/11. But instead, the administration moved military units and moved \nfocus out of that search for Osama bin Laden into Iraq--into Iraq. It \nwas Osama bin Laden who was the architect, not Saddam Hussein, and as a \nresult, we have effectively taken our eye off the principal author of \nterrorism.\n  Even as the President of the United States spoke yesterday, 17 times \nhe mentions Osama bin Laden. He was the one who was the architect. We \nshould have been after him for the last 4 years. Instead, we have been \nweighted down with the resulting conditions that I described earlier, \nand the principal architect of that is the Secretary of Defense. He was \nwrong when he represented that there were weapons of mass destruction \nin Iraq that threatened the United States. He was wrong about the \nconnection of al-Qaida to 9/11, as was demonstrated by the 9/11 \nCommission. He was wrong about the insurgency being just a group of \ndead-enders. He was wrong about the administration of Abu Ghraib. He \nhas just been continuously wrong, and we have the current situation \nwhich is outlined not by those of us who are supporting this resolution \nbut by the Department of Defense.\n  Let's look at what the military does to its soldiers when they have \nfailures in the performance of their duty. Here we have just mentioned, \nand it has been discussed over the course of the afternoon, the series \nof blunders by the Secretary of Defense--a series of blunders. Let's \nlook at how the military treats its people.\n  In 2003, the Navy fired 14 commanding officers. In October of that \nyear, the commanding officer of a Prowler aircraft squadron lost his \njob after one of his jets skidded off a runway. The Navy cited a ``loss \nof confidence'' when they made the decision to dismiss him.\n  In December of 2003 and January of 2004, the commanding officers of \nthe submarine Jimmy Carter and the frigate USS Gary were both fired \nbecause of ``loss of confidence.''\n  In 2004, the Navy fired the captain of the USS John F. Kennedy \naircraft carrier for running over a small boat in the Persian Gulf. The \nNavy didn't hide the incompetence or gloss over the facts. It responded \ndecisively. It stated plainly it had ``lost confidence'' in the \ncaptain's ability to operate the carrier safely. He was the eleventh \ncommanding officer of the Navy to be fired that year.\n  In February 2004, the commanding officer of the frigate USS Samuel B. \nRoberts was fired for a ``loss of confidence'' after he spent a night \noff the ship during a port visit to Ecuador.\n  For military officers in the Navy, the message is clear: If you fail, \nyou are fired. The message to the civilian leadership of this \nadministration is equally clear: If you fail, there are no \nconsequences, no accountability, even if more than 2,600 Americans lose \ntheir lives.\n  It is time for the Department of Defense to run a tighter ship at all \nlevels of command, including the civilian leadership. Those leaders at \nthe Pentagon should be held at least to the same standard of \naccountability to which military officers in the Navy are held.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld must be held accountable for the massive failures \nin Iraq. Civilian control of the military is one of the great \ncornerstones of our democracy. But what if the civilian leaders don't \nknow what they are doing and mindlessly lead our troops into battle \nunprepared? Clearly, there must be accountability for this breathtaking \nincompetence which has put our soldiers in daily danger and weakened \nAmerican national security.\n  In a hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2004, former \nDefense Secretary Harold Brown described the key to accountability:\n\n       At each level, the question is a loss of confidence. And in \n     the Navy, the loss of confidence goes with grounding your \n     ship. At a higher level, the loss of confidence has to be \n     determined on a basis that is somewhat broader, the full \n     performance. And I think that applies at the highest military \n     levels. And it applies at the level of the Secretary of \n     Defense and his staff.\n\n  That is what this resolution is all about.\n  The Bush administration has had its chance, and it has failed the \nbasic test of competence. It is more focused on the spin of war than \nthe real war in Iraq.\n  There is broad agreement among military experts, Members of Congress \nof both parties, and the overwhelming majority of the American people \nthat we need to change course in Iraq. We need this administration to \nface up to its mistakes and correct them. A good place to start would \nbe for the President to replace Secretary Rumsfeld. It is long past \ntime for Secretary Rumsfeld to go, and I urge the Senate to pass this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Another speaker on our side is coming. I wish to not \nmake a statement in that queue, so to speak. I just want to speak as a \nmanager of the bill. I was under the impression we would be able to get \nthrough this discussion prior to the submission of this resolution and \nbe able to go ahead with the votes we have. We have at least three \nvotes left tonight, and we have assurance that we are going to pass \nthis bill tomorrow, and there are still quite a few other amendments \nout there.\n  So I would like to know--can I inquire, may we get a time agreement \nfrom the other side of when this bill will pass tomorrow? I would like \nto know what is going to happen to this bill now? We had the \nunderstanding--I agreed we could not finish it on Wednesday, as we \ninitially agreed--that is today--and that we would finish it tomorrow. \nBut we had not anticipated this prolonged discussion about a resolution \nthat hasn't even been introduced yet.\n  Is the distinguished deputy leader willing to enter into some \ndiscussion about this?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could respond to the question of the \nSenator from Alaska, it is my understanding there was an attempt to \nreach a time agreement before this started and, unfortunately, there \nwas objection on the other side of the aisle. But----\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have not had any request for a time agreement. I have \nbeen willing to enter into a time agreement from the very beginning--\nfrom the very beginning.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to discuss this with Senator Reid, and \nwe will move quickly as our Members come to the floor prepared to \nspeak. We have tried to alternate back and forth, and we are prepared \nto continue to do that. Our goal is to finish this bill by tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would suggest then--is the Senator from Delaware going \nto speak next?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Pardon me. It is my eyes. I am sorry. Let's just skip \nthis space and we will have a speaker come and follow him when he is \nfinished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join today with many of my colleagues in \nexpressing ``no confidence'' in Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \nand urging President Bush to replace him. I truly respect the \nSecretary's commitment to public service, and I recognize that he has \none of the most difficult jobs here or anywhere in the world. He is a \nstand-up, tell-it-as-he-sees-it man, the kind we need more of in \nWashington. Unfortunately, the way he sees it has too often been wrong.\n  His disastrous failures in prosecuting the war in Iraq have left our \ncourageous American troops mired in a quagmire there with no end in \nsight. And his shameful rhetoric last week comparing critics of his \nfailed policies to the appeasers of Hitler was clearly a desperate \nattempt to divert attention away from his own failures.\n  Recent polls show the number of Americans who support the \nAdministration's policies in Iraq is down to 39 percent compared to a \nhigh of 76 percent in April 2003.\n  That loss of public confidence has occurred not because Americans are \nappeasers--they most certainly are not--and not because Americans don't \nsupport our troops because they most certainly do support them and \nadmire their incredible courage and patriotism as they persevere in the \nawful, deteriorating conditions there.\n  That loss of the public confidence in the Bush administration's war \nhas occurred because Americans can tell the difference between success \nand failure. They can see that the President's policies are not \nsucceeding in Iraq. They can see that the Iraqi Government and the \nIraqi people are not winning against their own countrymen who oppose \nthem. And the conditions in Iraq are getting still worse, not better.\n  All of the administration's rhetoric won't change their failed plans, \npolicies, and practices that have created this mess.\n  Shortly before the invasion of Iraq, then-Army Chief of Staff Eric \nShinseki testified before the Armed Services Committee that more than \ntwice the number of U.S. troops that the Secretary was planning to \ncommit to Iraq would be needed to secure the country after Saddam \nHussein's overthrow.\n  For his foresight and his candor, General Shinseki was essentially \ndismissed by the Secretary, who preferred to believe the \nadministration's favorite Iraqi exile, Ahmed Chalabi that the country \nwould go back to work the day after Saddam's regime was toppled.\n  So when widespread looting and disorder occurred instead, the \nSecretary of Defense dismissed its significance. We now know that \nGeneral Shinseki was right and President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and \nMr. Chalabi were wrong.\n  And that the initial civil disorder was a warning of much worse \nupheavals ahead, for which the Bush administration and its appointed \nIraqi administrators were completely unprepared.\n  Even more tragically, they remain unprepared even today. Increasing \nviolence, widespread corruption, nonexistent public services, failed \nimprovement projects, delays, failures, and finger-pointing--those are \nthe miseries that Iraqi citizens must endure today.\n  Democracy is a great thing, but democracy as we know means life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Most Iraqis today fear for their \nlives, more and more are losing them, and reportedly almost 1 million \nIraqi citizens have fled their country.\n  The New York Times today has an article about Iraqi citizens who are \nchanging their names, something that is almost forbidden in the Iraqi \nculture, because it is the only way they know to save themselves from \nbeing pulled out of their cars or their homes and murdered simply \nbecause of their identity. The story states, and I will quote in part:\n\n       Stories abound of Iraqi civilians being stopped at \n     checkpoints by militia men or uniformed men and having their \n     identification cards scrutinized. They are then taken away or \n     executed on the spot if they have a suspect name or a \n     hometown dominated by the rival sect. In Baghdad, Shiite \n     death squads, sometimes in police uniform, operate many of \n     the illegal checkpoints, Iraqi and American officials say. \n     The most infamous episode of this kind took place in July \n     when Shiite gunmen set up fake checkpoints and went on a \n     daytime rampage through the Jihad neighborhood of Baghdad, \n     dragging people from their cars and homes and shooting them \n     after looking at their identification cards. Up to 50 people \n     were killed.\n\n  Liberty, as we know, requires basic security, which the Bush \nadministration and the Iraqi Government are failing to provide. And the \nchance to pursue happiness for many Iraqis is tragically even less \npossible now than it was under Saddam Hussein's evil regime.\n  This is the disaster for which over 2,600 heroic American soldiers \nhave given their lives. Almost 20,000 have given their bodies, and for \nwhich Secretary Rumsfeld must accept responsibility--but won't.\n  Instead, what we are getting is another round of overheated and \nmisleading rhetoric from the Secretary, the Vice President, and the \nPresident.\n  Last week was a repeat of some of the 2002 conventions where they \nfirst trotted out their overheated and misleading rhetoric to stampede \nCongress into supporting the Iraqi war resolution.\n  Saddam Hussein and his supposed weapons of mass destruction were then \ncalled urgent threats to our citizens' safety.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the Vice President, and the President all \nclaimed proof positive that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear \nweapons that would soon, if not already, present mortal danger to our \nnational security.\n  Critics, skeptics, and even questioners were derided and dismissed as \nbeing appeasers of the then-Hitlerian menace of Saddam Hussein.\n  The administration offensive succeeded in persuading the majority of \nCongress and the American people. I was 1 of only 23 Members of the \nSenate to vote against the Iraq war resolution in October of 2002.\n  Yet even with bipartisan support for their war resolution, the \nPresident and others still used it politically to try to defeat \nDemocrats in the 2002 midterm elections--just as they are now trying to \ndo in this year's midterm elections.\n  Once again their rhetoric is misleading at best and blatantly wrong \nat worst.\n  Just yesterday the President repeated his claim that Iraq is the \ncentral battlefield where the war against terrorism will be decided.\n  There is no question that we must win the war in Iraq because we \nstarted that war, and once you are in it you must win it or suffer \nserious consequences.\n  But the worsening violence in Iraq, which the Bush administration and \nthe Iraqi Government are failing to control or contain, is, by all \nrational accounts, primarily and mostly Iraqi-against-Iraqi sectarian \nviolence.\n  To the extent that Al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations are \noperating in Iraq it is because of the openings and opportunities \nPresident Bush has provide them by creating a leaderless and lawless \nstate.\n  Al-Qaida, as we have just witnessed, is not using Iraq as its central \nbattlefield, but rather Heathrow Airport, or bombings in Spain, Jordan, \nand Egypt.\n  Osama bin Laden is by all accounts not masterminding his next assault \nagainst the United States from Iraq but rather from Pakistan or \nAfghanistan, where the al-Qaida allied Taliban is now resurgent due to \nother failed Bush administration policies, including their tragic and \ndisastrous failures to meaningfully help rebuild that country.\n  Five years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is still alive, unscathed, and \nplotting against the United States because the Bush administration has \nfailed to devote the military personnel, the resources, and the \ndiplomatic efforts necessary to find him and eliminate him.\n  Given the administration's attempts to exploit next month's fifth \nanniversary of 9/11 to its political benefit, it is a disgrace to the \nAmericans Osama bin Laden murdered and to their families--this terrible \ncriminal remaining alive and free to operate against the United States.\n  Let me conclude with excerpts from public statements made recently by\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\ntwo U.S. generals with firsthand experience of the situation in Iraq. \nThe first are excerpts from an article in the Washington Post by GEN \nJohn Batiste, a retired Army major general who commanded the First U.S. \nInfantry Division in Iraq. He wrote on Wednesday, April 19, 2006:\n\n       I had the opportunity to observe high-level policy \n     formulation in the Pentagon and experience firsthand its \n     impact on the ground. I have concluded that we need new \n     leadership in the Defense Department because of a pattern of \n     poor strategic decisions and a leadership style that is \n     contemptuous, dismissive, arrogant and abusive . . .\n       We went to war with the wrong war plan. Senior civilian \n     leadership chose to radically alter the results of 12 years \n     of deliberate and continuous war planning, which was improved \n     and approved, year after year, by previous secretaries of \n     defense, all supported by their associated chairmen and Joint \n     Chiefs of Staffs. Previous planning identified the need for \n     up to three times the troop strength we committed to remove \n     the regime in Iraq and set the conditions for peace there . . \n     .\n       Our current leadership decided to discount professional \n     military advice and ignore more than a decade of competent \n     military planning . . .\n       We took down a regime but failed to provide the resources \n     to build the peace. The shortage of troops never allowed \n     commanders on the ground to deal properly with the insurgency \n     and the unexpected. What could have been a deliberate victory \n     is now a long, protracted challenge.\n       Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claims to be the man who \n     started the Army's transformation. This is not true. Army \n     transformation started years before this administration came \n     into office. The secretary's definition of transformation was \n     to reduce the Army to between five and seven divisions to \n     fund programs in missile defense, space defense and high-tech \n     weapons . . . the Army remains under-resourced at a time when \n     it is shouldering most of the war effort. Boots on the ground \n     and high-tech weapons are important, and one cannot come at \n     the expense of the other.\n       Civilian control of the military is fundamental, but we \n     deserve competent leaders who do not lead by intimidation, \n     who understand that respect is a two-way street, and who do \n     not dismiss sound military advice. At the same time, we need \n     senior military leaders who are grounded in the fundamental \n     principles of war and who are not afraid to do the right \n     thing, Our democracy depends on it. There are some who \n     advocate that we gag this debate, but let me assure you that \n     it is not in our national interest to do so. We must win this \n     war, and we cannot allow senior leaders to continue to make \n     decisions when their track record is so dismal . . .\n\n  Secondly, a statement in Time magazine on Sunday, April 9, 2006, by \nLTG Greg Newbold, who states:\n\n       From 2000 until October 2002, I was a Marine Corps \n     lieutenant general and director of operations for the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff. . . . Inside the military family, I made no \n     secret of my view that the zealots' rationale for war made no \n     sense. And I think I was outspoken enough to make those \n     senior to me uncomfortable. But I now regret that I did not \n     more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a \n     country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat--al-\n     Qaeda . . . I am driven to action now by the missteps and \n     misjudgments of the White House and the Pentagon, and by my \n     many painful visits to our military hospitals . . .\n       What we are living with now is the consequences of \n     successive policy failures. Some of the missteps include: the \n     distortion of intelligence in the buildup to the war, \n     McNamara-like micromanagement that kept our forces from \n     having enough resources to do the job, the failure to retain \n     and reconstitute the Iraqi military in time to help quell \n     civil disorder, the initial denial that an insurgency was the \n     heart of the opposition to occupation, alienation of allies \n     who could have helped in a more robust way to rebuild Iraq, \n     and the continuing failure of the other agencies of our \n     government to commit assets to the same degree as the Defense \n     Department. My sincere view is that the commitment of our \n     forces to this fight was done with a casualness and swagger \n     that are the special province of those who have never had to \n     execute these missions--or bury the results . . .\n       The consequence of the military's quiescence was that a \n     fundamentally flawed plan was executed for an invented war, \n     while pursuing the real enemy, al-Qaeda, became a secondary \n     effort. . . .\n       So what is to be done? We need fresh ideas and fresh faces. \n     That means, as a first step, replacing Rumsfeld and many \n     others unwilling to fundamentally change their approach. The \n     troops in the Middle East have performed their duty. Now we \n     need people in Washington who can construct a unified \n     strategy worthy of them. It is time to send a signal to our \n     nation, our forces and the world that we are uncompromising \n     on our security but are prepared to rethink how we achieve \n     it. . . .\n\n  This debate is long overdue on the Senate floor, and I thank our \nDemocratic leader for it.\n  This debate is about how to finally win in Iraq, how to bring our \ncourageous troops home as safely and as soon as possible, with their \nvictory secured by the Iraqi Government, the Iraqi military and police, \nand the Iraqi people.\n  Our heroic soldiers deserve better than the President's apologies, \nagain defending the failures of the past and the continuing failures of \nthe present. They deserve a new strategy to win victory in Iraq and a \nnew leader to achieve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are here ostensibly debating a resolution \nthat deals with the Secretary of Defense but, of course, the \nconversation has devolved into a discussion of the war against the \nradical Islamists and the battle in Iraq, a battlefront of that war.\n  Let me begin, though, by asking unanimous consent that at the end of \nmy remarks we have printed in the Record a letter from Josh Bolton, of \nthe administration, to the distinguished minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that letter goes to one of the points of the \nresolution that we are ostensibly debating, a resolution which seems to \nmock the phrase ``stay the course,'' claiming that the current stay-\nthe-course policy has made America less secure.\n  I guess it all depends on what you mean by stay the course because, \nif you mean by stay the course don't abandon the effort, then of course \nthe administration and the Senate do not want to abandon the effort and \ntherefore do want to stay the course. At least the people on this side \nof the aisle do not want to abandon the effort. But if it means don't \nchange the way you are doing anything, obviously that is another \nmatter. The problem is, it is a straw man for those on the other side \nto argue that the administration is not willing to change anything. The \nletter from Mr. Bolton to the distinguished minority leader will \ndemonstrate the fact that, just as the enemy is agile and changes its \ntactics, so, too, has the United States changed the way that it deals \nwith the enemy in Iraq.\n  So, yes, stay the course if by that we mean don't abdicate the \nmission; no, if it means don't ever change the way you operate.\n  The other part of the resolution I found rather odd was the \ncondemnation of Secretary Rumsfeld, which for days now we heard is \ncoming. I was rather bracing for an indictment of the Secretary of \nDefense who, of course, needs no one to defend him. He is an honorable \nand effective and totally self-sacrificing public servant who has \nserved the President and the American people well. But I noted that the \nbig indictment is that President Bush needs to change course in Iraq--\nundefined how that change in course might operate--to provide a \nstrategy for success--the strategy was announced over and over by the \nPresident, reiterated in his speech yesterday--and one indication of a \nchange of course would be to replace the current Secretary of Defense.\n  I suppose it would be. That is a bit of a tautology. But it doesn't \nsuggest that it would do anything or accomplish anything except, \nperhaps, embarrass the President, perhaps undermine our credibility \nabroad, perhaps embolden our opponents and raise questions by our \nallies. That is not a very constructive proposition by our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. But, on the other hand, not much that they \nhave offered is very constructive.\n  It is easy to criticize, easy to play Monday morning quarterback. It \nis a little more difficult when you are in the middle of the battle, \ncharged with the responsibility of success. I shudder to think what \nthese Monday morning quarterbacks would have done in World War II or \nWorld War I, a day after the landing on D-day or at Iwo Jima--10,000 \ncasualties. Or the Civil War. It occurs to me we would not be here \ndebating as a unified nation today if one of the greatest generals in \nthe history of America, Robert E. Lee, hadn't made a monumental mistake \nat Gettysburg. The reality is mistakes are made in war and it is very \ndifficult while the war is going on, and before the historians have the \ncontext in which to reflect on it, to debate the mistakes, especially \nwhen the enemy is listening and certainly our allies and our troops are \nlistening as well.\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\n  But just to reflect on a couple of these, one comment by one of the \nSenators was the problem is we are trying to do a war without enough \nmilitary. A lot of us on this side of the aisle have steadfastly \nsupported a stronger more robust military. Sometimes we don't get a lot \nof support on the other side of the aisle for that. But the comment was \nwe do need more troops, from a Senator who wants to withdraw our \ntroops.\n  I happen to agree with my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, \nwho has said we need more troops. The best way to do that, at least \nunder current circumstances, is to not withdraw an American soldier for \nevery Iraqi trained but combine the two armies as the Iraqis are \ntrained up in order to go into a place like Baghdad and get control. \nThat is not reducing troops, obviously; that is enhancing the total \npower there.\n  How do we get more troops if every time we train up an Iraqi an \nAmerican has to leave? Or we set a timetable for leaving by the end of \nthe year? I am at a loss to understand this notion: Our problem is we \nneed more troops, so let's bring our troops home. I don't get it. \nUnless, of course, we are not concerned about the outcome--and that is \nthe question.\n  That, unfortunately, is the question that must be in the minds of our \nallies. It must be in the minds of our enemies when they hear a debate \nlike this and they hear: We need more troops, let's bring our troops \nhome. They must ask: Okay, what does that mean? Does it mean America is \nin it for winning or does it mean we are going to be leaving, and the \nvacuum that is created will be an opportunity to move in and do our \nevil deeds?\n\n  The President, in his speech yesterday, was very clear about the \nnature of the enemy, an enemy that sees the Iraq battlefront as a \ncentral part of what he called World War III, their attempt to either \nmake us bow down to their will or kill us or, if we succeed, they die \ntrying. It is a win-win for them either way, according to them.\n  The reality is, this is a battle we cannot leave. This is a fight we \ncannot walk away from. If we are going to win the war against the \nterrorists, we have to win the battle in Iraq. There is no other way \naround that proposition. We cannot abdicate Iraq and still hope to win \nthis war against these radical Islamists, at least not without taking \nhorrendous casualties and losses in the meantime until our allies and \nsome in America determine it is worth fighting, that it is a serious \nenemy, that we have to do whatever it takes to win, and that includes \nfighting in places such as Iraq.\n  I conclude with this notion, and the Senator from New Hampshire made \nthe point earlier in a very eloquent way. After recounting all of the \ncarping and criticism of what could have been done differently, he \nasked: Is there no credit for what we have achieved in Afghanistan, a \ncountry that was ruled by the Taliban, where women were beaten, where \npeople were taken to the soccer stadium and shot, where little girls \ncould not go to school and on and on, an altogether horrific place? Is \nthere no credit for the fact that the people of Afghanistan are now \nfree? Is there no credit for the fact that a brutal dictator who killed \nthousands and thousands of his own citizens, gassed many of them to \ndeath, killed hundreds of thousands of people in neighboring countries \nand was prepared to do battle with us, is there no credit for the fact \nthat Saddam Hussein is gone, that his people have now been afforded the \nopportunity to freely elect their own government, and we are in the \nprocess of helping them secure that freedom? Is there no credit for the \nfact that Qadhafi decided America's will was pretty well demonstrated \nin Afghanistan, and he was not going to buck that will by continuing \nhis evil way and developing nuclear weapons, so discretion being the \nbetter part of valor, he would get on the right side of history and be \nwith us in this war? Is there no credit for any of these achievements?\n  No, no, not when you are discussing the President of the United \nStates, who in some circles has to be vilified in the name of political \ndiscourse. This is not the way to conduct this debate. The way to \nconduct a debate over the strategy and over the course of history is to \nhave a civil discussion that does not focus on an individual in the \nadministration--who, after all, is only one person making the decisions \nand who has served this country ably--but, rather, on the strategic \nobjectives over the goals.\n  Can anyone doubt what the goals in the war have to be? Can anyone \ndoubt that the goal has to be to retain the ability of the country of \nIraq to keep terrorists out and to ensure the safety and security of \ntheir own citizens in the future? I don't think there can be any doubt \nabout what the goals ought to be.\n  Yet the President was right yesterday in reiterating those goals \nbecause there appear to be some who have lost sight or who have not \never realized the true evil nature of this enemy, who don't quite \ncomprehend what it will take to defeat this enemy, who do not connect \nthe dots to see we cannot walk away from Iraq and still be able to \ndefeat this enemy, the radical Islamist, both the Sunni and the Shia \nIslamists, the people who would do us evil if we do not stand in that \nway. If you do not understand the enemy, I suppose it is not hard to \nconclude that, because the going is getting tough in Iraq, we ought to \nleave. The people who believe that are very strong, as the President \nsaid, maybe quite patriotic but very wrong.\n  It is the terrorist leaders themselves who believe that Iraq is a \ncentral battlefield in what we call the Third World War, a war that \nobviously the United States is leading. With our allies, we need to \nbring this to a successful conclusion.\n  I quote from the President's speech the words of Osama bin Laden who \nsaid:\n\n       I now address the whole Islamic nation. Listen and \n     understand. The most serious issue today for the whole world \n     is this third world war that is raging in Iraq.\n\n  He calls it a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam and \nconcludes that the whole world is watching this war, and it will end in \nvictory and glory or misery and humiliation.\n  In the latter, I think he was correct. We have to make sure that it \nis his misery and humiliation and the terrorists' misery and \nhumiliation that is the result of the conflict in Iraq and not that of \nthe United States. In order to ensure that, it is incumbent upon us to \nprosecute this war to a successful conclusion and not leave this \ndifficult battlefield prematurely--in the process, by the way, support \nthose who are working very hard on our behalf, not denigrate them. It \nis fine to show the loyalty and the gratitude to our troops that the \nresolution does, and which I do, but it is also important to show that \nsame kind of gratitude to other people who are trying very hard to \nprotect the American people. That includes the President of the United \nStates and the Secretary of Defense.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Response from the Chief of Staff Josh Bolten to a Democratic Letter\n\n                                                September 5, 2006.\n     Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for your September 4 letter to \n     the President. I am responding on his behalf.\n       A useful discussion of what we need to do in Iraq requires \n     an accurate and fair-minded description of our current \n     policy: As the President has explained, our goal is an Iraq \n     that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself. In \n     order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing a strategy along \n     three main tracks--political, economic, and security. Along \n     each of these tracks, we are constantly adjusting our tactics \n     to meet conditions on the ground. We have witnessed both \n     successes and setbacks along the way, which is the story of \n     every war that has been waged and won.\n       Your letter recites four elements of a proposed ``new \n     direction'' in Iraq. Three of those elements reflect well-\n     established Administration policy; the fourth is dangerously \n     misguided.\n       First, you propose ``transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq \n     to counter-terrorism, training, logistics and force \n     protection.'' That is what we are now doing, and have been \n     doing for several years. Our efforts to train the Iraqi \n     Security Forces (ISF) have evolved and accelerated over the \n     past three years. Our military has had substantial success in \n     building the Iraqi Army--and increasingly we have seen the \n     Iraqi Army take the lead in fighting the enemies of a free \n     Iraq. The Iraqi Security Forces still must rely on U.S. \n     support, both in direct combat and especially in key combat \n     support functions. But any fair-minded reading of the current \n     situation must recognize that the ISF are unquestionably more \n     capable and shouldering a greater portion of the burden than \n     a year ago--and because of the extraordinary efforts of the \n     United States military, we expect they will\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\n     become increasingly capable with each passing month. Your \n     recommendation that we focus on counterterrorism training and \n     operations--which is the most demanding task facing our \n     troops--tracks not only with our policy but also our \n     understanding, as well as the understanding of al Qaeda and \n     other terrorist organizations, that Iraq is a central front \n     in the war against terror.\n       Second, your letter proposes ``working with Iraqi leaders \n     to disarm the militias and to develop a broad-based and \n     sustainable political settlement, including amending the \n     Constitution to achieve a fair sharing of power and \n     resources.'' You are once again urging that the Bush \n     Administration adopt an approach that has not only been \n     embraced, but is now being executed. Prime Minister Nouri al-\n     Maliki is pursuing a national reconciliation project. It is \n     an undertaking that (a) was devised by the Iraqis; (b) has \n     the support of the United States, our coalition partners and \n     the United Nations; and (c) is now being implemented. \n     Further, in Iraq's political evolution, the Sunnis, who \n     boycotted the first Iraq election, are now much more involved \n     in the political process. Prime Minister Maliki is head of a \n     free government that represents all communities in Iraq for \n     the first time in that nation's history. It is in the context \n     of this broad-based, unity government, and the lasting \n     national compact that government is pursuing, that the Iraqis \n     will consider what amendments might be required to the \n     constitution that the Iraqi people adopted last year. On the \n     matter of disarming militias: that is precisely what Prime \n     Minister al-Maliki is working to do. Indeed, Coalition \n     leaders are working with him and his ministers to devise and \n     implement a program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate \n     members of militias and other illegal armed groups.\n       Third, your letter calls for ``convening an international \n     conference and contact group to support a political \n     settlement in Iraq, to preserve Iraq's sovereignty, and to \n     revitalize the stalled economic reconstruction and rebuilding \n     effort.'' The International Compact for Iraq, launched \n     recently by the sovereign Iraqi government and the United \n     Nations, is the best way to work with regional and \n     international partners to make substantial economic progress \n     in Iraq, help revitalize the economic reconstruction and \n     rebuilding of that nation, and support a fair and just \n     political settlement in Iraq--all while preserving Iraqi \n     sovereignty. This effort is well under way, it has momentum, \n     and I urge you to support it.\n       Three of the key proposals found in your letter, then, are \n     already reflected in current U.S. and Iraqi policy in the \n     region.\n       On the fourth element of your proposed ``new direction,'' \n     however, we do disagree strongly. Our strategy calls for \n     redeploying troops from Iraq as conditions on the ground \n     allow, when the Iraqi Security Forces are capable of \n     defending their nation, and when our military commanders \n     believe the time is right. Your proposal is driven by none of \n     these factors; instead, it would have U.S. forces begin \n     withdrawing from Iraq by the end of the year, without regard \n     to the conditions on the ground. Because your letter lacks \n     specifics, it is difficult to determine exactly what is \n     contemplated by the ``phased redeployment'' you propose. (One \n     such proposal, advanced by Representative Murtha, a signatory \n     to your letter, suggested that U.S. forces should be \n     redeployed as a ``quick reaction force'' to Okinawa, which is \n     nearly 5,000 miles from Baghdad).\n       Regardless of the specifics you envision by ``phased \n     redeployment,'' any premature withdrawal of U.S forces would \n     have disastrous consequences for America's security. Such a \n     policy would embolden our terrorist enemies; betray the hopes \n     of the Iraqi people; lead to a terrorist state in control of \n     huge oil reserves; shatter the confidence our regional allies \n     have in America; undermine the spread of democracy in the \n     Middle East; and mean the sacrifices of American troops would \n     have been in vain. This ``new direction'' would lead to a \n     crippling defeat for America and a staggering victory for \n     Islamic extremists. That is not a direction this President \n     will follow. The President is being guided by a commitment to \n     victory--and that plan, in turn, is being driven by the \n     counsel and recommendations of our military commanders in the \n     region.\n       Finally, your letter calls for replacing Secretary of \n     Defense Rumsfeld. We strongly disagree. Secretary Rumsfeld is \n     an honorable and able public servant. Under his leadership, \n     the United States Armed Forces and our allies have overthrown \n     two brutal tyrannies and liberated more than 50 million \n     people. Al Qaeda has suffered tremendous blows. Secretary \n     Rumsfeld has pursued vigorously the President's vision for a \n     transformed U.S. military. And he has played a lead role in \n     forging and implementing many of the policies you now \n     recommend in Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld retains the full \n     confidence of the President.\n       We appreciate your stated interest in working with the \n     Administration on policies that honor the sacrifice of our \n     troops and promote our national security, which we believe \n     can be accomplished only through victory in this central \n     front in the War on Terror.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joshua B. Bolten,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from New York yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I make a unanimous consent as to the remaining speakers \non the Democratic side, if I might. I apologize for interrupting the \nSenator from New York.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following speakers be recognized on \nthe Democratic side in sequence, alternating with Republicans: Senator \nClinton for 10 minutes; Senator Harkin for 15 minutes; Senator Boxer, 6 \nminutes; Senator Carper, 5 minutes; Senator Dorgan, 10 minutes; Senator \nMurray, 5 minutes; Senator Mikulski, 5 minutes; and Senator Lautenberg, \n10 minutes.\n  The sequence may be different, depending on who is in the Chamber, \nbut those are the times allotted for which I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we are debating this resolution for two \nsimple reasons. First, no matter how the lily is gilded, things are not \ngoing well in our war against terrorism, and there is no doubt we need \nnew leadership.\n  Second, this Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibility \nto conduct oversight and hold the administration accountable for the \ndecisions which it has made over the course of the last 5 years.\n  This is quite unusual in American history because ordinarily the \nCongress would play that role of check and balance.\n  In the middle of World War II, which really was a world war, then-\nSenator Harry Truman was the chair of a commission looking into war \nprofiteering and other matters related to the conduct of the war. There \nwas a Democratic Congress, a Democratic President. Yet the Congress, \nunder then-Senator Truman's leadership, fulfilled its responsibility.\n  During the Vietnam war, which ripped this country apart, Senator \nFulbright felt compelled to hold hearings about the conduct of that \nwar. A Democratic Congress, a Democratic President, fulfilling its \nresponsibility.\n  We have seen none of that, with very few exceptions. This Congress \nhas been either intimidated or negligent in the fulfillment of its \nresponsibilities to hold the administration accountable. Absolute power \nnot only corrupts, but it can lead to bad decisions. This has been a \nvery small group of decisionmakers.\n  Recently, the President changed the leadership of his economic team \nbecause we all know the economy is not doing as well as advertised. \nProfits are up, productivity is up, but average wages and income \naren't. It is getting harder and harder for the average American to \nmake ends meet. So the President changed his economic leadership, \nchanged his Chief of Staff in the White House. Yet there is no \naccountability with respect to his security team.\n  I just returned, as did my colleagues, from our recess. I visited \nthroughout my State. In every kind of community, people are expressing \ndeep concerns about the direction we are heading when it comes to the \nwar in Iraq, when it comes to American security interests. New Yorkers, \nas most Americans, want things set right in Iraq, when so much both has \ngone wrong and seems to continue to go wrong.\n  We are asking for some accountability. There is no illusion on this \nside of the aisle that this resolution will pass. We know it will not. \nWe may not even get a vote on it because, heaven forbid, the other side \nwould have to stand up and actually vote. We know that many on the \nother side share our doubts. Privately, they will say some of the most \nharsh and critical comments about the Secretary of Defense, about the \nPresident, about the Vice President, and the conduct of this war. \nHowever, they abdicate their responsibility in public. We have no \nillusions we are going to get a vote. Yet we owe it to ourselves, our \ntroops, our fellow citizens to raise these issues.\n  One doesn't have to read the recently published book ``Fiasco'' or \nthe book before it, ``Cobra II,'' to see how badly things have gone. We \nknow that. At the center of so many of the wrong calls, the \nmisjudgments, the strategic blunders has been the Secretary of Defense. \nNo one is questioning his patriotism,\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nhis honorable service. We are questioning his judgment and his \nleadership.\n  We went to war with the Secretary of Defense we had. Now it is time \nto complete the mission with the new Secretary of Defense we need. It \nis past time.\n  Our friends on the other side will come forward and make the most \nimpassioned arguments about how things are going, how we have to stay \nthe course, and what has to be done in order to succeed. But under \nSecretary Rumsfeld's leadership, it has not happened. We have a full-\nfledged insurgency and full-blown sectarian conflict in Iraq. I don't \ncare what you label it--civil war, sectarian violence--the fact is the \nIraqis are losing hundreds and hundreds of lives. As of yesterday, \n2,652 service men and women have been killed in Iraq; amongst them, 123 \nNew Yorkers.\n  We didn't go with enough troops to establish law and order, to put \ndown a marker as to our authority as we replaced an authoritarian \ndictatorship. We went with this dysfunctional bureaucracy known as the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, which disbanded the Iraqi Army which \nwe are now trying to recreate.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld rejected virtually all of the planning that had \nbeen done previously to maintain stability when the regime was \noverthrown. He deliberately and repeatedly underestimated the nature \nand strength of the insurgency, the sectarian violence, and the spread \nof Iranian influence.\n  Let us not confuse the leadership's failures with either the \nremaining mission in Iraq, the war on terrorism or with our support for \nour troops. What we have is a failure of leadership to accomplish that \nmission. What was hailed as our shortest war has now become one of our \nlongest.\n  What was hailed as a model of democracy teeters on the brink of \ncomplete anarchy. What was the leadership that quickly claimed credit \nfor success has been lethargic in the face of misjudgments and \nsetbacks. I do not see what other conclusions one can draw. We will \nhave the same President and Vice President for the next 2 years. But \nwhy not ask the President to exercise his judgment to bring in new \nleadership, to send a new signal to our troops, to our military \nleadership, to our friends and our allies, and to our country that--\nguess what--we get it, we need new leadership.\n  When I confronted Secretary Rumsfeld a month ago, he continued to \nobfuscate and deny responsibility. He denied he ever painted a rosy \npicture in Iraq. In response, my office compiled a list of 13 \nstatements, out of many he had made, which clearly painted a rosy \nscenario.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Statement for the Record by Senator Clinton\n\n       In the August 3 Armed Services Committee hearing, I had the \n     following exchange with Secretary Rumsfeld:\n       CLINTON: Well, Mr. Secretary, I know you would, and I know \n     you feel strongly about it, but there's a track record here. \n     This is not 2002, 2003, 2004, '5, when you appeared before \n     this committee and made many comments and presented many \n     assurances that have, frankly, proven to be unfulfilled. And \n     . . .\n       RUMSFELD: Senator, I don't think that's true. I have never \n     painted a rosy picture. I've been very measured in my words. \n     And you'd have a dickens of a time trying to find instances \n     where I've been excessively optimistic. I understand this is \n     tough stuff.\n       I ask unanimous consent that the following quotes from \n     Secretary Rumsfeld be included in the Record:\n\n\n                         Congressional Hearings\n\n     July 9, 2003: Senate Armed Services Committee hearing\n       ``The residents of Baghdad may not have power 24 hours a \n     day, but they no longer wake up each morning in fear \n     wondering whether this will be the day that a death squad \n     would come to cut out their tongues, chop off their ears, or \n     take their children away for `questioning,' never to be seen \n     again.''\n     September 30, 2003: House Appropriations Committee hearing\n       ``My impression is that the war was highly successful.''\n       Source: Transcript of Hearing of House Appropriations \n     Committee, Subcommittee on Defense on President's FY '04 \n     Supplemental Request for Iraq and Afghanistan, available \n     online from FDCH Political Transcripts on Lexis-Nexis.\n     February 4, 2004: Senate Armed Services Committee hearing\n       ``The increased demand on the force we are experiencing \n     today is likely a `spike,' driven by the deployment of nearly \n     115,000 troops in Iraq.

It is time for the Senate to exercise our \nresponsibility, for the Members of this Chamber to decide: What do we \nowe our constituents, our young men and women in uniform? What do we \nowe history in terms of our responsibility? We know the answer. Whether \nwe stand up and deny it or not, we know the answer. History is going to \njudge this period harshly. And I wish we could, as a body, redeem \nourselves and redeem this mission, give it a chance for success, with \nnew eyes and ears, with a new way of thinking and leading.\n  I have no idea whom the President might ask to replace the Secretary \nwere he to be asked to leave or resign, but I have to believe that some \nfresh thinking, some new ideas would make a difference. It is time we \nput our policy, our chance for success, ahead of politics, that we put \nwise decisionmaking and new leadership ahead of the status quo. When it \nis not working, why do we keep digging a deeper hole? So I hope this \nbody would exercise responsibility in the only way open to us, since we \ncannot have the oversight and accountability the Congress should be \ndemanding.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

I appreciate all \nthe courtesy.\n  Mr. President, this is really a sad day for me. It is a very sad day, \nas we are coming up on the anniversary of September 11, as I remember \nthe fear that gripped the Capitol and gripped the United States of \nAmerica. I remember us being outside on the steps of the Capitol on the \nevening of September 11 when we stood together and sang ``God Bless \nAmerica'' together, when we were one Nation indivisible and when we \nwere united and we were so determined to fight that global war against \nterrorism.\n  I joined with all of my colleagues and I voted to give the President \nthe power to use lethal force to pursue the terrorists and pursue the \nTaliban and take the fight to Afghanistan. And how pleased I was with \nthe victory in Afghanistan and the way, then, that the Afghan people \ncame together in their Loya Jurga to choose Mr. Karzai to be their \nleader and to lay the groundwork for a democratic Afghanistan. I \nthought we were going to make Afghanistan the jewel of the Middle East, \nwhere the Muslim community could flourish, a democratic community could \nemerge, and women would be able to exercise their rights. How joyful we \nwere when those little girls were going to school the same way as the \nlittle boys. But it was not meant to be. Afghanistan did not get the \nbacking and support it needed, and along the way there was the \nrecommendation to go to war in Iraq.\n  In 2002, 1 year later, we were debating the war in Iraq. Well, on \nOctober 10, 2002, I disagreed with the resolution before the Senate, \nwith the request to give the President the authority to wage war in \nIraq, using a unilateral approach, and to engage in a preemptive war. I \ndid not agree that the world and the United States of America faced a \nclear, present, immediate danger from weapons of mass destruction.\n  That information was coming from our CIA, and it was coming from our \nDepartment of Defense, which had cozied up to a dissident named Achmed \nChalabi, the guy who hung around London, being paid $300,000 a week \nfrom the CIA, eating Dover sole, with no backing, no information. He \nsold us a bill of goods. There were no weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq. Rumsfeld was one of the ones who made that argument, along with \nthe CIA.\n  So where am I today? Today, I really do believe we need a fresh \napproach. One of the ways to get it is through new leadership. \nOrdinarily, I would not single out a personality. I would agree with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, that this is about policies. \nBut we have gotten nowhere. So I have joined with my colleagues to ask \nfor Donald Rumsfeld's resignation.\n  I have been asking for his resignation since 2004 because I watched \nus go from being at war with Iraq to being at war within Iraq. Well, \nthis dangerous incompetence has been wrong for America and wrong for \nour troops and wrong for our allies and wrong for the Iraqi people.\n  Rumsfeld was wrong about the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and \nhe led us into war on inaccurate evidence. As a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I know that Rumsfeld skewed, selected, and \nexaggerated information about weapons of mass destruction. And our men \nand women in uniform have been paying for this deception ever since.\n  Rumsfeld was wrong about what it would take to secure Iraq. We sent \nour troops to war without sufficient body armor, without armored \nhumvees, and unprotected for the war in Iraq, where they face daily \nattacks by IEDs and RPGs. It was up to the Congress, and actually the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, to add over $1 billion to make \nsure our troops have the protection they need.\n\n  Well, now they need to have new leadership, as well as new protection \nand new weapons. And along the way, when we hear we are going to listen \nto our generals in the field--what generals in the field? Those \ngenerals who said we need more troops or different strategies, who \ndisagreed with Rumsfeld's rosy projections were muzzled. Warnings about \nlawlessness and looting were ignored. The State Department's \nreconstruction plan for Iraq was dismissed and laid aside.\n  DOD's own report says now sectarian violence is the dominant trend in \nIraq. But the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, refuses to admit what \nour generals can clearly see: Iraq is slipping into a civil war and \nsectarian violence. And whose side are we going to be on? We have said \nthis must be a year of transition. And the transition must begin with \nMr. Rumsfeld resigning.\n  Now, Mr. Rumsfeld also assured us about the cost of the war. I was in \nthe meetings. I was in the hearings. He said: Don't worry, American \ntaxpayers will not pay for the war. With our shock and awe, and this \nquick war, we are going to have a mission accomplished, that the war \nwill be over, and the cost of rebuilding will be paid for by Iraqi oil. \nWell, Iraqi oil--drip, drip, drip. When do we get a chance to see it? \nThere is no Iraqi oil coming to the United States. Why? Because the \ninfrastructure is broken. Because of the corruption. And because we \nwere once again oversold.\n  Finally, we need to hold Rumsfeld responsible for the prisoner abuse \nscandals. The abuse at Abu Ghraib is deplorable, despicable and \ndishonorable. It does not reflect the values of the United States, or \nthe code of conduct that most of our Soldiers live by every day. \nRumsfeld's leadership created a command atmosphere where terrible abuse \nof prisoners was not just tolerated, but encouraged. But only junior \nenlisted and young officers have been held accountable, while high \nlevel military and civilian leaders are let off the hook. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Rumsfeld is completely incapable of speaking the truth--or facing the \ntruth--about Iraq. His dismal performance has undermined U.S. \ncredibility in the world, and undermined the President's credibility \nwith the American people. We face serious threats from terrorism and \nrogue regimes, and our brave troops are risking their lives every day \naround the world. We need a Secretary of Defense we can trust. Donald \nRumsfeld should resign now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think I made my point, and I am willing to yield my \ntime. We need new leadership. We need a new Secretary of Defense.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I have listened \nwith some interest. Unfortunately, the committee I chair has had \nmeetings all day, and I have not had a chance to really get involved in \nthis discussion. But I have been listening to people criticizing \nSecretary Rumsfeld, talking about the war, and I just wonder what war \nthey are talking about and what Secretary they are talking about \nbecause it certainly is not what is going on right now.\n  I can remember so many times during the 1990s when we had this \neuphoric attitude that somehow the Cold War was over and so we no \nlonger needed a military and so we knew we could do some downgrading at \nthat time. I can remember so many times on the floor saying we will rue \nthe day we did this, we are going to have to rebuild, not knowing at \nthat time that this would have to be during a time of war.\n  At that time, our Army divisions went down by about 50 percent. The \ntactical air wings went down by about 50 percent. Ships went down from \n600 to 300. And again, people were thinking, there is no need to have \nthis strong of a military. And they did not seem to think there was any \nkind of a threat out there. Nobody really thought about what we call \ntoday the asymmetric threat.\n  Now, that is what Secretary Rumsfeld inherited. I remember so well, \nabout 6\\1/2\\ years ago, at his confirmation hearing, I asked a \nquestion. I said: Right now, we have downgraded the military to the \npoint where we are going to have to build it up again. And as we try to \nanticipate the problems we will be facing that we must prepare for \ntoday, that will come 10 years from now, you are going to have all the \nfour star generals, who are all smart people, but they are not going to \nguess it right.\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n  I can remember one time, in 1994, I was in the House Armed Services \nCommittee, and we had someone testify that in 10 years from then we \nwould no longer need ground troops. That was in 1994. So I asked: What \nis the answer to this? If we are going to try to have our kids, our \ntroops go into the field on some future date 10 years from now, how are \nwe going to be sure they have the best of everything?\n  He said: Well--I am going from memory now, but he said--all \nthroughout the 20th century the amount we spent on defense equaled 5.7 \npercent of GDP. At the end of the 1990s, we were down to 2.7 percent.\n  I said: Where should it be?\n  He said: Probably, in order to be prepared for any contingency in the \nfuture, we would have to be somewhere between 4 and 4.5 percent or \nmaybe even 5 percent of GDP.\n  That is the problem he inherited. And he was hired because he has had \nthe vision to restructure this and set about doing that job some 6\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  During his first month, he called for flowcharts to be created that \nwould detail the interdepartmental relationships at the Pentagon. What \nhe received back looked like a bowl of spaghetti.\n  It was totally disorganized. He had to expose this, and we all know \nnow what he did. He started in on reforming the Pentagon. Nobody else \ndid it prior to him. He was the one who did it. We know the big picture \nchanges and takes time when we shake up the very foundation of the \nPentagon, but he did it. We were shifting from a division-oriented \nforce to a modular brigade combat force, from a conventional base enemy \ntoward an asymmetric war, while maintaining our ability as a modernized \nnation. Much progress has been made in the Army's system of dealing \nwith divisions and organizing them into modular brigades, combat teams \nthat are more capable and faster to deploy. He increased force size \nfrom 33 brigades to 42 brigades. I didn't agree with him at first.\n  I remember that out in Oklahoma we were shocked when he made the \nannouncement as to one of the programs that we had, that we were \nworking on, the development of a modern nonline-of-sight cannon called \nthe Crusader. It was going to take us out of the World War II \ntechnology. Right now, the best thing we have in terms of artillery is \nthe Paladin, and that is World War II technology. It is one where you \nhave to swab the breach after every shot. That is what we were faced \nwith at that time. I criticized him for junking that program. He had a \nbigger picture in mind. It was a future combat system for the Army.\n  He looked at the Navy and said the biggest problem was spare parts. \nDonald Rumsfeld concentrated on that and now has ships ready to be \ndeployable. Another change in the Navy was instead of bringing a ship \nall the way with a crew out to a battle area, he leaves the ship there \nand flies the crew back and forth and increases the ship's efficiency \nat sea by about 50 percent. That is common sense, but it is something \nthat nobody else did. It took Donald Rumsfeld to come along with the \nidea to do that.\n  In the Air Force, he recognized at that time that--I think it was \nprobably under his supervision that General Jumper had the courage to \nstand up and say: Now we are sending our airmen out with equipment that \nisn't as good, potentially, as the enemy's. He talked about our strike \nfighters, and the best that we had were the F-15 and the F-l6. We \nslowed down the F-22 development, the joint strike fighter. But General \nJumper stood up and said--and Rumsfeld agreed--that now the potential \nis that the enemy has better equipment than we do. What he was \nreferring to was the SU series the Russians were making, SU-27s, SU-\n30s, and SU-35s were, in many ways, superior to what our airmen and \nwomen were flying.\n  So, anyway, we got this back on schedule and now we have some 66, 68 \nF-22s flying. I see a couple of the Senators on the floor who will join \nme in wanting to enhance that program of F-22s and move the joint \nstrike fighter forward. That is something that this Secretary did, \nwhich others were not willing or capable of doing and didn't have the \nforesight to do.\n  I have to tell you this, Mr. President. I was there during the \nconfirmation hearing, and I said publicly on the Senate floor that the \nliberals are not going to like Rumsfeld for one major reason: they \ncannot intimidate him. He is not one to be intimidated. He has stood up \nto them, and he tells the truth; he tells it like it is. People in \npolitics, many times, don't like that.\n  Turning to Iraq, the positive things that have changed in Iraq are \neconomic change, where the economy is recovering after 30 years of a \nbloody dictatorship that we are aware of. In 2005, the Iraqi economy \ngrew an estimated 3 percent. It is estimated to be some 10 percent in \n2006. The International Monetary Fund is anticipating that. Under \nSaddam Hussein's regime, the Iraqi standard of living deteriorated \nrapidly. The per capita income there dropped from $3,800 in 1980 to \n$715 in 2002. Today, the economic recovery is picking up, with GDP \ngrowing from $18.9 billion in 2002 to $33 billion in 2005.\n  I have to say this, also. So many of the people who criticize what is \ngoing on over there in the war don't go over there and see. If you \nwatch CNN and the networks and read the New York Times, you will not \nget an accurate picture of what is going on. I have been there more \nthan anybody else. I have been in the Iraqi AOR 11 times, during all of \nthe elections. I was in Fallujah during that election. I recall very \nwell a general there named Mahi, who had been the brigade commander for \nSaddam Hussein; he had hated Americans. He hated Americans until the \nMarines went into Fallujah and started this embedded training. He \nlearned to love them so much that he looked across at me and he said, \n``When they rotated the Marines out, we all cried.'' Then he renamed \nthe Iraqi security forces in Fallujah to be the Iraqi Marines.\n  Then, up in Saddam's hometown, I was there when they blew up some of \nthe Iraqi security forces who were training. Forty were either killed \nor near dead. What you didn't get in the media was the success story, \nthe support from the Iraqis. Each family of the ones who were killed in \nTikrit supplied another member of the family to take the place of the \none who died. You don't see that in the news. I was fortunate to have \narranged to be there at the same time that their Government took over. \nThe Prime Minister, Defense Minister Jasim, and the National Security \nAdvisor were there. I asked them basic questions. Some are talking \nabout the civil war that is going on. A civil war is not going on. If \nyou go there and sit down and talk to them, I believe it was Jasim who \nsaid that he is Shia and his wife is a Sunni. He didn't even know what \nsome of the other members of the Cabinet were. I wasn't sure I believed \nthis, I say to my friend from Alabama. I went out on my own with an \ninterpreter and I saw an honor guard force, the very elite of the \ngroup; there were nine of them. One was the leader. I said to the \nleader: I would like to know about the civil war, about what is \nhappening between the Shia and the Sunnis. He said: That is just not a \nreal thing. I have been with these guys 8 days now, and I cannot tell \nyou which are Shia and which are Sunni. He said--and this is \ninteresting because he repeated what Dr. Rubai said--he said: That is a \nWestern concept.\n  I wish that some of these people who are criticizing what is going on \nwould hear the testimonials we hear. A woman told me ``now my daughter \ncan get married.'' I said: Why couldn't she get married before? She \nsaid it was because the wedding celebrations take place outdoors. Many \ntimes, the forces would come by--and we know, of course, Saddam's sons \nwould capture and rape all of the girls and bury them alive. That is \nnot happening anymore. For the first time, we have women going to \nschool there. You have to go there and talk to them before you realize \nit.\n  The security forces that we criticize on the floor of the Senate are \nup now to 275,000 trained and equipped. I have talked to them, visited \nwith them. I was in Fallujah when they voted. They voted 2 days ahead \nof time because they were risking their lives to vote. They are looking \nforward to the day when they are going to be able to take care of their \nown security. It is difficult for people to say when that day is going \nto come. That is a military decision. Many of the military people tell \nme that when they have 10 divisions\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\ntrained and equipped, they will be able to do it. Now they have \n275,000, so that would be about 325,000.\n\n  They are making great progress. I heard the distinguished minority \nleader of the Armed Services Committee talk about a poll taken about \nhow the Iraqi people are responding to us. If a question is worded: Do \nyou want to have the coalition forces here from now on? Of course, they \ndon't. They are a very proud people. They want to take care of their \nown problems. But they are not ready for us to leave right now. In a \npoll taken about two trips ago, they said 94 percent of the Iraqis \nsupport a unity government. Now they have that unity government.\n  In the same poll, 78 percent of the Iraqis said they were opposed to \nIraqis being segregated by religion or ethnicity. And so we can show \nyou that the Iraqi people are so appreciative. It is spooky when they \nrecognize you as an American and come running up to you. You never know \nfor sure what they have with them. But they come up and embrace you and \nthey are recognizing that what we and the coalition forces have done is \na remarkable thing.\n  Also, what do a lot of these critics I heard on the floor have in \ncommon? They are all running for President of the United States. This \nis going to be their issue. If they can go to the Democrats and say, I \nam more liberal than anybody else, I am heading up the surrender, cut-\nand-run caucus, that is what they are going to try to do.\n  I suggest that we are very fortunate that Donald Rumsfeld was here at \nthis time. I have thought often about what might have been the \nalternative. The greatest possible disservice we can do, not just to \nthe Iraqi people but to our troops there, is to use Rumsfeld and the \nwar for political advancement. I have spent time with them over there, \nand I assure you that we did the right thing.\n  People who say there is no connection between 9/11 and Iraq don't \nrealize that three major terrorist camps were actually in Iraq at that \ntime. They are not open for business anymore. So I am very proud to \nstand here and defend our Secretary of Defense, who has done a great \njob, and also to say that our troops are doing an incredible job under \nmost difficult circumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate really should not have to \ndebate the need to replace Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense. \nIf the Bush administration believed in accountability, if it believed \nin performance standards, if it believed in demanding competence from \nsenior officials, Mr. Rumsfeld would have been dismissed long ago.\n  Instead, as disaster after disaster has followed disaster after \ndisaster, and as Iraq descended first into guerrilla war and into civil \nwar, Mr. Rumsfeld has been allowed to cling to his job.\n  For the record, I was the first Senator to call for Mr. Rumsfeld's \nresignation. I did so nearly 2\\1/2\\ years ago, on May 6, 2004, in \nresponse to the revelations of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. \nAs I said then:\n\n       For the good of our country, the safety of our troops, and \n     our image around the globe, Secretary Rumsfeld should resign. \n     If he does not resign forthwith, the President should fire \n     him.\n\n  I said that on May 6, 2004. However, the scandal at Abu Ghraib is not \nthe only disaster that can be traced directly to Mr. Rumsfeld. The \nSecretary of Defense has become virtually synonymous with disastrous \ndecisionmaking. The litany of his catastrophic mistakes is familiar to \nall of us.\n  Before the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld sidelined General Shinseki, \nthen the Army Chief of Staff, for daring to state that hundreds of \nthousands of troops would be needed to secure Iraq. Instead, Mr. \nRumsfeld insisted on going to war on the cheap, with the bare minimum \nnumber of troops needed to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Mr. Rumsfeld gave \nno thought to securing the country after Saddam's fall. Indeed, he \nthrew out the State Department's plan for restoring order. It was Mr. \nRumsfeld, remember, who dismissed the postwar anarchy in Baghdad and \nother places with the phrase ``stuff happens.'' That is a direct quote \nfrom Mr. Rumsfeld.\n\n  He was complicit in the decision to disband the Iraqi Army which fed \nthe chaos and drove many former Iraqi soldiers into the arms of the \ninsurgency.\n  Again and again, he refused to increase U.S. troop strength to a \nlevel that would allow law and order to be restored in Iraq.\n  He gave a green light to abusive practices that led to the scandal at \nAbu Ghraib prison.\n  He dismissed the insurgency as the work of just a few ``dead-enders'' \nwho would soon be routed.\n  He failed to adequately equip our Armed Forces in Iraq, including \nbasic items such as body armor and fortified humvees.\n  Most recently--just last week--Mr. Rumsfeld lashed out at critics of \nthe war in Iraq. He accused them of ``moral and intellectual \nconfusion'' and of appeasing ``a new type of fascism.'' Those are his \nexact words, ``moral and intellectual confusion,'' ``a new type of \nfascism.''\n  Wait a minute. This is the same Donald Rumsfeld who visited Baghdad \nin 1983 and was photographed warmly shaking hands with none other than \nSaddam Hussein. He had been sent on that mission to court Saddam \nHussein and to communicate the Reagan administration's desire to help \nthe Iraqi dictator in his war against Iran.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld went on that mission after we knew that Saddam Hussein \nhad committed mass murders, after we knew he had used chemical weapons \nto gas the Iraqi Kurds and Iranians. Mr. Rumsfeld is the last person to \nbe preaching about ``moral and intellectual confusion.''\n  I don't know of anyone else, I don't know of anyone on this side of \nthe aisle who has criticized the President and his mismanagement of the \nwar, and Rumsfeld and his mismanagement, who ever went to Iraq to shake \nhands with Saddam Hussein, who went to tell Saddam Hussein we would \nshare information and intelligence and whatever weapons we might need. \nThis was after we knew that he had gassed the Kurds and Iranians, after \nhe committed mass murders. Yet for Mr. Rumsfeld in 1983, Saddam was our \nguy. Let me rephrase that, Saddam was his guy, not ours.\n  Now, for Mr. Rumsfeld to be talking about moral and intellectual \nconfusion, let's get real here, folks. The only person who is morally \nand intellectually confused is Donald Rumsfeld.\n  The litany of Donald Rumsfeld's mistakes and misjudgments go on and \non. He has become almost a legend in his own time as a Secretary of \nDefense who has been catastrophically wrong again and again but who \narrogantly refuses to acknowledge any mistakes.\n  Earlier this year, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the \nUnited States made tactical errors in Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld dismissed her, \ntoo. He said:\n\n       If someone says, well, that's a tactical mistake, then I \n     guess it's a lack of understanding of what warfare is about.\n\n  Maybe we should listen to those who truly do understand what warfare \nis about. Maybe we should listen to some of the generals.\n  In early April, LTG Greg Newbold, the former Director of Operations \nfor the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in Time magazine that the invasion \nof Iraq ``was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special \nprovenance of those who have never had to execute these missions--or \nbury the results.''\n  He added:\n\n       The cost of flawed leadership continues to be paid in \n     blood.\n\n  About the same time, MG John Baptiste, who commanded the 1st Infantry \nDivision in Iraq in 2004 and 2005, said:\n\n       I believe we need a fresh start at the Pentagon. . . .We \n     need leadership up there that respects the military as they \n     expect the military to respect them.\n\n  Marine GEN Anthony Zinni, the former Chief of U.S. Central Command, \naccused Mr. Rumsfeld and his civilian advisers of ``dereliction of \nduty'' in failing to prepare adequately for war.\n  The remarkable thing about the debacle in Iraq is that nobody, aside \nfrom a few privates and sergeants, has been held accountable or \ndismissed. Isn't it the truth? It is always the grunts, it is always \nthe noncoms and the privates who get the raw end of the deal. They were \nthe ones who were thrown in prison for the scandals at Abu Ghraib. What \nabout the people above them? No one is ever held accountable above \nthem.\n  Incredible as it may seem, the four coarchitects of the Iraq \ndebacle--Paul\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\nWolfowitz, George Tenet, GEN Tommy Franks, Paul Bremmer--have all been \nawarded the Medal of Freedom. They have all been awarded the Medal of \nFreedom. Paul Wolfowitz, who said we would pay for it with Iraqi oil, \nwho said it would be over within 6 weeks, maybe 6 months at the most, \nwas awarded the Medal of Freedom. Think about that, the architects of \nthe debacle in Iraq. And Donald Rumsfeld has been rewarded with \ncontinued tenure as Secretary of Defense.\n  Meanwhile, our enterprise in Iraq continues to descend deeper and \ndeeper into chaos, corruption, and crime. Who is surprised by this? The \nsame Secretary of Defense whose decisions created the quagmire in Iraq \nis still in office, still in charge, still making key decisions.\n  It boggles the mind. I am reminded that the definition of insanity is \ndoing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different \nresult.\n  We have the same disastrous civilian leadership in place at the \nPentagon. Why should we expect anything but the same disastrous \nresults?\n  I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said ``Support our troops, \nnot poor leadership.'' I agree. Our soldiers and marines on the ground \nin Iraq are putting their lives on the line every day. They are trying \ntheir best to salvage some kind of positive outcome in Iraq. They \ndeserve our respect and our support. They also deserve competent \ncivilian leadership at the Pentagon.\n  Donald Rumsfeld ought to have the decency to step aside and allow for \nfresh leadership at the Pentagon. Instead, he stubbornly refuses to \nadmit any error. He stubbornly refuses to change course. He stubbornly \nrefuses to go.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. Rumsfeld has a pre-9/11 mentality, a pre-9/11 \nmindset. He talks about World War II, fascists, and Nazis. That is \nWorld War II.\n  Then, he said we have to stop the terrorists in Iraq before they get \ninto the Philippines, Indonesia, and other places. I remember as a \nstaff aide to a committee in the House in 1970 going to Vietnam and \nsitting in a meeting with then-President Nguyen Van Thieu with a bunch \nof Congressmen. I remember him lecturing how the Communist goal was not \nSouth Vietnam; it was just a stepping stone to the Philippines and \nIndonesia. And the Congressmen there lapped it up. They lapped it up. \nOh, yes, we have to stop the Communists in Vietnam before they get to \nAmerica. This is Rumsfeld saying this about terrorists.\n\n  As it has been pointed out, there are more terrorists in Iraq now \nthan prior to 9/11. It seems as though for every terrorist we kill, \nfour or five spring up.\n  So Mr. Rumsfeld has a pre-9/11 mindset, that he is fighting World War \nII or maybe even fighting the Vietnam war. That is why we need a change \nat the Pentagon. His tenure at the Pentagon has been disastrous--\ndisastrous for our economy, disastrous for Iraq, disastrous for the \nworld, disastrous for so many of our troops now injured, now deceased, \nkilled in Iraq.\n  It is unacceptable. It is time for the Senate to go on record saying \nthat it is unacceptable. That is what the amendment is all about. It is \nabout holding Mr. Rumsfeld accountable for his tragic mistakes. It is \nabout giving our troops the credible, competent civilian leadership \nthey deserve, someone with a post-9/11 mindset on the world, not a pre-\n9/11 mindset, such as Mr. Rumsfeld has.\n  It is about charting a new course in Iraq. It is also about charting \na new course in the war against terrorists who attacked us on September \n11, 2001.\n  It is time for Mr. Rumsfeld to go. It is time for new leadership at \nthe Pentagon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment \nthat I understand is going to be filed. I want to be brief, but I want \nto make two quick points.\n  I listened with interest to my good friend from Iowa, and he is my \ndear friend. I understand there are reasons one can put hindsight \nglasses on and one can criticize somebody for failing to take action \nwhen something has been done over a course of weeks, months, and years \nin this case. But what I don't hear in addition to the criticism is \nwhat we could have done or what we ought to do. All I hear is blame \nbeing put on, in this case, one man for the situation that has \ndeveloped in Iraq.\n  I happen to have a different opinion. I have been involved from the \nintelligence side, as well as from the Armed Services side in this \nbody, as well as previously on the House side. Secretary Rumsfeld has \nbeen at the helm of the Department of Defense now for almost 6 years, \nand during that 6 years, we, first of all, saw a movement toward \ntransformation of our military to a leaner, meaner, more mobile \nmilitary. Under his leadership, we have been headed in that direction.\n  During the course of that, along comes the conflict in Afghanistan, \nfollowed by the conflict in Iraq, and the overall global war on terror, \nwhich is really what this is all about.\n  I heard the distinguished minority leader say this morning that this \nis not about Donald Rumsfeld. It goes well beyond that. He is exactly \nright because the criticism I hear now is not just specifically at the \nSecretary of Defense but the overall policy of this administration \ntoward the global war on terrorism.\n  I am not a military expert. I don't pretend to be, and I don't think \nthere is anybody in this body who is an expert on the type of conflict \nin which we are now engaged, particularly as much of an expert as those \nfolks who wear the uniform of the United States. All of those who have \nworn it, all of those who do wear it are true heroes to all of us. But \nthe fact is, when it comes to the leadership in the Army, the \nleadership in every other branch of the U.S. military--but most \nspecifically the Army because, frankly, they have carried the brunt of \nthis in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq--there is strong leadership over \nthere, strong individuals, men who are well educated, men who are \nsmart, men who are well schooled in the war on terrorism but who are \nprincipally schooled in military operations. We don't hear any one of \nthose individuals jumping up and saying: I have told the Secretary \nthis, he wouldn't do this, and therefore we suffered the consequences \nof his decision.\n  What we have heard from my good friend from Iowa, again, is comments \nmade by former military individuals who probably didn't agree with what \nthis Secretary did, but they didn't say it while they were in uniform. \nThey waited until they were out of uniform.\n  It is awfully easy to look back and say what we should have done. But \nthere has been no Secretary of Defense in modern times that has had to \ndeal with as many complex military issues as this Secretary of Defense.\n  This Secretary of Defense is a tough boss. He is a very tough boss, \nbut he has a tough job to do. When I look at the men who are making \ncomments relative to what this Secretary of Defense should have done or \nshould not have done, I start with GEN Tommy Franks. General Franks was \nthere from day one as the Commander of CENTCOM. Tommy Franks was the \nman who was leading his men and women into battle under this Secretary \nof Defense. He is the man who was providing tactical information to \nthis Secretary of Defense and who made the key decisions in Afghanistan \nand the decisions early on relative to Iraq. And what does Franks say \nabout the leadership of Donald Rumsfeld? He couldn't say enough nice \nthings or enough positive things about the leadership of Donald \nRumsfeld. But as the minority leader said, this goes beyond that. What \nwe are hearing in this debate is about the policy in Iraq and not about \njust the leadership of that one position. And this amendment goes to \nthat.\n\n  My second point is when we talk about in this amendment that America \nis less secure today than we were prior to September 11, that statement \ncould not be any more false. All of us in this body who were here on \nSeptember 11--I happened to be in the other body on September 11, and \nall of us who were in both the House and the Senate who had any \nknowledge whatsoever of the intelligence situation and, for that \nmatter, probably 100 percent of the Members of the House and the \nSenate, believed that at some point in time we were going to suffer \nanother attack by the terrorists, who wake up every single morning with \ntheir sole purpose that day being to try to decide how they are going \nto kill and harm Americans. Yet we are going to celebrate next Monday\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\nthe fifth anniversary of September 11. And, gosh knows we hope it \ndoesn't happen today, we hope it doesn't happen tomorrow, but if we get \nto Monday, it will be 5 years that the United States has gone without \nsuffering another attack.\n  There are reasons for that, and Donald Rumsfeld is one of the reasons \nwe have not suffered another attack on U.S. domestic soil since \nSeptember 11. He is part of a team. There are a lot of people who \ndeserve credit for it. Our intelligence community is doing a much \nbetter job. We had a briefing in the Intelligence Committee from the \nDirector of the CIA, Mike Hayden, today to find out some additional \nthings that we are doing now, all positive things, all continuing to \nmove in the right direction. Mike Hayden is a part of that team. As we \nlook out at all of our other intelligence agencies around the country, \nfrom a defense standpoint as well as a civilian standpoint, they are \nall doing a better job than they were on September 11. They are all a \npart of that team with Donald Rumsfeld and Mike Hayden to make sure \nthat we are protected as citizens of the United States.\n  When you look at Director Mueller at the FBI, the FBI is doing a \nbetter job today than they were doing on September 11 of helping to \ngather intelligence and interrupting and disrupting potential terrorist \noperations inside the United States. They, again, are part of that \nteam. Every single FBI agent, whether they are on domestic soil or \nwhether they are on foreign operations, are doing a better job of \nmaking sure that as a team they are working to protect Americans and to \nhelp interrupt and disrupt terrorist activity.\n  So to say that we are not as safe today as we were on September 11, \n2001, is simply an incorrect statement and shows a lack of \nunderstanding about what has happened in the 5 years since September \n11.\n  Donald Rumsfeld is in a very unique position. He is in a position of \nmaking decisions relative to every single aspect of the war on terror. \nDonald Rumsfeld has a boss and he has to answer to that boss, and the \nboss is the President. I suspect that the underlying motive behind what \nwe are debating today is not about Donald Rumsfeld; it is one more \nopportunity for those folks who came on the floor of the Senate and \nattacked the war in Iraq and said it was time to get out and made the \narguments that we ought to get out of there now, we ought to get out of \nthere in 6 months, we ought to be out in 9 months, whatever it is--\nlet's set a timetable and tell the terrorists: You sit where you are, \nand in that period of time we are going to be out of there. And when \nthe vote came on that particular issue, there was a resounding vote in \nopposition to that particular philosophy in this body. I hope the next \nvote that we take, which will be on this particular amendment, will be \njust as resounding in opposition and a defeat of this amendment.\n  I will say that I haven't always agreed with Donald Rumsfeld. He and \nI have had some very public and tough battles. But he has always been \nfair. He has always been straightforward.\n  In one instance, when he called me about a matter that I was involved \nin, frankly, he was right and I was wrong, and I had to admit that. I \nmade a change in something we were doing, and we moved on. In other \nmatters, he has told me that I was right, and he was wrong. That is the \nkind of leader he is. He is not one who says that you either agree with \nme or you are simply not on the team. Secretary Rumsfeld has been in a \ntough position since he has been there. He has dealt with very tough \ndecisions in a very fair and favorable way.\n  If you look at the men who have served under him and you start with \nTommy Franks, for whom I have such great respect and who I think \neverybody in this body would agree is not somebody who is going to get \nrolled over, Tommy Franks is not that kind of individual. If he \nbelieved in something, he would encourage the Secretary of Defense \nunder his leadership to do exactly what he thought ought to be done. \nDonald Rumsfeld is the kind of person who would have listened to him, \nand he would have done whatever General Franks recommended. When \nGeneral Franks says this is the kind of guy we need in the foxhole with \nus, as Tommy Franks has alluded to, then he is the kind of guy we want \nleading the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is interesting and amazing to me to \nlisten to the critics of dissent in this democratic society. If you \ndisagree with the administration, they try to insult you out of order \nand to create positions that describe you as insignificant, willing to \nretreat. We watched last week as the President continued his \nadministration, as he began yet another campaign to convince Americans \nthat its policy in Iraq is working. But much like the President's Iraq \npolicy itself, this latest rhetorical campaign just isn't working. \nThere have been five Bush administration campaigns to convince America \nthat we should stay the course, and in each one of these administration \nclaims they fail to convince the public. The public is smarter than \nthey give them credit for. The American people understand what is \nhappening in Iraq, and no wordsmithing is going to change that.\n  The administration rhetoric continues. Last month, in a speech in \nArizona, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       What these Democrats are pushing now is the very kind of \n     retreat that has been tried in the past and has failed.\n\n  Is he implying that their mismanaged offense worked? Ask the 2,600 \nfamilies who lost a son or a daughter there whether they think the plan \nhas worked. It is insulting to suggest that those who disagree suggest \na retreat. They are ugly, partisan, political comments by the Vice \nPresident.\n  What the Democrats want--and many Republicans--is a change in the \ndirection in Iraq and new civilian leadership at the Pentagon to \nimplement it. The stubborn Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld approach is simply not \nworking. The retreat the Republican administration should be concerned \nwith is the retreat of their colleagues from this failed Iraq policy.\n  Some Republicans in Congress are happy to walk the plank and support \nthe arguments that simply defy logic and others are jumping ship. We \nare seeing staunch Republicans, such as Representative Gil Gutknecht of \nMinnesota, saying that we lack strategic control of Baghdad and calling \nfor a limited troop withdrawal. Representative Mike Fitzpatrick of \nPennsylvania has characterized the Bush stay-the-course strategy as \nextreme. We all know our principled colleague, Senator Hagel, has \nspoken up in favor of changing course in Iraq from these failed \npolicies.\n  But through it all, the Bush administration mantra is the same: Stay \nthe course. Don't cut and run.\n  The alternative to that is stay and die. Critics are either \nunpatriotic or, as we heard from Secretary Rumsfeld last week, like \nNazi appeasers.\n  It seems the more the Americans call on the President to change \ncourse in Iraq, the more adamant he is to continue his failed approach. \nPresident Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld are making the same speeches now \nthat they were making a year ago and even 2 years ago. Most of the \nwords and phrases are the same. Nothing has changed except the date and \nthe stage of the time.\n  The reality is that this administration is incompetent, and those in \nthis Congress who stand with them are endorsing this grievous \nincompetence. The administration's incompetence in Iraq has put our \ntroops in danger. The administration's incompetence in Iraq is now \nempowering the terrorist regime in Iran. The administration's \nincompetence in Iraq has strengthened, not weakened, al-Qaida and other \njihadists.\n  In summary, this administration's incompetence has made us less safe, \nand Americans feel it in poll after poll and in State after State.\n  I used to run a large company. Any successful CEO will tell you that \nif one of the top executives is making mistake after mistake after \nmistake, you have only one course: fire him. Get rid of him. There have \nbeen so many mistakes and miscalculations by Secretary Rumsfeld it is \nstaggering to try to understand why he is still around, to be polite, \nwhy he is still on the job. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make \nsense to me, and it doesn't make sense to millions across the country.\n  Before the war, Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n\n       We know where the weapons of mass destruction are.\n\n  But now we know that there was no real evidence that Iraqis had WMDs. \nHe also said that the Iraqis would welcome U.S. troops and that Iraqi \nresistance would be limited. That was obviously wrong. He also failed \nto build coalitions with our allies. That doesn't stop him from \nreferring to the coalition experience that we are having. There is \nvirtually no coalition existence there, with the exception perhaps of \nthe U.K. and Canada. In fact, Secretary Rumsfeld went out of his way to \nmock our allies when he should have been reaching out to them.\n  This administration's failure to build a real coalition has caused \nour troops to bear the vast majority of risk and to suffer the \ncasualties. These casualties stand at 2,652 deaths and almost 20,000 \nwounded.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said the war would be short. He said:\n\n       It is unknowable how long that conflict will last. It could \n     last six days, six weeks. I doubt six months.\n\n  More than 3 years later, we know that assessment was tragically \nwrong.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also ignored warnings that he wasn't committing \nenough personnel and resources to win the war. When Army Chief of Staff \nGEN Eric Shinseki suggested that we needed more troops to maintain \norder in postwar Iraq, he was forced out.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also was way off on the cost of the war. He said \nit would cost no more than $100 billion. The war so far has cost a \nstaggering $320 billion. He missed the mark. He said--insultingly:\n\n       You go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you \n     might want.\n\n  Is that a suggestion that our troops are less competent, less brave, \nless courageous, less willing to do their job? I think it is a terrible \nreference:\n\n       If you think about it, you can have all of the armor in the \n     world on a tank and a tank can be blown up.\n\n  Ask the parents of those who are in the tank corps how they feel \nabout that.\n\n       And you can have an up-armored humvee and it can be blown \n     up.\n\n  So it means, if you take it literally, well, that is what happens. If \nyou don't have enough armor, they just get killed. Talk to the parents. \nI talked to them. I visited with them. Boy, they don't feel they were \nas protected as they should have been.\n  Despite all of the funds, all of the effort, all of the sacrifice \ndevoted to the war, Secretary Rumsfeld has failed to fully equip our \ntroops. As we know, a number of prominent retired generals have come \nforward to say what many in the military have been thinking for years--\nit is time for Secretary Rumsfeld to leave his post.\n  The generals who have spoken out: MG Paul D. Eaton, GEN Anthony \nZinni, LTG Gregory Newbold, MG John Batiste, MG John Riggs, MG Charles \nSwannack, Jr., LTG Paul van Riper, GEN Wesley Clark--distinguished \nmilitary leaders who served nobly, who served bravely. Now, when they \nsay take a look and see where we are going, they are ignored.\n  General Eaton, who served in Iraq, said the following about Secretary \nRumsfeld:\n\n       In sum, he has shown himself incompetent, strategically, \n     operationally, and tactically, and is, far more than anyone \n     else, responsible for what has happened to our important \n     mission in Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.\n\n  In summary, business as usual in Iraq has to stop. We need new \nleadership. Unless Secretary Rumsfeld is replaced, we are, \nunfortunately, destined for more of the same pain and casualties as we \nhave in Iraq now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what we are having now is a rehash of \npeople's complaints about the war, and they are focusing it on the \nSecretary of Defense in a political season. We all know we will soon \nhave an election. So, everything anybody wants to complain about with \nregards to the war on terror, that they are unhappy about regarding the \ndifficulties we now face in Iraq, is now dropped on the head of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  The President of the United States took his case to the American \npeople in the last election. We heard these same complaints from these \nsame people, and they made them all over the country, and the President \nof the United States, George Bush, won that election. He won it with a \nmajority of the votes of the American people. For the first time in \nover a decade, a President has won the majority of the votes in this \ncountry.\n  Now unfortunately, that is not enough.\n  I would just say a couple of things I think are important. This \nSenate, after months and weeks of debate and discussion and hearings--\nopen hearings, secret hearings, briefings from the intelligence \nofficers at lower rank, briefings from the CIA Director, from Defense \nintelligence--we came into this body and we had to do our duty. Our \nduty was to vote our conscience on whether to authorize military force \nin Iraq. That was a solemn duty. I do not think anyone here \nmisunderstood the seriousness of that event. If they did, they are not \nvery grown up because it was a grownup decision we were asked to make: \nwhether we were going to commit our soldiers to military action against \nthe Saddam Hussein regime, which had violated 16 U.N. resolutions. This \nregime had fired at our airplanes on a regular basis--we cannot forget \nthat. And we were dropping bombs on him weekly and he was shooting \nmissiles at our airplanes weekly. That had been going on for years. He \nwas violating the resolutions, he was violating the weapons of mass \ndestruction discovery and openness requirement that he had committed \nto, to the U.N.--all those things.\n  The situation was such that we, with many of our allies, gave him one \nlast chance. He didn't take that chance, that one last chance to clear \nhimself and demonstrate he had no weapons of mass destruction, and that \nis when we voted. There was no mystery about that.\n  The Secretary worked with GEN Tommy Franks, and GEN Tommy Franks \napproved and designed a military campaign that he believed would be \nsuccessful. He moved with lightning speed and tremendous effectiveness, \nand it was a tremendously effective destruction of Saddam Hussein's \nregime in a time period far less than I would ever have thought \npossible and with a loss of life far less than I would have thought \npossible. It was a brilliant deal, and the Secretary of Defense, if you \nread GEN Tommy Franks' book, followed GEN Tommy Franks' decision, \nsupported that decision and was praised by GEN Tommy Franks, the man \nwho led this effort against Saddam Hussein and removed him from office.\n  Now what has happened? Many of the things that were predicted to \nhappen didn't happen. We didn't have a humanitarian disaster. We didn't \nhave to lose thousands or tens of thousands of soldiers in house-to-\nhouse fighting. We didn't have oil well fires. We didn't have a lot of \nthings people projected. The people did welcome our soldiers, and they \nwere happy to see the statue fall. You remember those scenes.\n  But look, we have difficulties now. There has been a persistent \nmeasure of violence in Iraq driven by a whole lot of forces. They are \ndetermined and striving every day to not allow a good and decent \ngovernment to be formed and be sustained in Iraq. We have invested a \nlot of time and effort in that. It is tough.\n  I have a nephew there and the son of a good friend there in the \nMarines, in tough areas right now. My nephew is in the Marines. I have \na sense for the effort and courage of our soldiers. It is a tough duty, \nand we are in a very tough struggle.\n\n  The struggle moved to Baghdad. An effort has been made to destabilize \nBaghdad and the Government there. We moved to counter that. That is the \nway, American people, it is always going to be when you deal with an \nenemy who has an ability to think. When you move in one direction, they \nwill counter. When they move in another direction, you have to counter \nthat. That is the way it will be. It is not a failure when an enemy \nmoves in one direction for you to counter that and alter your tactics. \nIn fact, I expect any good military commander would be altering tactics \non a regular basis to stay one step ahead of the enemy. That is what we \nare in, and it is a tough battle.\n  I, therefore, ask, first and foremost, does the resolution suggest--I \nsay the\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nresolution. It hasn't been offered because it is not appropriate, as I \nunderstand it, and it would not be appropriate to be offered. But any \nresolution to change the Secretary of Defense, is that going to help \nour soldiers in Iraq? Is that going to help them be successful? Is it \ngoing to make their lives better? Will it help us win this war, which \nwe must do? We need to ask ourselves that.\n  It is ironic, I have to say, that some of the people who complain \nabout Secretary Rumsfeld not having enough troops voted consistently \nfor the reduction of the number of troops we had by 40 percent when \nPresident Clinton was in office.\n  I see Senator McCain here. He has been a strong supporter of defense. \nHe has been concerned about the number of troops and said so \nconsistently. But there are many in the Chamber today who are saying we \ndo not have enough troops and at the same time saying they must be \nwithdrawn ahead of time; we ought to pull the number of troops down. \nHow ironic is that.\n  They say Secretary Rumsfeld doesn't listen to the generals. I say he \nhas listened to the generals.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator, who is a strong supporter of the military \nmen and women who are serving and with whom I have had the great \nprivilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee, if I may be a bit \ncynical, may I ask, Does the Senator think we would be having this \ndiscussion if we were not in an even-numbered year in September?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Unfortunately, I think the Senator's suggestion is \ncorrect. We are on the eve of an election. We have a motion here, a \nsuggestion and an attack on the Secretary of Defense who is leading a \nwar effort.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Arizona, who served in the military \ncourageously and who has been actively engaged in trying to help us be \nsuccessful in this war, is he troubled that the resolution and remarks \nthat are made, even recognizing we are in an election cycle, could be \nsuch that they would add to the risk and difficulties our soldiers \nface?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to respond to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Alabama, we have many pressing \nareas of the war on terror in Iraq. I think we should be engaged in \ndiscussions as to how we can better equip the men and women who are \nserving in Iraq. I think we could discuss the situation of the \nacquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran and North Korea. There are many \npressing issues around the world this body could be discussing.\n  I would respond with one more question for my friend from Alabama. I \ndo not want to take up too much of his time, but isn't it true that \nelections have consequences? The fact is, when we elect a President of \nthe United States, one of the most important things is for him to have \na team around him that he can trust and that he can rely on, and the \nPresident should be able to keep that team until such time as the \nPresident of the United States loses confidence in that team.\n  If we begin dictating who the team is around the President of the \nUnited States, it bodes ill for any President of the United States, \nwhether it be a Democrat or Republican or whoever, because one of the \nimportant aspects of the Presidency is to have people around the \nPresident of the United States whom he or she can trust. Isn't that one \nof the most important predicates of capable government?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. I think the Senator from Arizona \nhas made a tremendously important point. This President is committed to \na successful outcome in Iraq. He has chosen his Secretary of Defense, \nand his Secretary of Defense is his person in whom he has confidence, \nand he does not believe changing that Cabinet Member at this point in \ntime would help him be successful in that effort. I agree. But \nregardless of whether you and I might agree, it is his call. He was \nelected after a full debate over the wisdom and the conduct of the war \nin Iraq. He was reelected. I think the American people, therefore, \naffirmed him and expect him to choose the type people he believes will \nbe successful.\n  I think the Senator makes a good point.\n  I would just share a couple of thoughts before my time is up. To \nrepeat, we made a decision in this body. A majority of the Democratic \nside and a large majority if not all the Republicans voted to authorize \nthis military action. Many things went far better than we could have \nexpected. But we are now facing very difficult, persistent violence \nthat places at risk our soldiers, places at risk the new Iraqi \nGovernment, and it is something that should not be minimized. This is a \nvery tough time. But we have to be successful.\n  I know my colleagues have filed a motion and had quite a number of \nvotes on one or more resolutions to set a date and just withdraw, \nregardless of what is going on in the country--to just withdraw.\n  Just a few weeks ago, just before we recessed on August 3, we had an \nArmed Services Committee hearing on Iraq. Testifying before that \ncommittee was General Abizaid. General Abizaid followed Tommy Franks as \nCENTCOM Commander. That region of the world is under his control. We \nhad just voted overwhelmingly to reject a pullout of the troops in Iraq \nwithout regard to the status of the military situation in Iraq. I asked \nhim a question at that hearing.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska is here. I know he has had experience \nin these issues. He served our country in combat.\n  This is the question I asked General Abizaid:\n\n       What kind of reaction, what kind of impact would there be \n     with regard to the Islamic extremists in the Middle East? And \n     you are a student, General Abizaid of that region. You spent \n     time in that region as a young person. You speak Arabic and \n     you have been with us, conducting this Iraq war, virtually \n     from the beginning. What kind of impact would result if we \n     were to precipitously withdraw? Would it mollify the \n     extremists? Would it make them say, well, the United States \n     is a nicer place now? We don't have to be so aggressive now? \n     Or would they likely be emboldened, empowered, and more \n     aggressive?\n\n  And just like that, General Abizaid said:\n\n       Emboldened, empowered, more aggressive.\n\n  I said:\n\n       In your opinion, would a failure in Iraq embolden and \n     empower these radical extremists?\n       Yes, it would.\n\n  I asked again:\n\n       And, in your opinion, would setting a fixed date, \n     regardless of the situation in Iraq, for a withdrawal, \n     embolden or empower the extremist forces?\n       Embolden.\n\n  Then I asked General Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nMarine Corps general:\n\n       General Pace, this is a matter we've discussed. \n     Unfortunately, it's had very little support in the Senate but \n     there is a political election coming up and people float this \n     idea that we should just pull out. You've heard General \n     Abizaid's comments. He's been in the region for years and \n     been leading this effort. Would you agree with his comments?\n\n  General Pace, Marine Corps general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, said:\n\n       Sir, I agree with each of General Abizaid's responses to \n     each of your questions.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would, briefly.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Stevens came to me and wanted to enter into an \nagreement that we will have two votes tonight. I am very inclined to \nagree to that, but I ask the Senator--we have specific times on our \nspeakers. We need an idea as to how much longer the Senator will speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I won't be speaking but just 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That way we can work through there and have the votes the \nmajority leader wants.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Then he basically volunteered, he said:\n\n       Senator Sessions, sir, what I'd like to say is that the \n     troops that serve in the region are not afraid of what's \n     happening there. They would be afraid of what would happen if \n     we just precipitously left.\n\n  I would carry it a little bit further because I was talking to some \nsoldiers. Basically, what they told me was they were worried the \npoliticians wouldn't have the gumption to stay the course and be \nsuccessful after we have committed so much of our resources and lives, \nwhen we have a new government\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nthat has been up less than 6 months, trying to get itself established, \nand then we send signals with this kind of debate that we might just up \nand leave.\n  Fortunately, when we have had the votes, they have not been there. It \nis not helpful, in my view, to have this kind of debate. We have had it \nbefore. We have had our votes. The American people have elected the \nPresident again when he stated exactly what he intends to do to protect \nthis country from the regimes and the terrorists that are gathering in \nIraq.\n  We have an outstanding Secretary of Defense, a man who has the \nconfidence of the President, a man who has listened to the generals.\n  I was on an airplane, a C-130, flying into Baghdad with General \nAbizaid. We could hardly hear anyone talk on the planes. Just the two \nof us were sitting on one side of the aircraft. He explained to me why \nhe thought we should not send more troops there 2 years ago. He \ntestified recently at the hearing that he does not believe we need to \nsend more troops.\n  Is Secretary Rumsfeld dictating this policy or is he listening to the \ngeneral? That is what they have advised him; that is what he is doing. \nHe is following the advice of one of the most brilliant generals in the \nArmy, General Abizaid, the commander in that region.\n  If we will continue to follow that advice, if we will show strength \nand courage, if we continue to alter our tactics to meet the changing \ntactics of the enemy, this mindless violence can be defeated and a good \nand decent government in Iraq can be established. We have invested so \nmuch in that effort.\n  We voted as a Congress to undertake this action. We need to see it \nthrough successfully. We can do that. We just do not need to lose our \nnerve. We must win this war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I have listened to my friend from Alabama assert that the \nDemocrats are really interested in precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. \nFor the most part, the debate I have heard from our side and in our own \ncaucus is really more reflective of the words of some of our top \nmilitary leaders in Iraq with whom I met who said, as recently as last \nDecember, it is time for America to move toward the door; not to go out \nthe door, not to close the door behind us but, again, move toward the \ndoor.\n  That is a pretty good way to describe the way most feel. It is time \nto redeploy our forces, not to leave overnight, not to leave \nprecipitously, but to move toward the door.\n  Senator McCain asked: Would we be having this debate if it were not \nSeptember of an election year? I remember voting in 1991 to authorize \nthe use of force to invade Iraq and to force and compel the Iraqis out \nof Kuwait back into Iraq. Eighteen months or so after that, September \n1992, we were not having a debate. There was an election year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask my comments not interrupt the Senator's speech in \nthe Record.\n  Could the Senator yield to me? We have a time agreement following the \ndisposition of this.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent following the disposition of the \nReid amendment there be a period of 30 minutes equally divided in \nrelation to the Kennedy amendment, No. 4885, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; \nprovided further, following the vote, there will be 10 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to a vote in relation to the Mikulski \namendment, No. 4895, with no second-degree in order prior to that vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have no objection on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. What I was saying, responding and reflecting on Senator \nMcCain's question, would we be having this debate if it were not \nSeptember of an election year, in 1991, we voted to authorize the use \nof force in Iraq. Eighteen months after a number of us voted to \nauthorize the use of force to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait and to \nfollow them into Iraq, 18 months later, in September of 1992, a \nPresidential election year, we were having debates. One of the things \nwe were not debating was the wisdom of going out, getting the Iraqis \nout of Kuwait and forcing them far into Iraq, into Baghdad.\n  The reason we are having this debate today is not because it is an \nelection year, not because it is September of an election year, but \nbecause of how badly too much of our effort in that part of the world \nhas been managed. It is not a reflection of our troops. They have \nserved us valiantly. They continue to do so.\n  I say to my friend on the other side, be honest with yourself. If the \nshoe were on the other foot, if we had a Democratic administration, \nDemocratic President, a Secretary of Defense appointed by that \nDemocratic President; if we were in a war that the Secretary of Defense \nhad alleged would cost $50 billion to $60 billion, and in reality was \ncosting 10 to 20 times that amount; if we were in a war that was \nexpected to last maybe 6 months, and we are in it 3 years later, with \nno end in sight; if we were in a war where basically a Democratic \nadministration had said to the Iraqi Army, go home, we don't need you; \nif we were in a situation where instead of fostering a situation where \nwe had fewer insurgents, we had at least a fourfold increase in the \nnumber of insurgents holding forth in Iraq; if we had a Democratic \nadministration in Afghanistan that was starting to slip away from us, \nand we were seeing a massive increase in drug production, growing \nenough poppies in Afghanistan today to meet the demands of the whole \nrest of the world, not just the U.S. heroin addiction but the rest of \nthe world, I say to my friends on the other side, if the effort were \nmismanaged as badly by a Democratic administration, I bet we would be \nhaving this debate in September of 2006.\n  This is a reasonable debate. I say that as one who has voted for most \nof this administration's nominees who had to be confirmed, who tried to \nhelp a bunch of my old colleagues, including Secretaries Thompson, \nRidge, Leavitt, Whitman, and others to put together their teams to help \ngovern this country.\n  Every now and then the time comes to change course. We know what we \nare doing is not working. One of the keys to changing course, frankly, \nis to change leadership.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, to his credit, in response to early criticism, I \nam told, actually came to the President and offered to resign. And the \nPresident, to his credit, being loyal to his team, declined that offer \nby his Secretary. I believe that to be true.\n  I would say, Mr. President, if Secretary Rumsfeld feels compelled to \nsubmit his resignation to you again, accept it. It is time to turn the \npage. It is not the time to turn our backs on Iraq. It is not the time \nto turn our backs certainly on the men and women who are serving there \nfor us on behalf of the Iraqi people today, but it is time to change \ncourse. It is time to change the leadership. That begins with the \ncivilian leadership of the Department of Defense.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is debating a resolution that \nsimply asks the question: Could the Bush administration be doing things \nbetter in Iraq, the global war on terror, and with homeland security?\n  I know we can do better. I know we need to change course if we want \nto be more secure. We can do better than sending our troops into war \nwithout the armor and equipment they need. We can do better than \nmisleading the American people about the costs of this war. We can do \nbetter than completely misreading the insurgency, which the Vice \nPresident told us over a year ago was in its last throes. We can do \nbetter than a policy that leaves our troops without a clear mission and \nwithout a plan for success.\n  Our servicemembers deserve better. Frankly, our security demands \nbetter. It starts with this Senate simply saying we need to change the \ncourse. We cannot tolerate more of the same. We cannot have an \nadministration that has gotten it wrong at every turn. It is time to \nsend that message loudly and clearly.\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\n  We all want the same thing in Iraq: for our troops to complete their \nmission successfully and to come home safely. But today it is not even \nclear why our servicemembers are still there. What are they supposed to \nbe accomplishing in Iraq today? Overthrowing Saddam Hussein? They \naccomplished that. Looking for weapons of mass destruction? They looked \nand there were no weapons to be found. Are they supposed to be setting \nup an Iraqi Government? We have done that. The Iraqi people have \ncreated a Constitution. They have elected their leaders. They filled \ntheir Cabinet. Our troops have done everything we have asked them to \ndo. What is left? What are our troops supposed to be accomplishing \ntoday? And how will the President's policies get us there? That is the \ndiscussion we need to be having.\n  This administration's focus--solely on Iraq--has distracted us from \nthe larger important war on terror and has left us vulnerable. Our \ncountry faces possible threats from terrorists around the world. We \nneed a security strategy that ensures we can fight those threats \nwherever they are. But, instead, this administration has become \nincreasingly focused on Iraq. The President took a detour from the war \non terror and has invested a majority of our resources in Iraq, \nseemingly forever. That weakens our ability to fight the important war \non terror. That is another mistake.\n  Bin Laden is still on the loose and our homeland security efforts are \nwoefully inadequate. This resolution sends the message that we have to \nget back on track on the war on terror. We cannot continue to stay the \ncourse in Iraq indefinitely and expect to make progress in the global \nwar on terror.\n  The war on terror extends far beyond the borders of Iraq, and unless \nwe deal with all the threats we are facing, we are not going to have \nthe security we deserve in this country. But this White House has put \nall our eggs in the baskets of Iraq, and we are slipping behind all the \nother challenges we face in Iran, in North Korea, in Afghanistan.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times showed us how bad things have gotten in \nAfghanistan. And I quote:\n\n       Across Afghanistan, roadside bomb attacks are up by 30 \n     percent; suicide bombings have doubled. Statistically it is \n     now nearly as dangerous to serve as an American soldier in \n     Afghanistan as it is in Iraq.\n\n  Today the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in my home State of Washington \neditorialized that we need to get back to work in Afghanistan. And I \nwant to read to you what they said:\n\n       The central government's control is weakening as warlords \n     and the Taliban reassert themselves. Casualties for \n     international troops are mounting, making Afghanistan almost \n     as risky for U.S. soldiers as Iraq. Opium production is at a \n     record. The head of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime said \n     Afghanistan is now supplying a ``staggering'' 92 percent of \n     the world's opium supply.\n\n  We entered Afghanistan because it had harbored al-Qaida and bin \nLaden--who are responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11, \nwhich killed nearly 3,000 Americans. We still have not captured bin \nLaden, and the Taliban is reemerging in Afghanistan.\n  Iraq is not the only challenge we face, and if we do not recognize \nthat, Americans will pay the price.\n  This administration has gotten it wrong in Iraq, the war on terror, \nand on homeland security time and again. Continuing the status quo is \nunacceptable, and that is the message I send with my support for this \nresolution.\n  The American people deserve straight answers and a real debate so we \ncan get this right. Nothing is more important for our security, and \nnothing is more important for this country's future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a no-\nconfidence resolution on the leadership of Secretary of Defense Donald \nH. Rumsfeld.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has overseen a failed strategy, policy, and \nmilitary tactics for Iraq that have weakened the state of our national \nand homeland defense.\n  Despite clear evidence that our current strategy is not working, he \nhas stubbornly stuck to a deteriorating course.\n  We need a new direction. ``Staying the course'' is not the answer and \nSecretary Rumsfeld has been the key proponent of this failed policy.\n  I first publicly called for Secretary Rumsfeld's resignation 6 months \nago, after watching 3 years of mismanagement of our war effort in Iraq.\n  And, since that time, I have become more convinced of the importance \nof changing the leadership at the top of the Department of Defense.\n  In truth, the Bush administration's failed strategy and tactics in \nIraq have significantly diminished the United States' standing in the \nworld and made waging the global war on terror more difficult.\n  Despite optimistic reports by Pentagon officials regarding the \nsecurity situation near Baghdad over the past several weeks, it is \nclear that Iraq is on the edge of civil war.\n  For example, in recent days news agencies have reported that: 40 \nbodies, 25 of which had been blindfolded and executed by gunshot, were \ndiscovered in a mass grave in Baghdad--this from the New York Times.\n  The number of killings in and around Baghdad grew substantially last \nweek despite an American-led security crackdown, with morgues receiving \nas many bodies as they had during the first three weeks of August \ncombined--this from the Los Angeles Times.\n  Finally, the Iraqi parliament voted to extend a state of emergency \nthroughout much of the country a strong indication that the security \nsituation remains tenuous--this from the Associated Press.\n  Yet we are continuing down the same failed path, buttressing the \nShiite-dominated government and preventing it from taking actions \nnecessary to end the insurgency and prevent a full-scale civil war.\n  As a result of these failed policies under Secretary Rumsfeld's \nleadership, Iraq continues to be a nation in chaos.\n  Yes, there is a permanent government in place. But the ministries do \nnot function properly; terror, kidnappings, and assassinations continue \non a daily basis.\n  Iranian influence is growing, and Shiite militias dominate the \npolice.\n  Civilian killings now top 3,000 a month, and a Sunni-Shiite civil war \nis emerging, with U.S. forces caught in the middle.\n  Despite spending almost $20 billion on reconstruction efforts, our \nplan for Iraq reconstruction has stalled as security requirements \ncontinue to tax our resources.\n  Unemployment may be as high as 50 percent, many utilities are not \nonline, and demand for subsidized gasoline--U.S. $0.55/gallon--has led \nto a thriving black market and corruption. Oil production has yet to \nmeet revenue goals.\n  The list of failures in our war policy in Iraq is comprehensive and \nlong:\n  (1) Failed strategic, logistical, and financial planning for the Iraq \nwar\n  Secretary Rumsfeld ignored suggestions early on by advisers like Army \nChief of Staff General Shinseki, Senators such as John McCain, and \nreports by well-respected think tanks such as the RAND Corporation, \nthat many more ground troops were needed.\n  For questioning Rumsfeld's plan, General Shinseki was effectively \nforced into early retirement.\n  White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey found himself out of a \njob after differing with Rumsfeld in suggesting that the Iraq war might \ncost up to $200 billion Rumsfeld initially argued that it would cost \nonly $50 billion.\n  With the addition of emergency supplemental funding, the cost of the \nIraq war has now reached $320 billion, with spending averaging $2 \nbillion a week.\n  American troops went into combat without the proper equipment and \nprotection. Hundreds of soldiers and marines were killed or maimed in \nthe early stages of the war due to the lack of appropriate vehicle and \nbody armor.\n  Yet in responding to these concerns, Secretary Rumsfeld famously \nquipped, ``You go to war with the Army you have.''\n  (2) Failed policy of de-Baathification, including abolishing the \nIraqi Army with no severance pay or pensions for soldiers\n  Perhaps the biggest strategic mistake made by military planners, \nbeyond the lack of adequate troop strength, was the decision to \ndemobilize the standing Iraqi Army, while ``blacklisting'' other \ncivilian professionals who had been members of the Baathist Party.\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\n  Many of these soldiers, government officials, doctors, lawyers, and \nother civilian workers, with their jobs eliminated and no money to feed \ntheir families chose to join the insurgency that has now grown to an \nestimated 20,000 individuals.\n  Remarkably, Rumsfeld until only recently tried to characterize the \ninsurgency as a group of ``foreign fighters,'' failing to understand \nthe deep resentment cultivated by American policies in post-Saddam \nIraq.\n  (3) Faulty belief that capturing Baghdad meant controlling Iraq\n  As related in recent firsthand accounts of the initial invasion, \ncommanders on the ground quickly identified the threat of a guerilla \nwar, but after GEN William Wallace, who was leading the march toward \nBaghdad, recommended crushing the small insurgency along the way, he \nwas nearly forced to resign.\n  While U.S. forces successfully captured Baghdad within 3 weeks, this \nstrategy allowed an insurgency to grow within the Sunni triangle and \nhundreds of foreign fighters to stream across Iraq's unguarded borders.\n  (4) Failure to manage the chaos in the aftermath of the invasion\n  Some of the first signs that the U.S. lacked adequate troops were the \npictures of Iraqis rioting and looting in several key cities \nimmediately following the invasion.\n  Rumsfeld dismissed the chaos as a symbol of ``freedom and \ndemocracy,'' simply saying ``stuff happens.'' Sadly, it demonstrated to \nall Iraqis that American military resources were limited.\n  This shortage of U.S. troops also resulted in a failure to secure \nmunition dumps and small arms that were stashed throughout the country.\n  The insurgency was able to thrive through access to these munitions \nand weapons caches, and many American troops have been killed or \ninjured from bombs or RPGs that could have been secured in the initial \ninvasion, had we had enough troops.\n  (5) Failure to stop abuse and torture\n  One of the greatest stains on America's reputation that will come out \nof the war effort is our failure to properly protect the rights of \nthose detained by our military.\n  While most of our men and women have served honorably, it is clear \nthat the Pentagon allowed a culture of abuse to develop in prisons such \nas Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and Camp Nama.\n  Yet despite the clear evidence of detainee abuse, no high-level \nofficial has been held accountable for these actions.\n  (6) Failure to maintain military readiness\n  The Iraq war has taken a significant toll on the state and \npreparedness of our military. Our armed forces are stretched thin; our \nmen and women in uniform overburdened.\n  Last month, the Marine Corps was forced to issue call-up orders for \n2,500 from its Individual Ready Reserve the first time it has had to do \nso since the war started.\n  Top Army commanders have suggested that two-thirds of all Army \nbrigades do not meet the necessary state of readiness, and National \nGuard chief, LTG Steven Blum, estimates that two-thirds of the National \nGuard cannot even be deployed today.\n  Equipment is fast wearing out. It is estimated that the Army and \nMarines will need a combined $75 billion over the next 5 years for \nmaintenance, repair, and replacement alone.\n  As a result of failed policies under Secretary Rumsfeld's leadership, \nwe may well end up with a broken force and an Iraq held captive by \ncivil war.\n  There must be a change in course and a change in those who have \nmanaged the war effort.\n  This is critical if we want to have any chance for success in Iraq.\n  Just last week, Secretary Rumsfeld employed truly shameful rhetoric \nby comparing those who have criticized the Iraq War with those who \n``appease[d]'' the Nazis in the run-up to World War II.\n  In the speech at the American Legion conference in Salt Lake City, \nRumsfeld stated:\n\n       Once again, we face similar challenges in efforts to \n     confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism but some \n     seem not to have learned history's lessons.\n\n  Questioning the patriotism of those who might not support the war, he \nsaid:\n\n       The struggle we are in is too important the consequences \n     too severe to have the luxury of returning to the ``blame \n     America first'' mentality.\n\n  These baseless, partisan attacks are simply over-the-top and are \nbeing used to fill a gaping vacuum created by the lack of a successful \nplan for Iraq.\n  It is clear to me that this administration, led by the President and \nSecretary Rumsfeld, has been wrong at almost every turn.\n  Still, Secretary Rumsfeld remains in place, despite a growing number \nof bipartisan calls for the President to replace him.\n  Consequently, I believe that now is the time for the Senate to assert \nits oversight role and move forward with a vote of no-confidence.\n  Ultimately, it is true that President Bush is responsible for the \nfailures in Iraq, but no Bush administration official was closer to the \nwar planning than Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld was and remains the chief architect of the \nstrategy and policy in Iraq.\n  Consequently, it is time for President Bush to ask for Secretary \nRumsfeld's resignation and pursue a course correction under new \nPentagon leadership.\n  There must be accountability for the disastrous policy pursued in \nIraq.\n  It is time to bring in a new team to run our military. Secretary \nRumsfeld must step down.\n  Our men and women in uniform deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to be the last speaker. Senator \nDorgan will not be using his time, so I am asking that I have 4 minutes \nof his time, since he has given me that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. That will give me a total of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think it is a very sad day that the Republicans are \nnot going to allow a vote on this Democratic resolution calling for a \nchanged course in Iraq. And their reason--I sat here and listened--is \nthat we are only doing this because it is an election year. Well, \nfolks, I do not know how to break this to you, but every 2 years is an \nelection year. Are we supposed to stop working in an election year? Are \nwe supposed to stop talking about the issues that are on the minds of \nthe American people because they may be difficult or they may be \ncontroversial or they may have consequences for us? Are we supposed to \nstop doing the people's business in an election year?\n  I do not know about my Republican friends, but I know Californians \nexpect me to work every year--election year or not--every day, every \nweek, every month. And I say to Senator McCain, elections do have \nconsequences. He said elections have consequences. Yes. And all of us \nwere elected, too. Is he forgetting that? Does he think the only \nelection that matters is the election of a President? I think our \nFounders would be very shocked. Our job is to provide oversight. Our \njob is to, in fact, advise and consent on many nominations, including \nthe top levels of this administration. So I rise in strong support of \nthis very important amendment Senator Reid has carefully put together.\n  This amendment does three critically important things.\n  First, it is about this Congress conducting its constitutional \nresponsibility to exercise oversight over the executive branch. It is \nour job, given to us by the Founders. It is our job not to be a \nrubberstamp Congress, not to be a compliant Congress, not to be a roll-\nover-and-play-dead Congress, but to challenge, to question, to push; \nand if things are not going well for our country--be it wages for our \nworkers or be it education for our children or be it deficits as far as \nthe eye can see and debt as far as the eye can see or the war in Iraq--\nwe need to speak out. And that is what this carefully crafted amendment \ndoes.\n  Second, the amendment is about helping to chart a new path forward in \nIraq and clearly states that we need a new direction. That is \nimportant. There are those on the other side who said this is all about \nDonald Rumsfeld. It is not all about Donald Rumsfeld. It talks about \nstarting over, starting anew, getting a new strategy in place for \nsuccess in Iraq.\n  Third, it is about calling for a new civilian leadership. As you \nknow, in this\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\nparticular version, we do not even mention Donald Rumsfeld's name. We \nare basically saying it is time to change direction. Things are \ndangerously heading down the wrong path in Iraq.\n  Let's hear what the latest Pentagon report said. My friends are \nquoting the Pentagon, as well they should. Let's hear what the Pentagon \nitself is saying:\n\n       Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian \n     population and among some defense analysts has increased in \n     recent months. Conditions that could lead to civil war exist \n     in Iraq.\n\n  They pointed out that the average number of weekly attacks--against \ncoalition forces, Iraqi security forces, the civilian population, and \ninfrastructure--increased by 15 percent since last spring. The number \nof weekly attacks has increased from approximately 640 to nearly 800. \nJuly saw the highest level of weekly attacks since military operations \nbegan.\n  In California, we have bases that are sending our troops out for \ntheir fourth tour of duty--their fourth tour of duty. So we are \nsupposed to sit back and be compliant because it is an election year? \nBecause it is an election year? Just talk to the parents and the \nfamilies who are losing their family members, who are losing their sons \nand daughters, who are losing their moms and dads, who are seeing them \ncome back with post-traumatic stress disorder, severe brain injury. \nTalk to them about it. They could care less if it is an election year. \nThey want us to change course and bring their kids home. The fact is, \nwe could do it if the Iraqis wanted democracy and wanted freedom as \nmuch as we wanted it for them. You show me one country that survives \nthat cannot take care of its own security.\n  Sectarian violence is what is going on over there. As a result of our \nflawed policy, we are shorting the war on terror. We are not protecting \nour ports. The money is going to Iraq. It is being sucked out of the \nTreasury, going onto the backs of our grandchildren, to the tune of \nover $300 billion. And where is the money for port security? Where is \nthe money to protect our nuclear powerplants? Where is the money to \nprotect our infrastructure? Where is the money to protect our aircraft \nfrom shoulder-fired missiles, when we know that at least two dozen \nterrorist organizations have those missiles and the FBI has warned us \nover and over that we need to do something about it? Oh, they have to \nslow-walk it because they do not have the money--except for tax cuts to \nbillionaires. They have the money for that.\n  So the bottom line is, this flawed strategy is shorting the war on \nterror. Secretary Rumsfeld how wrong could he be? He said he doubted \nthis war would even last even 6 months. But he cannot admit a mistake. \nThe fact is, when we went into Iraq without a plan, we turned away from \nthe war on terror. Every single Senator voted for the war on terror--\nevery single Senator.\n  I remember writing a speech, coming to this floor, and giving strong \nsupport to this President to go get Osama bin Laden, to go break the \nbacks of terrorists, to go break the backs of al-Qaida to do it--and I \nwould give him everything he needed. The whole world was with us. Go \nback to those days. Everyone was with us. But, oh, no, he had this \nthing, he was going to go into Iraq, even though his own State \nDepartment showed there was not one al-Qaida cell in Iraq. There were \nmore al-Qaida cells in America than in Iraq. Took the money, took the \nenergy, took the military, spread them thin, thought this war would be \nover in a nanosecond. And we have been misled. We have been misled.\n  So this is a very sensible resolution. Let me just read you the \noperative language:\n\n       Our troops deserve and the American people expect the Bush \n     Administration to provide competent civilian leadership and a \n     true strategy for success in Iraq.\n       President Bush needs to change course in Iraq to provide a \n     strategy for success. One indication of a change, of course, \n     would be to replace the current Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. President, this resolution is written with respect to the \nPresident. It does not demean anybody. I believe it is very carefully \ndrawn, and I think it speaks for the American people. If you look at \nthe polls today, they are begging us--begging us--to change course. And \nI will tell you, it has not been easy for the American people to make \ntheir feelings known because they have changed. In the beginning, they \nwere all for this. But they have seen what has happened. We cannot \nclose our eyes to what is happening. And then when the Secretary of \nDefense looks at those of us in America--a vast majority who oppose \nthis war--and says we do not understand history and we are appeasers, \nthat has gone just too far.\n  I say to the Secretary and to this President: Get with the current \ntimes.\n  I even heard Secretary Rice talk about how this was somehow akin to \nthe people who did not want to fight the Civil War. Talk about drawing \nup analogies that do not make any sense, there is another one.\n  Let's change course now. And let's start by approving this \nresolution. At the minimum, I say to my friends on the Republican side, \nlet us vote on this resolution. It is our job to speak out. It is our \njob to do oversight. And let the votes fall where they may. But the \nAmerican people deserve this vote. I thank my leader for putting this \nresolution together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will momentarily send an amendment to the \ndesk. But my disappointment is that the majority, as they have done for \nyears when a tough issue comes before the Senate, through technical \nmeans, is preventing Senators and preventing the Senate from expressing \nits will--in this instance on this resolution of no confidence. This is \nunfortunate. We should have the ability to vote on this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4904\n\n  Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Carper, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4904.\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\nSense of the Senate on the Need for a New Direction in Iraq Policy and \n        in the Civilian Leadership of the Department of Defense:\n\n     Findings:\n       1. U.S. forces have served honorably and courageously in \n     Iraq, with over 2,600 brave Americans having made the \n     ultimate sacrifice and over 20,000 wounded.\n       2. The current ``stay the course'' policy in Iraq has made \n     America less secure, reduced the readiness of our troops, and \n     burdened America's taxpayers with over $300 billion in \n     additional debt.\n       3. With weekly attacks against American and Iraqi troops at \n     their highest levels since the start of the war, and \n     sectarian violence intensifying, it is clear that staying the \n     course in Iraq is not a strategy for success.\n\n       Therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       1. Our troops deserve and the American people expect the \n     Bush Administration to provide competent civilian leadership \n     and a true strategy for success in Iraq.\n       2. President Bush needs to change course in Iraq to provide \n     a strategy for success. One indication of a change of course \n     would be to replace the current Secretary of Defense\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against this \nresolution on the basis of precedent of the Senate of May 17, 2000. It \nis not appropriate to raise this amendment as a sense of the Senate on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot germane. The amendment falls under the criteria of the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4885\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is now, for the Kennedy amendment, \n30 minutes on a side, as I understand it; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Fifteen minutes on a side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. Just for the \ninformation of the Members, I intend to ask for the yeas and nays at \nthe conclusion of the debate.\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Kennedy-Reid amendment requires the Secretaries of \nDefense and State to determine every 3 months whether Iraq is in a \ncivil war and to outline a plan to protect our troops in the event of a \ncivil war.\n  Under our amendment, if the administration determines that Iraq is \nnot in a civil war, the amendment requires a description of the efforts \nby our Government to avoid civil war in Iraq, a plan to protect our \ntroops in the event of a civil war, and a strategy to ensure that our \ntroops don't take sides. If the determination is that Iraq is in a \ncivil war, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to explain \nthe mission of our troops and the duration, his plan to protect our \ntroops, and a strategy to ensure that they don't take sides in a civil \nwar.\n  At every step of the way, this administration has missed the threat \nto our troops, and the American people have seen it time and again. \nThey saw it when the Bush administration disbanded the Iraqi Army after \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein but allowed thousands to walk away with \ntheir weapons. They saw it when the Bush administration waited a full \nyear to begin training the new Iraqi security forces. They saw it when \nthe White House failed to see the insurgency spreading like a cancer \nthroughout Iraq. They saw it when the Bush team failed to see the \ndanger of roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices, yet sent our \ntroops on patrol day after day, month after month, year after year. \nThey saw it when the White House failed to provide the proper armor for \nour troops until the Congress demanded it.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's repeated failure to see each new \nthreat in Iraq has put our troops and our security in greater peril. \nToday, once again, the administration refuses to recognize another \nseismic shift in Iraq--the dangerous prospect that we are drawn into a \ndeadly and divisive civil war.\n  While the President and Dick Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary \nRice are out on the campaign trail claiming progress in Iraq, military \nleaders and experts are urging the White House to heed the disturbing \nwarning signs in Iraq. General Abizaid acknowledged the clear danger \nwhen he told the Senate Armed Services Committee on August 3:\n\n       I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as \n     I have seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not \n     stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move toward civil \n     war.\n\n  General Pace, at the same hearing, agreed about the threat of the \ncivil war. He said:\n\n       I believe that we do have the possibility of devolving to a \n     civil war, but that does not have to be the fact.\n\n  Others think that a civil war may have already begun. Former Iraqi \nPrime Minister Allawi said in March that Iraq is probably in ``an early \nstage of civil war.''\n  The British Ambassador to Iraq wrote in August:\n\n       The prospect of a low-intensity civil war and a de facto \n     division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a \n     successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy.\n\n  Our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel, concurred, saying \nin August:\n\n       We, in fact, are in probably a low-grade, maybe a very \n     defined, civil war.\n\n  General William Nash, who commanded our troops in Bosnia after that \ncountry's civil war ended, stated on March 5:\n\n       We are in a civil war now; it is just that not everybody \n     has joined in.\n\n  These leaders see what is really happening in Iraq, not just the \nWhite House spin. Indeed, the September 1 report prepared by the \nDepartment of Defense on civility and security in Iraq reaffirms what \nthe American people already understand, the conditions of civil war \nexist. Violence in Iraq is spiraling out of control, and staying the \ncourse is not a viable option.\n  This is what the Department of Defense report says:\n\n       Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian \n     population and among some defense analysts has increased in \n     recent months. Conditions that could lead to civil war exist \n     in Iraq.\n       Rising sectarian strife defines the emerging nature of \n     violence in mid-2006.\n       Sustained ethnic and sectarian violence is the greatest \n     threat to security and civility in Iraq.\n       Sectarian tensions increased over the last 3 months, \n     demonstrated by the increased number of executions, \n     kidnappings, attacks on civilians, and internally displaced \n     persons.\n       Civilian casualties increased by approximately 1,000 per \n     month since the previous quarter. Assassinations, in \n     particular, reached new highs in the month of July. The \n     Baghdad coroner's office reported that 1,600 bodies arrived \n     in June, and more than 1,800 bodies in July, 90 percent of \n     which were assessed to be the result of executions.\n       Sectarian violence is gradually spreading north into Diyala \n     Province and Kirkuk as Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish groups \n     compete for provincial influence.\n       Both Shia and Sunni death squads are active in Iraq, and \n     are responsible for the most significant increases in \n     sectarian violence.\n       Militias and small, illegally armed groups operate openly \n     and often with popular support. The threat posed by Shiite \n     illegal armed groups, filling perceived and actual vacuums, \n     is growing.\n       The security situation is currently at its most complex \n     state since the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n  That is all from the report prepared by the Defense Department. These \nfacts are at odds with the administration's statement about civil war. \nSectarian divisions are increasing. Militia violence and death squad \nactivity is increasing. The number of Iraqis fleeing the violence is \nincreasing. Yet the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, \nand Secretary of State continue to deny the possibility of civil war. \nAs long as the administration continues to deny the plain truth, \nAmerica will be behind the curve and unable to adjust to the current \nrealities on the ground and protect our troops.\n  Most important, our amendment requires the administration to say what \nwe are going to do about it. How are we going to advance America's \ninterests in Iraq in a time of civil war? How are we going to protect \nour troops from getting drawn ever deeper into an endless sectarian \nconflict?\n  An article in Newsweek magazine on August 14 indicates that although \nthe Bush administration insists that Iraq is a long way from civil war, \nsome inside the White House and the Pentagon have begun some \ncontingency planning. The American people and our men and women in \nuniform want to know what that means.\n  What is the role of our troops in a civil war? What is our mission? \nHow long will it take? What are the rules of engagement? How do we \nprevent our troops from taking sides? As long as we are on the ground \nin the conflict, our troops run the risk that they will be perceived as \nhelping one side against another.\n  The administration should level with the American people about their \nplanning to protect our troops. We all agree that the Iraqis need to \nmake political compromises necessary to stop the violence and civil \nwar. That is plan A. But what is plan B? What is the contingency plan? \nWhat is the plan to protect our troops?\n  That is the purpose of our amendment this evening. The amendment is \nneeded to ensure proper planning in the event of civil war.\n  Instead of attacking those who want to change our course, President \nBush ought to deal with the hard, cold facts. This Defense Department \nreport underscores the fundamental truth that our brave troops are \nbeing let down by the administration and we need to find a way to \nsucceed.\n  The administration needs to look at all of the facts and honestly \naddress the question of civil war for the sake of our military and the \nAmerican people. This legislation creates a continuing obligation to \nensure that analysis on civil war is done regularly. The facts in the \nadministration's report say one thing about civil war, but the \nconclusion about civil war says another. We need an honest assessment \nabout the conditions and a clear plan to protect our troops.\n  Our soldiers and the American people deserve more from the \nadministration. Together, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \nState need to set the White House political agenda aside and directly \nand thoughtfully address this ominous threat.\n  The administration acts as if the mere discussion of a civil war is \ndefeatist. They have it exactly backward. This amendment is an effort \nto make sure that the administration confronts and deals with the facts \non the ground in Iraq and recognizes the emerging threat before it \nconsumes our troops.\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\n  We must do better. This administration owes it to the American \npeople. Even more important, dealing with reality is essential and \nnecessary to protect the lives of our brave soldiers.\n  Iraq's future and the lives of our troops are close to the precipice \nof a new disaster. The timebomb of civil war is ticking, and our most \nurgent priority is to defuse it.\n  For the sake of our men and women in uniform and the stability of \nIraq, all Americans are anxious for success, but we need to be \nrealistic and smart enough and humble enough to understand that even \nour best efforts may not prevent a civil war from overtaking events in \nIraq.\n  We need to begin planning now for this possibility. Such planning is \nnot an admission of defeat. It is essential and necessary for \nprotecting the lives of our service men and women in Iraq who are \nperforming so admirably today under such enormously difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Benjamin Franklin said as long ago as the 18th century:\n\n       By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\n\n  This was sound advice then, it is sound advice now. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nVirginia may use.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \ninitiative by my fellow colleague on the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts. It is rather interesting, I went back \nand studied a lot of military treatises and precedents, trying to \nanalyze what constitutes a civil war--Webster's Dictionary; Edward \nLuttwak, ``The Dictionary of Modern War''; Pennsylvania State \nUniversity's ``The Classic International War''; and other treatises. It \nwas interesting. There is another academic, with a last name spelled K-\nA-L-L-Y-V-A-S. He put out a treatise on warfare in civil wars. He talks \nabout a conventional civil war, an irregular civil war, an asymmetric, \nnonconventional civil war.\n  This is an academic exercise that yields nothing. The one thing that \ncomes out in this study is that there are no two civil insurrections \nalike. There is not a blueprint that can be put on this problem in Iraq \nto say definitively that it constitutes a civil war.\n  In fact, the situation in Iraq, no matter how disturbed all of us are \nabout the rising number of deaths and the sectarian violence, it is \nvery disturbing and I acknowledge that. It was never, in my judgment, \nforeseen that this level of insurrection would take place once we had a \nseries of elections by the people of Iraq and a government put into \nplace.\n  But the basic formula of civil war has the principle in it that if \nthe government is still functioning and if the Armed Forces of that \ncountry are still acting in support of the government, then it does not \nconstitute a civil war.\n  I urge my colleagues to turn their attention to the key fact here: \nWhat are the consequences if this government fails to have a security \nsituation that enables it to exercise the full range of sovereignty? \nWhat are the consequences? What are the consequences if these valuable \noilfields--maybe not all at once, but part of them--fall into the hands \nof terrorists who seize them? What are the consequences of the \nsituation devolving to the point where the nations around it feel they \nmust inject themselves into the situation? For example, those nations \nwith Sunni populations, Jordan and Saudi Arabia and indeed Syria and \nEgypt; they are not going to stand on the sidelines.\n  So I say to my colleague, we better look at what happens if this \nGovernment fails to receive that measure of support from the coalition \nforces, principally the United States, to enable it to continue to \nexercise the reins of sovereignty and continue to have the allegiance \nand loyalty of the Armed Forces which we have painstakingly trained in \nlarge numbers now and equipped.\n  Therein is the debate we should have to let the American people know \nwhat are the consequences. If the oilfields were to fall into the wrong \nhands, they would provide an unlimited source of cash for the \nterrorists--terrorists who have the most frightful of all weapons \ntoday; namely, the human bomber. Couple that unlimited cash and what \nappears to be a number of human bombers and we have a serious problem. \nThe Middle East would be thrown into a convulsive state. The \ncredibility of our Nation, in the eyes of the world, would be tested, \nand we could no longer be a strong voice in trying to bring about order \nin this region and to contain the most serious problem, as I see it; \nthat is, the possibility of Iran becoming a power enabling it to have \nnuclear weapons.\n  We must maintain a strong presence and we cannot let this Government \nbe in a situation where it can no longer exercise the reins of \nsovereignty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And how much time on Senator Kennedy's side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, since 2005, the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee has required the Department of Defense to report quarterly on \nthe stability and security situation in Iraq. This is the most recent \nreport. It was prepared in August and embargoed until September 1.\n  Six pages of the bill language is very detailed. Starting on page \n233--my colleagues can look in the bill--it requires a comprehensive \nset of performance indicators and measures for progress and political \nstability in Iraq. In other words, we continue in our bill already, \nwithout the Kennedy amendment, the concept that every quarter the \nDepartment reports to us.\n  The first part of this report describes trends and progress toward \nmeeting goals and political stability. That requirement is contained in \nsection 9010 of our bill.\n  The second section of this report describes training development and \nreadiness of the Iraqi security forces, including the forces of the \nMinistry of Defense and police and paramilitary forces of the Ministry \nof Interior.\n  The third section describes transfer of security responsibility from \ncoalition forces to the Iraqi Government, including prerequisite \nconditions and criteria for assessing the readiness of provinces to \nassume responsibility for security.\n  As I said, this report is already prepared and was presented on \nSeptember 1 and is on every desk in the Senate. The current report \naddresses the prospect of civil war on pages 33, 34, and 35. It is very \nclear. It has reviewed the concept of ethno-sectarian violence, and \nthat is the greatest threat to security and stability. It also \ncontinues with regard to the concepts on page 34 and has a series of \nincident reports.\n  I can tell the Senate there is no question that the Department has \ndiscussed already in the report the concepts Senator Kennedy wants to \nhave discussed. It says this on page 33:\n\n       Notwithstanding this concern, there is no generally agreed \n     upon definition of civil war among academic or defense \n     analysts. Moreover, the conflict in Iraq does not meet the \n     stringent international legal standards for civil war.\n\n  In other words, they have already reported to us, as Senator Kennedy \nwould require. But Senator Kennedy wants to add additional requirements \nnow. The question he asks, for example, in section (G), subparagraph 3: \nis the strategy of the United States Government to ensure that the \nUnited States Armed Forces will not take sides in the event of a civil \nwar in Iraq?\n  It may be that we are already taking sides. We are supporting the \nGovernment if the insurrection is there. We need to help the elected \nGovernment against the al-Qaida attacks. There is no question that \nshould be done. But the Kennedy proposal presumes the United States \nmust not take sides. In other words, he would prevent what we are doing \nright now.\n  The question for the strategy of the United States in taking sides is \nrepeated in section 6 of Senator Kennedy's amendment. I do not believe \nit is appropriate to direct foreign policy or military strategy through \na reporting requirement on an appropriations bill.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Warner sit on the Armed Services \nCommittee. That is where policy is discussed. I do not think this is \nthe way the Senate should do business.\n  We are in a situation tonight where having had this discussion at \nlength on\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\nthe other matter, I think too many Members of the Senate have not heard \nthis debate and probably will come and say: What's going on?\n  The clear answer has to be that we should not dictate policy--\nparticularly military policy--in an appropriations bill. We provide the \nfunding for whatever policies are already established by law, by \nregulation, by the Commander in Chief. This is something that requires \nthe determination of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, \nand the President to set military policy.\n  There is a constitutional question involved here, in my opinion, in \nterms of what Senator Kennedy wants to do. He wants to set up a \nsituation whereby the Department of Defense has to decide if there is a \ncivil war going on and if there is, then it has a set of procedures \nthat must be followed. If they decide a civil war is not going on, \nthere is another set of procedures that must be followed.\n  As a practical matter, what he is saying is reports such as this \nshould come to the Senate quarterly and they should tell us in advance \nwhat are they going to do for the next quarter. In terms of military \nstrategy and what we are doing over there, for those of us who have \nbeen there repeatedly, it is not possible to do that.\n  I certainly believe Senator Warner outlined the whole concept of \ncivil war very clearly. You can call it a civil war if you want, but \nthe question is, when you put it into an amendment that demands we have \na report to assess a finding by the Department, which it must make \nwhether or not there is a civil war going on, and then give it \ninstructions based on how it makes that decision, I think, is \nmicromanaging the Defense Department. If there is one thing we should \nnot do on an appropriations bill is try to micromanage the Defense \nDepartment.\n  I urge the Senate not to support this amendment. I do believe the \nreports we are getting right now give us some measurement of what is \ngoing on, and on the basis of that let's make judgments which we should \nmake. For instance, this bill measures progress toward a democratic \nIraq.\n  It describes the obstacles toward political progress, and it gives us \na comparison of the situation in individual Iraqi homes.\n  It tells us about the black market in Iraq and how it might affect \nwhat we are doing over there.\n  It discusses the al-Qaida influence in Iraq and the recent \ndevelopments in the security environment.\n  This is a very extensive report. Like a lot of reports, it comes to \nus quarterly, Mr. President, but not a lot of people pay attention to \nit. We do. If you look at our bill, we prepared, on the basis of the \nlast report, a continuation of the concept of what they should do in \nterms of improving these reports for the coming period.\n  I do hope the Senate will support our position that this is not the \nway to go, that this is not the thing to do.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one can argue about the definition of a \ncivil war, but what I am talking about is the concern of the commanders \non the ground in Iraq. This is what GEN Rick Sanchez, former commander \nof the multinational forces in Iraq, said on January 7:\n\n       The country is on the verge of civil war.\n\n  GEN Peter Pace on March 13:\n\n       Everything is in place if they want to have a civil war.\n\n  Ambassador Khalilzad is concerned about the threat, March 7:\n\n       The potential is there for sectarian violence to become a \n     civil war.\n\n  General Abizaid before the Armed Services Committee on August 3:\n\n       I believe the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I \n     have seen it in Baghdad, and if not stopped, it is possible \n     Iraq could move toward civil war.\n\n  General Pace the same day:\n\n       I do believe we have the possibility of devolving into \n     civil war.\n\n  Here we have Newsweek magazine, August 14:\n\n       The Bush administration insists Iraq is a long way from \n     civil war but the contingency planning has already begun. . . \n     .\n\n  Now, the Senator from Alaska says let's look at the most recent \nreport from the Defense Department that we received September 1. Let's \nlook at it. What does it say?\n\n       Concern about civil war within the Iraqi civilian \n     populations among defense analysts increased in recent \n     months. Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in \n     Iraq.\n\n  And it continues:\n\n       Conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq, \n     specifically in and around Baghdad. Concerns about civil war \n     within the Iraqi civilian populations increased in recent \n     months.\n\n  All we are asking for is a plan to protect our troops. What are the \nrules of engagement if there is a civil war? That is the issue. That is \nthe question. That is the information they ought to have, the families \nought to have, and the American people ought to have. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  The White House evidently is concerned, according to news reports. \nGenerals on the ground are concerned about it. The Defense Department's \nown report is concerned about it. All we want to do is let Congress \nknow and let us have the kind of planning that is going to provide the \ngreatest protection for American troops on the ground should there be a \ncivil war. Rules of engagement--that is all this amendment does. And it \ndoes seem to me when we are talking about plans--we heard a great deal \nof debate about policy today. This is about a plan to protect American \ntroops. That is what this amendment is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I disagree. This amendment is about \nchanging the report requirements we have had in the past and that we \nhave in this bill now. And we have had a satisfactory report.\n  If one looks at the report, there is no question there are attitudes \nin Iraq that indicate this may turn into a civil war. There is no \nquestion that is one of the major problems facing us today. To put on \nthe Secretary of Defense the burden of deciding if there is a civil war \nand giving instructions whether there is or not, changing the basis of \nthings we require that are serving us right now--I urge Senators to \nlook at this report. There are graphs in the report. Are you very or \nsomewhat concerned that a civil war might break out? There is great \nworry that it might. We should have that worry. But to force the \nDepartment of Defense to decide when it has turned into a civil war and \ngive specific instructions in case they do make that decision, and if \nthey don't make the decision--of course, that is not what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wants. He wants the decision that there is a civil \nwar, obviously, because that would force a withdrawal.\n  This is very much connected with the debate we just had about the \namendment that was considered to be not in order.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the Senator's amendment. I move to table \nhis amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. Time is up, is it not, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not in order until all \ntime has expired. The majority has 1 minute remaining, and the minority \nhas 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Massachusetts has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the 30 seconds, refer to page 3 of my \namendment. If there is not a civil war, we are still asking for the \nstrategy to protect American troops. If there is a civil war, the \nstrategy ought to be how are we going to protect the Armed Forces of \nthe United States. This is a plan about how to protect American troops \nif there is a civil war, plain and simple.\n  The White House is concerned about it. Newspapers have published that \nthey are concerned about it. We ought to be able to get it, and the \nmembers of the Armed Forces ought to be entitled to that information. \nWe missed too many opportunities in the past. Let's not miss this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back my time. I move to table the amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Menendez) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 233 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4895\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Mikulski has an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes equally divided on the \nMikulski amendment.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is the Mikulski-Sarbanes amendment. \nIt is very straightforward. It eliminates funding for the Army to carry \nout the A-76 effort that eliminates close to 400 jobs at Walter Reed, \nprimarily little people, such as landscapers. Senator Sarbanes and I \nobjected to this contracting out because the process was flawed, \nunfair, and does not save the taxpayer any money.\n  Number 1, it started in the year 2000. It went on and cost $7 million \nto run the process.\n  The Federal employees won it in 2004. The Army changed the bar, \nreissued the solicitation, making up to 1,500 changes. After the \nFederal employees won the contract in September 2004, the Army changed \nthe solicitation.\n  Having spent $7 million, it will now spend $5 million to implement \nit. The Army is about to spend $12 million to save $7 million. Even by \nArmy accounting, that is a bad deal.\n  This process is flawed. It is unfair. It did not go by the rules. It \ndoes not save the taxpayers money. We urge the agreement of the \nMikulski-Sarbanes amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, very briefly, no one would argue there are \nactivities which are inherently governmental and should be performed by \nthe Government. However, the Government should not engage in activities \nwhich are already offered in the private sector.\n  I am here today to share my opposition to the Mikulski amendment. If \nagreed to, this amendment would roll back a completed public-private \njob competition at Walter Reed Army Hospital. This job competition was \nwon fair and square by the private sector because it proved to be more \nefficient and will save the taxpayers $32 million over the next 5 \nyears. Furthermore, it was subject to intense review and investigation \nby the Army and the GAO, all upholding the Army decision to move \nforward to award to the private sector.\n  Opponents are not happy with the outcome. They appealed and lost; \nthey appealed again and lost. Now they have appealed the contract award \nto Congress by offering this amendment. Congress is not in the business \nof awarding contracts. This amendment is bad policy and bad precedent.\n  Competitive sourcing is not about outsourcing or offshoring. It is \nabout competition. It is the useful tool that utilizes competition to \nallow Federal agencies to evaluate whether certain functions shall be \nperformed in the future by Federal employees of the private sector. We \nought to continue to evaluate programs and activities and whether the \nFederal Government should be doing these kinds of things. This is \nessentially true if the Government is involved in activities that are \navailable to the private sector.\n  It is my longstanding view that if a service is available to the \nprivate sector, there better be a darn good reason why the Government \nis doing it. In most cases, it simply is not right for the Federal \nGovernment to be doing things that could be done by Main Street \nbusiness.\n  But the Federal Government is engaged in activity already offered in \nsmall business.\n  If this language prevails, it will undermine a portion of the \nadministration's competitive sourcing program. With the continuing war \non terror, the Army must have extra savings to meet its daily needs. \nThe private sector will be discouraged from bidding on future \ncompetitions if the Congress demonstrates an effort to reverse \nlegitimate acquisition decisions.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself a minute and a half.\n  Mr. President, I listened very carefully to my able colleague from \nWyoming. I don't quarrel with a lot of what he says, but this process \nwas absolutely flawed. This was not a fair process. The rules were \nconstantly being changed. If we are going to have competitive sourcing, \nit ought to be done according to the rules, with a respect for the \ncompetitive bidding process. That didn't happen here.\n  This was put out for bid in June of 2000. It is now September of \n2006. Under current law, none of these competitions can go on for more \nthan 3 years. In 2004, the Federal employees won this competition. And \nthe Army came back and changed the solicitation and put in new \nrequirements for the bids. It is totally unfair, what is happening \nhere. I respect the competitive bidding process, but there has to be \nsome integrity to it. It has to have some decency to it. That is \ntotally lacking in this situation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I normally would agree with the Senator \nfrom Maryland, but the comments that were made are really not correct.\n  This has been reviewed by third-party entities, including the \nGovernment Accountability Office. We received a final report on May 30, \n2006. The Department of Defense strongly opposes the amendment. If the \nlanguage prevails, it will undermine the competitive sourcing program.\n  They have learned a lot about using A-76 on an enormous entity like \nthe Walter Reed Hospital, but this amendment would preclude the Army \nfrom implementing a contract which has been reviewed three times and \nhas been agreed to by the GAO.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 2 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let's talk about taxpayers, since this is supposed to \ninherently do something or other, saving money to fight terrorism.\n  This started in 2000, as Senator Sarbanes said. The Army spent $7 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\nto defeat their own Federal employees. They spent $7 million in 6 \nyears. Boy, how about that? These are the little people, the \nlandscapers. Thank God they had the AFGE behind them.\n  Then, after spending $7 million and changing the rules--and with the \nlast set of specs, they had 1,500 amendments; imagine if we had 1,500 \namendments--what we now find is they are going to have to spend another \n$5 million to implement the savings. So they are going to spend $12 \nmillion when the original goal was to save $7 million. Come on. If we \nare fighting terrorism and saving money, let's leave Walter Reed alone. \nIt is going to be closed in a couple years because of BRAC. Let the \nlandscapers do their job. Let the doctors and nurses do their job. \nLet's do our job and pass the Mikulski-Sarbanes amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The delay in this matter really came about--there is no \nquestion there is a serious delay--as it was reviewed and upheld on two \noccasions. These are third-party entities that did the review, \nincluding the GAO. We should not upset a process that has taken so long \nand is finalized now.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and move to table the Senator's \namendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Menendez) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment to honor the \nmemory of a fallen Coloradan: Army Cpl Christopher Franklin Sitton of \nMontrose.\n  Corporal Sitton was a medic with the 10th Mountain Division, serving \nin Afghanistan since March. He had just turned 21 and graduated from \nMontrose High School just 3 years ago. Now, instead of having his whole \nlife ahead of him, he has been taken from his friends, family and \ncountry by a roadside bomb in Kunar, in eastern Afghanistan.\n  Chris Sitton was looking forward to a medical career. His interest in \nmedicine reached back to his childhood, where as a young man in \nQuinlan, TX he would accompany his father, a volunteer with a rescue \ngroup, on emergency calls.\n  Corporal Sitton's time in the Army was marked by excellence, not \nunlike his time in high school. Secialist Sitton entered the Army \nnearly 3 years ago, in January 2004. In his service, Specialist Sitton \nreceived three commander's coins, recognizing his exemplary performance \nin the Army. One was personally handed to him by a four-star general.\n  This achievement is remarkable to many but not to those who knew \nChristopher Sitton. Chris was a natural leader. A standout track star, \nhe is pictured mentoring a younger teammate in a photo that hangs in \nhis high school track coach's office. Young people naturally gravitated \nto him, and Chris returned their enthusiasm with a smile one friend \ndescribed as big as Texas itself.\n  As a young man, Chris Sitton was an accomplished Eagle Scout. He was \nan avid athlete, a musician and outdoorsman, enjoying his time hiking, \nskiing and camping. But perhaps most notable, Chris Sitton left a mark \non those around him as someone who was always helping others, putting \nthem before himself.\n  GEN Douglas MacArthur once reflected, ``The soldier, above all other \npeople, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds \nand scars.'' Chris' legacy as a son, friend and mentor, his willingness \nto put others before himself, shows how fundamentally he understood \nthis calling to find a better tomorrow. Corporal Sitton sought to make \nthe world a better place in his every action, to bring us to a better \nunderstanding of the ties that bind humanity together.\n  To Corporal Sitton's parents, Judy and Steve Sitton, I know that no \nwords can ease the grief you feel at the loss of your son. I and this \nentire Nation share, in some small way, your painful sorrow. Corporal \nChristopher Sitton and his entire family will reside in my prayers \ntonight and remain in my thoughts.\n\n\n                   Marine Corporal Jordan C. Pierson\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine \nCpl Jordan C. Pierson of Milford, CT.\n  Corporal Pierson, a member of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 25th \nMarine Regiment, 4th Marine Division 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, was \nkilled in action on August 24 while conducting combat operations \nagainst anti-Iraqi forces in Al Anbar Province. He was shot while on \nfoot patrol. He had been previously awarded the Purple Heart for wounds \nto his arms and legs by shrapnel from an insurgent's grenade 3 months \nprior.\n  Having delayed his education at the University of Connecticut, \nCorporal Pierson joined the Marine Corps in December 2003. It seems to \nbe apparent by the many recollections of his friends and family that \nJordan had already proven himself a leader. They recount many of the \nhigh-spirited exploits that he both engineered and led. However, his \nwily deeds quickly gave way to an outstanding performance as a marine \ndevoted to his comrades and mission.\n  He is fondly remembered as a brilliant light and strong leader with \nstrength of character and self assurance, persistently watching out for \nhis fellow marines. He is described best by his first sergeant: \n``Corporal Pierson had been a bright spot in his platoon, in a place, \nthat can take the softest of hearts into a void of darkness. Even when \nthe gloom of combat reached deep in a man's soul, Corporal Pierson \ncould bring the Marine back to a sense\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nof purpose, a sense of why we were here, and that we were making a \ndifference. Corporal Pierson was destined not to only be a Marine, but \na leader among Marines. He fostered a sense of caring for Marines while \nstill embodying all it meant to be a Marine.''\n  Corporal Jordan Pierson was a true patriot and defender of our great \nNation's principles of freedom of justice. He served as an example of \nthe potent American spirit, which permeates this Nation's history. I am \nboth proud and grateful that we have the kind of defender exemplified \nby Corporal Pierson serving our great Nation.\n  Our Nation extends its heartfelt condolences to his family. To his \nfather Eric, his mother Beverly, and brother Ethan, we extend our \nprofound gratitude for sharing this outstanding marine with us, and we \noffer our prayers and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9036-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues a bill that could have a significant impact on the \nfamily budgets of millions of American households. H.R. 5252, the \nCommunications Act of 2006, passed by the Senate Commerce Committee in \nJune is that bill.\n  H.R. 5252 is an important piece of proconsumer legislation. It \nreforms the cable franchising process to permit competition to \nincumbent cable companies. The result will be competition in the \ndelivery of cable television services to all our constituents.\n  While prices for Internet access and wireless service continue to \nfall, cable bills continue to climb and climb--in fact, according to \nthe Federal Communications Commission, those bills have shot up more \nthan 86 percent over the past decade. Millions of Americans have no \nchoice when it comes to their video provider.\n  H.R. 5252 will change that by bringing real competition and giving \nconsumers the ability to choose who provides their video programming. \nThis is something consumers want and deserve. Competition brings lower \nprices and consumers win. Competition brings improved customer \nservice--and consumers win. Competition results in service providers \nseeking to serve narrower segments of the marketplace--and consumers \nwin.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that the enactment of this \nlegislation will save consumers billions of dollars a year. In the few \nmarkets where video providers have successfully negotiated franchise \nagreements--for instance, in parts of Florida, Texas and Virginia--\nconsumers have benefited greatly.\n  According to a recent Bank of America study, in those aforementioned \nareas, cable bills have fallen by 28 to 42 percent--a savings of as \nmuch as $264 per year for cable customers.\n  And a recent Phoenix Center report estimates that each year Congress \ndelays cable franchise reform, it costs American consumers $8.2 billion \nin unrecoverable losses from increased cable rates. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Furthermore, according to the same report, this means that Florida \nconsumers are losing $626 million each year. That is a significant \namount of money coming out of the pockets of my fellow Floridians. We \nhave the power to change this. Consumers in every State will continue \nto lose money if we do not act now.\n  This issue is too important for us to ignore. We all know and \nunderstand that technology is changing each and every day--and yet our \nNation's telecom laws have not been updated in 10 years.\n  The United States is the world leader in creating new and innovative \ntechnologies and we are at the forefront of bringing these new \ntechnologies to the marketplace. Sadly though, when it comes to \nbroadband deployment, the U.S. currently ranks 16th in the world.\n  We need to act today to update our Nation's telecom laws and bring \nmore choice and competition to the marketplace. Our economy needs it \nand consumers are demanding it.\n  I know the Senate Calendar is packed with important legislation which \nwe must complete prior to adjourning. But the video choice legislation \nwill affect every single household in America. It will bring \ncompetition to the video programming marketplace, and bring the \nbenefits of competition to all of our constituents, whether or not they \nsubscribe to cable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of Senator Stevens to \nbring this legislation before us.\n  As far as this legislation is concerned, time is money. Change is \nlong overdue, and we are eager to help our fellow Americans keep more \nof their hard earned money.\n  We in this Chamber have a responsibility to get this legislation \npassed sooner, rather than later, so that our constituents can start \nsaving more today, not tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9036-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WAYNE S. FENTON, M.D.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Wayne S. \nFenton, M.D., Director of the Division of Adult Translational Research \nand Associate Director for Clinical Affairs at the National Institute \nof Mental Health who was tragically murdered on September 3, 2006.\n  Dr. Fenton was a man truly passionate about working with the most \nsevere mentally ill population. He was a compassionate and tireless \nadvocate for people with mental illness and the families so desperately \ntrying to help them. He went above and beyond the call of duty and \ncontinued a private practice outside of his work at the National \nInstitute of Mental Health. In his private practice, Dr. Fenton readily \ntreated patients with the most severe mental illnesses, very often ones \nthat other psychiatrists refused to see. These are the patients who are \nmost likely to commit horrific crimes when they do not take necessary \nmedication.\n  Just last week, I participated in a panel discussion regarding \nwhether the State of New Mexico should enact an assisted outpatient \ntreatment, AOT, program that requires a court ordered treatment for \nthose who are severely mentally ill. It is time we focus on this issue \nat a State and national level. Dr. Fenton's death should not be in \nvain; we cannot continue along a path that not only does not help the \nsuffering, but continues to hurt the community. This is a challenging \ntopic to take on and a hard discussion to have but we must start \naddressing the link between untreated mental illness and violence or we \nrun the risk of seeing more horrific deaths.\n  Outside of his work and private practice, Dr. Fenton worked with many \ngroups including the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, and the World Psychiatric \nAssociation. He served as Deputy Editor of Schizophrenia Bulletin and \nas a consultant to the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division. On \nnumerous occasions he was nominated as one of the Best Doctors in \nAmerica. He was a leader in the field of mental health research, \nparticularly relating to the study of schizophrenia. Dr. Fenton \nauthored many textbook chapters and more than fifty scientific papers \non diagnosing, treatment, and mental health service methods for \nindividuals who suffer from schizophrenia. His central goal was to \ncreate a treatment system to allow even those suffering from the most \nsevere mental illness to become functioning members of society.\n  Dr. Fenton's death truly is a great loss to the mental health \ncommunity. In the words of Dr. Thomas Insel, Director of NIMH, ``It is \ndifficult to grasp such a tragic, shocking loss; a loss not only for \nhis many friends and family but for people with serious mental illness \neverywhere.'' As advocates for people with mental illness, and mental \nhealth policy, my wife Nancy and I had the pleasure to work with him \nover the years. I am extremely saddened by his tragic death. I want to \nextend my thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and coworkers at \nthis time. It is my hope they remember the great impact he made during \nhis time with us. I express my deepest sympathy to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9036-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9036-S9037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JAMES O'GARA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, prior to the August recess, the Senate sent \nthe nomination of James O'Gara to be the Deputy Director for Supply \nReduction at the Office of National Drug Control Policy back to the \nWhite House for reconsideration. Mr. O'Gara's nomination was strongly \nopposed by Senators on both sides of the aisle, which prevented it even \nfrom being reported out\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nof the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, the White House has returned \nMr. O'Gara's nomination for confirmation. As such, I am using this \nopportunity to, again, remind the President of the objections that law \nenforcement and many Members of this body have to the policies and the \nleadership at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In so doing, \nit is my hope that the administration will change course and develop \nand implement strategies that will address the drug problems facing our \ncommunities, such as the spread of methamphetamine.\n  More than 20 years ago I began working to create an Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy because I believed then, as I believe now, \nthat we needed a Cabinet-level official who would coordinate Federal \ndrug policy and be publicly accountable for developing and implementing \nan effective national strategy. I believe the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy is an important office, and I take matters related to it \nvery seriously.\n  When our current drug czar, John Walters, came for a vote before this \nbody in 2001, I opposed his nomination because I did not believe he was \nthe right man for the job.\n  Unfortunately, my fears have been borne out. During his tenure, John \nWalters has been reticent to acknowledge the methamphetamine problem \nthat is plaguing small communities nationwide, preferring to focus \nalmost exclusively on marijuana. He recommended to the President that \nthe highly popular and highly effective High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Program, which funds drug enforcement task forces, be cut by 56 \npercent and relegated to the Department of Justice. And under his \nleadership, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has essentially \nwalled itself off from consultation and dialogue with external drug \npolicy experts including treatment professionals, prevention \nspecialists, and State and local law enforcement officials.\n  Those are just a few of the many examples of Mr. Walters' missteps. \nUnder him, the office operates like an ivory tower rather than the \ncommand center for our national drug control policy.\n  This past year, together with many of my Republican colleagues, I \nfought to prevent James O'Gara--a colleague of Mr. Walters since 1989--\nfrom becoming the Deputy Director for Supply Reduction. Together, they \nhave coauthored policy articles expressing their shared drug policy \nviews. Given the misgivings that many of us have about how Mr. Walters \nhas run the Office of National Drug Control Policy, I would likely have \na difficult time voting to give a promotion to any member of his inner \ncircle. But that is not the only reason why many of us opposed Mr. \nO'Gara's nomination.\n  Perhaps most troubling is that Mr. O'Gara, who was nominated for a \nposition which has authority over international drug control, foreign \nand domestic drug intelligence, and interdiction, does not have the \nconfidence of law enforcement.\n  In letters to Senator Specter and Senator Leahy expressing their \nstrong opposition to the O'Gara nomination, law enforcement has \nexpressed its strong opposition. The National Narcotics Officers \nAssociation wrote that:\n\n       Mr. O'Gara lacks an operational understanding of a critical \n     issue involved in supply reduction, has no operational \n     background in supply reduction or drug control, and most \n     importantly is not trusted by his constituents in the drug \n     enforcement, prevention and treatment fields. All of this \n     makes him unqualified and unable to effectively lead the \n     coordination of supply reduction initiatives in accordance \n     with the National Drug Control Strategy.\n\n  The letter from the HIDTA Directors states that:\n\n       Based on our collective 1,000+ years of law enforcement \n     experience, we believe Mr. O'Gara lacks the qualifications \n     and abilities necessary to coordinate our nation's supply \n     reduction initiatives effectively. We believe his lack of \n     experience and inability and/or unwillingness to collaborate \n     with a variety of stakeholders has resulted in the \n     formulation of three National Drug Control Strategy documents \n     that do not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement, \n     treatment, and prevention professionals; lack specific and \n     measurable objectives; and insufficiently address some of the \n     most pressing drug threats facing our country today, \n     including methamphetamine.\n\n  By returning this nomination, it is my hope--together with many of my \nRepublican colleagues--that the administration will reconsider and \nrescind this nomination.\n  State and local law enforcement accounts for more than 90% of drug-\nrelated arrests. During a time when assistance for State and local law \nenforcement has been slashed, it is essential that the leadership of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy have the confidence of local \nofficials. Mr. O'Gara lacks this support. Moreover, Mr. Walters and Mr. \nO'Gara have alienated State and local law enforcement, drug prevention \nand treatment professionals, as well as many members of Congress.\n  As the scourge of methamphetamine continues to ravage middle America, \nit is essential that the policies adopted and the personnel appointed \nby the administration have the confidence of the drug enforcement \ncommunity. President Bush could take a huge step in this direction by \nrescinding the nomination of Mr. O'Gara and consulting with local law \nenforcement to appoint an individual who could win the bipartisan \nsupport of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9037-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RECOGNIZING THE CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING--FRESNO\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, last week, an excellent article in \nthe New York Times of August 29 detailed the renaissance of Pittsfield, \nMA, which has adopted a bold economic revitalization strategy centered \non the arts and historic preservation involving the restoration of the \npopular Colonial Theater of a century ago. Pittsfield mayor James \nRuberto and the entire Pittsfield community came together behind this \nbold vision, which received major encouragement a decade ago when the \ntheater was included as part of First Lady and now Senator Hillary \nRodham Clinton's highly effective Save America's Treasures tour.\n  The Colonial Theater certainly qualified as an American Treasure. The \nrestored theater reopened on August 29 to wide acclaim, and I am proud \nof all that the mayor and the community have accomplished. This \nrecognition of their efforts is eminently well-deserved, and I believe \nall of our colleagues in Congress will be interested in Pittsfield's \nextraordinary achievement. I commend Mayor Ruberto and the people of \nPittsfield for a job well done, and I ask that the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From The New York Times, Aug. 29, 2006]\n\n           A City Plots Its Future By Reaching Into the Past\n\n                         (By Hubert B. Herring)\n\n       Arts-minded visitors to the Berkshire Hills in western \n     Massachusetts may think of Pittsfield as little more than an \n     urban speed\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n     bump on the way to Stockbridge, Williamstown and the glories \n     of Tanglewood and Jacob's Pillow.\n       But the city is betting that, with the help of a long-\n     neglected jewel of a theater, it too can make a place for \n     itself on the region's arts map. After a two-year, $22 \n     million restoration, the century-old Colonial Theater will \n     reopen tonight for a year-round season that kicks off with a \n     week's visit by a touring company of ``Rent.'' After that, \n     there are more than 40 other events scheduled for the rest of \n     the year.\n       For years, few outsiders were aware of what lay behind the \n     neo-Classical yellow-brick facade on the Route 7 commercial \n     strip. But inside was a grand Broadway-style theater, a \n     Gilded Age monument designed by J.B. McElfatrick, who \n     designed dozens of New York theaters, including the Theater \n     Republic (now the New Victory) on 42nd Street.\n       From its opening in 1903 to the early 30s, the house, which \n     seated about 1,400, was a regular stop for the likes of Sarah \n     Bernhardt, the Barrymores, Rachmaninoff, Will Rogers and John \n     Philip Sousa. Anna Pavlova danced by, as did the Ziegfeld \n     Follies (100 strong).\n       In 1937, the Colonial was converted into a movie palace, \n     but by 1952 it had gone dark. It was saved from demolition \n     only because a local businessman, George Miller, bought it \n     and housed his paint business inside.\n       The idea of transforming the city into a cultural center \n     received a boost in 1998, when Hillary Rodham Clinton, then \n     the first lady, visited the Colonial as part of a ``Save \n     America's Treasures'' tour.\n       ``Her visit said, `You have a national treasure--it's worth \n     fighting for,' '' said John Bissell, a senior vice president \n     at the Greylock Federal Credit Union and a prominent figure \n     in the move to revitalize Pittsfield.\n       In 2002, the city commissioned a study on the potential \n     economic benefits of restoring the theater. The study, led by \n     Stephen Sheppard, an economics professor at Williams College, \n     forecast $2 million a year in direct economic benefits to \n     Pittsfield and an increase in local property values of at \n     least $23 million.\n       That study ``quantified what we felt instinctively, that \n     the theater would indeed make economic sense,'' said James M. \n     Ruberto, Pittsfield's mayor and a major force behind the \n     renovation.\n       After Mrs. Clinton's visit and the study, of course, came \n     the fund-raising. Ultimately, some $7 million came from \n     donations, the rest from city, state and federal grants and \n     tax credits.\n       ``I have been amazed at the amount of money given to the \n     Colonial,'' said Gary Scarafoni, a retired banker who is now \n     the theater's president.\n       The theater itself was a shambles, said Tom Johnson of \n     Martinez & Johnson, the Washington architects responsible for \n     the restoration. In the half-darkness of the balcony, ``you \n     could see the plaster detailing,'' big pieces of which were \n     starting to fall.\n       Now, the curves and curlicues of the interior \n     ornamentation--which Mr. Johnson describes as eclectic neo-\n     Classical--have been restored to their original glory.\n       But the renovation remains a gamble. David W. Fleming, \n     recently hired as the theater's executive director, said that \n     the Colonial would have an annual overhead of at least \n     $750,000 and expected artists' fees, marketing and stagehand \n     costs collectively to fall in the same range.\n       That means, said Mr. Fleming, who previously ran the Grand \n     Opera House in Wilmington, Del., and the New Brunswick \n     Cultural Center in New Jersey, that the theater will need to \n     fill about 60 percent of its seats if it is to pay half its \n     annual expenses from ticket sales.\n       ``Ideally,'' he said, ``I'd like to see us cover more like \n     65 percent''--with the rest coming from annual donations.\n       He said he hoped that within a few years, the theater, now \n     reconfigured to seat 810, would be active 200 nights a year, \n     with events that appeal to all tastes and budgets. This \n     season's offerings include low-priced fare like Cirkus \n     Inferno and the Inflatable Theater Company.\n       The theater will have to rely in part on out-of-town \n     audiences. The city's population, roughly 57,000 in 1960, \n     fell steadily after General Electric, which once employed \n     more than 10,000 workers here, gradually shut down most of \n     its operations, paring the workforce to less than 1,000. The \n     population is now 43,000 and is projected to fall \n     considerably further in the next two decades.\n       The city is betting that, if it can transform itself into \n     an arts center, it can reverse that slide. It took a first \n     step in that direction when the highly regarded Barrington \n     Stage Company moved into a renovated 1912 music hall in \n     downtown Pittsfield this month after working for years out of \n     a high school auditorium in Sheffield, in the southwest \n     corner of the state. The company plans spring, summer and \n     fall productions.\n       Mr. Bissell of the credit union argues that people will \n     come, not only to visit but also to live. He cites the rise \n     of the local real estate market since the Colonial \n     restoration project was announced.\n       ``When new businesses come to town,'' he added, ``every \n     single one cites the rebirth of the Colonial as a primary \n     reason why they chose this location.''\n       Such optimism is not universal. Jonathan Levine, publisher \n     of The Pittsfield Gazette, said that while he was ``thrilled \n     to have a renovated theater,'' he questioned the business \n     projections behind it.\n       ``They've made all these economic development promises,'' \n     Mr. Levine said, ``and there is no way, with their current \n     programming, they can achieve those goals.''\n       But the Colonial can boast of something that half of every \n     Broadway audience can only dream about. The theater bought an \n     abutting property that will house, in addition to the main \n     entrance, a gigantic ladies' room.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9038-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF MATTHEW S. COSTA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of \nMatthew S. Costa, an outstanding young man from Cheshire, CT who died \ntragically on September 3. I am very saddened to hear of Matthew's \ndeath and will be keeping his friends and family in my thoughts and \nprayers during this difficult time.\n  At the time of his death Matthew was serving in Mali as a volunteer \nfor the U.S. Peace Corps. Matthew enrolled in the Peace Corps in 2003 \nand had been serving in the Malian village of Kati since November 2005, \nafter teaching English in Chad for 2 years.\n  While in Kati, Matthew helped foster one of the Peace Corps core \nmissions, fostering cultural exchange, by fully immersing himself in \nthe local community. He taught English to local high school students \nand organized training for other teachers in the community. He was also \nwidely known in the community as the host of a popular radio program \nthat played popular American music and then worked with the radio \nstation to improve its marketing strategy. Matthew also sought to \ninvolve himself with the village community by playing in a local soccer \nleague and helping to distribute donations of sports equipment.\n  What I think was truly remarkable about Matthew is that after \ngraduating from Tulane University in 2003, a time in which there must \nhave been unlimited opportunities open for Matthew to pursue, he chose \nto delay any future career plans to help others and broaden his \ncultural understanding. Matthew volunteered to travel many miles from \nhome and, if necessary, to give up many of the modern conveniences we \noften take for granted. Matthew liked it so much, that in 2005 he \nextended his service. Matthew's sacrifice and dedication is truly \ninspiring.\n  The passing of Matthew Costa is truly a loss for the Peace Corps, for \nthe people of Mali, and for Connecticut. May his selfless devotion to \nhelping others live on in the hearts and minds of those who knew him \nbest and were served by his good works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9038-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9038-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9038-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9038-S9039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT OF \n                             2006''--PM 55\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit for the consideration of the Congress draft legislation \nentitled the ``Military Commissions Act of 2006.'' This draft \nlegislation responds to the Supreme Court of the United States decision \nin Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006), by establishing for the \nfirst time in our Nation's history a comprehensive statutory structure \nfor military commissions that would allow for the fair and effective \nprosecution of captured members of al Qaeda and other unlawful enemy \ncombatants. The Act also addresses the Supreme Court's holding that \nCommon Article 3 of the Geneva\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nConventions applies to the conflict with al Qaeda by providing \ndefinitions rooted in United States law for the standards of conduct \nprescribed by Common Article 3.\n  The military commission procedures contained in this draft \nlegislation reflect the result of an extended deliberation both within \nthe executive branch and between representatives of my Administration \nand Members of Congress. The draft legislation would establish a Code \nof Military Commissions that tracks the courts-martial procedures of \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice, but that departs from those \nprocedures where they would be impracticable or inappropriate for the \ntrial of unlawful enemy combatants captured in the midst of an ongoing \narmed conflict, under circumstances far different from those typically \nencountered by military prosecutors.\n  Five years after the mass murders of 9/11, it is time for the United \nStates to begin to prosecute captured al Qaeda members for the serious \ncrimes that many of them have committed against United States citizens \nand our allies abroad. As we provide terrorists the justice and due \nprocess that they denied their victims, we demonstrate that our Nation \nremains committed to the rule of law.\n  I ask that the Congress carefully consider this legislation and \nrespectfully urge its speedy passage for enactment into law.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 301 Commerce Street in Commerce, Oklahoma, as the \n``Mickey Mantle Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of \nthe United States Postal Service located at 301 Commerce Street in \nCommerce, OK as the ``Mickey Mantle Post Office.''\n  Mickey Mantle emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, charity, and \nsportsmanship. He is a shining example of how commitment and dedication \ncan lead to great success. I seek to name the post office in Commerce, \nOK, in Mickey Mantle's honor. He is still known to Commerce by the \nnicknames ``Commerce Comet'' or ``Commerce Kid''.\n  At age 4 Mickey Mantle moved with his family to Commerce where he \ngrew up, having been born in Spavinaw, OK. By his father who was an \namateur player and fervent fan, Mickey Mantle was named in honor of \nMickey Cochrane, the Hall of Fame catcher from the Detroit Tigers.\n  Signing with the New York Yankees in 1949, Mantle made his Major \nLeague Debut in 1951. He played his entire Major League career with the \nYankees. He was a twenty-time All Star and named American League MVP \nthree times. Mantle was a part of 12 pennant winners and 7 World \nChampionship clubs. Some of Mantle's records still hold today. He holds \nthe record for most World Series home runs (18), runs batted in (40), \nruns (42), walks (43), extra-base hits (26), and total bases (123).\n  Mantle announced his retirement on March 1, 1969. He actually retired \non Mickey Mantle Day, June 8, 1969. In addition to the retirement of \nhis uniform number 7, Mantle was given a plaque that would hang on the \ncenter field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the monuments to Babe Ruth, \nLou Gehrig and Miller Huggins. In 1974, as soon as he was eligible, he \nwas inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame demonstrating his \nimportance to baseball and community.\n  Sadly, Mickey Mantle's father died of cancer at the age of 39, just \nas his son was starting his career. Mantle said one of the great \nheartaches of his life was that he never told his father he loved him.\n  After a bout with liver cancer himself, Mickey Mantle was given a few \nprecious extra weeks of life due to a liver transplant. The baseball \ngreat was overwhelmed by the selfless gift of a liver from a stranger; \ntherefore, Mickey became determined to give something back at the end \nof his life. Thus, in 1995, the year he died, the Mickey Mantle \nFoundation was established to promote organ and tissue donation, and \nMickey Mantle will be remembered for something more than his heroic \nbaseball career.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nas we commemorate an outstanding athlete so that future generations \nwill be as inspired by his example of sportsmanship and charity as we \nhave been.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 3846. A bill to provide for the establishment and maintenance of \nelectronic personal health records for individuals and family members \nenrolled in Federal employee health benefits plans under chapter 89 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof a piece of legislation that Senator Voinovich of Ohio and I have \nworked on for a while. It is called the Federal Employees Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act of 2006. This bill makes available--or \nwould make available--electronic personal health records for every \nenrollee of a Federal health benefits plan who wishes to have one. That \nis, potentially, as many as 8 million people. That includes those of us \nwho work in Federal agencies, large and small, across the country and, \nactually, around the world. It includes their families and includes \nFederal retirees and their families as well.\n  Our health care sector is the most innovative in the world, but it \nhas not kept up with the information age. Our excessive reliance on \npaper record keeping makes our health care system less efficient, more \ncostly, and more prone to mistakes. Expanding the use of health \ninformation technology shows promise as a way to improve both the cost \nand the quality of health care in our country.\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\n  In 2004, the United States spent some $1.9 trillion on health care \ncosts.\n  That is more than any other industrialized country on this planet. In \n2005, health care premiums continued their upward trend, increasing by \nan average, I am told, of some 9 percent. We are literally spending \ntrillions of dollars on health care, but I am sorry to say we are not \ngetting the gold standard of treatment or results.\n  A 2005 survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, a private \nfoundation that focuses on improving health care, found that medical \nerror reports rates in the United States far exceed those of western \ncountries. In that survey, one in three Americans reported getting the \nwrong dosage of medication, incorrect test results, mistakes in \ntreatment, or late notification of test results. That is nearly 15 \npercent higher than similar results in Britain and Germany.\n  I believe some of the problems--though certainly not all of them--can \nbe blamed on the fact that health care providers don't have full and \nreal-time access to patients' medical records. Doctors in this country \nwait days sometimes for couriers to deliver lab tests or x rays. They \ndiagnose patients without knowing their full medical history, what they \nare allergic to, what kinds of surgeries they have had, or whether they \nhave complained about similar symptoms before.\n  Time constraints, or medical necessity, often force doctors to \nperform a quick diagnosis. Sometimes that diagnosis wrong. Sometimes \nthose errors prove to be costly. The widespread use of health \ninformation technology, the ability to immediately access one's full \nmedical history from a computer, can help doctors and nurses provide \nbetter care less expensively. It has the potential to dramatically \ntransform the way we provide health care in America--saving lives, \nsaving costs.\n  If we are looking for success stories on how health care \nprofessionals have integrated the use of electronic health care records \ninto their daily routines, we don't have to look any further than our \nown Department of Defense and our Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Times have changed since I retired from the Navy some 15 years ago. I \nremember that as an ensign I used to carry my medical health records in \na brown manila folder from duty station to duty station--from the time \nI left Ohio State, on to Pensacola, Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, \nout to California, across the seas and back again, and, finally, \ngetting off of active duty and coming to Delaware to enroll in graduate \nschool, on the GI bill, at the University of Delaware in the business \nschool. I went up the road to the VA hospital. I still had my folder \nwith the records. I turned them in and asked: What kind of benefits am \nI eligible for?\n  Over a decade ago, the Department of Defense and VA decided there was \na better way, and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal. \nToday, when a patient enrolls in the Department of Defense's military \nhealth system, they no longer need the kind of brown manila folder I \ncarried all those years. Instead, we have electronic health care \nrecords to keep track of the medical histories of those who serve our \ncountry in the military. This health record is managed electronically, \nand you don't have to remember to pack it up on your next tour of duty, \nwhether it is in Southeast Asia, or Iraq, or Afghanistan.\n  Instead, one's electronic health care record follows them wherever \nthey go--both during the time they are in the military and when they \nleave and join our veterans community as a veteran.\n  The result is that the Department of Defense and VA have been \nimpressive, especially when you consider that they have only used these \nelectronic health records for about a decade or so.\n  The VA health system has transformed itself from a troubled, \nsometimes bloated and inefficient operation to one of the best health \ncare operations in the country.\n  Researchers and doctors now laud the VA for having the foresight to \nuse electronic health records to improve patient care.\n  What is the cost? That is a good question. It is about $78 per \npatient. That is roughly the cost of not repeating one blood test. In \nother words, it is money well spent.\n  The VA now regularly outperforms Medicare and other private health \nplans when it comes to providing patient care for diabetes, high blood \npressure, and heart attack victims.\n  In January, the National Quality Research Center concluded that for \nthe sixth consecutive year, the VA health care system outranks the \nprivate sector for customer satisfaction.\n  I have witnessed that new-found satisfaction in my own backyard, at \nthe Veterans Medical Center in Elsmere, DE. That is the place I went in \n1973 fresh out of the Navy. Veterans from neighboring States are now \ncoming to our hospital in Elsmere to seek care instead of going to \nregular civilian hospitals near them.\n  In 2004, the Elsmere facility, as well as popular satellite clinics \nin Millsboro and Seaford, DE, served more than 22,000 veterans and had \nmore than 150,000 outpatient visits. Both totals are about 20 percent \nhigher than just 4 years ago.\n\n  Normally, you would think the busier a hospital is, the less \nsatisfied customers are because of longer waits and other hassles. But \nit turned out that the opposite is true. As the workload has climbed, \nso has patient satisfaction. I might add, so has the satisfaction of \nthose providing the care to the patients.\n  More than 85 percent of Delaware's VA outpatients said they were \n``highly satisfied'' with the care they received. Planning is now \nunderway to open a third outpatient clinic for veterans in Kent County \nnext spring--probably in Dover where we have another 15,000 veterans.\n  What is keeping the rest of our Nation's health care system from \nfollowing the lead of the Department of Defense and the VA? The answer \nis the high cost of implementing the latest information technologies, \nas well as the lack of uniformity among various technology products.\n  A physician can spend up to $30,000 implementing an electronic health \nrecords system. A hospital can spend up to five times that amount. If \nthat weren't enough of a reason to say no thanks, there is one more \nreason; that is, we don't have a set of national standards in place to \nmake sure that once health care providers have made the switch, their \nnew system can communicate with the hospital or doctor on the other \nside of town. The result: Only 15 percent of doctors and about 30 \npercent of hospitals have fully functional electronic health care \nsystems today.\n  A new study by a number of health care scholars estimates there will \nbe another 20 years before the majority of physicians are using an \nelectronic health care system.\n  Let me say this. Our Presiding Officer is from Louisiana where they \nwent through a terrible situation a year ago with Katrina. The folks \nwho happened to be civilians and were in hospitals or nursing homes, \nfor the most part, they had paper health records and they were \ndestroyed. The veterans who were on the gulf coast when Katrina \nstruck--either in nursing homes, VA nursing homes, or VA hospitals--\nwere evacuated from the area as civilians were; but when the veterans \ngot to another VA facility inland, or a nursing home, or a VA hospital, \ntheir electronic health records were available immediately, and whoever \nprovided care for them had access to the records and were able to \nprovide excellent care.\n  I am sorry to say that the same wasn't true for the civilians whose \npaper records were largely destroyed at the time of the evacuation.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to rely solely on health care providers \nto bring the health care industry into the 21st century. We must think \noutside of the box and build on the health information technology \nissues already underway in other areas of our health care industry.\n  The Federal Employee Electronic Personal Health Records Act of 2006--\nthe legislation Senator Voinovich and I introduce today--does just \nthat. How? By requiring all carriers that contract with the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program to make available an electronic \npersonal health record for those of us who are enrolled in that \nprogram. As I said earlier, it is some 8 million people.\n  Electronic personal health records will provide enrollees with a tool \nto better access and control their health information. Via the \nInternet, an enrollee will be able to log on to their\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\nelectronic personal health record to keep track of such things as their \nmedications, cholesterol, glucose levels, allergies, and immunization \nrecords.\n  An enrollee will also be able to review a comprehensive, easily \nunderstood listing of their health care claims. Health care providers, \npayers, and enrollees will be able to add this information onto the \nelectronic personal health record. Enrollees will benefit, I believe, \nsignificantly from such a tool.\n  An enrollee can easily share sections of the electronic personal \nhealth record with their health care provider, ensuring that their \nprovider has the most up-to-date and accurate health information when \nmaking clinical decisions.\n  In the case of an emergency, an enrollee can also grant others the \nability to access their electronic personal health record. Again, it is \nthe decision of the patient, the enrollee in the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefits Program, to decide what kind of access to grant to a \nprovider or a member of the family or another person in the wake of an \nemergency.\n  Having health information readily available will increase the \nefficiency and safety of health care for enrollees by eliminating \nunwarranted tests, procedures, and prescriptions.\n  Most important, the legislation ensures that the electronic personal \nhealth records provided for through this act are kept private and \nsecure.\n  The electronic personal health records are required to include a \nnumber of security features. They include, among other things, user \nauthentication and audit trails.\n  The legislation also requires that carriers comply with all privacy \nand security regulations outlined in the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act, which we call HIPAA.\n  Mr. President, what Senator Voinovich and I are introducing today \nwill help demonstrate the importance and utility of health information \ntechnology--not just the importance of the technology but the \nimportance of harnessing the technology--in the delivery of health care \nin this country today. In this case, the potential is as many as 8 \nmillion additional Americans.\n  This bill is designed to jumpstart this new technology by requiring \nsome of the largest health insurance companies to offer these \nelectronic personal health records, which many are beginning to do \ntoday. As more insurance companies, health care providers, and \nconsumers use this new technology, I am convinced that more people will \nrecognize its advantages, and we can more quickly move America's health \ncare industry into the 21st century.\n  We view this initiative as the next necessary step for the Nation's \nlargest employer-sponsored health insurance program that prides itself \non being a model for best practices in health care.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senator Voinovich and me as we \nintroduce this legislation. We look forward to talking with our \ncolleagues about it. With luck, maybe we will have a hearing. Senator \nVoinovich may hold one in his subcommittee this month.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill my \ncolleague Senator Carper and I introduced today, the Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act. The purpose of this legislation is to \nprovide for the establishment and maintenance of electronic personal \nhealth records for individuals and family members enrolled in the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP.\n  The widespread adoption of health information technology, such as \nelectronic health record, (EHR), will revolutionize the health care \nprofession. In fact, the Institute of Medicine, the National Committee \non Vital and Health Statistics, and other expert panels have identified \ninformation technology as one of the most powerful tools in reducing \nmedical errors and improving the quality of care. Unfortunately, our \ncountry's health care industry lags far behind other sectors of the \neconomy in its investment in IT.\n  The Institute of Medicine estimates that there are nearly 98,000 \ndeaths each year resulting from medical errors. Many of these deaths \ncan be directly attributed to the inherent imperfections of our current \npaper-based health care system. This statistic is startling and one \nthat I hope will motivate my colleagues to take a close look at the \ngoals of our legislation.\n  The voluntary EHRs that would be established through the Electronic \nPersonal Health Records Act will provide clinicians with real-time \naccess to their patient's health history. Each EHR would contain claims \ndata, contact information for providers of health care services, and \nother useful information for diagnosis and treatment. The records will \nbe available cost-free to FEHBP participants and will maintain strict \nadherence to HIPAA.\n  Under the bill, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would be \nrequired to ensure that all carriers who participate in FEHBP educate \ntheir members about the implementation of the EHR, as well as give \ntimely notice of the establishment of the record and an opportunity for \neach individual to elect not to participate in the program.\n  OPM, through their carriers, would also have to ensure that all \nrecords would be available for electronic access through Internet, fax, \nor printed method for the use of the individual, and that to the extent \npossible, records could be transferred from one plan to another. The \nbill would require EHRs to be made available two years after the \npassage of the legislation or earlier at the discretion of OPM in \nconsultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \nInformation Technology within HHS.\n  Not only can EHRs save lives and improve the quality of health care, \nthey also have the potential to reduce the cost of the delivery of \nhealth care. According to Rand Corporation, the health care delivery \nsystem in the United States could save approximately $160 billion \nannually with the widespread use of electronic medical records. As a \nresult, the private market is already moving toward implementing \nelectronic medical records.\n  This bill, simply encourages the health care industry to continue in \nthat direction and take their use of technology in the delivery of care \nto the next step. I urge my colleagues to consider not only the benefit \nit will provide to the eight million individuals who receive their \nhealth care through the FEHBP, but also to our Nation's overall health \ncare system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 3847. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 110 Cooper Street in Babylon, New York, as the \n``Jacob Samuel Fletcher Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nwhich would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service \nlocated at 110 Cooper Street in Babylon, NY, as the ``Jacob Samuel \nFletcher Post Office Building.''\n  Jacob Samuel Fletcher sent his first application for military \nenlistment to the Marines when he was 8 years old. Young Jacob had \ncompleted an application he found in a magazine and submitted it \nthrough the mail. Though his mother told the Marines recruiter to call \nback in a few years, it wouldn't be long before Fletcher was wearing a \nuniform.\n  Fletcher enlisted in the Army soon after the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. He told family members that he felt he had a duty to serve his \ncountry. This service was nothing new to his family, as both his father \nand his stepfather served in Vietnam.\n  His story, however, ends in a tragically different manner than his \nfather's or stepfather's. On November 14, 2003, PFC Jacob Samuel \nFletcher was killed when a road side bomb exploded near a bus he was \nriding in Samara, Iraq. It was 11 days before his 29th birthday. He was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n  While he was close to finishing his tour of duty at the time of his \ndeath, Jacob told family and friends that he was not finished serving; \nhe hoped to become a state trooper upon completion of his tour in the \nmilitary.\n  I ask that the Senate come together and honor this brave American for \nhis service to our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 3848. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to support the \nwar\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\non terrorism, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2006. This Act will enhance and improve the statutes \ngoverning material support for terrorism, protection of classified \ninformation, terrorist hoaxes, and terrorist murders and assaults. \nSpecifically, the TPA expands the reach of statutes punishing material \nsupport for terrorism, making it a crime to reward the family of a \nsuicide bomber or other terrorist with the intent to facilitate \nterrorism, and increases penalties for existing material support \noffenses; clarifies and improves the Classified Information Procedures \nAct in light of the lessons learned in the Moussaoui trial; expands the \nreach of the terrorist hoax statute, and increases penalties for hoaxes \nabout the deaths of U.S. soldiers during wartime; increases penalties \nfor terrorist murders, kidnappings, and assaults committed overseas \nagainst U.S. nationals, and increases penalties for terrorist crimes \nresulting in death; and improves the United States's ability to \ninvestigate terrorist crimes by protecting the confidentiality of FISA \ninvestigations, authorizing multi-district search warrants in terrorism \ncases, and increasing penalties for obstruction of justice in terrorism \ncases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of the \nTerrorism Prevention Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the analysis was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Terrorism Prevention Act of 2006\n\n\n                      Section by Section Analysis\n\n     SECTION 2. MATERIAL SUPPORT\n\n       Subsection (a) creates a new offense, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339E, \n     of giving material benefits to the family or associates of \n     someone who has committed a terrorist act, if the benefit is \n     given with the intent to reward, encourage, or facilitate \n     terrorism. Section 2339E applies overseas to the extent that \n     the offenses are linked to interstate or foreign commerce, \n     are targeted at the United States or its people or property, \n     or the offender is a U.S. national or resident. The offense \n     is punishable by imprisonment for ten years to life. This new \n     offense would punish those individuals who encourage or \n     embolden suicide bombers by rewarding their families after \n     such bombings occur.\n       Subsection (b) increases penalties for existing material \n     support offenses as follows: Sec. 2339A, giving material \n     support to aid a terrorist act, 10 years to life; Sec. 2339B, \n     giving material support to a designated terrorist \n     organization, 5 to 25 years; and Sec. 2339D, receiving \n     military-type training from a terrorist organization, 3 to 15 \n     years. The Sec. 2339A and B penalties have not been increased \n     since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n       Subsection (c) eliminates a loophole in current law that \n     would allow an individual to give an unlimited amount of \n     medical or religious supplies to a designated terrorist \n     organization. This loophole, which was recently criticized by \n     a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, could allow a terrorist \n     organization to receive large amounts of supplies that it \n     could either resell in exchange for cash or distribute in its \n     local area in order to build support and gain recruits.\n       Subsection (d) amends Sec. 2339D to bar attempts or \n     conspiracies to obtain military-type training from a \n     terrorist organization.\n       Subsection (e) bars convicted terrorist from receiving \n     federal benefits.\n\n     SECTION 3. IMPROVEMENTS TO CIPA\n\n       This section implements a number of lessons learned during \n     the use of the Classified Information Procedures Act during \n     the trial of suspected 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui. \n     Subsection (b) authorizes interlocutory appeals of any order \n     for access to classified information. In the Moussaoui case, \n     the Fourth Circuit determined that CIPA allows interlocutory \n     appeals only of orders entered under CIPA itself, not orders \n     entered under other authority. One judge of that Court noted \n     that, although compelled by the text of CIPA, this result \n     frustrates Congress's intent to allow prompt review of \n     disputes over disclosure of classified information.\n       Subsection (c) allows requests for CIPA protection to be \n     made ex parte. Sometimes a request for protection of \n     classified information cannot be made publicly without itself \n     compromising classified information. This subsection also \n     ensures that requests for CIPA protection shall remain \n     sealed, regardless of whether they are accepted or denied, \n     and codifies the current practice of allowing such requests \n     to be made orally.\n       Subsection (d) clarifies that CIPA applies to evidence \n     obtained from nondocumentary sources, such as depositions of \n     witnesses. In the Moussaoui case, the Fourth Circuit \n     determined that CIPA technically only applies to documentary \n     information and information that the defense might disclose \n     during trial. The Court nevertheless looked to CIPA to \n     develop a framework for protecting classified information \n     during depositions. This subsection effectively codifies the \n     Fourth Circuit's approach by formally applying CIPA to \n     nondocumentary sources of evidence, such as depositions.\n\n\n                      SECTION 4. TERRORIST HOAXES\n\n       This section amends the terrorist hoax statute so that it \n     punishes hoaxes relating to terrorist offenses that \n     inexplicably were excluded from the current hoax law. For \n     example, current law does not punish hoaxes related to the \n     taking of hostages in order to coerce the federal government \n     (18 U.S.C. 1203), hoaxes related to blowing up an energy \n     facility (18 U.S.C. 1366(a)), hoaxes related to terrorist \n     attacks on military bases aimed at undermining national \n     defense (18 U.S.C. 2156), or hoaxes related to attacks on \n     railways and mass-transportation facilities, such as the \n     recent London bombings (18 U.S.C. 1992-93). This section adds \n     these terrorist crimes to the predicates for the terrorist \n     hoax statute.\n       This section also increases the penalties for hoaxes about \n     the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during \n     wartime. Unfortunately, there have been a number of incidents \n     in which individuals have contacted the families of US. \n     soldiers serving in Iraq, pretended to represent the military \n     or other official organizations, and falsely told the family \n     that their son, brother, or other relative had been killed. \n     This section would punish such hoaxes with imprisonment for 2 \n     to 10 years. If the hoax resulted in serious bodily injury, \n     it would be punished by 5 to 25 years, and if it resulted in \n     death, 10 years to life.\n       This section also clarifies that the offense of mailing \n     threatening communications applies to threats made against \n     organizations as well as individuals.\n\n\n        SECTION 5. TERRORIST MURDERS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND ASSAULTS\n\n       This section expands 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332, which punishes \n     murder or assault of U.S. nationals overseas for terrorist \n     purposes, to also include kidnappings of U.S. nationals \n     overseas that are carried out for terrorist purposes, and \n     clarifies that sexual assault qualifies as serious bodily \n     injury for purposes of the section's assault prohibitions. \n     This section also increases penalties for terrorist murders \n     and assaults, such that a murder of a U.S. national overseas \n     that is carried out for terrorist purposes would be punished \n     by imprisonment for at least 30 years, and an assault \n     resulting in serious bodily injury would be punished by \n     imprisonment for 10 years to life. ``Serious bodily injury'' \n     is defined by federal statute to mean bodily injury \n     accompanied by a substantial risk of death, extreme physical \n     pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted \n     loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, \n     or mental faculty.\n       This section also creates a new offense of committing a \n     terrorist crime while engaging in conduct that results in \n     death. This new offense is punishable by death or \n     imprisonment for 20 years up to life. This section also makes \n     eligible for capital punishment existing offenses \n     resulting in death that involve the use of nuclear \n     weapons, anti-aircraft missiles, radiological bombs, and \n     variola (smallpox) virus, and increases to 15 years to \n     life the penalties for aiding a foreign terrorist \n     organization or state sponsor of terrorism's WMD program \n     or developing, possessing, using, or threatening to use a \n     radiological weapon.\n\n\n              SECTION 6. INVESTIGATION OF TERRORIST CRIMES\n\n       Subsection (a) limits FISA notification requirements so \n     that the government is not required to inform an individual \n     seeking an immigration benefit if FISA information was used \n     to deny their application. Such notice effectively informs \n     such an individual that he or his associates have been the \n     target of an intelligence investigation. The United States \n     should not be required to compromise an intelligence \n     investigation in order to exclude a foreign national with \n     ties to terrorism from the United States.\n       Subsection (b) authorizes federal judges to authorize \n     search warrants that may be used in multiple judicial \n     districts for purposes of terrorism investigations. Such \n     investigations often require searches to be conducted in \n     different parts of the country at the same time.\n       Subsection (c) increases the potential penalties for \n     obstruction of justice in the course of a terrorism \n     investigation by making the maximum penalty ten years' \n     imprisonment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 851. A bill to provide for the extension of preliminary permit \nperiods by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for certain \nhydroelectric projects in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to give \nprivate developers more time to complete planning and financing for a \ncomplex of three high-mountain lake-tap hydroelectric projects that \npromise to provide at an electric power for Southeast Alaska and for \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  Today, I introduce legislation to extend by a total of six years the \ntime for developers to secure data necessary to determine the \nfeasibility and prepare a development application for three individual \nhydroelectric projects, all located up Thomas Bay in Southeast\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\nAlaska, near Petersburg, AK. This legislation will give time for \nconstruction of the estimated $75 million, 45-megawatt Cascade Creek \nproject, the $56 million, 30-megawatt Scenery Creek, and the $40 \nmillion, 20-megawatt Delta Creek hydroelectric projects to be built.\n  The extensions are needed and justified since the three renewable \nenergy projects can only proceed after a $30 million, 27-mile high-\nvoltage transmission line is constructed in Alaska to the U.S.-Canada \nborder, after another $130 million is spent for 150 miles of new line \nare built in Canada, after $120 million is spent for 140 miles of \ntransmission line upgrades are finished on the Canadian side of the \nborder to move the excess power to Skeena near Terrace in Canada, and \nafter portions of the proposed Southeast Alaska, Electric, Intertie are \nfinished to also permit excess power from the existing Swan Lake and \nTyee Lake hydroelectric projects, and the proposed Mahoney Lake project \nnear Ketchikan, AK, to be shared among Panhandle communities and to \nconnect to export transmission lines.\n  The developers of the Thomas Bay project, Cascade, LLC., deserve a \ntime extension since the company, so far, has focused all of its \nplanning efforts on winning approval and financing for the vital \nelectrical interconnection between Southeast Alaska and Canada, not on \nfinishing the three individual power projects. The State of Alaska only \nin early summer 2006 approved a grant of $3.2 million to pay for \nplanning to develop a comprehensive plan and review the economic \nfeasibility of using several of Southeast Alaska's nearly 100 potential \nhydroelectric sites to provide power for both local needs and for \nexport of the surplus power to the Pacific Northwest power grid to help \nwith financing of the 95 megawatts of installed capacity, 410 gigawatt, \npower project.\n  These hydroelectric projects all involve tapping high mountain lakes \nfor power. They do not require the damming of fish streams, so they \nhave no negative environmental impacts. They will produce electricity \nat substantial savings over the 40- to 50-cents per kilowatt hour cost \nof generating power from expensive diesel fuel in the region and they \nwill also reduce the effects of local air pollution and reduce carbon \ndioxide generation through the avoidance of fossil fuel combustion.\n  Congress routinely extends the three-year deadline for worthy \npotential FERC-licensed power projects to provide additional time for \ncompletion of preliminary planning, financing and design. It is \ncertainly appropriate to grant these three projects that are so \ninterconnected this additional time to work out the contractual and \nfinancial planning and to finish the environmental studies needed for \nconstruction permits to be obtained.\n  Developing renewable energy that can be produced without any \nenvironmental impacts on streams and the fish and wildlife they support \nis an increasingly important task of government. This bill will help \nsuch environmentally-sensitive development occur and will help reduce \nthe nation's dependence on foreign fossil fuels. I hope for speedy \npassage of this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 3854. A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Mount Hood is a cherished wild place that \nis often photographed, visited and enjoyed by scores of Oregonians and \nmany non-Oregonians as well. Today, I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague Senator Smith, a new bipartisan Oregon Wilderness bill: the \n``Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2006.'' In tribute to \nthe great river-dependent journey of Lewis and Clark, our legislation \nadds nine free-flowing stretches of rivers to the National Wild and \nScenic River System. This reflects the Oregonian wish to protect but \nalso actively experience our State's treasures.\n  This bill contains many elements of the bill I introduced two years \nago while incorporating many of the provisions adopted in the House-\npassed version of Mount Hood Wilderness protections, HR 5025. My bill \nbuilds upon the House version by adding more wilderness, more wild and \nscenic rivers, and providing a recreation area to allow diverse \nrecreational opportunities. It protects the lower elevation forests \nsurrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge as Lewis and Clark \nsaw them. These forests embody the natural beauty of Oregon. They \nprovide the clean water necessary for the survival of threatened \nsteelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon. These forests provide critical \nhabitat and diverse ecosystems for elk, deer, lynx and the majestic \nbald eagle. And these are the forests that provide unparalleled \nrecreational opportunities for Oregonians and our visitors.\n  But the bill I introduce today differs from the bill I introduced two \nyears ago because it responds to the many comments I heard in the \nensuing years. I received thousands of comments on proposed Mount Hood \nlegislation. Some comments came as a result of the general public \nmeetings I held in Oregon. Many of the meetings lasted over 3 hours, \nand everyone who wanted to speak was given an opportunity to do so. \nOther comments came from the second Mount Hood Summit held at \nTimberline Lodge hosted by Representatives Walden and Blumenauer. I and \nmy staff met with over 100 community groups and local governments, the \nmembers of the Oregon congressional delegation, the Governor, and the \nBush administration. And still more comments came from letters and \nphone calls from Oregonians.\n  Overwhelmingly, these comments urged me to protect and build on \nOregon's Wilderness system. This goal is as important today as it was \nin 1804, 1964 or 1984--if not more so. To succeed, we must provide the \ntools that help us create a planned future on Mount Hood. This bill \ndoes both.\n  The Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most visited National \nForest in the United States. In the 22 years that have elapsed since \nany new wilderness has been designated in the Mount Hood area, the \npopulation in local counties has increased significantly--25 percent in \nMultnomah County, 24 percent in Hood River County, and 28 percent in \nClackamas County.\n  The predominant public use of this urban forest is non-mechanized \nactivity like hiking, camping, and fishing. With increasing emphasis on \nwild scenery, unspoiled wildlife habitats, free flowing rivers, \nwilderness and the need for opportunities for diverse outdoor \nrecreation sometimes it seems we are in jeopardy of ``loving our wild \nplaces to death.''\n\n  A few years ago, the Forest Service made a proposal to limit the \nnumber of people that could hike the south side of Mount Hood and the \npublic outcry was enormous. Seems to me, rather than tell people that \nthey are going to be restricted from using our public lands, part of \nthe solution for the future of the Mountain lies in providing more \nopportunities for them to enjoy the Mountain's great places. We should \nensure the Mount Hood National Forest can meet the increased use and \ndemand for outdoor experiences--my bill will provide those \nopportunities.\n  Of the hundreds of people who attended the meetings I held throughout \nthe State of Oregon, the vast majority spoke in favor of more \nwilderness. Additionally, I have received more than 2,500 written \ncomments supporting additional wilderness for Mount Hood.\n  This is what I have heard: More Wilderness: First and foremost, I \nheard that Oregonians in astonishing numbers support protecting Mount \nHood and the Columbia River Gorge with additional wilderness. A large \nnumber of Oregonians didn't think that enough wilderness areas had been \nincluded in the House proposal.\n  Mountain Biking: Some mountain bikers expressed concerns that their \nrecreation opportunities not be unfairly curtailed.\n  Fire Protection and Forest Health: Some people were worried about \nforest health and those living in towns on the mountain and in the \ngorge were concerned about fire protection for their communities.\n  Developed Recreation: Some people were worried about maintaining a \nrole for developed recreation, like skiing, on Mt. Hood.\n  This is what my bill does to address those concerns: More Wilderness: \nThere are currently 189,200 acres of designated wilderness on the Mount \nHood National Forest. The House legislation\n\n[[Page S9048]]\n\nwould have added approximately 77,200 acres of new wilderness on the \nMountain. The bill I am introducing today increases wilderness on Mount \nHood by designating approximately 128,385 new acres of wilderness--\nincorporating all the areas the House bill included and building upon \nthem.\n  This bill adds the areas surrounding the oldest Mt. Hood Wilderness--\nthe mountain itself--which was designated in the original Wilderness \nAct of 1964. These additions include cathedral old growth forests, the \nhistoric Tilly Jane trail, lava beds that were created during the Mt. \nHood eruptions, and much of the legendary route that Oregon's pioneers \nused when they were settling our great state. To the north and west of \nthe mountain, I would add the viewshed of the Columbia Gorge to the \ncurrent Mark O. Hatfield wilderness. These areas encompass the \nspectacular ridges framing the Gorge that we all marvel at from I-84 \nand include perhaps the greatest concentration of waterfalls in North \nAmerica. To the southwest of the mountain I add lands to the current \nSalmon Huckleberry Wilderness to conserve their diverse wildlife and \nprotect unique recreational areas like those around popular Mirror \nLake. These lands include Alder Creek, the source of drinking water for \nthe City of Sandy, which unanimously endorsed the draft proposal. Over \nto the east are proposed additions to the Badger Creek Wilderness. \nThese areas provide a critical link between Westside forests and \nEastside ecosystems. This area is known for beautiful fall color and \nthe best deer and elk hunting in the entire Mount Hood National Forest. \nAmong the areas we are protecting is the newly designated Richard L. \nKohnstamm Memorial Area. It is dedicated in honor of Mr. Kohnstamm who \nrestored the historic Timberline Lodge--built originally by the Works \nProgress Administration in 1937--to its former grandeur.\n\n  Wild and Scenic Rivers: My proposal seeks to protect over 81 miles of \nwild and scenic rivers on nine free flowing rivers. This includes some \nof the most pristine and beautiful rivers in Oregon. Among those \nproposed rivers are the picturesque waterfalls and glacial outwash of \nthe East Fork of the Hood River, and the ancestral hunting and fishing \ngrounds of Fish Creek. Over 17 miles of superb salmon and steelhead \nhabitat on the Collowash River have also been proposed for protection. \nMy bill again incorporates all the House proposed protections and \nbuilds upon them.\n  Mountain Biking: I believe that local riders raised some valid \nconcerns, so I did two things. I have proposed Mount Hood National \nRecreation Area. It will offer greater, permanent environmental \nprotections to those beautiful areas, while providing mountain bikers, \nand other recreational users, an opportunity to continue to recreate in \nthese areas. Additionally, I made boundary adjustments to ensure all \nopen mountain biking trails were not included in my proposed \nwilderness.\n  Fire Protection and Forest Health: I protect wilderness, where there \nare healthy, older trees that should never be harvested on Mount Hood \nor in the Gorge. Older, healthy stands are the most resistant to fire \nand disease. However, there is an enormous backlog of over-crowded, \nplantation, second-growth that should be thinned. My bill incorporates \nHouse provisions that would give the Forest Service a mandate to \nprepare an assessment for promoting forests resilient to fire, insects \nand disease. This also includes provisions to study and encourage the \ndevelopment of biomass in conjunction with forest health work. In \naddition, I added fire safe community zones so that the Secretary will \nconstruct a system of fire safe buffer zones around the communities of \nCascade Locks and Government Camp.\n  Developed Recreation: In order to facilitate developed recreation \nopportunities I have adopted the House provisions establishing a ``fee-\nretention'' provision that will establish an account for the Mount Hood \nNational Forest. In addition, in order to help address growth while \nensuring access to recreational opportunities, I have adopted House \nprovisions directing the Secretary and the State of Oregon to develop \nan integrated transportation plan for the Mount Hood region.\n  Local and Tribal Relationships: I have also incorporated the House \nprovisions on local and tribal relationships emphasizing the rich \nhistory of the Mount Hood region and affirming the rights of Native \npeoples to access the mountains resources, as they have for \ngenerations.\n  The protection of these important Oregon places will depend on the \nhard work and dedication of all Oregonians and particularly that of my \nOregon colleagues here in the Congress. I am especially pleased that \nSenator Smith has joined me in developing this bipartisan legislation \nand putting forth our proposal for wilderness. I am hopeful everyone \nwill pull together: county Commissioners, environmentalists, \nentrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, state elected officials, the \nGovernor, and the Oregon delegation here in the Capitol. I look forward \nto perfecting legislation together in the coming weeks, and seeing its \nswift adoption by Congress thereafter. Then the grandeur of Mount Hood \nand other Oregon treasures can be assured for future generations.\n  Soda Mountain Wilderness: In addition, I wish to offer my \ncosponsorship of legislation to be presented by Senator Smith, creating \nthe Soda Mountain Wilderness and authorizing the voluntary cancellation \nof grazing leases in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. This bill \nwould establish a 23,000-acre Soda Mountain Wilderness in the \nbackcountry of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. In addition, it \nprovides for the negotiated voluntary grazing permit lease buyout in \nthe Monument. This proposed wilderness area lies at the intersection of \nthe Siskiyou and Cascade mountain ranges, and the Oregon Desert, \nCalifornia chaparral, High Cascade and coastal Westside forests. It is \ntruly where east meets west meets north meets south. This makes it a \ntruly unique and biodiverse ecosystem and a key wildlife corridor--one \nthat is used by ten rare, threatened or endangered species, including \nthe northern spotted owl, Ashland thistle, and the Siskiyou fritillary. \nIt is also home to populations of trout, elk, bobcats, black bears and \nfalcons. The grazing buyout in this bill also provides a win-win \nsituation. It provides a good deal for the ranchers--the negotiated \nagreement between the Bureau of Land Management grazing lessees and the \nconservationists includes an agreed-upon conservationist premium to be \npaid to the lessees. This premium enhances the compensation lessees \nreceive from the federal government as part of the legislation. It also \nensures this special place will be protected. I commend Senator Smith \nfor introducing this legislation and am happy to join him in \nintroducing this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) long before the arrival of Lewis and Clark, Native \n     Americans in the Oregon country lived amid the wild splendor \n     of the Cascade Mountains and the Columbia River, where the \n     waters teemed with fish, game roamed the forests, and fruits \n     and berries were abundant;\n       (2) the Native Americans arrived in this bountiful land \n     from Asia by way of the Bering Sea and inhabited the land in \n     and around Mount Hood and the Columbia Gorge;\n       (3) some of the tribes along the Columbia River were part \n     of the Chinook family;\n       (4) many of the people of the tribes--\n       (A) used canoes made from cedar logs;\n       (B) were expert fisherman;\n       (C) told fire legends about the mid-Columbia volcanic peaks \n     that featured warrior heroes, fair ladies, and numerous gods; \n     and\n       (D) Mount Hood as Wy'East, the warrior whose passionate \n     love caused the region to be transformed as he hurled \n     powerful volcanic fire in his quest for the love of the \n     gentle maiden Loo-wit, known today as Mount St. Helens;\n       (5) traveling down the Columbia River in 1805, the Lewis \n     and Clark Corps of Discovery expedition was awed by the \n     unspoiled scenic splendors of the Cascade Mountains and the \n     Columbia River Gorge cutting through the mountain rampart;\n       (6) on October 18, 1805, Clark recorded in his journal: ``I \n     ascended a high cliff, about 200 feet above the water, from \n     the top of which is a level plain, extending up the river and \n     off for a great extent. From this place I discovered a \n     mountain of immense height, covered with snow.'';\n       (7) following Lewis and Clark, settlers came to the Oregon \n     territory by way of the Oregon Trail, transforming more \n     accessible portions of the wild landscape into farms, \n     orchards, and small communities using the old growth forests;\n       (8) in 1845, Oregon Trail pioneers Samuel K. Barlow and \n     Joel Palmer and their parties opened the Barlow Trail across \n     Barlow Pass, high on the south slopes of Mount Hood, with \n     Palmer writing on October 11, 1845: ``I had never seen a \n     sight so nobly grand.'';\n       (9) even as the settlers transformed the wilderness, that \n     frontier land helped develop in the settlers the \n     characteristics of self-reliance, fortitude, hard work, \n     independence, and love of the land, which the people of \n     Oregon and the entire United States cherish to this day and \n     wish to inculcate in their children;\n       (10) the unprotected wilderness that remains in the Mount \n     Hood and Columbia River Gorge region provides easily \n     accessible outdoor recreation for the descendants of the \n     early settlers and more recent arrivals;\n       (11) Mount Hood is home to the historic Timberline Lodge, \n     which--\n       (A) is a National Historic Landmark;\n       (B) was built as a project by the Federal Works Progress \n     Administration in 1937; and\n       (C) was restored to its former grandeur by the dedication \n     and stewardship of Richard L. Kohnstamm;\n       (12) preserving wilderness assures the integrity of the \n     background and scenic views that enrich more developed forms \n     of recreational use, including downhill skiing and roadside \n     enjoyment of sweeping wilderness scenery;\n       (13) designation as wilderness provides the strongest \n     congressional protection of scientific, cultural, \n     educational, environmental, scenic, and recreational values \n     that contribute long-term quality of life and economic \n     benefits to the people of Oregon, visitors to Oregon, and \n     local communities in and around the Mount Hood National \n     Forest, including the wilderness-dependent wildlife, high \n     water quality, and resident and anadromous fish that thrive \n     in undisturbed ecosystems;\n       (14) the Mount Hood National Forest is the seventh most \n     visited National Forest in the United States;\n       (15) wilderness management is interrelated with and will \n     interface with the established activities and management of \n     adjacent land, particularly when the land is high-density \n     recreation land;\n       (16) Mount Hood National Forest is predominantly used by \n     the public for mechanized and non-mechanized activities, such \n     as hiking, camping, and fishing, which according to the Mount \n     Hood National Forest Management Plan, are projected to \n     increase dramatically over time;\n       (17) the Land and Resource Management Plan for Mount Hood \n     National Forest provides that ``the present capability to \n     supply recreational opportunities such as hiking on trails in \n     primitive and semi-primitive non-motorized areas is predicted \n     to fall short of satisfying demand'';\n       (18) according to the plan described in paragraph (17), the \n     Mount Hood National Forest--\n       (A) provides resources for nearly 2 times the current \n     demand for developed recreation such as skiing, power \n     boating, and sightseeing by car; but\n       (B) meets less than \\2/3\\ of the demand for back country \n     recreation;\n       (19) the Management Plan for Mount Hood National Forest \n     projects that by 2040, the Mount Hood National Forest will \n     only meet 16 percent of the demand for wilderness recreation, \n     while meeting more than 100 percent of the demand for \n     mechanized recreation;\n       (20) because the Mount Hood National Forest provides \n     drinking water for more than 16 communities and over 40 \n     percent of Oregon residents, management of the Mount Hood \n     National Forest needs to take into consideration plans \n     developed by local watershed councils in managing the forest; \n     and\n       (21) the management of the Mount Hood National Forest \n     should address practical, site-specific situations in a \n     manner that supports wilderness and the general \n     environmental, economic, and community-related welfare of the \n     mountain.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n       (2) Mountain bike.--The term ``mountain bike'' does not \n     include a motorized vehicle.\n       (3) Old growth.--The term ``old growth'', with respect to a \n     tree or grove of trees, means a tree or grove that is--\n       (A) at last 120 years old; or\n       (B) previously unmanaged.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means--\n       (A) when used in reference to Forest Service land, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture; and\n       (B) when used in reference to Bureau of Land Management \n     land, the Secretary of the Interior.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of Oregon.\n\n                TITLE I--DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS AREAS\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the most recent designation of wilderness in the Mount \n     Hood National Forest occurred in 1984; and\n       (2) the designation of an additional 128,400 acres as a \n     wilderness area by this title will increase the amount of \n     wilderness designated as a wilderness area in the Mount Hood \n     National Forest by 68 percent.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to designate \n     approximately 128,400 acres of National Forest System land in \n     the Mount Hood National Forest as a wilderness area.\n\n     SEC. 102. LEWIS AND CLARK MOUNT HOOD WILDERNESS AREAS.\n\n       (a) Designations.--In accordance with the Wilderness Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), the following areas in the State \n     are designated as wilderness areas and as components of the \n     National Wilderness Preservation System:\n       (1) Badger creek wilderness additions.--Certain Federal \n     land managed by the Forest\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\n     Service, comprising approximately 3,700 acres, as generally \n     depicted on the maps entitled ``Badger Creek'' and ``Bonnie \n     Butte'', dated September 2006, which are incorporated in, and \n     considered to be a part of, the Badger Creek Wilderness, as \n     designated by section 3(3) of the Oregon Wilderness Act of \n     1984 (16 U.S.C. 1132 note; 98 Stat. 273).\n       (2) Bull of the woods wilderness addition.--Certain Federal \n     land managed by the Forest Service, comprising approximately \n     6,870 acres, as generally depicted on the map entitled ``Bull \n     of the Woods'', dated June 2006, which is incorporated in, \n     and considered to be a part of, the Bull of the Woods \n     Wilderness, as designated by section 3(4) of the Oregon \n     Wilderness Act of 1984 (16 U.S.C. 1132 note; 98 Stat. 273).\n       (3) Clackamas wilderness.--Certain Federal land managed by \n     the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, comprising \n     approximately 11,900 acres, as generally depicted on the maps \n     entitled ``Clackamas Canyon'', ``Big Bottom'', ``Memaloose \n     Lake'', ``South Fork Clackamas'', ``Sisi Butte'', and ``Upper \n     Big Bottom'', dated September 2006, which shall be known as \n     the ``Clackamas Wilderness''.\n       (4) Lower white river wilderness.--Certain Federal land \n     managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, \n     comprising approximately 2,850 acres, as generally depicted \n     on the map entitled ``Lower White River'', dated September \n     2006, which shall be known as the ``Lower White River \n     Wilderness''.\n       (5) Mark o. hatfield wilderness additions.--Certain Federal \n     land managed by the Forest Service, comprising approximately \n     26,000 acres, as generally depicted on the maps entitled \n     ``Gorge Ridgeline'' and ``Larch Mountain'', dated September \n     2006, which shall be known as the ``Mark O.

A bill to authorize Congress to award a gold medal to Jerry \nLewis, in recognition of his outstanding service to the Nation; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nEnsign and Senator Lautenberg to introduce legislation to award Jerry \nLewis with the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor. This well-deserved \nrecognition pays tribute to the many outstanding and enduring \ncontributions Jerry Lewis has made throughout his career.\n  Born in 1926 in Newark, NJ, this gifted comedian has been a fixture \nin the entertainment community for more than five decades keeping \nspirits high and Americans laughing during some of the most turbulent \nperiods in our history--World War II, the Cold War, and the \nassassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King \nJr. But in addition to his comic persona, Lewis is also an active \nchampion of charitable causes with an undying commitment to finding a \ncure for muscular dystrophy. Mr. Lewis has served for five decades as \nthe National Chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which is \nan incredible organization dedicated to making a difference in the \nlives of countless families dealing with the challenges associated with \nmuscular dystrophy. Forty years ago, he began the ``Jerry Lewis MDA \nLabor Day Telethon,'' an annual television program that benefits \nchildren and adults affected by muscular dystrophy and related \nneuromuscular diseases. This year, Mr. Lewis achieved an amazing \naccomplishment. His annual Labor Day telethon raised a record $61 \nmillion to fight this disease.\n  In September of 1976, this great body adopted a resolution expressing \ntheir appreciation of Jerry Lewis' philanthropic endeavors, in \nparticular, his fight to find a cure for muscular dystrophy. Today, I \nbelieve a fitting accolade to this larger than life individual would be \nfor him to join the ranks of distinguished Congressional Gold Medal \nrecipients. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jerry \nLewis, supporting the fight to end muscular dystrophy, and co-\nsponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 3857. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to small businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Bringing \nOpportunity to Our Small Business Taxpayers Act,'' or ``BOOST Act.'' I \nam pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Blanche Lincoln of \nArkansas.\n  Small businesses represent over 99 percent of all employers and \ncreate approximately three-fourths of the new jobs added to the \neconomy. The approximately 23 million small businesses truly are the \nbackbone of our economy.\n  However, this important engine of job creation and growth for our \neconomy is subjected to unnecessary and unfair financial burdens \ninflicted by Federal tax policy and other laws. My bill will extend \nexpensing provisions, eliminate tax inequities and encourage retirement \nplans for small businesses, as well as provide a health insurance tax \ndeduction for the self-employed.\n  Current law allows small businesses to expense up to $100,000 of the \ncost of property per year and invest up to $400,000 per year and still \nbe eligible for expensing. My bill will make these expensing \nprovisions, which are set to expire in 2009, permanent.\n  My legislation also addresses inequitable provisions in the law that \naffect the approximately 3.2 million S-corporations in the United \nStates. Today, businesses that convert from C-corporation to S-\ncorporation status are penalized for a period of ten years if they sell \nassets that were held prior to the conversion, even if the proceeds are \ndriven right back into the business. By reducing the holding period \nsubjected to built-in gains tax from ten years to seven years, S-\ncorporations will be able to unload unneeded assets and improve cash \nflow and create more jobs.\n  Known as the ``sting tax,'' S-corporations that have converted from \nC-corporation status are taxed at the maximum corporate tax rate for \npassive investment income in excess of 25 percent of their gross \nreceipts. This law is burdensome and unfair and needs to be revised. My \nbill will decrease the amount of income subjected to the tax. The \nadjustment will relieve S-corporations from an unnecessary tax burden \nand level the playing field with C-corporations and LLCs.\n  Saving for retirement is important for all Americans and access to \nretirement plans is critical in order to build wealth for an \nindividual's golden years. Unfortunately, high costs and taxes \ndiscourage many small businesses from providing retirement plans to \ntheir employees. Through tax equity and tax credit measures, my bill \nencourages small businesses to offer retirement benefits to employees \nso they will have the necessary tools to prepare for their financial \nfuture.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on issues affecting \nsmall businesses and urge their support of my legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3857\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate bringing to justice terrorists and \nother unlawful enemy combatants through full and fair trials by \nmilitary commissions, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. FRIST. In 5 days we will observe the fifth anniversary of the \nmost vicious act of terror ever perpetrated on American soil. Nearly \n3,000 fellow Americans lost their lives on September 11.\n  We have worked tirelessly to make America safer from terrorist \nattacks and to honor the sacrifices of the victims of 9/11 and their \nfamilies. But the fact remains that we still have more to do.\n  That is why Senator McConnell and I are proud to introduce \nlegislation on behalf of the President to bring terrorists to justice. \nThe bill authorizes military commissions to prosecute terrorist \ndetainees and addresses the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in the \nHamdan decision.\n  Today, we are a nation at war. Our enemies are terrorists who do not \nvalue democracy, freedom, or innocent life.\n  When we capture them on the battlefield, we have a right to prosecute \nthem for war crimes. And we must establish a system that protects our \nnational security while ensuring a full and fair trial for the \ndetainees.\n  That is why it is imperative that we quickly move forward on this \nbill. By formally establishing military commissions to prosecute \nterrorist detainees, we are creating another tool in the war on \nterror--and providing a measure of justice to the victims of 9/11.\n  Under these commissions, terrorist detainees will get a fair trial. \nThey will be tried before impartial military judges. They will have the \nright to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to \ncounsel, the right to present exculpatory evidence, the right to \nexclude evidence obtained through torture or coercion, and the right to \nappeal.\n  However, these procedures also recognize that because we are at war, \nwe should not try terrorist detainees in the same way as our uniformed \nmilitary or common civilian criminals. The procedures take great care \nto protect our national security interests by preventing disclosure of \nclassified information to the detainees themselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill carefully. I will consult \nChairman Warner and the Armed Services Committee members to ensure the \nSenate moves expeditiously to meet its responsibility to the American \npeople.\n  I hope we can move forward in a spirit of bipartisanship even though \nwe are in the middle of a partisan election season. And I hope we can \nremain focused on the goal of making America safer and continuing to \nhonor the victims of 9/11.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9061-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 557--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 10 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 16, \n  2006, AS ``NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK'' AND \nSUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE \n     AWARENESS WEEK TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF \n  POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND TO FOSTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT \n  POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE HAS ON PATIENTS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF \n                             THEIR FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 557\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is the \n     most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease in the United \n     States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease that has a \n     devastating impact, in both human and economic terms, on \n     people of all ages, and affects equally people of all races, \n     sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and income \n     levels;\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents called polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     cure, is 1 of the 4 leading causes of kidney failure in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease \n     causes many patients to live in denial and forego regular \n     visits to their physicians or to avoid following good health \n     management which would help avoid more severe complications \n     when kidney failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression (7 times the national average) and its resultant \n     consequences due to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and \n     premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health and from such initiatives as \n     the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the third week of September and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Week: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 10 through September 16, 2006, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease (known as \n     ``PKD'');\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9061-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 558--HONORING THE LIVES AND MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF \n    THE CRASH OF COMAIR FLIGHT 5191, AND EXTENDING THE MOST SINCERE \n CONDOLENCES OF THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE FAMILIES AND \n                      FRIENDS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning) submitted the following \nresolution;

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska. It is late, and I understand that. I rise to address \nsomething which is very important to me, and that is the Defense \nappropriations bill that may appear to many to be insignificant \nboilerplate language, when, in fact, is not that at all. Unfortunately, \nthe provision has an enlarged significance in\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nthis Congress as a result of the inexplicable and unpardonable failure \nof the Senate to do something that it has never done before, and that \nis to fail to pass intelligence authorizations for either fiscal year \n2006 or fiscal year 2007.\n  Section 8086 of the Defense appropriations bill waives section 504 of \nthe National Security Act of 1947 until the enactment of the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007. What does that \nmean? Section 504 provides, with limited exceptions, that no \nappropriated funds available may be obligated or expended for an \nintelligence activity unless those funds were specifically authorized \nby Congress; therefore, by the two Intelligence Committees.\n  This waiver is a standard part of the Defense appropriations bill. \nUntil this Congress, it has served the acceptable function of allowing \nintelligence communities to begin spending money if the authorization \nbill is not completed before the beginning of the fiscal year. Under \nthis waiver, as soon as the intelligence authorizations for any given \nyear are enacted, that authorization language would control.\n  In this Congress, however, the boilerplate language has become the \nsubstitute for legislative authorization of intelligence activities \nbecause the majority leader, to be honest, has refused to bring the \nintelligence authorization bill to the floor for the past 2 years--for \nthe past 2 years.\n  The Senate's failure to pass this critical national security \nlegislation is unprecedented. Last year was the first time since the \nestablishment of the congressional Intelligence Committees that the \nSenate failed to pass an annual authorization bill. From 1978 through \n2004, the Senate had an unbroken, 27-year record of completing its work \non this critical legislation. The intelligence authorization bill has \nbeen rightly considered, always, must-pass legislation. Regardless of \nwho controlled the Senate, regardless of who controlled the White \nHouse, there was an understanding that the programs authorized by this \nbill were too important to not have the input of the Congress through \nthe Intelligence Committees.\n  Unfortunately, because of an anonymous objection by a Republican \nSenator, the majority leader decided to let this important national \nsecurity legislation die on the vine last year, for the first time, and \nhe appears intent on doing so this year again. The result of this \ndecision by the majority leader will be diminished authority for \nintelligence agencies to do their jobs of protecting Americans. It also \nwill result in less effective oversight, which was essentially the 9/11 \nCommission's No. 1 call, and all of this at a time when the \nintelligence community is undergoing the biggest restructuring in its \n50-year history.\n  The annual intelligence authorization is the primary mechanism which \nthe Congress, through the Intelligence Committees, uses to provide \nguidance and support to America's intelligence agencies, the heart of \nour effort to protect America's national security.\n  At a time when our security depends so heavily on good intelligence, \nwhen our national security has been endangered by not depending \nsufficiently on good intelligence--or maybe the intelligence wasn't \ngood when it should have been--and we are in the midst of reforming and \nmodernizing our intelligence community, the Senate's failure to act on \nthis legislation is absolutely inexplicable to this Senator and to \nvirtually all the Members of the Intelligence Committees.\n  In reporting the resolution to establish the Intelligence Committee \nin May 1976, since the first chairman on our side was the Senator from \nHawaii, Mr. Inouye, the Committee on Government Operations back then \nwrote the following:\n\n       An essential part of the new committee's jurisdiction will \n     be authorization authority over the intelligence activities \n     of the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central Intelligence \n     Agency. Without this authority, the new committee would not \n     be assured the practical ability to monitor the activities of \n     these agencies.\n\n  They wrote that back then--and that is:\n\n        . . . to obtain full access to information which the \n     committees must have to exercise control over the budgets of \n     agencies in order to reduce waste and inefficiency, and to \n     impose changes in agency practices.\n\n  That is what they said.\n  The failure of the Senate to pass intelligence authorization for 2 \nyears threatens to erode the ability of the Intelligence Committee to \ncarry out the mission assigned to it by the Senate. This failure has \nconsequences both immediate and long term. Our intelligence agencies \ncan continue executing the funding made available through the various \nappropriations bills but without any guidance as to what they should do \nfrom the Intelligence Committees.\n  I do not understand this.\n  The Appropriations Committee does an excellent job at providing \nresources for the intelligence agencies, what they need to operate on. \nBut the roadmap for how the Congress expects those sources to be \nexecuted comes from the authorization bill--which seems to no longer \nexist. The sensitivity and importance of our Nation's intelligence \nprograms makes congressional direction essential every single year. But \nthe creation of an Office of the Director of National Intelligence in \n2004, and the ongoing development of that office, makes the guidance \neven more important now.\n  The fiscal year 2006 authorization bill contains 17 separate \nprovisions enhancing or clarifying the authority of the DNI. Those \nprovisions included additional authority to promote information \nsharing, clarifying the DNI's role in managing human intelligence--all \nof these, easy to say and difficult to do--providing flexibility in the \nfinancing of national intelligence centers, how those centers were to \nbe set up, and elevating the DNI Inspector General to a statutory \nposition.\n  Those important provisions are now included in this fiscal year 2007 \nbill, and we should act on them as soon as possible. I do not think we \nare going to, but we should.\n  In the longer term, the Senate's inability to debate and act on this \ncritical legislation will have a more lasting effect on congressional \noversight. Both the 9/11 and the Robb-Silberman commission on weapons \nof mass destruction highlighted the importance of improving oversight \nas a necessary component of reforming our intelligence capabilities. \nOversight.\n  The 9/11 Commission wrote:\n\n       Of all our recommendations, strengthening Congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and most important.\n\n  In December 2004, the Senate took steps to strengthen the Senate \nIntelligence Committee by eliminating member term limits. That had been \na long time coming. People were limited to 8 years. They just began to \nget up to speed and then they were off. Now that has changed. It is at \nthe discretion of the majority leader and the minority leader.\n  We increased our staff and strengthened other procedures. But these \nimprovements were in a sense a hollow victory. Since enactment of the \nreforms, the majority leader has emasculated the Intelligence Committee \nby denying it the central tool to carry out oversight, and that is the \nannual authorization bill which is called for under the law.\n  The majority leader's unwillingness to consider these bills is even \nmore puzzling because of the bipartisan effort that has gone into their \ndevelopment on both sides of this House. Both the fiscal 2006 and 2007 \nbills passed the Intelligence Committee unanimously. Both were referred \nto the Armed Services Committee where they were again approved \nunanimously. Last year, the bill was also referred to the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, which suggested changes \nthat would have been included had we been discussing the bill along \nwith suggestions from the administration in a managers' amendment.\n  Last year's bill and this year's bill contain legislation focused on \nfour important areas about which I am going to talk briefly. I have \nalready mentioned the numerous provisions relating to the authority and \nthe operation of the Office of the DNI, the Director of National \nIntelligence. The bill also contains additional provisions to foster \nand improve information sharing and information access. Easy words, \nhard to do.\n  Section 310 establishes a pilot program giving the Intelligence \nCommittee access to databases of other\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\nnonintelligence agencies for the purpose of collecting intelligence on \ncounterterrorism or weapons of mass destruction. While this bill sits \non the calendar, that information is now outside the reach of the \nintelligence community.\n  Many of my colleagues have decried the seemingly endless stream of \nleaks of classified information. I join them in denouncing the leaks of \nsensitive material. The authorization bill includes provisions \nstrengthening the authority of the DNI and the Director of the CIA to \nprotect intelligence sources and methods. It also includes a provision, \nauthored by Senator Wyden and adopted by the committee unanimously, to \nincrease the penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of a covert \nagent.\n  Finally, the authorization bill contains numerous provisions intended \nto improve oversight of the intelligence community, both from within \nand from the Congress itself.\n  Section 408 is interesting. Section 408 of the bill proposes the \nestablishment of a statutory inspector general for the intelligence \ncommunity. I have said that. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 took a \nfirst step toward that end by authorizing the Director of National \nIntelligence to appoint an inspector general within the Office of the \nDirector. The DNI has done that, and I applaud him for doing so. But \nthe bill will strengthen that position and make it more accountable to \nthe Congress.\n  Section 434 of the bill strengthens accountability further and \noversight of the technical agencies by providing that the heads of the \nNational Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency are to be appointed by the \nPresident with the Senate's advice and consent.\n  This is in the authorization bill, and if we were to pass it, this \nwould become effective. I think it actually comes as a surprise to many \nof my colleagues that the head of an agency with as central a role in \nthe intelligence community as the National Security Agency is not \nappointed with Senate confirmation. In fact, heads of the National \nSecurity Agency have customarily only gone through confirmation in \nconnection with their military rank but not for their appointment to \nthe position of the Director of NSA. That is not considered.\n  Section 107 of the bill, sponsored in committee by Senators Levin and \nHagel, seeks to improve the timely flow of information to the \ncongressional Intelligence Committees. Similar language was included in \nthe intelligence reform legislation that passed in the Senate in 2004 \nbut did not survive the conference. I applaud Senators Levin and Hagel \nfor their efforts with respect to this issue.\n  There are other provisions requiring specific information, including \na report on the implementation of the Detainee Treatment Act and a \nseparate report on the possibility of existence of clandestine \ndetention facilities. I am at a loss to understand what the objection \nto this legislation is. Maybe somebody does not like the enhancement of \noversight. That is our job. That is why the committees were formed. \nMaybe somebody doesn't want the DNI to have more authority or maybe \nsomebody thinks the Congress should not be getting timely access to \ninformation about intelligence programs that are so important. But let \nme remind all my colleagues that the authorization bill passed the \nIntelligence Committee unanimously. If somebody has a problem with a \nprovision, bring up the bill, offer an amendment, debate, and vote. \nThat is the way the Senate works.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4906\n\n  Because of the importance of getting the authorization bill enacted \nand because I and all the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhave been totally unable to make any headway on this at all now for 2 \nyears, and because I have concluded that it will once again be ignored \nby the majority leader, I send an amendment to the desk to strike \nsection 8086 of the pending legislation, the fiscal year 2007 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] proposes a \n     amendment numbered 4906.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the section specifically authorizing intelligence \n                  and intelligence-related activities)\n\n       On page 206, strike lines 10 through 16.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, striking section 8086 would mean the \nfollowing: that none of the funds in this bill could be spent for \nintelligence activities without an authorization bill. I do not know \nhow else to do it. I am reluctant to take this step because I do not \nwant our intelligence agencies to be caught without funding. But I see \nno other way to force the Senate to bring into the consciousness, the \ncerebral cortexes of the various Senators, that it is important to take \nup and pass authorization bills.\n  This legislation is too important to be allowed to languish in \nlegislative limbo. I am at a loss to understand why the Senate cannot \ncomplete action. It would be in no one's interest to not complete this, \nnot the Senate, not the Congress, not the intelligence community, nor \nwould it be in the national security interest of the United States.\n  Democrats are more than willing to quickly debate and pass much \nneeded national security legislation. Democrats know that it is \nessential that we permit the men and women of the intelligence agencies \nto continue their critical work on the front lines of the war in Iraq \nand the war on terror.\n  In the meantime, to the men and women of the intelligence agencies, I \nsay that we stand with you. We are proud of your bravery and your \npatriotism, and we thank you for your sacrifice, working in silence, \nand in the shadows, against the threat that America faces.\n  (At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the following statement was \nordered to be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9068-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9068-S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAILURE TO PASS AN INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join Vice Chairman \nRockefeller in calling for the Senate to take up and pass the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. As has been said \nalready, this legislation is the primary way in which the Congress \ndirects the Nation's 16 intelligence agencies.\n  In writing this legislation, the Committee worked closely with the \nDirector of National Intelligence, or DNI, to identify new authorities \nneeded to protect our national security. The bill authorizes a pilot \nprogram to allow intelligence agencies to better share information that \ncould help uncover and thwart a terrorist; empowers the DNI to build \ninformation-sharing systems across the Federal Government; and creates \na strong inspector general for the intelligence community.\n  The bill also requires the intelligence community to explain how it \nis complying with the Detainee Treatment Act and provide Congress with \ninformation on any ``alleged clandestine detention facilities'' that it \nmay be operating and continues the process of intelligence reform begun \nin 2004.\n  It is not surprising that the creation of the DNI and major \norganizational changes across the Government's national security \napparatus left some things undone. This Intelligence authorization bill \nmakes a number of small but useful changes to allow the DNI and the \nNation's 16 intelligence agencies to operate on a day-to-day basis more \neffectively.\n  These are a few of the important provisions in this legislation. But \nhere I would like to focus on language in the bill that was adopted on \na bipartisan basis at committee. The provisions, sections 304 and 307 \nof the bill, ensure that the congressional Intelligence Committees are \nfully informed of all intelligence activities.\n  The National Security Act of 1947 requires the President to ``ensure \nthat the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and \ncurrently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States. \n. .''.\n  Even more than other committees, the Intelligence Committee relies on \nthe executive branch to provide it with information. Without full and \ntimely notification of intelligence programs, problems, and plans, the \ncommittee cannot judge whether agencies have adhered to the law, nor \ncan we judge whether changes in authorities or resources are needed to \nbetter protect national security.\n  It was, in fact, Congress's lack of regular oversight that led to the \ncreation\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nof the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1976. Following the Church \nCommittee's report on Executive abuses, the Senate established the \nCommittee to ``provide vigilant legislative oversight over the \nintelligence activities of the United States to assure that such \nactivities are in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.''\n  Thirty years after the Senate Intelligence Committee was created, \nhowever, it is not living up to its charge. Members of the committee \nare not provided with sufficient information on intelligence programs \nand activities to legislate or oversee to intelligence community. \nProvisions in the stalled legislation--the Intelligence authorization \nbill--would fix this problem.\n  A good example of how the system fails to work is the so-called \nTerrorist Surveillance Program, which was publicly revealed last \nDecember but which had not previously been briefed to the committees.\n\n  According to the White House, this National Security Agency program \nwas too sensitive to be briefed to the 15 Senators on the committee--\nthe 15 Senators hand-selected by the majority and minority leaders for \nthis assignment.\n  Instead, the President and Vice President decided to inform only 8 of \nthe 535 Members of Congress: the party leadership in both houses and \nthe leadership of the two intelligence committees.\n  The National Security Act does provide for limited briefings to these \neight Members of Congress but only for especially sensitive covert \nactions. The NSA program is not a covert action.\n  The administration also points to statute saying that it must take \n``due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of \nclassified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and \nmethods or other exceptionally sensitive matters. . .''\n  The 1980 Senate report accompanying this ``due regard'' provision \nexplained this provision more directly--and makes clear that it does \nnot allow the administration to restrict information from the committee \nindefinitely as was done with the Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n  The report recognized ``that in extremely rare circumstances a need \nto preserve essential secrecy may result in a decision not to impart \ncertain sensitive aspects of operations or collection programs to the \noversight committees in order to protect extremely sensitive \nintelligence sources and methods.''\n  The ``due regard'' language that the administration cites was \nintended, at most, to limit briefings on the most sensitive aspects of \noperations, in extremely rare circumstances. It was also expected that \nwithholding this sensitive information would be a temporary measure. \nThis language was not intended to conceal the existence of entire \nprograms from all committee members.\n\n  So in effect, the White House has broadly interpreted the National \nSecurity Act to void meeting its responsibility to inform Congress.\n  This Intelligence authorization bill's changes to the National \nSecurity Act close the loopholes but, in fact, are far more generous to \nthe executive branch than many would like. The bill acknowledges that \nthere are times when not all Members have to be ``fully and currently'' \nbriefed on all intelligence matters. However, in those cases, it \nrequires that all committee members receive a summary of the \nintelligence collection or covert action in question.\n  This arrangement would allow the intelligence agencies to protect the \nmost sensitive details of sources and methods, but crucially, it would \nallow the full committee to assess the legality, costs and benefits, \nand advisability of an intelligence operation.\n  The authorization bill also changes a definition in the National \nSecurity Act to make clear that the requirement to keep the committees \n``fully and currently informed'' means that all Members will be kept \ninformed. Congress has allowed the intelligence community to brief only \nthe chairman and vice chairman on too many programs for too long.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues that full committees, not a \nsingle Democrat and Republican, vote to authorize programs and funding. \nAll Members must be informed if they are to perform their \nConstitutional duties.\n  The pending authorization bill would make one additional change to \nwhat it means for an intelligence activity to be authorized by \nCongress.\n  Stemming from the wiretapping abuses in the 1970s and because of the \nspecial challenges to conducting oversight of classified programs, the \nNational Security Act prohibits the use of appropriated funds for any \nintelligence activities unless they are authorized by Congress. The \npending bill would specify that an activity can only be ``authorized'' \nif the members of the authorizing committees have been fully briefed on \nit--or given a summary in the especially sensitive cases I described \nbefore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/06/senate-section/article/S9069-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
