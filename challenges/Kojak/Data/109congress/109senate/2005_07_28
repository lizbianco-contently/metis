Mr. President, this morning we will begin with a period of \nmorning business for 60 minutes. Following that time, we will resume \nconsideration of S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nlegislation. Senator Kohl has an amendment pending related to trigger \nlocks, and there will be an hour of debate on that amendment prior to \nthe vote. That vote should begin before noon, in the next 2\\1/2\\ hours. \nThe managers will continue to work through the day to see what \nadditional amendments are ready for votes. The cloture vote could be as \nearly as 1 a.m. Friday morning. We haven't set the vote for that time. \nI mention that early hour only to highlight the fact that we have so \nmuch work to do.\n  We have conference reports, the gun liability bill, nominations, all \nof which we need to accomplish before we leave for the recess. We have \nthe Interior appropriations conference report that has the veterans \nhealth money in it that we have addressed before. We have the energy \nconference report, which I believe is very close; the highway \nconference report, which has not been filed yet but which will be \nhopefully later today. We have the Legislative appropriations \nconference report. Once we address the pending bill, we can hopefully \nexpedite completion of all of the remaining measures prior to the \nAugust break. I will be working with the Democratic leader to schedule \nthese important items over the next couple of days.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the leader be good enough to yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several of us have amendments directly \nrelated to the underlying legislation. We understand the time goes to 1 \no'clock this evening. I have two amendments dealing with the ability of \nterrorists to purchase weapons. I know both Senators from New Jersey \nhave amendments. We are more than willing to enter into short time \nagreements. We want to cooperate on the conference reports, but we \nunderstand the process and the procedure that is going on is that the \nmajority is making a judgment decision about which amendments we are \ngoing to consider and which ones we are not.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to our distinguished colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, there have been several filed amendments. I \nmentioned 1 o'clock today because then we will have the whole universe \nof filed amendments. We are going to proceed and have a rollcall vote \non the trigger lock amendment before noon today, and then we need to \nlook at each of the amendments. Including the amendments mentioned, \nSenator Levin has an amendment, Senator Lautenberg, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has filed two amendments. We will be looking at \nthose amendments over the course of the day.\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader controls the time. Does \nthe leader yield for a question?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The only point is that, as the leader just said, we are \nfollowing a procedure where the leadership is going to look at the \namendments and then make their judgment as to whether the Senate will \nget a chance to consider these issues. I must say, that is an unusual \nprocedure to follow, when many of us are trying to cooperate with the \nleadership. We are more than glad to enter into short time agreements \nand then to let the Senate work its will.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9204-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, prior to the distinguished majority leader \nleaving the floor, I have a short statement I would like him to listen \nto. Then I will propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Two months ago, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 810, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Two months in legislative time may \nnot seem like a lot of time. But in the lives of people who are sick or \nwho have loved ones who are sick, it can be an eternity. The bill that \npassed the House was a rare victory of bipartisanship. I sincerely \nhoped, after having read that it had passed, that we would embrace the \nsame spirit of bipartisanship in the Senate and pass this legislation \nthat offers hope to millions of Americans who suffer from deadly \ndisease, and their families.\n  In May, I spoke with my friend, the distinguished majority leader, \nabout the need to take up this crucial legislation as soon as possible. \nI was assured that Senator Frist would work with Members of both sides \nof the aisle so that we could consider the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act before we broke for our August recess.\n  The month of July, of course, is almost over. We hope to be able to \ncomplete things in the next day or two or three. But this legislation, \nin the lives of the people I mentioned, can't go on forever. We believe \nthis legislation could produce and will produce stunning medical \nbreakthroughs to some of the dread diseases that affect mankind.\n  What we have been asking is simple. We propose that the Senate take \nup two bills: the stem cell bill, which is H.R. 810, and a blood cord \nbill, which is S. 1317, just like the House bill. Instead, we have \nheard that we are going to consider six bills, and now we read seven \nbills. We haven't seen the language of all seven.\n  It doesn't have to be that complicated, I don't think. The House \ndealt with the issue very simply, and we should do the same.\n  A bipartisan majority supported the stem cell bill in the House. I \nbelieve there is a tremendous body of Senators who will also support \nthis legislation. Every day we delay consideration of this bill is \nanother day we deny hope to millions of Americans and people throughout \nthe world with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, \nheart disease, and diabetes, to name only a few.\n  These patients, as I have said, don't have the luxury of time like \nsome of us do. Let's have an up-or-down vote on these bills and send \nthem to the President as quickly as possible--like today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 119, H.R. 810, the stem cell research \nbill, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 156, S. 1317, the cord blood and bone \nmarrow transplant bill; that the committee substitute be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read the third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The issue of \nsupport for stem cell research is one that I believe deserves \nexamination by this body. Stem cell research itself is very promising. \nI ran a very large multidisciplinary transplant center, and part of \nthat was a transplant arm that transplanted literally hundreds of \npeople with cord blood--or with bone marrow transplants, which is very \nsimilar to using cord blood, which one of the bills addresses. Passage \nof that bill would extend that therapy--which is with adult stem \ncells--with the variance of cord blood. I agree that passage of that \nbill would help hundreds of people by establishing registries that \ncould be easily accessed.\n  H.R. 810, Calendar No. 119, the stem cell research bill--the bill the \nDemocratic leader mentioned--is also a bill that I believe should be \naddressed in this body. It is a bill that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives in a bipartisan way.\n  In trying to address those two bills, I have extended to both sides \nof the aisle the opportunity to have clean up-or-down votes on those \nbills, as well as a fascinating new arena of research--very promising--\nthat gives an alternative not to the Castle bill or the H.R. 810 bill, \nbut an alternative where you don't have to destroy embryos at all, with \nthe opportunity to develop what are called pluripotential stem cells, \nor embryonic-like stem cells, which also should be addressed.\n  Thus, my proposal has been to address the cord blood bill, H.R. 810, \nthe alternative new research, where embryos do not have to be \ndestroyed; a cloning bill, Senator Brownback's bill; and a bone marrow \nbill. I have been unsuccessful in trying to bring that to the Senate \nfloor. There are concerns on our side of the aisle about that \napproach--having clean votes on these bills.\n  I am not going to give up on the stem cell issue because the research \nis hugely promising. I think, although each of us has individual \nthoughts about the potential of stem cells and the moral and ethical \nissues around stem cells, it deserves our body politic addressing the \nissue. So with that, I will continue to address the issue. I hope that \nafter we come back over the recess, we will be able to address the \nissue.\n  I do object to the unanimous consent request, as we finish over the \nlast 48 hours with our business on the floor of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9204-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before leaving the floor, if I can have \nthe attention of our minority leader. Is it the understanding of the \nleader in propounding this request that the measures proposed in the \nrequest had bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, and he \nbelieves as I believe--and I see my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, \nwho is a great leader on this, who believes as well--that there is very \nstrong bipartisan support for the legislation, and we could, in a \nreasonable period of time--really in a matter of hours--pass the \nlegislation and still not exclude the possibility of continued debate \nand discussion on the other measures relating to stem cells; and that \nthis would permit us to act before August 9, which would be the fourth \nyear since we had the limitation and restriction on stem cell research, \nthe kind of research that 80 Nobel laureates in a letter to President \nsaid offers the greatest opportunity for progress in the areas of \nParkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, cancer, and\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\nso many other diseases--do I understand the position of the Senator \nfrom Nevada is that he believes the progress taken in the House of \nRepresentatives in a bipartisan way should be given the opportunity for \naction in the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my friend that I believe there \nis a significant majority in the Senate that would quickly support both \nof these bills. I say that without any hyperbole. I believe without \nquestion that a significant number would vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the position of the Senator from Nevada that this \nis the same kind of research that, as I mentioned earlier, Nobel \nlaureates indicate offers the greatest opportunity for progress in \ndealing with the kinds of illnesses and diseases that just about every \nfamily in America in one way or the other is affected by, and he \nbelieves, as I do, that this offers an enormous opportunity for hope \nand progress in conquering or curing these diseases?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with scientists, physicians, \npeople who have diseases, and the families of those who have diseases, \nand there is a sparkle of hope and anticipation from the scientific \ncommunity, from the people who are ill, and from their loved ones--a \nsparkle of hope and opportunity that I have never seen before. There is \nthe hope that these children, for example, who are stuck with needles \ntens of thousands of times in their little lives will no longer have to \nhave that done; the hope that someone who is beginning Parkinson's \nsyndrome will be able to be cured. This is hope I have never seen \nbefore.\n  We need to go forward with this as quickly as possible. That is why \nfor us in the Senate, a couple of months is not much. For those people \nwho are sick and the loved ones of those people, it is an eternity. I \ncan remember Steve Rigalio, an executive at Nevada Power, the largest \npower company in Nevada, who got sick with this disease. I personally \nwatched this man. He had Lou Gehrig's disease. I personally watched \nthis man deteriorate before my eyes. He was dead in a matter of months. \nThe average life expectancy from the time the disease is diagnosed is \n16 months. That is why the time we spend here is so important and why \nwe must move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this time I have taken \nthis morning be charged to leader time and not to morning business \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I might follow up on the discussion now \non the Senate floor, might I ask the distinguished majority leader a \nquestion. It is this Senator's understanding, and I think the \nunderstanding of others with whom I have spoken, that the distinguished \nmajority leader, during the last work period--I think that was prior to \nthe Memorial Day--no, before the Fourth of July break, I guess it was. \nIt was my understanding that the majority leader had made a commitment \nthat we would bring up a stem cell bill prior to the August recess. I \nmay be mistaken. If so, I stand to be corrected.\n  My question is to the distinguished majority leader, was a commitment \nmade to bring up the stem cell bill? If so, I am wondering why we have \nnot done so and why we have waited until 2 days before we leave and we \nstill don't have a stem cell bill before us?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Democratic \nleader, our colleagues from both Iowa and Massachusetts. It gives me an \nopportunity to make it clear. My belief both in the science, the \npotential--we have to be careful not to overpromise. I know my \ncolleagues are aware of that. As a physician, you never overpromise and \ngive false hope. You have to be very careful. On the other hand, I \nunderstand the huge promise of this science, the proven therapies of \nadult stem cells, as well as these magnificent embryonic stem cells. \nUnfortunately, the only way you can obtain them is from the destruction \nof the blastocyst. That is the ethical issue everybody struggles with.\n  As majority leader, people come to me all the time and have this \ndiscussion in a very personal way, about the complexities and the \nadvancing science coming together in a nexus that we are going to \nincreasingly have to face in this Chamber. Both of my colleagues who \nhave spoken this morning have been real leaders in that field. I, in \nthe last 2 months, have said we have a responsibility to come back and \nreview policy--policy where you have advancing science. You have moral \nconsiderations for each one of us, but that is our responsibility.\n\n  As individuals, we have different feelings, but as a body politic, \nthis body needs to address them. Now, in doing that, I have put on the \ntable, as leader and in discussions with the Democratic leader for the \nlast 6 weeks, the opportunity to address the Castle bill, H.R. 810, \nwhich passed the House, and bring it to the Senate floor free of \namendments. The bill is not written very well. It doesn't have the \nethical construct that I believe we absolutely need.\n  So I think the bill is not ideal. But to give the opportunity to have \na vote on that bill, to give the opportunity to have a vote on the cord \nblood bill, which is proven therapy--and cord blood can be used, and \nbone marrow transplants are used right now for thousands of people. \nThat is adult stem cells. Then to address the newer science, which is \ntoo preliminary but gets through a lot of ethical issues--right now, to \nget the stem cells, it requires the destruction of the embryo. There is \na science out there that is preliminary but promising, and maybe you \ndon't have to destroy embryos to get these cells. That really has been \ndeveloped in talking to scientists, and that deserves consideration on \nthe floor as well because it gets beyond all the ethical \nconsiderations.\n  As we said, let's get clean shots on these three bills so everybody \ncan express themselves and see where the votes are. Others have come \nforward, and my colleague from Kansas says he cannot agree to that, to \ngiving these bills up-or-down votes on the floor without the \nconsideration also of another very important bill, and that is the \ncloning bill, which is an element a little bit outside of just the \ndeveloping embryos and the destruction of embryos. So I put that offer \non the table after discussion with the Democratic leader.\n  With that, other people have their individual bills. That is why we \nare not addressing it right now, because I have not been able to get \nunanimous consent to do that. What I hope both of my colleagues and \nothers recognize is that I believe, as leader, it is an important issue \nthat has to be addressed by this body. It needs ongoing review, and I \nam trying to do just that. I have been denied that by the body thus \nfar. To bring up a bill and pass it today, which strikes at the moral \nand ethical fundamentals of each and every one of us, and try to just \ntake that single bill--or just two bills through without respecting my \ncolleagues, I just cannot do that. I look forward to working with both \nof my colleagues on this important issue, which I believe needs to be \naddressed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the majority leader. It is this Senator's \nunderstanding that there have been a number of different bills proposed \nto deal with cloning and a number of other issues that don't really \npertain to the issue of embryonic stem cell research as the bill was \npassed by the House.\n  Is it not true, I ask the distinguished majority leader, that H.R. \n810--the bill we are talking about that passed the House with a \nbipartisan majority and has a number of supporters on both sides of the \naisle in the Senate--has bipartisan support in the Senate? Last year, I \nwill say in further expanding on my question, I think there were 58 \nSenators who signed a letter in support of that legislation, many of \nthe same Senators who are still here. So it has a lot of bipartisan \nsupport. These other bills, we don't know. In fact, I say to the \ndistinguished majority leader, there are a couple of bills we heard \nabout but we have never seen any language on.\n  My question to the majority leader is: Why can't we bring up the bill \nthat passed the House, which everyone knows about--it is clear, it is \nstraightforward, it passed the House, as I said,\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nwith a bipartisan majority, it has bipartisan support here; we all know \nit has enough votes to pass probably many more than even 60 votes, I \nwould venture to guess--why can't we take that up, pass it, get it to \nthe President, and then when we come back in September, we can take up \nthese other bills?\n  I do not have any problem with these other bills coming up. Some I \nmay support when they come up. To bring them all up together clouds and \nconfuses the issue. Why can't we just bring up the House bill, simple, \nstraightforward, have a limited debate on it, and vote it up or down as \nthey did in the House, I ask my leader?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the majority \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the question. It \ngives me the opportunity to show the work and the challenge it is to \naddress an issue that strikes at the science and ethical concerns.\n  My approach has been to include what I think the Senator from Iowa \nwants, and that is a clean up-or-down-vote on this bill. I have real \nconcerns with how that bill is written, and I will give several \nexamples of why it bothers me a bit the way it is written and passing \nas a clean bill. But I am willing to do that if I can take into \nconsideration the moral concerns and scientific concerns of others in \nthis body and give them the same opportunity that the Senator from Iowa \nis asking for, and, thus, put together a group, a defined group, but \nnot an unlimited group--we will be voting up or down on all sorts of \nvotes--but see where everybody is on alternative ways: You do not have \nto destroy embryos to get the same cells you get from embryos, the cord \nblood bill, H.R. 810, and the cloning bill. It is a separate issue but \ninvolves the creation of embryos and ultimately the destruction of \nembryos.\n  That is what we are talking about. That is my attempt. It is going to \ntake a while on the floor of the Senate because of the fact of it not \nhaving gone through the committee process and the fact everybody does \nstand in little different positions, from an ethical standpoint, on any \nof the bills.\n  On H.R. 810, the consent process is inadequate, from my standpoint. \nThere is not an ideal ethical construct. It says informed consent, but \nit does not specifically talk about the potential for financial \nincentives between, say, a physician and an in vitro fertilization \nclinic. That is not addressed specifically in the bill. Instead of \nvoting up or down, I would like to at least discuss those issues.\n  Another issue--there is informed consent and the financial \nincentives--would be if we pass it, it is passed forever; there is no \nopportunity to come back and look at it on a periodic basis, say, every \n4 or 5 years.\n  I mention those concerns because I am willing to step back and give a \nclean vote on that if we can take into consideration other people's \nissues or their particular bills. I am a little surprised my colleagues \nhave not taken me up on that opportunity, but since they have not, we \nwill have to come back and figure the best way to address it when we \nget back after the recess.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nresponse. I know Senator Kennedy wants time to make a speech. On the \nstem cell bill, I say to my friend from Tennessee, the distinguished \nleader, the clock is ticking. It does have a lot of support. There may \nbe a lot of ideas out there. No bill that ever passes here has 100-\npercent approval by everybody of every, as they say, ``jot and tittle'' \nin the bill. If I were to rewrite H.R. 810, I might want to write it \ndifferently myself.\n  The fact is a lot of thought was given to it. The disease groups that \nrepresent the very ill people in this country--the Juvenile Diabetes \nFoundation, Spinal Cord Injury Foundation, and a whole host of other \ngroups--have put their stamp of approval on this bill. They want it \npassed.\n  It just seems to me that the more we dawdle around here--I understand \nwe are in the last couple of days. We have been here all of July. This \nbill, H.R. 810, has been sitting here. We could have taken it up at any \ntime. It is this Senator's observation that all of a sudden all these \nother bills are popping up on cloning, chimeras, and others, which I am \nnot saying are not important issues, but they are separate and aside \nfrom this issue.\n  If the distinguished majority leader wants to bring those up at some \nother time for debate and amendments and bring them up for a straight \nup-or-down vote, that is fine, I don't have a problem with that, but \ndon't tie them in with a bill that has strong majority support on both \nsides of the aisle, strong bipartisan support, as was shown in the \nHouse, and one which, if passed, could be sent to the President right \naway for his signature and which could really open the door so our \nscientists could get to work on embryonic stem cell research.\n  It seems--I am not accusing anyone of this, but it is the process we \ngo through sometimes--there is a lot of smoke and mirrors going on, and \na lot of bills are popping up to confuse the issue and to try to pull \npeople away from support of H.R. 810.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Tennessee, I hope that we can have \nsome assurance from the leader that when we get back in September that \nwe will take up H.R. 810 and, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, if \nthey want to bring up these other bills at some other time, in some \nother context, I can assure him this Senator would not object. I would \nhave no objection to it. But right now there are objections to bringing \nthem up at the same time, not just on this side of the aisle, but I \nalso understand on the other side of the aisle.\n  It seems to me the clearest way is to bring up H.R. 810 and the cord \nblood bill and get them out of the way and deal with the others. I hope \nthe majority leader will assure us we will do that when we come back in \nSeptember.\n  Mr. FRIST. To complete this, from my standpoint, I want it to be very \nclear, to be understood that the majority leader of the Senate has \noffered to his colleagues to bring up six bills. The statement is made \nthis is going to have an overwhelming bipartisan support. It did in the \nHouse. All I am saying is, let's, in a short period of time--what has \nbeen offered to both sides, is spend a day debating these six bills \nwhich do, if you look at the six bills, take the range of ethical \nconsiderations and moral considerations of this body and do look at the \nscience--alternative ways of developing embryonic stem cells--and let's \ntake them to the floor and allow each one to get a vote, and let's see \nwhere the votes are.\n  It may be the bill of my distinguished colleague from Iowa will get a \nmajority vote or a supermajority vote, but so may the cord blood bill. \nI hope it does. I think it will save lives. The alternative bill, let's \nsee what it is. It has never been discussed on the floor. I would hope \nthe distinguished colleague from Iowa would vote for it because there \nis potential hope there, as well as obtaining embryonic stem cells from \nembryos. Also, the cloning bill. Let's debate it in a defined period of \ntime and vote on that. Let's see where the body is. That has been my \napproach, and that has been the offer to both sides.\n  The Senator is correct, on both sides of the aisle there is this \nhesitation to do it. I need for my colleagues to understand that I am \npushing for clean votes over a period of time, where we can address the \nvery issues my two colleagues want to address.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \ndeep sorrow and regret that the Republican leadership has allowed \nanother month to go by without taking action on the bipartisan stem \ncell bill approved overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives.\n  Over the last several weeks, Republican leaders in the Senate have \nignored the true priorities of the American people. They have denied \nthe Senate the opportunity to provide our troops the protections they \nneed against attack. They have denied the Senate the chance to \nguarantee funding for veterans' health, and to raise the minimum wage, \nand to allow importation of lower cost medicine from Canada and other \nnations.\n  And they have stalled and delayed, and twisted and turned, to deny \naction on legislation to unlock the healing potential of stem cell \nresearch.\n  They say there is no time for stem cells, or for the needs of our \ntroops, or our veterans, or working families. There's plenty of time to \nprotect the\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\nmakers of lethal assault weapons--but no time for lifesaving cures.\n  The bill is right there, Mr. President, right there on that desk in \nfront of you. At any time, the majority leader could walk over, pick it \nup and have a vote on a bill that would bring new hope to millions of \nAmericans.\n  For years, patients and their families waited for a medical \nbreakthrough to provide new hope for serious illnesses like Parkinson's \ndisease, spinal injury, and Alzheimer's disease.\n  Then at last, dedicated scientists made that breakthrough. They \ndiscovered stem cells, which can repair the injuries that cause untold \nsuffering and shorten lives.\n  The cruel irony is that just as medicine was giving patients new \nhope, the Bush administration snatched it away through needless \nrestrictions on stem cell research,\n  In a few days, on August 9, patients across America will mark the \nfourth tragic anniversary of that cruel decision.\n  We in the United States Senate had the opportunity--no, we had the \nresponsibility--to see that August 9 of this year did not mark 4 years \nof failure and 4 years of missed opportunity.\n  But the Republican leadership would not let us meet that \nresponsibility. They let the first week of July slip by, and then the \nsecond, and now the last--all with no action on this urgently needed \nlegislation.\n  Every day that we delay is another day of falling behind in the race \nto cure diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and many other serious \nillnesses.\n  It is another day for America to lose ground to Korea, Singapore, \nBritain, and other nations in the competition for global leadership in \nbiotechnology.\n  Most of all, it is another day of shattered hopes for millions of \npatients and their families across America.\n  Some respond to the failure of the current policy by saying we should \nexplore new ways to develop embryonic stem cells. I agree. Let's \nexplore the potential of new discoveries in genetics and cell science \nto improve the ways we can tap the potential of stem cells. But let's \nnot restrict essential research while scientists explore speculative \nand preliminary theories.\n  Some say we should encourage research on stem cells from the blood in \numbilical cords or on adult stem cells from bone marrow and other \ntissues. Again, I agree. We should seek help for patients wherever it \nmay be found. But it makes no sense to limit medical research to one \nnarrow channel when the Nation's leading scientists agree that these \nalternatives have a more limited potential than embryonic stem cells. \nAs a letter signed by 80 Nobel laureates in February 2001 stated:\n\n       Current evidence suggests that adult stem cells have \n     markedly restricted differentiation potential. Therefore, for \n     disorders that prove not to be treatable with adult stem \n     cells, impeding human pluripotent stem cell research risks \n     unnecessary delay for millions of patients who may die or \n     endure needless suffering while the effectiveness of adult \n     stem cells is evaluated.\n\n  The conclusion of an NIH report in June 2001 is clear:\n  Stem cells in adult tissues do not appear to have the same capacity \nto differentiate as do embryonic stem cells.\n  It would be cruel to base the hopes of millions of patients on an \nideological conclusion that these experts are wrong. By all means, \nlet's pursue vigorous research on adult stem cells, but let's not \ndeceive the American public into thinking it's an adequate substitute \nfor embryonic stem cell research.\n  Legislation should be an expression of our values, and our \nlegislation says loud and clear that we value patients and their \nfamilies--not rigid ideology.\n  It is a travesty that no action has been taken on this lifesaving \nmeasure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nunanimous consent request offered today by Senator Reid. The Senator \nhas asked unanimous consent for the Senate to take up H.R. 810, the \nStem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and S. 1317, the Bone Marrow and \nCord Blood Therapy and Research Act.\n  Both of these bills have been passed by the House and are sitting at \nthe desk waiting to be passed by the Senate and sent to the President \nfor his signature.\n  The month of July has come and is nearly gone. Yet these two House-\npassed bills, with strong bipartisan support, sit and wait at the desk.\n  The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act has 41 sponsors--Republicans \nand Democrats alike. This legislation is the result of many years of \nbipartisan cooperation in both the House and Senate. I am pleased to \njoin my colleagues, Senator Arlen Specter, Tom Harkin, Orrin Hatch, Ted \nKennedy, and Gordon Smith, who have worked tirelessly on behalf of \npatients and their families across this Nation to see that embryonic \nstem cell research moves forward.\n  This legislation is proof positive that Senators from many different \npoints of view, be they liberal or conservative, pro-life or pro-\nchoice, can work together on legislation that will help speed the pace \nof cures and treatments for more than 110 million Americans.\n  Identical legislation passed the House on May 24 by a vote of 238 to \n194. Congressman Mike Castle, Republican, Delaware, and Diana DeGette, \nDemocrat, Colorado, are to be commended for their tireless work in \ngetting this bill passed in the House.\n  It is essential that the Senate move quickly to pass this bill. The \nclock is ticking. August 9 marks the fourth anniversary of President \nBush's policy limiting Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. At the time it was thought there were 78 stem cell lines \navailable to researchers, today that number is 22. And all 22 of the \nlines available are contaminated by mouse feeder cells and not usable \nfor research in humans.\n  So why has the Senate still not acted? The simple unanimous consent \nrequest put forth by Senator Reid would allow the Senate to vote on \nthis bill as early as today. We could send it to the President for his \nsignature tonight.\n  What is going on here is an attempt to obscure what is a very simple \nissue. What is going on here is an attempt to allow votes on other \nbills in order to pull votes away from H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act.\n  I think it is appropriate for the Senate to debate other related \nissues at a later time. In fact, yesterday I introduced S. 1520, the \nHuman Cloning Ban Act--with 25 bipartisan cosponsors--which would \nprohibit once and for all the immoral and unethical act of human \nreproductive cloning. I believe strongly that Congress must pass a \nprohibition on human cloning or attempts to clone human beings.\n  But first we must act on the unanimous consent request offered today \nby Senator Reid, and I hope that request will be one of the first \nissues the Senate deals with after the August recess.\n  Embryonic stem cell research is the bright new frontier of medicine. \nWe owe it to the 110 million Americans suffering daily with \ndebilitating and catastrophic diseases to pass H.R. 810.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9207-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on another subject, the \nunderlying legislation, the gun immunity bill. This bill is deceptively \nnamed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but it will make \nit virtually impossible to bring lawsuits against the gun industry, \neven in circumstances in which the industry's conduct contributes to \nunlawful gun violence.\n  The bill purports to exempt suits in which the manufacturers and \nsellers engage in illegal or negligent conduct, but these exemptions \nare poorly defined and clearly would not cover many types of bad \nconduct.\n  The Senate majority leader says this bill is of urgent importance, \ntaking precedence over the Defense bill because the Department of \nDefense faces the real prospect of having to outsource side arms for \nour soldiers to foreign manufacturers. But the real story is that the \nRepublican leadership and the Bush administration will do whatever it \ntakes to give the gun industry all that it wants.\n  The NRA wants gun dealers and manufacturers to be protected from \nlawsuits. The NRA expects--the NRA demands--that this body remove the \nlast resort for victims of gun violence against negligent and often \ncomplicit gun dealers and manufacturers by barring all types of cases.\n  Let's be clear about what this bill does not do.\n  It does not help our law enforcement officials fight crime or \nterrorism.\n  It does not meet the urgent need to strengthen any of our gun control \nlaws.\n  It does not affect--it does not address at all--the rights or ability \nof law-abiding citizens to purchase and own a gun.\n  It does not have anything to do with the second amendment, no matter \nhow you interpret the language of that amendment.\n  This bill has one motivation: payback by the Bush administration and \nthe Republican leadership of the Congress to the powerful special \ninterests of the National Rifle Association.\n  As the New York Times reported less than 2 weeks ago, Wayne LaPierre, \nthe executive vice president of the NRA, made it clear that the NRA \nexpected total support from its allies--or else.\n  Mr. LaPierre said, ``It's simply bad politics to be on the wrong side \nof the second amendment at election time,'' asserting that Vice \nPresident Al Gore lost the 2000 Presidential election because he \nsupported gun control, including a Federal ban on assault weapons.\n  That is the same assault weapons ban that President Bush told the \nAmerican people he supported but then allowed to expire.\n  We know what happened when the NRA pushed this special interest bill \nlast year. When the Senate voted to reauthorize the assault weapons ban \nas part of the bill, the NRA called their supporters and instructed \nthem to vote against the bill for which it had just lobbied. What a \ndisgraceful spectacle, Members of this great body reversing themselves \non the Senate floor minutes before a vote because of a single call from \nthe NRA.\n  That same kind of raw special interest power is now being used again \nto take the Senate away from the important business of protecting our \nmen and women who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan so that a few \nunsavory gun dealers and gun manufacturers can channel powerful killing \nmachines into the hands of criminals and terrorists in this country \nwithout any regulation or judicial oversight whatever.\n  The manufacturing of guns, unlike the manufacturing of nearly every \nother consumer product in the country, is not subject to consumer \nproduct safety standards. As it stands, manufacturers and sellers in \nthe industry are free to design, make, and market these products with \nno independent review of their potential risk.\n  The gun industry is the only industry whose products are not subject \nto basic consumer health and safety regulation. Why stop with the gun \nindustry? Why not make tire manufacturers immune from lawsuits or car \nmanufacturers or bicycle manufacturers or toy manufacturers? Obviously, \nit would be absurd to shield any negligent manufacturers from liability \nfor their action. But when it comes to shielding the gun industry, the \nNRA is calling the tune and too many Members of this body are \ntragically dancing to it.\n  The other side also tells us that it is too burdensome on the gun \nindustry to fight these lawsuits. After all, we are told there are \nthousands of gun laws on the books and the Government can enforce them. \nLet us look at some of those gun laws and how the gun lobby has \nsystematically made it more difficult, and in some cases even \nimpossible, for the Government to police negligent gun dealers and \nmanufacturers while making it easier for criminals to get their hands \non guns.\n  Federal gun dealers are regulated under Federal law and required to \nperform background checks of gun buyers, but at the urging of the gun \nlobby several years ago, Congress drastically narrowed the definition \nof gun dealer. Now there are many unregulated individuals who do not \nmeet the new definition. These reckless and unlicensed dealers are now \nselling millions of guns to people, including criminals and terrorists, \nwithout background checks. All of that is legal because the U.S. \nCongress kowtowed to the NRA.\n  In the case of Afghanistan, our troops found an al-Qaida manual that \ninstructed terrorists on how to buy guns legally in the United States \nwithout having to undergo a background check. Al-Qaida understands that \nwe have created a mess that allows, even encourages, criminals and \nterrorists to traffic in guns. But we will not do anything about the \nso-called gun show loophole because the NRA has snapped its fingers and \nsaid no.\n  We are told by the other side that victims of gun violence do not \nneed recourse to the courts because the Government is already \ninspecting and overseeing the businesses of gun dealers. But is that \nthe whole story? Absolutely not. At the direction of the NRA, Congress \nlimited Federal inspection of gun dealers to once a year, and passed \nlaws making it virtually impossible for agents to conduct inspections \nmore than once a year. If an agent happens to inspect a negligent or \neven grossly negligent gun dealer in January, the dealer does not have \nto worry about the feds showing up for at least another year.\n  Federally regulated financial institutions can be inspected without \nnotice whenever and as often as the regulators deem appropriate. \nMeatpacking companies, shipyards, iron foundries, gas refineries can \nall be inspected without notice whenever and as often as the regulators \ndeem appropriate, but not gun dealers. Congress and the NRA have said \nthey can be inspected only once a year.\n  What difference does that make in the life of the average citizen? It \nmakes a lot of difference. Just ask the innocent victims of the DC \nsniper attacks. When the regulators cannot keep tabs on gun dealers it \nmeans the companies like Bull's Eye Shooter Supply Store, the dealer \nthat supplied the Bushmaster rifle to the DC snipers, can get away with \nsupposedly losing the rifle that ended up in the hands of DC snipers \nand losing more than 200 other guns that ended up who knows where.\n  The DC sniper victims had only the courts to turn to for recourse \nbecause Congress made it impossible for Federal agents to police \nunsavory gun dealers such as Bull's Eye. Now the NRA is telling us, \ntake away the courts, too. Why? An obvious answer is that gun dealers \nand manufacturers want to sell more guns.\n  Our laws are designed by the NRA to increase the sales of guns by \ndealers and manufacturers even if they are sold to or by criminals. The \nNRA is lavishly rewarded for lobbying successes and so are the Members \nof Congress who do their bidding. It is hard to reach any other \nconclusion. The unholy alliance and control of the legislative process \nagainst the safety of our citizens is immoral and it is a disgrace. But \nlet us look at the other outrageous actions that this body has taken \nbecause the NRA has demanded it.\n  Congress has cut Federal funding for the agency that oversees gun \ndealers\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nand manufacturers. In fact, the GAO has recently reported that the ATF \nis so underfunded that it would take 22 years to inspect the records of \nall gun dealers in this country just once. The GAO report has also \nfound that terrorists and people on the terrorist watch list are not \nautomatically barred from purchasing guns and are routinely buying guns \nin this country. This must stop.\n  The gun industry must have some accountability. That is why I am \noffering my amendment that would ensure that cases could be brought \nagainst gun manufacturers and dealers aiding or abetting a \nrepresentative of a designated foreign terrorist organization. One can \nfind a list of the designated foreign terrorist organizations on the \nInternet, and it includes al-Qaida and Hamas among others.\n  How can Congress deny victims the right to challenge a manufacturer \nor dealer that provided guns to a foreign terrorist organization which \ncaused them harm?\n  This administration continuously says that we are engaged in a war on \nterror, but it takes a position that the war on terror does not allow \nus to prevent terrorists from buying guns in this country. Because of \nthe actions of this administration, this Congress is caving to the NRA. \nTerrorists can now add assault weapons to their arsenals, all to \nappease the NRA so they will give campaign contributions and get out \nthe vote. This is not only a disgrace, it is criminal and it has to \nstop.\n\n  The hypocrisy is mind-boggling. After 9/11, the worst terrorist \nattack in the history of the Nation, the Justice Department, over the \nobjection of the FBI, at the urging of the NRA, decided that the \nGovernment had to destroy within 24 hours the background check records \nof all gun purchases. What is the rationale for the destruction of \nbackground checks of records in 24 hours? Former Attorney General \nAshcroft and the NRA decided that it was a violation of privacy rights \nof law-abiding citizens to have their records held on file for 90 days, \nas they have been for years since the passage of the Brady bill.\n  This is the same John Ashcroft who, in the immediate aftermath of 9/\n11, prohibited--that is right, he prohibited--the FBI from examining \nthe gun purchasing records of any of the 19 hijackers or any of the \n1,200 other terrorist suspects who were detained for questioning. What \nkind of society are we turning into? We are supposed to be protecting \nthis Nation from terrorism, not aiding and abetting terrorists.\n  Within days of the 9/11 attacks, we knew who the hijackers were. We \nknew where they sat on the planes. We saw some of their faces on \nsurveillance videos. We know what they had charged on their credit \ncards. We know where they had gone to school. We know where they lived, \nwhere they traveled. We know that they had tried to get pilots \nlicenses. We know they had looked for ways to transport hazardous \nchemicals, but we did not know where they or their terrorist friends \nhad purchased their firearms because we were worried about their \nprivacy rights and their rights to bear arms. Give me a break.\n  Every day, law-abiding Americans have their every move videotaped by \nsurveillance cameras. They are required to take off their shoes and \njackets and be searched at airports, have their luggage inspected and \nopened. Yet our Government worries about the privacy rights of \nterrorist gun owners and refuses to let the FBI look at gun purchase \nrecords of suspected terrorists? The Justice Department refuses to stop \nsuspected terrorists from buying guns, and then it destroys those \nrecords in 24 hours? Something is rotten here, and it has to stop.\n  I ask again, whose side are we on? Instead of addressing the real \nissues that can make our country and our communities safer, we are \nconsidering a bill that will close the courthouse door to victims of \ngun crimes and give a free pass to the handful of gun dealers and gun \nmanufacturers who sell firearms to terrorists and criminals. We are \ndoing it to appease the special interests of the NRA.\n  Law-abiding citizens who sell or purchase firearms do not want to \ngive criminals a free pass, but that is exactly what this bill will do. \nIf we vote for it, we will be aiding and abetting these wrongdoers, \njust as Congress has done for years at the command of the NRA. This \nbill gives greater protection to the gun industry than Congress gave to \nthe health care industry, to teachers and volunteers under the headline \nof tort reform. The legislation is so extreme that it requires the \nimmediate dismissal of any cases pending in either State or Federal \ncourt.\n  By doing so, the bill denies victims their day in court. It amounts \nto an unprecedented interference with the judicial branch of Government \nand is an outrageous violation of the rule of law.\n  The bill's supporters misrepresent the real goal of the lawsuits \nfiled against this industry. These lawsuits are not filed in an effort \nto bankrupt the industry. Like all tort suits, the victims turn to the \ncourts to obtain compensation for their injuries and demand responsible \nconduct.\n  Let's be clear and debunk a few myths that the other side is \nspinning. The gun industry is not uniquely burdened with lawsuits. They \njust do not like what the public discovers about the industry and its \npractices when documents are produced in litigation.\n  This immunity bill is not aimed only at frivolous lawsuits. The truth \nis, it bars almost all actions for negligence. If this bill had become \nlaw last year, the families of the victims of the DC snipers would have \nbeen barred from suing and receiving the settlement from the gun dealer \nin Washington State that lost and could not account for more than 200 \nguns in its inventory, like the assault rifle used by the DC snipers, \nthat were used in the commission of other crimes.\n  If passed, the bill forces the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the \nfamily of Massachusetts victim Danny Guzman, an innocent bystander shot \non Christmas Eve in 1999. Danny was killed by a gun stolen by an \nemployee working in a gun manufacturing plant. Danny, here in the \npicture with his cousin, was a true victim of negligent conduct. This \ngun factory lacked adequate security, recordkeeping, and other \nreasonable safeguards to prevent employees from taking guns in their \npockets out of the plant. The lack of security was so bad that the \nowners of the plant did not even know the guns were missing. Danny's \nmother and his two surviving daughters sued the manufacturer claiming \nthat it had negligently hired criminals to work in its plant and had \nsuch irresponsible security that allowed them to walk out of the plant \nwith guns that did not have serial numbers. One of these guns was used \nto shoot Danny. This case should not be dismissed.\n  This bill will result in the automatic dismissal of a case just filed \nin Pennsylvania. Anthony Oliver, a 14-year-old boy, was killed by a \nhandgun that discharged accidentally when he was playing with his \nfriends. Anthony's life was cut short due to the gun seller's reckless \nconduct. His family filed a case against the gun companies that \nnegligently allowed one of Anthony's friends to obtain a handgun. The \ndealer who sold the gun had a history of supplying guns to criminals \nand not even taking the minimum step to screen the purchasers. Over a \n4-year period, Lou sold over 400 guns traced to criminals. Under this \nbill, Anthony's family will not get their day in court, and the \nirresponsible activities of this gun dealer and its supplier will not \nbe stopped. This case should not be dismissed.\n  This bill would also bar municipal lawsuits. If this case passes, \nfour pending cases involving New York City, the District of Columbia, \nGary, IN, and Cleveland, OH, will all be dismissed. This bill is not \nabout protecting the gun industry from bankruptcy. This bill is a \nblatant special interest bill to protect gun manufacturers and sellers \nwho provide guns to criminals and even terrorists.\n  With this bill, Congress is aiding and abetting in the perpetuation \nof these crimes. Enough is enough is enough. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in saying no to this shameful bill and get back to the serious \nissues that face our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I first commend the Senator from Massachusetts for \nexplaining what is before the Senate, not only today but yesterday and \nthe day before. Would the Senator be kind enough to tell those who are \nobserving and following this debate which bill we\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\ntook off the calendar, which bill we were considering, to move this \nbill on the calendar, this special interest bill to protect gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers from being held personally responsible \nfor their wrongdoing? Would the Senator from Massachusetts tell us what \nbill we pushed off the calendar to bring on this special interest bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Illinois knows that one of the most \nimportant bills that we consider at any time of the year is the Defense \nauthorization legislation. That is the legislation which provides basic \nresources and support for our armed services, not only in Iraq and \nAfghanistan but all over the world. It is the basic document which is \nthe expression of our national priority in terms of national security \nand national defense.\n  As one who has been here for some years, having been a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, we met in the day and in the evening to \nreport that bill out in a timely way so that it could be considered \nbefore the August recess. That is what we heard, as members of the \nArmed Services Committee, and we were in the process of doing that at \nthe end of last week. As a matter of fact, there was one amendment \noffered by the chairman of the committee to restore money for up-\narmoring humvees, which I welcomed the opportunity to support. The \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee had opposed that up-armoring \nat the time we had the supplemental. That is very important, making \nsure our men and women serving in Iraq are going to have the body armor \nand have the best in terms of their protection. That is what is in that \nlegislation. That is what we were considering. That is what we hoped to \ndeal with.\n  All of a sudden, out of the blue, the Republican leadership says, No, \nwe are going to pull that bill down and we will put it back on the \ncalendar and consider this special interest legislation, which they \nhave called up. They now use parliamentary procedures in order to even \ndeny those of us who want to amend that legislation the opportunity to \ndo so.\n  I don't know whether the Senator was here a few moments ago when our \nmajority leader was talking about stem cell research, which we wanted \nto take up, which offered such hope and opportunity to conquer \ndiseases. The majority leader said: We want everyone's views on our \nside of the aisle to be considered.\n  It is interesting. They want that on the stem cell research, but not \non this special interest legislation.\n  It is deplorable. I know of at least 20 amendments from Members of \nour side and the other side, amendments that would provide additional \nhelp and support for the National Guard, for our reservists in the \narmed services of this country, that would have provided additional \nstrengthening for our fighting men and women. To deflect that to \nconsider this special interest legislation that is just going to serve \nthe gun manufacturers makes no sense.\n  I know this is an extended answer. As the Senator remembers, we spent \n2 weeks on the credit card industry legislation and bankruptcy. We \nspent 2 weeks in order to protect the credit card industry. We spent 2 \nweeks after that on class action legislation. We spent more than a week \ndebating highways. We have spent 3 days on the Defense authorization \nbill. And then we have the Republican leadership pull that down? It \nmakes no sense to me.\n  I wonder what the service men and women think about our priorities \nwhen an action like that is taken.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question, I \nwould say to the Senator, through the Chair, that the Army Times, the \npublication for our U.S. Army and its soldiers who are risking their \nlives in Iraq, ran a headline story that the Senate pushed off the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, which included amendments \nwhich were being offered to provide additional financial assistance to \nthe widows and orphans of those soldiers who lost their lives in \ncombat, took away the bill which included an amendment to allow \nadditional payment for totally disabled veterans, and instead moved on \nthe floor this bill for one special interest group, the gun lobby.\n  The Senator has made it clear the Republican leadership considers \nthis bill, a National Rifle Association sponsored bill, more important \nthan the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could tell me if he knows \nof any other industry, any business in America which enjoys the same \nkind of immunity from liability for their wrongdoing--any other \nbusiness with immunity from liability that the gun industry and gun \ndealers are asking for in this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator knows the answer to that; that is, there is \nnone. This will be special, unique to a single industry that prides \nitself, as the spokesman for the NRA said--you better support this or \nelse; basically saying that to the Congress of the United States.\n\n  Just to complete the thought about the sense of priorities, as \nlegislators we basically express the priorities for the people of our \nState and the Nation. We express those priorities in our budget, on \nwhat we ought to be expending resources, and we express priorities by \nwhat we address on the floor of the Senate.\n  One of those amendments that was going to be offered to the Defense \nauthorization bill--I know the Senator from Michigan was going to \nprovide assurance that there was going to be mandatory spending to \nprotect the veterans who are coming back from Iraq so they are \nguaranteed the kind of health care they are guaranteed before they go \nover there and fight and become wounded and need those kinds of \nservices. That is offered in light of the fact that we are not \nproviding the resources to serve our veterans.\n  That is something worthy of debate on the floor of the Senate. It \nseems to me that has a lot more priority for debate and discussion and \ndecision by this body than the special interest legislation that we are \nconsidering with the National Rifle Association.\n  I ask whether the Senator would not agree with me on that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts another \nquestion about this bill. The Senator raises an important point. If a \ngun dealer in the United States sells a gun to someone----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Illinois will suspend, the \nSenator from Massachusetts wanted to be informed when he had 3 minutes \nleft. He has 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If a gun dealer in the United States has a history of \nselling guns to criminals--in other words, someone comes in and buys \n100 Saturday night specials, ``fill up my trunk with guns''--obviously, \nnot a sportsman or hunter or someone interested in personal defense, \nbut someone who comes in and buys clearly for guns to be sold through \nstraw purchasers to others--if the gun dealer has not even taken the \ntime to check the FBI's Most Wanted list when making a sale across the \ncounter, is this legislation saying that dealer, so negligent in his \nconduct, cannot be held personally responsible, or responsible as a \nbusiness, in court for the victims of the gun violence that follows \nfrom that negligent act?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes an absolutely accurate point. We have \nhere a list from the FBI of the Most Wanted fugitives. There is an \namendment to say at least they have to look at the FBI's Most Wanted \nfugitives. Under this legislation, if the gun dealer sells it to one of \nthe Most Wanted, they still get a free pass.\n  Under the current legislation, we are not even asking them to look on \nthe Internet for those who are going to be listed on the Internet as \nmembers of terrorist organizations. We are not even asking them to do \nthat. If they do, and they sell it, as we saw from the al-Qaida book \nover in Afghanistan saying go on in there and purchase it because you \nare not going to be bothered--we are not even holding them accountable \nto do that. Is that what we want to do, when we have seen what has \nhappened in London, and what is happening, and we appropriate more and \nmore resources for homeland security, not even to require that the gun \ndealer is going to check the Most Wanted list of the FBI?\n  We can't even offer that amendment so it will be voted on. We are \nbeing blocked by the power interests on the other side from even having \nthe Senate consider that amendment. That is the power of the NRA. They \nare not letting\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nany of these kinds of amendments dealing with the Most Wanted list or \nthe terrorist list--we can't even get it before the Senate. That is the \nlock, the hold that the NRA has. It is disgraceful.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts yields the \nfloor. The Democratic side has 30 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto conclude the morning business.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts has laid out the case. Can you \nimagine? We took the bill off the floor for the Department of Defense, \nfor our soldiers and their families, and said we didn't have time to \nfinish it this week because we had to go to this bill, the National \nRifle Association's most important bill, which says that gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers selling their firearms to those on the \nFBI Most Wanted list, or to those in terrorist organizations, would not \nbe held accountable for their misconduct? Where are the priorities of \nthis Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the Democratic side has expired. \nWho seeks recognition? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of arguments on the \nfloor in my day, but some of these arguments are some of the worst ever \nheard. I don't know, maybe I missed something. We were moving ahead on \nthe Defense authorization bill when all of a sudden we couldn't get \ncloture. We couldn't move ahead because of the very people who have \nbeen making these arguments, in a holy fashion, that they want to help \nour soldiers. Yet they filibuster by preventing cloture and preventing \na full acceptance of the Department of Defense authorization bill, and \nthen turn around and say we stopped them from amending the bill. If \nthey were stopped, it is because their amendments were not germane.\n  I have never heard arguments like this, that we are just going to \ngive gun dealers an absolute right to violate the law. They haven't \nread this legislation at all.\n  And then they bring in an antiterrorism argument. What they do not \ntell the American public is that there are millions of guns out there \nin the underworld that people can get. But that doesn't justify holding \nliable gun manufacturers--who manufacture guns for our soldiers, by the \nway; if they all go broke we will not have the guns for our soldiers--\nwhen somebody takes one of their guns and misuses it. The person \nmisusing it ought to be liable, not the gun manufacturer who cannot \nsupervise the persons to whom they legitimately sold guns.\n  Let's face it. The folks on that side of the aisle hate guns. They \ntalk in terms of, We want to take care of our hunters and our gun \ncollectors and people who love guns who are decent, law-abiding \ncitizens. But look over the years how they have argued against anything \nthat makes sense with regard to the right to manufacture weapons that \nwe have always had in this country, and the right to keep and bear \narms, which is explicitly in the Constitution. These are the same \npeople who are constantly arguing about things that are not explicitly \nin the Constitution, claiming that they should be given the \nsanctification of constitutional protection. Yet something that is \nexpressly written in the Constitution, they turn around and blast.\n  I could spend a lot of time on that, but that is not what I came over \nhere to do. All I can say is I find it amazing that an argument would \nbe made, after they voted against cloture--in other words, proceeding \nwith the Defense authorization bill, they voted against proceeding--and \nnow they are saying, Why didn't we proceed. I missed something maybe. \nBut I don't think so. This is just typical: Politics trumps everybody. \nNo one is saying, with regard to this issue of the gun manufacturer's \nright to manufacture guns that are legal, they have a legal right to do \nso--nobody is making the argument that dealers who are honest and \ndecent and honorable should not be able to sell those guns to decent, \nhonorable people. We have plenty of restrictions already in law against \nillegality with regard to the sale of weapons.\n  My gosh, is there no end to politics in these issues? This argument \nthat this modest bill gives criminals a free pass and aids and abets \nterrorists is as phony an argument as I have heard. And the argument \nthat it lets manufacturers off the hook for their wrongdoing--if they \ndo wrong, they are on the hook under this bill.\n  They are not doing wrong. That is the problem. What is wrong is the \nchief fundraiser of our friends on the left happens to be--the chief \nhard-money funder in this country happens to be the personal injury \ntrial lawyer for liberals. And those people literally are the reason \nwhy we have these, I think, misconceived arguments.\n  I could not sit here without saying something about it because it is \nhard to believe that they can stand and make these kinds of arguments. \nMuch as I respect my fellow Senators, it is mind-boggling that they can \nmake an argument that we are preventing going ahead with the DOD bill \nwhen they are the ones who stopped it. My gracious. Let me shift gears. \nI could talk for hours on that subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9211-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9211-S9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the nomination of Judge John Roberts to the \nSupreme Court presents the Senate with some real challenges and \nopportunities.\n  First, it allows us the specific opportunity to place on our Nation's \nhighest Court a man of impeccable qualifications and unquestioned \ncharacter. Everbody here knows that.\n  After an unprecedented degree of consultation with the Senate, \nPresident Bush has nominated a truly outstanding individual.\n  Judge Roberts has a strong background in terms of education and \nexperience.\n  Judge Roberts is a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard College--a \ndegree which he finished in just three years--and a magna cum laude \ngraduate of Harvard Law School, where he was the managing editor of the \nHarvard Law Review; meaning he is at the pinnacle of Law school \nstudents at the time throughtout the country.\n  He was a law clerk for two distinguished Federal judges: First for \nthe late Judge Henry Friendly on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit, widely recognized as one of the most influential \nappellate judges of his time; and next on the U.S. Supreme Court for \nthen-Associate Justice William Rehnquist. Now Chief Justice, he too is \none of the most outstanding jurists of his time.\n  Judge Roberts's career in legal practice covers both the public and \nprivate sectors.\n  He held several positions in two administrations, including Special \nAssistant to the Attorney General, Associate Counsel to the President, \nand Principal Deputy Solicitor General, all high positions. They don't \nget much higher in the law.\n  In between his stints in public service, Judge Roberts became a \nleading member of the prestigious law firm of Hogan and Hartson, an \ninternationally recognized law firm.\n  Overall, Judge Roberts became, by all accounts, one of the leading \npractitioners before the Supreme Court, arguing nearly 40 cases.\n\n  Not only does Judge Roberts have the education and experience, but \nhis colleagues in the bar tell us that he possesses the integrity and \ncharacter to make a fine member of the Supreme Court.\n  Just two years ago, the American Bar Association unanimously gave \nJudge Roberts its highest well qualified rating for serving in his \ncurrent position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. President, a second opportunity, as well as a great challenge, \npresented by this nomination is more general.\n  We can better educate ourselves and our fellow citizens about the \nproper role of judges in our system of government.\n  We can clarify the kind of judge we need on the bench.\n  We can get straight just what judges are supposed to do.\n  We must seize this opportunity, because I am concerned that lack of \nclarity on this point, a misunderstanding of what judges are supposed \nto do, contributes to the rancor and the partisan conflict surrounding \nthe judicial selection process.\n  Mr. President, last week here on the Senate floor, I began to address \nthis by\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\ncomparing judges to umpires or referees.\n  I used that analogy because I believe we can be simple without being \nsimplistic, even regarding some of these very important, and sometimes \nconfusing matters.\n  Judges, like umpires or referees, take rules they did not make and \ncannot change and apply them to the contest before them.\n  Neither judges nor umpires may first pick a winner and then \nmanipulate the rules to produce that outcome or the final result.\n  Every American of a certain age remembers only too well the Olympic \nbasketball game in which biased referees unfairly replayed the final \nseconds of the game so that the Soviets would win. And we all saw the \ntainted, colluding French ice skating judge at the last winter Olympics \nin Salt Lake City.\n  Neither judges nor umpires may allow their personal views of the \nparties or teams before them to influence their application of the law \nor the rules.\n  And they certainly may not prejudge the contest before the teams even \ntake the field.\n  This role or function, this job description, must guide the hiring or \nselection process.\n  We hear it said, for example, that we must know a judicial nominee's \nviews. At least on the surface, that notion sounds practical, even an \nassertin of common sense.\n  The problem is, that by itself, this general demand to know a \nnominee's views begs rather than answers the important questions.\n  It is so general that it simply cannot mean what it says. We have \nneither desire, need, nor right to know most of Judge Roberts's views \non most imaginable subjects.\n  The real questions are these: What views do we actually need to know? \nWhat views may we properly seek to know?\n  I submit, that properly understanding what judges do helps us \nproperly establish which of a nominee's views we need to know.\n  This is quickly coming to a head.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, aided in turn by \nsome of their friends among left-wing interest groups, are demanding to \nknow Judge Roberts's views related to how he is likely to rule on \ncertain issues.\n  They seek to elicit those views in a variety of different ways and \nseem committed to ask carefully crafted questions designed to poke and \nprod, cajole and extract, but they are after the same thing.\n  Simply put, it appears that some of our Democratic colleagues want, \nin essence, Judge Roberts to prejudge issues and cases that might come \nbefore him.\n  It appears some Senators may even base their confirmation vote on his \nfuture judicial votes.\n  I might add that one Senator, I believe, said that he would vote no \nif the Jugde Roberts does not explicitly endorse Roe v. Wade. That is \noutrageous.\n  When Judge Roberts appears before the Judiciary Committee, I hope we \nwill follow a standard, for both questions and answers, that is \nconsistent with the nature of the judicial office and with Senate \ntradition.\n  The nature of the judicial office itself requires independence and \nimpartiality. Nominees for judicial office, and especially those who \nare already sitting judges, must protect these essential elements of \njudicial character.\n  Many questions and answers will be consistent with judicial \nindependence and impartiality, but others are not.\n  I have said before that Senators can ask any questions they choose, \nwhether I disagree with those questions or not, whether I feel those \nquestions are wise or not.\n  I have served on the Judiciary Committee during hearings for eight of \nthe nine current Supreme Court Justices and more than 1400 lower court \njudges.\n  I know from experience that Senators want to know a great many things \nfrom a judicial nominee. Being legislators and being political, we may \neven want to know many political things.\n\n  I do, however, encourage my colleagues, and remind myself, to resist \nusing a purely political standard to evaluate a nominee for judicial \noffice.\n  Even more than Senators, however, the nominee before us will \ncertainly use a judicial standard to answer even political questions.\n  Many of us have already met with Judge Roberts. I know him \npersonally. I have seen him sit there for 14 years because he wasn't \neven given the courtesy of a hearing.\n  He is a thoughtful, sincere, and honest man.\n  We can be confident that he will do his best to balance the need to \nbe forthcoming and responsive, on the one hand, with his commitment to \njudicial independence and impartiality, on the other.\n  There is, however, more for him to consider than simply that a \nSenator wants to know something.\n  Judge Roberts has not only been nominated to a judicial position, he \nalready has one. He is a sitting judge.\n  He will be on the Federal bench, on one court or another, for many \nyears to come.\n  Those who come before him deserve to know, need to know, that he is \nimpartial. Nothing shatters that confidence more than knowing a judge \nhas, under oath, already pledged to rule one way or another, which is \nbeing demanded by some of my colleagues on the other side.\n  In fact, this duty not to prejudge issues or cases is so important \nthat it is codified in the Canons of Judicial Ethics. Let me read a \nportion of it here. I think it should be interesting to everybody.\n  ``[A] judge or a candidate for appointment . . . to judicial office \nshall not . . . with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that \nare likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises or \ncommitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the \nadjudicative duties of the office.''\n  I know that Judge Roberts takes his judicial responsibilities, his \njudicial ethics, very seriously.\n  We can look not only to the nature of the judicial office, but to \npast judicial confirmations, for more concrete definition of this \njudicial standard.\n  As each Supreme Court nominee came before the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators asked different kinds of questions on a wide range of issues. \nSome of them sought, more or less obviously, to zero in on how the \nnominee would likely rule in the future cases raising particular \nissues.\n  We are probably all guilty of that at one time or another, but judges \nwho use common sense refuse to answer those kind of questions. They \nshould.\n  Senators of both parties pressed nominees of both parties.\n  The remarkable thing, which we will do well to keep in mind today, is \nthe consistency with which nominees handled these questions. There were \nvariations, to be sure, but those were variations in degree.\n  Nominees regularly took the same basic approach to the issue of \nprejudging issues and cases.\n  Let us look briefly at some examples from nominees of both parties.\n  Anthony Kennedy's nomination was sent by a Republican President to a \nDemocratic Senate. At his confirmation hearing in January 1988, he \nsaid, ``[T]he public expects that the judge will keep an open mind, and \nthat he is confirmed by the Senate because of his temperament and his \ncharacter, and not because he has taken particular positions on the \nissues.'' That is a pretty important statement.\n  The Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy by a vote of 97-0.\n  David Souter's nomination was also sent by a Republican President to \na Democratic Senate. At his confirmation hearing in September 1990, he \nasked rhetorically, ``[C]an you imagine the pressure that would be on a \njudge who had stated an opinion, or seemed to have given a commitment \nin these circumstances to the Senate of the United States?''\n\n  By the way the Senate confirmed Justice Souter by a vote of 90-9.\n  Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination was sent by a Democratic President \nto a Democratic Senate. At her confirmation hearing in July 1993, she \ngave what she called her rule when asked to prejudge issues or cases--a \nrule which we honored in the committee and the Senate ``No hints, no \nforecasts, no previews.'' That was a Democratic nominee and we honored \nthose views, Democrats and Republicians.\n  The Senate confirmed Justice Ginsburg by a vote of 96-3.\n  And finally, Stephen Breyer's nomination was sent by a Democratic \nPresident to a Democratic Senate. At his\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nconfirmation hearing in July 1994, he said, ``I do not want to predict \nor to commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in \nthe Court. . . . it is so important that the clients and the lawyers \nunderstand the judges are really open-minded.''I agree with his \nstatement and so did members of the Judiciary Committee by and large.\n  The Senate confirmed Justice Breyer by a vote of 87-9.\n  I hope everyone sees the pattern here. Each of these Supreme Court \nnominees was, like Judge Roberts, already a Federal appeals court \njudge.\n  Each of them, whether Republican or Democrat, used the same judicial \nstandard when Senators, Republican or Democrat, sought prejudgment.\n  They refused.\n  These judicial nominees refused to prejudge issues or cases because \nit would compromise their own independence and impartiality.\n  They refused to prejudge issues or cases because litigants deserve \nconfidence that the judge before whom they appear is impartial and \nopen-minded. Let me put back up here the simple, straightforward \nGinsburg Rule.\n  No hints, no forecasts, no previews.\n  We honored her in that. Why is it that somebody can come to the floor \nand say, unless he is against overturning Roe v. Wade, I will not vote \nfor him? I guess that is a Senator's right, but it certainly is not \nconsistent with the way we treated other Supreme Court nominees.\n  She was asked about her personal views on issues and precedents.\n  She was asked her judicial views on issues and cases. She steadfastly \nrefused.\n  Once again, the Ginsburg Rule is no hints, no forecasts, no previews.\n  I know that this way of balancing responsiveness to Senators with \ncommitment to judicial independence and impartiality can be \nfrustrating. But we confirmed her nomination overwhelmingly.\n  Let me be clear. Senators have the right to ask any questions they \nchoose. I do hope that Senators, myself included, consider the absolute \nimperative of judicial independence and impartiality when we decide \nwhat questions to ask.\n  But we must realize as we have in the past that simply asking the \nquestion does not mean a judicial nomination answer. I am concerned \nthat some are already planning to change standards to demand that Judge \nRoberts abandon the Ginsburg rule or the rule of the other Justices. \nSome have already released a list of questions they intend to ask this \nnominee. Many of the questions asked in various ways how Judge Roberts \nwill rule on issues. Many of the questions ask how he will prejudge \ncases. I am concerned that we might hear Senators demand that Judge \nRoberts sacrifice his independence and impartiality, that he violate \nhis sense of judicial ethics before they will vote for him. I hope this \ndoes not happen. This political standard will not only undermine \njudicial independence and impartiality but will be a radical departure \nfrom Senate tradition. I hope we do not see it.\n  Some have also argued that the Senate allowed Justice Ginsburg to \nfollow her ``no hints, no forecasts, no previews'' rule because she had \nalready been on the appeals court for more than a decade. This \nreasoning is faulty also. As I have described, the Ginsburg rule is \ncompelled by the judicial function itself, by the absolute imperative \nof judicial independence and impartiality. This imperative exists \nwhether someone had never before been a judge, been a judge for 2 \nweeks, or was a judicial veteran of 25 years. We should have faith in \nthis fine nominee to take his responsibility as a judge seriously. I \nfirmly believe we should follow the standard that the judicial function \ncompels and Senate tradition confirms. Justice Ginsburg stated it as \n``no hints, no forecasts, no previews.'' We respected her and we \nconfirmed her.\n  This administration has given up 75,000 pages of materials. Frankly, \nthat is the haystack. I guess some are calling to now look for the \nneedle.\n  We should do the same for Judge Roberts, and that is respect him and \nconfirm him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are talking with the floor staff on the other side \nabout getting additional time on this side since a bit more was used on \nthe other side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be given 2 extra minutes, \nthen I be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, followed by Senator \nBrownback for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will spend no more than 10 minutes to \ncomment on the President's nomination of John Roberts to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Several weeks ago, shortly before the President nominated Judge \nRoberts, we were informed that the strategy on the other side of the \naisle was a three-pronged strategy: one, to claim that there was \ninadequate consultation; two, to somehow paint the nominee as extreme; \nand three, to use document requests to go on a fishing expedition to \ndelay the confirmation for as long as possible.\n  Before this nominee was proposed by the President, there was \nunprecedented consultation with both sides of the aisle, and because \nthis nominee is clearly in the mainstream of American jurisprudence and \nhas a distinguished record of public service as a judge and as an \nadvocate on behalf of the United States in the Solicitor General's \nOffice and elsewhere, it looks as if we already have jumped to prong \nthree, the first two prongs being unavailable.\n  Some members on the other side of the aisle are already intimating \nthat, unless the White House finds and turns over every piece of paper \nwritten by Judge Roberts when he was a Government lawyer, they cannot \nproperly assess his qualifications to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is \npreposterous. The public record on Judge Roberts is already immense. It \nis telling that opponents of this nomination, or at least those who \nwant to slow it down unnecessarily, have not even had a chance to \nreview the documents that are already available. Yet they are calling \nfor more documents. If history is any teacher, and I believe it is, \nthis may indeed be the beginning of a case of moving the goalpost each \ntime a document request is made and then satisfied, to then ask for \nmore, which then leads to another request for more, and a game that the \nnominee cannot win because the goalposts move each time.\n\n  I would like to remind my colleagues what we already have. Judge \nRoberts was confirmed to the D.C. Court of Appeals just 2 short years \nago. He testified extensively before this Senate on two previous \noccasions, and these transcripts total 14 hours of testimony. In \nconjunction with those hearings, he completed more than 100 pages of \nresponses to written questions posed to him by Senators on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. If this were not enough, the Senate already has \nbefore it various legal briefs and oral argument transcripts from the \nhundreds upon hundreds of briefs written by Judge Roberts, or in which \nhe participated, when he practiced as a lawyer both in the private \nsector and in the Solicitor General's Office. The committee and the \nCongress already has before it 10 articles authored by Judge Roberts, \nscholarly legal articles which reflect some of his thought processes \nand his expertise on various issues of law.\n  All of this, of course, was more than enough for the Senate to \nunanimously confirm Judge Roberts as it did 2 short years ago to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have called the second most \nimportant court in the land.\n  There is more. Since his confirmation to the bench, he has \nparticipated in more than 300 appellate cases and opinions that cover \nmore than 2,000 pages. The White House, as recently as yesterday or \nperhaps the day before, has pledged to expedite the public processing \nof more than 75,000 pages of memoranda that Judge Roberts wrote while \nan adviser to President Reagan during the 1980s. By any measure, this \nis a vast public record.\n  I am quite confident none of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle or even on our side of the aisle have had an opportunity to \ndigest this huge disgorging of public information at this\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\npoint. Yet there is the clamor already for more, more, more and \ncomplaints that the President and this administration have not given \nthem enough. Perhaps my colleagues, I respectfully suggest, should read \nwhat has already been produced before they start complaining that it is \nnot enough unless, of course, this is more about picking a fight than \nit is about finding a reasonable path toward an orderly process leading \nto an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  The documents my colleagues are demanding to see, the documents that \nremain that have not been provided, are documents written while he was \na Government lawyer working in the Office of Solicitor General at the \nDepartment of Justice. As my colleagues know, the Solicitor General is \nthe public official who argues cases on behalf of the U.S. Government \nin the U.S. Supreme Court. Of course, there are a number of lawyers who \nwork there assisting the Solicitor General. Those lawyers write \nmemoranda suggesting various litigation strategies--weighing, on the \none hand, we could make this argument; perhaps it would be better to \nmake this argument--and make a recommendation on the litigation \nstrategy of the U.S. Government in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 2002, all seven former living Solicitors General of both political \nparties wrote a letter asking the President to refuse to turn over \nthese confidential documents because they said such a move would chill \nfor years to come the candid advice the Government receives from its \nlawyers. They noted that ``our decisionmaking process requires the \nunbridled, open exchange of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take \nplace if attorneys have reason to fear their private recommendations \nare not private at all, but vulnerable to public disclosure.''\n\n  Most Americans understand that it makes sense to allow this sort of \nprivate communication between a lawyer and a client in order to provide \nthe most effective legal representation, and the same principle \napplies, of course, whether you are the Solicitor General representing \nthe U.S. Government or whether you are a lawyer representing someone \nwho has been accused of a crime or someone who is pursuing a civil \nclaim in a court of law.\n  A couple of our distinguished Senators from Vermont and Massachusetts \nhave in recent days argued that confidential memoranda written by \nGovernment lawyers are the property of the American people and, \ntherefore, should be handed over to the Senate. Of course, that is in \ndirect contradiction to what the seven bipartisan appointees of the \nOffice of Solicitor General have said as recently as 2002.\n  But we all understand that the nature of the attorney-client \nrelationship is not one that should be breached simply because the \ngovernment is a party to the communication. For example, the Federal \nGovernment's veterans hospitals are there to take care of the men and \nwomen who fought for our freedom. Does this mean that Members of this \nSenate are entitled to see confidential medical files of veterans who \nreceive care in these facilities? Does that mean somehow we should be \nable to invade the doctor-patient relationship by making public their \nprivate medical records? Certainly not. The same principle holds true, \nthis principle of confidential communications in a position of trust or \nfiduciary relationship, between lawyers and clients as well. To hold \notherwise would deny the American people the vigorous and outstanding \nrepresentation they are entitled to before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I suggest, in accordance with traditional practice, that the claim of \nattorney-client privilege for these Solicitor General documents, these \ndeliberate documents written by Judge Roberts when he was working in \nthat office representing the U.S. Government, can and should remain \nconfidential. They should not be made public. And we should stop \nplaying this game of ``gotcha'' by moving goalposts on the President's \nnominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yesterday, I expressed my concern that some may try to \nturn the confirmation process for Judge John Roberts into a political \ncircus. After recent media reports, I have become concerned that some \nof those fears I spoke of earlier in this Senate are coming true; \nnamely, that our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do \neverything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the \nPresident's nominee to the Supreme Court.\n  Earlier, I spoke of the Washington Post article that outlined a \ncarefully constructed plan of attack on the Roberts nomination. It was \na three-staged battle plan.\n  The first stage was to assert that the amount of consultation from \nthe White House, no matter the amount, no matter how much consultation, \nwas somehow insufficient. But that dog clearly won't hunt. The White \nHouse consulted with over 70 Senators, including two-thirds of the \nDemocratic caucus and every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. The \nPresident himself met with the Democratic leader and the Democratic \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee. He and his staff were \nreceptive to any and all suggestions our Democratic friends cared to \ngive. Frankly, he has done more than the Constitution requires by far, \nand more than his predecessors did. No one can say he did not consult \nthe Senate, period. End of story.\n\n  The second salvo against the President's nominee, as told to the \nWashington Post, was to try to distort and destroy his record and paint \nhim as extreme. This plan, too, has failed.\n  Judge Roberts is one of the preeminent jurists of his generation. He \nis a top graduate of Harvard Law School and Harvard University. He was \nunanimously approved by the Senate for his current position on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Over 150 of his peers, Democrat \nand Republican alike, endorsed him for the current position he holds. \nAnd he has argued, as we have pointed out numerous times, before the \nSupreme Court 39 times. He is clearly in the mainstream, is fair-\nminded, has a keen intellect, and a sterling record of integrity.\n  So now some of our Democratic friends, as some of us could have \npredicted, have come to the third and final stage of the attack plan. \nThey are making unreasonable demands for documents about the nominee.\n  Now, the administration has been very generous in releasing documents \nfrom Judge Roberts's time in the Justice Department as a special \nassistant to Attorney General William French Smith and his tenure in \nthe White House Counsel's Office.\n  In fact, the Judiciary Committee will receive some 70,000 pages of \ndocuments, at the behest of the administration. Let me say again: That \nis 70,000 pages turned over. I doubt that our colleagues have pored \nthrough those pages already, and yet they are hungry for more.\n  Since the release of these documents, some in the media have \nhurriedly--some might say recklessly--skimmed document after document, \nmany of them quite complex, looking for any hint of controversy so \nprecious to the demands of the 24-hour news cycle. In so doing, they \nrun the risk of simplifying complex constitutional issues beyond \nrecognition.\n  For example, during the last couple of days, there has been a great \ndeal of media attention regarding the arcane issue of so-called ``court \nstripping,'' a shorthand term describing the issue of whether Congress \nhas the authority to deny jurisdiction to Federal courts.\n  The New York Times writes this morning that:\n\n       Mr. Roberts consistently argued that courts should be \n     stripped of authority of abortion, busing, school prayer and \n     other matters.\n\n  The Washington Post yesterday:\n\n       Roberts presented a defense of bills in Congress that would \n     have stripped the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over \n     abortion, busing and school prayer cases.\n\n  The Boston Globe:\n\n       One memo suggested that [Roberts] supported proposals in \n     Congress to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over \n     abortion, busing and school prayer cases. ``Aha,'' say our \n     friends in the media. The media and some of our friends on \n     the other side of the aisle suggest that John Roberts may \n     have taken a position on these controversial issues. The \n     problem is not that this is an oversimplification. The \n     problem is that it is just plain wrong.\n\n  As a young attorney in the Justice Department, John Roberts was \nassigned to write a memo advocating that Congress had the \nconstitutional authority to determine the appellate\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. This memo \nwas written in response to legislation introduced in Congress proposing \nto strip Federal jurisdiction on a number of controversial social \nissues. Now, Mr. Roberts was a constitutional scholar, and he did what \nconstitutional scholars are frequently asked to do: argue a legal \ntheory about congressional authority. Mr. Roberts was given this \nassignment by his boss, and he responded with the outstanding advocacy \nfor which he is justly admired.\n  Making a legal argument, however, is miles away from endorsing the \npolicy underlying the constitutional argument. And, as it turns out, \nJohn Roberts did not think that ``court stripping'' was good policy in \nthe first place. Let me say again: John Roberts did not think that \n``court stripping'' was a good policy in the first place.\n  The Associated Press reported, yesterday, that in 1985:\n\n       [A]s a lawyer in the Reagan White House, John Roberts wrote \n     that Congress had authority to strip the Supreme Court of \n     jurisdiction over cases involving school prayer and similar \n     issues, but he added that ``such bills were bad policy and \n     should be opposed.''\n\n  The second half of the story was he added that ``such bills were bad \npolicy and should be opposed.'' This tempest in a teapot over ``court \nstripping'' refers to a position that Mr. Roberts never agreed with in \nthe first place.\n  That is the problem with a rush to judgment on a complex legal \ndocument--these documents that have been released just recently. \nInstant media reports can muddy the waters by confusing a legal opinion \nwith a policy position. A legal opinion is different from a policy \nposition.\n  Now, half the story only conveys half the truth. Half the story only \nconveys half the truth. And a half-truth is frequently 100 percent \nwrong. I hope those in the media who got it wrong will not make the \nsame mistake again. This is the exact kind of misrepresentation I hope \nthe Senate can avoid as it debates the Roberts nomination.\n\n  Now, Judge Roberts deserves a fair and dignified process. The Senate \nneeds to be thorough and deliberate, but it must be fair. I would say \nto our friends in the media, half a story is frequently 100 percent \nwrong. Read all the documents before reaching a conclusion.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest we all take a deep breath and not rush \nto judgment in an effort to get tomorrow morning's headlines out before \nwe have read the entire story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9215-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9215-S9217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STEM CELL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise this morning to address some of \nthe comments that have been made on the other side of the aisle \nregarding the Castle bill on embryonic stem cell research that passed \nin the House a few weeks ago: I have heard the proposal this morning \nfrom my colleagues from the other side that we should discuss and talk \nabout embryonic stem cell research and the proposed umbilical cord \nblood bill that have been put on the calendar here in the Senate, but \nwithout any discussion about human cloning. I want to try to put this \nissue in context a little, and to propose some factual information.\n  Mr. President, we need to have a broad discussion about bioethical \nissues in this body and all across the country, and it needs to involve \nthe full range of issues that have come to light as we attempt to grasp \nthe implications and come to understand the decisions that must be made \nin this challenging area.\n  This discussion should involve cord blood stem cells. These types of \ncells are stem cells that come from the umbilical cord when a child is \nborn; they are a rich source of pluripotent stem cells that have proven \nvery helpful in providing a number of treatments for humans.\n  We need to continue to talk honestly about embryonic stem cell \nresearch: the possible limitations of this research to cure diseases in \nhumans, as well as the certain destruction of embryos that this type of \nresearch necessitates.\n  We need to talk about human cloning, whether or not we want to \ncontinue to allow the practice of cloning to take place in the United \nStates of America (it is currently a legal process in this country, to \nclone, create and kill an embryo, a young human).\n  We need to talk about the cutting edge related research applications, \nwe need to consider where the science is leading us on issues such as \nthe creation and manipulation of chimeras--human-animal crosses that \nare created by, for instance, taking human brain cells and putting them \nin a mouse--we cannot bypass these critical issues in this discussion.\n  And we need to talk about some exciting new application prospects of \nthese broad-based pluripotent cells, cells that can do virtually \nanything--but I speak of cells where it is not necessary to extract \nthem from a human embryos, destroying that embryo in the process, but \ncells yielded from other places in the body.\n  With this background in mind, I want to point out a couple of quick \nfacts.\n  No. 1, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, from this morning's Washington Post, an article describing new \nrevelations about pluripotent adult stem cells that can answer many of \nthese questions. I ask that the article be included and printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to read one section of this \narticle:\n\n       A team of Harvard scientists is claiming the discovery of a \n     reservoir of cells that appear capable of replenishing the \n     ovaries of sterilized mice, possibly providing new ways to \n     [create human eggs].\n\n  Adult stem cells in the body with the ability to create human eggs. \nNow, people may say: What do you mean by that? Well, here we have a \npluripotent adult stem cell (derived from bone marrow) with a broad \ncapacity to create a lot of different cells, so much so that they can \ngenerate, when placed in the right place in the body--a woman's ovary--\nhuman eggs.\n  Listen to what the scientists here say about this:\n\n       In addition, because the cells appear to be a particularly \n     versatile type of adult stem cell--\n\n  I would like to pause for a moment to point out that there are no \nethical problems or objections to research conducted with adult stem \ncells. We should put millions of dollars into this type of research. \nThis type of research is yielding cures--65 treatment applications for \nhumans with adult stem cell research. However, I'd like to conclude the \nreading of this excerpt:\n\n      . . . a particularly versatile type of adult stems cells \n     [which] could provide an alternative to those obtained from \n     embryos, avoiding the political and ethical debates raging \n     around the use of those cells.\n\n  End of quote, in this morning's Washington Post, from Harvard \nresearchers.\n  Mr. President, I ask then, why would we want to kill young human \nembryos, young humans, who are clearly alive, who are clearly human, \nwhen we have the capacity, in adult stem cells, to conduct useful and \nproductive research to cure diseases, that is not hindered by ethical \nproblems?\n  In an article from this month's The Lancet--a well-respected British \nmedical journal--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The author of this editorial--this is the lead British \nmedical journal--says:\n\n      . . . what is unarguable is that the human embryo is alive \n     and is human, and intentionally ending the life of one human \n     being for the potential benefit of others is not territory to \n     which mainstream clinical researchers have hitherto sought \n     claim--or which ethically conscientious objectors could ever \n     concede.\n\n  These embryos are alive. They are alive. They are human.\n  I want to conclude, because time is very limited--Mr. President: I \nwant cures for people. I want cures for juvenile diabetes, for cancer, \nfor spinal cord injuries, for Parkinson's disease. And, with research \ngenerated from pluripotent adult stem cells, we are getting these \ntreatments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of human clinical trials going on now, using adult or cord blood \nstem\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\ncells, involving no ethical dilemmas, for 65 different human maladies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The number of areas of treatment for human ailments or \nmedical conditions in humans using human embryonic stem cells is zero. \nSo the notion that delaying this Castle-Specter bill is going to hurt \ncurrent patients is completely false. If we want to help current \npatients, the key--the key--is to put more research into adult and cord \nblood stem cell research. If you want to help current patients, you \nshould be ever so careful not to promise impossibilities to these \nhurting individuals; you should state what the scientists are telling \nus, that the possibility of embryonic stem cells yielding cures, if \never--and I really doubt if it ever happens--is decades away. And we \nhave had problems in the past with these types or cells forming \ndangerous and cancerous tissues--a problem which has not yet been \nworked out. If we want cures, let's go the route where we know we are \ngoing to reach our destination, and where we know treatment is true \npossibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 28, 2005]\n\n       Scientists Claim To Find Cells That Restore Egg Production\n\n                             (By Rob Stein)\n\n       A team of Harvard scientists is claiming the discovery of a \n     reservoir of cells that appear capable of replenishing the \n     ovaries of sterilized mice, possibly providing new ways to \n     help infertile women have babies.\n       While cautioning that more research is needed to confirm \n     that similar cells exist in women and that they can safely \n     restore fertility, the researchers said the findings could \n     revolutionize the understanding of female reproduction and \n     the power to manipulate it.\n       ``This may launch a new era in how to think about female \n     infertility and menopause,'' said Jonathan L. Tilly, a \n     reproductive biologist at Harvard Medical School and \n     Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who led the \n     research. It is being published in tomorrow's issue of the \n     journal Cell.\n       Other researchers agreed that the findings could have \n     profound implications, but several expressed caution and \n     skepticism, saying many key questions remain about whether \n     the researchers have proved their claims.\n       ``This is really exciting and a revolutionary idea. The \n     implications are potentially huge,'' said Lawrence Nelson of \n     the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \n     ``But before this could have any type of application to \n     humans, a whole lot of work has to be done. We have to be \n     careful not to get ahead of ourselves.''\n       But Tilly said he was confident of his findings, which \n     could, for example, enable women to bank egg-producing cells \n     when they are young in case they have health problems that \n     leave them infertile or they get too old.\n       ``In theory, these cells could provide an insurance policy. \n     We could harvest them and store them away for 20 years. Then \n     you put them back in, and they are going to do exactly what \n     they are supposed to--find the ovaries and generate new \n     eggs'' to restore fertility, Tilly said.\n       The discovery could also lead to ways to prevent, delay or \n     reverse menopause, perhaps by stimulating dormant cells in \n     the bone marrow or ``tweaking'' the ovaries to accept them, \n     Tilly said. It may also be possible to transplant them from \n     one woman to another, he said.\n       In addition, because the cells appear to be a particularly \n     versatile type of adult stem cell, they could provide an \n     alternative to those obtained from embryos, avoiding the \n     political and ethical debates raging around the use of those \n     cells.\n       ``The implications are mind-boggling, really,'' Tilly said.\n       The research is a follow-up to results the team reported in \n     March 2004, when it claimed it had shown that mice can \n     produce eggs throughout their lives. For decades, scientific \n     dogma has been that female mammals such as mice and humans \n     are born with a finite number of eggs. To alleviate doubts \n     about their original claim, the researchers conducted another \n     round of experiments, which they said confirm the findings \n     and explain how it might work.\n       First, the scientists sterilized female mice with a cancer \n     chemotherapy drug that destroyed eggs in the ovaries but \n     spared any egg-producing cells elsewhere. They tested the \n     animals' ovaries 12 to 24 hours later and found signs their \n     egg supply was rapidly regenerating. Two months later, the \n     animals' ovaries looked normal, and they remained that way \n     for life.\n       After tests indicated the source of the cells may lie in \n     the animals' bone marrow, the researchers infused marrow from \n     healthy mice into those that were either genetically \n     engineered to be infertile or had been made infertile with \n     chemotherapy. Two months later, the recipients' ovaries \n     looked normal, whereas those that had not received the \n     transplants remained barren, the researchers reported. Blood \n     transfusions produced similar results, they said.\n       The researchers then infused blood into infertile mice from \n     animals that had been genetically engineered so that their \n     reproductive stem cells glowed fluorescent green. Within two \n     days, green egg cells appeared in the recipients' ovaries, \n     which the researchers said indicated the cells had traveled \n     through the blood to the ovaries.\n       Finally, the researchers screened human bone marrow and \n     blood from healthy women and found that both tested positive \n     for biological markers indicating the presence of immature \n     reproductive cells.\n       ``Mice and humans appear to be the same--they appear to \n     have a set of genes in bone marrow consistent with . . . \n     cells that can make themselves a new egg,'' Tilly said.\n       The findings could help explain previously mysterious cases \n     of women sterilized by cancer treatment who spontaneously \n     became pregnant after receiving bone marrow transplants, \n     Tilly said. This may happen only rarely because some, but not \n     all, techniques used to process bone marrow before \n     transplantation may destroy the cells in some cases, he \n     speculated.\n       The research triggered a mixture of excitement, caution and \n     deep skepticism.\n       ``It's quite amazing,'' said Hans Schoeler of the Max \n     Planck Institute in Germany. ``The idea that cells from bone \n     marrow may be a reservoir for egg cells would be quite \n     astonishing.''\n       But Schoeler and other researchers cautioned that many \n     crucial questions remained. Several researchers had doubts \n     about some of the techniques the researchers used. Others \n     were puzzled by the speed with which the ovaries appeared to \n     be repopulated with eggs. Many pointed out that the \n     researchers had failed to show the eggs were viable, the mice \n     were ovulating or that they could give birth to healthy \n     offspring.\n       ``I'm very skeptical,'' said David F. Albertini of the \n     University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. \n     ``There are a lot of holes in the research.''\n       Tilly attributed the skepticism to the radical nature of \n     the findings and said he already had work underway to address \n     the concerns, including breeding studies aimed at producing \n     healthy offspring.\n       ``We hope we will have the answers very soon,'' Tilly said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    Stem-Cell Therapy: Hope and Hype\n\n       In the fifth year since human cloning to generate stem \n     cells was legalised in the UK, what progress has been made \n     towards taking stem-cell therapy from laboratory to clinical \n     practice? In 2000, articulating robust UK Government support, \n     then Health Minister Yvette Cooper proclaimed that stem cells \n     from cloned human embryos ``could prove the Holy Grail in \n     finding treatments for cancer, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, \n     osteoporosis, spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's disease, \n     leukemia and multiple sclerosis . . . transform[ing] the \n     lives of hundreds of thousands of people''. But 4 years \n     later, the technical difficulties and biological hazards \n     inherent in cloning human embryos and developing treatments \n     from their stem cells led Richard Gardner, Chairman of the \n     Royal Society Working Group on Stem Cells and Therapeutic \n     Cloning, to doubt whether this would ever be a ``a procedure \n     that becomes widely available . . . There are concerns about \n     the efficiency and elaborateness of the procedure, and it's \n     going to be very time-consuming and very expensive''. So, to \n     paraphrase May 25th's Saving Faces event in London, UK, are \n     stem-cell therapies hype, or hope, or substance?\n       Only two UK groups currently seek to clone human embryos, \n     both with immediate aims not of developing therapies but of \n     improving understanding of embryonic development or specific \n     diseases. Techniques for culturing human embryonic stem cells \n     have advanced--e.g., allowing them (like adult stem cells) to \n     be grown--but an increasing appreciation of the hazards of \n     embryonic stem cells has rightly prevented the emergence or \n     immediate prospect of any clinical therapies based on such \n     cells. The natural propensity of embryonic stem cells to form \n     teratomas, their exhibit of chromosomal abnormalities, and \n     abnormalities in cloned mammals all present difficulties.\n       The prospect of having to clone (to obtain embryonic stem-\n     cells) every patient requiring therapy is surely unrealistic \n     (the Korean report of cloning human embryos for stem cells \n     used almost 250 human eggs in generating a single stem-cell \n     line). If cloning is unrealistic and/or too hazardous, the \n     autologous advantage of (cloned) embryonic stem cells \n     vanishes: and immune rejection of embryonic stem cells \n     generated from ``foreign'' in-vitro fertilisation or abortion \n     presents further problems.\n       These biological problems only add to the ethical \n     objections. The Lancet declared in 2001 that: ``the creation \n     of embryos solely for the purpose of producing human stem \n     cells is not only unnecessary but also a step too far''. \n     Semantic questions about embryology and personhood are \n     interesting, if unprovable, but what is unarguable is that \n     the human embryo is alive and is human, and intentionally \n     ending the life of one human being for the potential benefit \n     of others (i.e., for research) is not territory to which \n     mainstream clinical researchers have hitherto sought claim--\n     or which ethically conscious objectors could ever concede.\n       So is stem-cell research a damp squib, another over-hyped \n     funding gambit? Far from it, for the embryonic stem-cell \n     story forms only one aspect. Excitement about the potential \n     of adult stem cells was tempered by\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\n     reports in 2002 that in some circumstances such cells can \n     fuse. Fusion might give a false appearance of \n     metadifferentiation, the argument ran, therefore adult stem \n     cells are not really multipotent, and are a nonstarter as an \n     alternative to embryonic stem cells.\n       Fortunately, for the now highly expectant patient, reports \n     of the death of adult stem cells were greatly exaggerated. \n     Much research (some indeed antedating the fusion excitement) \n     clearly shows that although fusion can and does occur in \n     certain tissues, adult (say) bone-marrow-derived stem cells \n     can also generate multiple lineages without cell fusion. \n     Interestingly, fusion may be an unexpected mechanism of \n     achieving repair, and could additionally offer means of \n     delivering gene therapy. Normal (bone-marrow-derived) donor \n     nuclei were found in the muscle of a patient with Duchenne \n     muscular dystrophy, over a decade after bone-marrow \n     transplantation for immune deficiency, offering proof of \n     principle for fusion of bone-marrow-derived stem cells as \n     gene therapy, and presenting tantalising therapeutic \n     prospects. Also, it is now clear that aneuploidy represents a \n     not uncommon, spontaneous, and normal process, rather than \n     necessarily carrying sinister implications, as speculated.\n       Suggestions of low rates of differentiation of bone-marrow-\n     derived stem cells and integration in situ, and of \n     questionable differentiation, have also been addressed. \n     Perhaps the most compelling (and extraordinary) evidence \n     unambiguously confirming the ability of adult bone-marrow-\n     derived stem cells not only to metadifferentiate but also to \n     integrate fully into adult (human) organs, and survive for \n     decades, comes from postmortem studies of sex-mismatched \n     recipients of bone-marrow transplants, showing donor-derived \n     fully differentiated neuronal cells of a highly complex \n     morphology apparently fully functionally established within \n     the host brain, with no evidence of fusion.\n       We now know that bone marrow-derived stem-cells circulate \n     systemically and actively migrate into damaged tissue to \n     contribute to spontaneous repair. Experimentally, therapeutic \n     benefit occurs in numerous disease models but, importantly, \n     repair by bone-marrow-derived stem cells does not stop at the \n     laboratory door. Safety data from 50 years of clinical bone-\n     marrow transplantation, during which nonhaemopoetic stem \n     cells have inadvertently also been transplanted, and the \n     accompanying clinical expertise in collecting, handling, \n     freeze-storing, thawing, and delivering marrow, have safety \n     allowed a rapid translation of bone-marrow-stem-cell science \n     from laboratory to clinic. Controlled trials have shown \n     significant benefit of marrow-derived stem-cell therapy in \n     myocardial infarction, and trials are planned or underway in \n     chronic cardiac failure, stroke, and other diseases: reports \n     of successful adult stem-cell therapy in myocardial \n     infarction, and trials are planned or underway in chronic \n     cardiac failure, stroke, and other diseases: reports of \n     successful adult stem-cell therapy in patients with corneal \n     disease have just appeared. The next few years, not decades, \n     will show whether adult stem-cell treatments are to join the \n     mainstream therapeutic arsenal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\nBenefits of Stem Cells to Human Patients--Adult Stem Cells v.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 397, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 397) to prohibit civil liability actions from \n     being brought or continued against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition \n     for damages, injunctive or other relief resulting from the \n     misuse of their products by others.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Frist (for Craig) amendment No. 1605, to amend the \n     exceptions.\n       Frist amendment No. 1606 (to amendment No. 1605), to make \n     clear that the bill does not apply to actions commenced by \n     the Attorney General to enforce the Gun Control Act and \n     National Firearms Act.\n       Reed (for Kohl) amendment No. 1626, to amend chapter 44 of \n     title 18, United States Code, to require the provision of a \n     child safety lock in connection with the transfer of a \n     handgun.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1626\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are back on this very important piece of \nlegislation, S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n  Under a unanimous consent agreement entered into last evening, we are \non the Kohl trigger lock amendment. I understand there is an hour \nequally divided, and we hope we can get to a vote on this before 12:30. \nThis is an important amendment, which I am confident Senator Kohl will \nbe here in a few moments to discuss.\n  In the short term, let me visit the broader issue of the bill itself. \nWe now have 62 cosponsors. I am pleased Senator Conrad has joined us in \nsupport of this important piece of legislation to limit predatory and \njunk lawsuits from attempting to destroy the capability of the private \nsector to produce legal, effective firearms for our Nation's citizens \nand for our police and military. Unlike most nations, we are a nation \nthat does not have a government company or a government manufacturer of \nfirearms. It has always been the responsibility of the private sector. \nThey have done extremely well. Innovation and creativity has always \nallowed the latest and best firearm capability, not only for our \nprivate citizens but for the military and police departments and the \narmed services that contract with these private sector companies to \nproduce not only the firearms but the effective ammunition for them.\n  Some years ago, we saw a frustration growing in the gun control \ncommunity that the public and the Congress collectively would not bend \nto their wishes. The public, in its inevitable wisdom, recognized that \nguns were not an issue in deaths caused by guns or in the commission of \ncrimes, but the criminal element was the issue and that we ought to get \nat the business of law enforcement and taking those off the streets who \nused a gun in the commission of a crime. That is exactly what this \nadministration has done in the last 5\\1/2\\ years. The use of a firearm \nor criminal activities in which a firearm is used has rapidly dropped \nin the last\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\n6 years because this Justice Department has said, clearly, they will \nenforce the law.\n  The law is basically if you use a gun in the commission of a crime, \nyou do the time. You don't get to plea bargain it away and go back to \nthe streets to reengage as a criminal to once again misuse your rights \nas a citizen in a violent or criminal activity.\n  Because the anti-gun community didn't get it their way, they, over \nthe years, have determined that they could use the legal system, the \ncourt system, to bypass and suggest that the third party, or the \nmanufacturer, even though he or she was a law-abiding company and \nproduced under the auspices of the Federal laws in responsible ways in \nthat those products were sold through federally licensed firearms \ndealers, that wasn't good enough. Somehow you had to pass through and \nsay that the crime and the fallout of crime was going to get paid for \nin some way by these responsible citizens who were building a legal and \nresponsible product. That is the game--I say that--that has been \nplayed.\n  As a result, these legal, law-abiding manufacturers and citizens have \nincreasingly had to pay higher and higher legal costs to defend \nthemselves in lawsuit after lawsuit that have, in almost every \ninstance, been denied and thrown out of court by the judges when filed \nlargely by municipalities who, obviously frustrated by gun violence in \ntheir communities, chose this route. Instead of insisting that their \ncommunities and prosecutors and law enforcement go after the criminal \nelement, they, in large part, in their frustration, looked for an easy \nway out. That has brought this legislation to the floor to limit the \nability of junk or abusive kinds of lawsuits in a very narrow and \ndefined way, but in no way--and I have said it very clearly--denying \nthe recognition that if a gun dealer or a manufacturer acted in an \nillegal or irresponsible way or produced a product that was faulty and \ncaused harm or damage, this bill would not preempt or in any way \nprotect them or immune them from the appropriate and necessary legal \nsentence.\n  That is what we are about. I see that the sponsor of the trigger lock \namendment is on the Senate floor.\n  Before I relinquish the floor, I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record a letter from the Department of Defense as to the importance \nof this issue, the Acting General Counsel of the Department of Defense \nspeaking to the importance of S. 397 in safeguarding and protecting \nthese gun manufacturers that produce a large amount of our firearms and \nweapons for all of our men and women who serve in harm's way in defense \nof our freedoms.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: This responds to your request for \n     the Department of Defense's view on S. 397 a bill to \n     ``prohibit civil liability actions from being brought or \n     continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or \n     importers of firearms ammunition for damages, injunctive or \n     other relief resulting from the misuse of their products by \n     others.''\n       The Department of Defense strongly supports this \n     legislation.\n       We believe that passage of S. 397 would help safeguard our \n     national security by limiting unnecessary lawsuits against an \n     industry that plays a critical role in meeting the \n     procurement needs of our men and women in uniform.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this letter for the \n     consideration of the community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel J. Dell'Orto,\n                                                           Acting.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the last few days, I have found interesting editorials \nin the Wall Street Journal. They get it. They understand it. They have \nput it very clearly as to the reality of this bill, that is not just \nfor the protection of law-abiding citizens but recognizing that tort \nreform is necessary. When the Congress can't do it in sweeping ways, we \nhave chosen targeted ways to get at the misuse of our court system in \nlarge part by the trial bar.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print those in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 27, 2005]\n\n                         Gun Liability Control\n\n       If we recall correctly, it was Shakespeare who wrote ``the \n     first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.'' That's going \n     too far, but the Senate can do the metaphoric equivalent this \n     week by voting to protect gun makers from lawsuits designed \n     to put them out of business.\n       Senate Republicans say they have 60 votes to pass the \n     Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which would \n     protect gun makers from lawsuits claiming they are \n     responsible for crimes committed with their products. The \n     support includes at least 10 Democrats, which speaks volumes \n     about the political shift against ``gun control'' in recent \n     years.\n       The ``assault weapons ban'' expired with a whimper last \n     year. State legislatures have been rolling back firearm laws \n     because the restrictions were both ineffectual and unpopular. \n     Gun-controllers have responded by avoiding legislatures and \n     going to court, teaming with trial lawyers and big city \n     mayors to file lawsuits blaming gun makers for murder. \n     Companies have been hit with at least 25 major lawsuits, from \n     the likes of Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Chicago and \n     Cleveland. A couple of the larger suits (New York and \n     Washington, D.C.) are sitting in front of highly creative \n     judges and could drag on for years.\n       Which seems to be part of the point. The plaintiffs have \n     asked judges to impose the sort of ``remedies'' that Congress \n     has refused to impose, such as trigger locks or tougher \n     restrictions on gun sales. Some mayors no doubt also hope for \n     a big payday. But short of that, the gun-control lobby's goal \n     seems to be keep the suits going long enough to drain profit \n     from the low-margin gun industry.\n       Gun makers have yet to lose a case, but these victories \n     have cost more than $200 million in legal bills. This is a \n     huge sum for an industry collectively smaller than any \n     Fortune 500 company and that supports 20,000 jobs at most. \n     Publicly listed companies such as Smith & Wesson have seen \n     the legal uncertainty reflected in their share price. Money \n     for legal fees could be better spent creating new jobs, \n     researching ways to make guns safer, or returning profits to \n     shareholders.\n       Congress has every right to stop this abuse of the legal \n     system, all the more so because it amounts to an end-run \n     around its legislative authority. A single state judge \n     imposing blanket regulations on a gun maker would effectively \n     limit the Second Amendment rights of gun buyers across the \n     nation. Liability legislation would also send a message that \n     Congress won't stand by as the tort bar and special interests \n     try to put an entirely lawful business into Chapter 11.\n       The gun makers aren't seeking immunity from all liability; \n     they would continue to face civil suits for defective \n     products or for violating sales regulations. The Senate \n     proposal would merely prevent a gun maker from being pillaged \n     because a criminal used one of its products to perform his \n     felony. Murder can be committed with all kinds of everyday \n     products, from kitchen knives to autos, but no one thinks GM \n     is to blame because a drunk driver kills a pedestrian. (On \n     the other hand, give the lawyers time.) To adapt a familiar \n     line, guns don't kill industries; lawyers do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 27, 2005]\n\n   Senate Moves Closer to Shielding Gun Makers From Negligence Suits\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Cashing in its election gains, the gun lobby was the big \n     winner in a 66-32 Senate vote that moves Congress closer to \n     enacting legislation that would shield the firearms industry \n     from lawsuits charging negligence in the manufacture or \n     distribution of weapons and ammunition.\n       Majority Leader Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) vowed to complete \n     Senate passage before the August recess, which is to begin \n     this weekend. Minutes after the vote, the White House warned \n     that any amendment that ``would delay enactment of the bill \n     beyond this year is unacceptable.''\n       The action came as House-Senate negotiators reached \n     agreement on a $26 billion-plus natural resources budget last \n     evening that would cut funding for clean-water and lands-\n     conservation programs after Oct. 1. The Environmental \n     Protection Agency is directed to complete a rulemaking on \n     human toxicity studies, important to the pesticide industry, \n     within 180 days, but the agreement prohibits any use of \n     pregnant women, infants or children as part of such studies.\n       The Senate gun bill, as drafted, seeks to bar third parties \n     from bringing civil-liability actions against manufacturers, \n     distributors or dealers for damages from the unlawful misuse \n     of a qualified product. People directly harmed in a firearms \n     incident still would be able to sue, but the standard for \n     charging negligence is so tightly written that critics say it \n     would be difficult to prevail.\n       The National Rifle Association's goal is a clean Senate \n     bill that the House can send on to President Bush quickly for \n     his signature.\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n     Gun-liability legislation has twice before passed the House, \n     and the NRA now hopes to grind down the Senate opposition, \n     which has stymied the gun lobby over the past five years.\n       In March 2004, for example, the NRA withdrew its support \n     for a Senate bill when opponents successfully attached gun-\n     control amendments unacceptable to the lobby. Eight months \n     later, the NRA wrought vengeance at the polls, helping to \n     defeat then-Democratic Minority Leader Tom Daschle in South \n     Dakota and picking up a total of four Senate votes for its \n     position.\n       The changed climate is demonstrated by the fact that \n     Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, up for reelection next year in \n     West Virginia, added his name to the co-sponsors this week. \n     Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who still harbors presidential \n     ambitions, also has become a co-sponsor since the last \n     Congress. And Mr. Daschle's leadership post now is filled by \n     Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, a strong NRA ally and one of 12 \n     Democrats to support the lobby yesterday.\n       At a time of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, both Sen. Frist \n     and the White House have cast the fight as a matter of \n     national security, given the threat of ``frivolous lawsuits'' \n     against firearms manufacturers who are part of the larger \n     military establishment. The same protections also would \n     extend to dealers and distributors, who have no real role in \n     national defense. Dennis Henigan, legal director of the Brady \n     Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the framing of the issue \n     was ``classic misdirection'' to narrowly focus on a few \n     manufacturers.\n       Critics argue that laws governing the distribution of \n     firearms are too lax and that only by applying broader tort \n     standards of negligence can dealers be held accountable for \n     showing inadequate diligence to secure their products or \n     determine the real buyer in straw transactions. ``Clearly, \n     this is an attempt to achieve sweeping legal immunity, the \n     kind that can only be dreamed about by other industries,'' \n     Mr. Henigan said.\n       The NRA's victory was all the more striking because it \n     required the Senate to set aside debate--perhaps until \n     September--on a $441.6 billion defense-authorization bill for \n     the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Democrats chided \n     Republicans for sacrificing national interests for the \n     ``special self-interests'' of the gun lobby, a powerful \n     political ally. But Mr. Frist had effectively locked himself \n     into a position where he felt compelled to proceed on the gun \n     bill as a show of strength as party leader.\n       In fact, Mr. Frist's hope had been to cut off debate on the \n     defense bill and complete its passage by tonight, before \n     turning to the gun legislation. That strategy had the double \n     advantage of helping the White House avoid a protracted fight \n     over base closings and its treatment of military detainees in \n     the war against terrorism.\n       On a 50-48 roll call, the leader fell 10 votes short of the \n     60-vote supermajority needed to limit debate. A large part of \n     his losing margin can be explained by the fact that seven \n     Republicans broke ranks, including Sen. McCain, a former \n     prisoner of war in Vietnam who has a big stake in the debate \n     on setting a more uniform policy for the treatment of \n     detainees.\n       Among accounts in the natural-resources budget bill, modest \n     increases are provided for Indian health services and forest \n     programs. The EPA's budget is cut almost $200 million below \n     present funding, and lawmakers both trimmed their own home-\n     state projects and denied two-thirds of the funds sought for \n     an arts and humanities initiative backed by first lady Laura \n     Bush.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, if we are going to give gun dealers immunity \nfrom lawsuits, then I believe we should insist they take every safety \nprecaution available when selling firearms. This amendment goes a long \nway to help reduce the number of accidental shootings, particularly \namong the most vulnerable members of our society, our children, by \nrequiring dealers to sell a safety device with all handguns. We have \nall read troubling stories about lives cut short by accidental \nshootings and teen suicides. They are made all the more terrible by the \nknowledge that many were preventable. The annual number of firearm \ninjuries and deaths involving children is startling.\n  According to the most recent stats available, thousands of people are \ninjured every year in accidental shootings, including more than 800 \ngun-related tragedies that resulted in death. In addition, it is \nestimated that every 6 hours, a young person between the ages of 10 and \n19 commits suicide with a firearm. In all, 13,053 children were injured \nby firearms in 2002. Securing the firearm with a child safety lock \ncould have prevented many of these tragedies. The sad truth is that we \nare inviting disaster every time an unlocked gun is easily accessible \nto children.\n  Eleven million children live in households with guns, and in 65 \npercent of those homes, the gun is accessible to the child. In 13 \npercent of them, the gun is left loaded and not locked. This amendment \nwill help address this problem. It requires that a child safety device \nbe sold with every handgun. These devices vary in form, but the most \ncommon resembles a padlock that wraps around the gun trigger and \nimmobilizes it. Trigger locks are already used by tens of thousands of \nresponsible gun owners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use, \nand they can be purchased in virtually any gun store for less than $10.\n  The Senate has already expressed its support for the sale of trigger \nlocks with handguns, most recently last year, when 70 Senators voted in \nfavor of this exact same amendment.\n  The mandatory sale of trigger locks is equally supported in the rest \nof the country and the law enforcement community. Polls have shown that \nbetween 75 and 80 percent of the American public, including gun owners, \nfavors a mandatory sale of safety locks with guns. In a recent survey \nof 250 of Wisconsin's police chiefs and sheriffs, 91 percent agreed \nthat child safety locks should be sold with each handgun.\n  The current administration has indicated its support for this \nconcept. During his campaign in 2000, President Bush indicated that if \nCongress passed a bill making the sale of child safety locks mandatory \nwith every gun sale, then he would sign it.\n  All of these people agree that we should be doing everything within \nour power to promote the use of locks or other safety devices with \nhandguns. Nobody has ever claimed that this would be a total panacea. \nTo be sure, it will not prevent every single firearm-related accident. \nBut its importance cannot be overstated. Stats show that those who buy \nlocks are more likely to use them. And when they are used, they do \nprevent accidental deaths. While imposing a minimal cost on consumers, \nit would prevent the deaths of many innocent children every year, which \nis a small price to pay. The Senate spoke overwhelmingly in favor of \nthis type of proposal just last year. We should do so again today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors of \nthe amendment: Senators Boxer, Mikulski, Corzine, and Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Kohl for this amendment. \nHe has worked with so many of our colleagues to ensure that children \nare adequately protected. There are too many deaths each year of \nchildren because the weapons are unsecure. They are able to get access \nto them, and they are able to discharge them. There are accidental \ndeaths. Sadly, there are too many childhood suicides that result from \nhaving access to weapons.\n  The Kohl amendment is a practical and appropriate response to that by \nrequiring the sale of a child safety lock along with the weapon. There \nis huge public support for this issue. Over 70 percent of Americans \npolled think this is an appropriate and necessary proposal. In fact, I \nbelieve 6 out of 10 gun owners similarly believe this is a sensible \napproach to dealing with the issue of the accidental death of children \nwith firearms.\n  We are here today to move forward on this amendment, to have a vote \nwhich is scheduled. I would hope, also, that we can move to other \namendments so they could be offered for votes. Several of my colleagues \nhave offered amendments. It is appropriate, since we have begun the \nprocess of debate and amendment and vote, to continue that process \nforward. I hope we can do that.\n  I certainly commend Senator Kohl for his efforts over many years. As \nhe rightfully points out, there was overwhelming support for this \nmeasure last year. More than 70 Senators supported it. I hope we see \nthat same support this year. Certainly, the danger to children has not \ndiminished from the last Congress. The practicality and efficacy of \nthis approach continues to be compelling. I would hope we would have \nanother strong vote in support of the amendment, as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a trigger lock does not a safe weapon make. \nA trigger lock can lay right beside a firearm. Unless it is inserted \nand locked, the firearm is still accessible. You can sell a firearm. \nYou can demand that there be a trigger lock. Yet still someone who is \nirresponsible in the storage and/or use of a firearm can cause that \nfirearm, by the absence of a trigger lock or the absence of a safe \nstorage place, to be harmful to a child. That is reality.\n  Sometimes we stand on the floor of the Senate and think we can fix \nthe world by simply writing a law. I am not, by that statement, \nquestioning the sincerity of Senator Kohl. Last year, his amendment got \n70 votes in the Senate. At the same time, it is a mandate. In that \nmandate, have you created a safer world? I am not sure.\n  I do know this: I do know what creates a safer world. That is an \nawareness, an understanding of and an educational process of how you, \nin fact, create a safer world. Gun manufacturers know that. Licensed \nand responsible firearms dealers know that. Today, more than 90 percent \nof the new handguns already sold in the United States have a safety \ndevice attached to them or that comes with it that is part of the sales \npackage.\n  So already, clearly, the educational process has gone forward. There \nare several national private organizations out there who have \nconstantly and repetitively taught young people about the misuse of \nfirearms. The Eddie Eagle program of the National Rifle Association \neducates thousands and thousands of young people each year to stay away \nfrom a firearm if they see one, to report it if they see one and, \nobviously, to seek an adult's knowledge about it.\n  Still, tragically enough, a child's curiosity in a misplaced firearm \ncan cause accidents; it always has and, even with the passage, \ntragically enough, of the Kohl amendment, if it becomes law, it always \nwill. You cannot create the perfect world. It is simply an \nimpossibility to do. We try, and we try to at least shape that world in \na way that makes it safer. But there is a reality I think all of us \nclearly understand. The statistics, though, while alarming if it is \neven one child, are dramatically improving. I think it is important to \nsay on the record what the facts are. Unintentional firearm deaths--\nthis is from the National Safety Council records. In 2001, there were \n802 total; 15 of those 802 were under the age of 5 years; 57 were from \n5 years old to 14 years old. That is that phenomenal time of curiosity \namong young children. No question about it, if that trigger lock was in \nplace, a life might have been saved. I don't question that either. But \nthen again, you have to get the adult who has the responsibility with \nthat firearm to put the trigger lock in place. It is not automatically \nattached or automatically activated. It has to be humanly attached and \nhumanly activated. There were 110 of the 802 deaths from age 15 to age \n19. My guess is, unintentional, yes, by statistical fact it was. But \nagain, that is an age when young people ought to know, ought to have \nbeen trained, ought to have had some level of education about the \nunderstanding of the safe use of a firearm. From age 20 to 24, there \nwere 96 of the 802. Age 25 to 45, there were 268 accidental, \nunintentional deaths of the 802 total in 2001; and age 45 to 64--these \nare, without question, mature adults who clearly ought to understand \nand, yet, unintentional, accidental firearm deaths numbered 177. That \nwas out of the 802 total in 2001. In 2002, it was 800. In 2003, it \ndropped to 700.\n  The point is this: From 1992 to 2003, there has been a 54-percent \ndecline in accidental, unintentional deaths caused by firearms. \nSomething is beginning to work out there, because gun ownership \ncontinues to go up in our country. So there is, without doubt, an \neducational process underway about the importance of handling a firearm \nappropriately and correctly, using safety devices when that firearm is \nin storage or nonuse, and in a way that is protecting. The 90-percent \nsales of trigger locks today on new weapons, new firearms, may be a \ncontributing factor to that. That number continues to go up. So there \nwas a 54-percent increase from 1992 to 2003 in the reduction--54 \npercent down--of accidental, unintentional firearms deaths. From 2001 \nto 2003, that figure was a 13-percent decline. Those are very important \nstatistics.\n  Once again, in no way should my statement on the floor be taken as \nsomeone who doesn't care or recognize that one child's death is one too \nmany. We will not talk about safety belts and about safety seats and \nabout any of the other kinds of deaths of children in that 5-year-old \nand under age group. Those are so dramatically higher than firearms \nthat one could argue something ought to be done about those. Clearly, \nsome things are being done about those. If you have a child in a safety \nseat or not in a safety seat and it is a State law and you have a law \nenforcement officer out there, you can, in many instances, note that \nand cause the adult to be more responsible than you can in the privacy \nof a home, where most of our firearms are today.\n  My point in arguing or discussing this issue is not to suggest we \nought not to be concerned, but to clearly recognize that we will not, \nby this, in any way create a perfect world. Safe storage devices are no \nsubstitute for common sense and a clear understanding that a firearm \nmisuse can become, as we all know, a lethal device. A firearm \nirresponsibly used can become a lethal device. While I know this is a \npopular thing to do, the point is--and I hope it is made clear by what \nI have said--the world better understands today than ever before, and \nunintentional deaths, accidental deaths by firearms have dramatically \ndropped in this country, and they are continuing to drop.\n  Nothing replaces the responsible action of an adult in his or her \nexercising of their constitutional rights to provide safe storage away \nfrom that casual curiosity of a small child about the uniqueness of a \nmom or dad's firearm, owned and held in the homes of America.\n  So I am certainly going to suggest to my colleagues that they vote \ntheir will on this, but it is important we shape it in the right \ncontext. I have always appreciated working with Senator Kohl and his \nsincerity on these kinds of issues. I think what he suggests today, as \nit relates to fines, or revocation of license, or failing to sell, is \nan appropriate fashion to go. But again, it is a mandate that I think \ntoday's reality in the marketplace would suggest is in part an \nunnecessary thing to do.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask that the time be charged equally on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I rise to talk about this bill. There has been a lot \nof debate on the floor, and some have suggested this is a special \ninterest group piece of legislation. I am here to say that I think it \nis very important this Senate do everything it can to stop frivolous \nlawsuits against gun manufacturers. Class action lawsuit reform, which \nwe enacted earlier this year, also was an effort to curb the overly \nlitigious society America now lives in.\n  We have found in so many instances that it is the litigiousness of \nAmerica's society that drives jobs overseas and out of our country \nbecause we have lawsuit abuse of mammoth proportions. One of the areas \nin which there is lawsuit abuse is suing a gun manufacturer for the \nmisuse of a gun. That is like suing the maker of a plate because \nsomeone throws a plate at another person. That is not what plates are \nfor. And most certainly, the misuse of a gun is not caused by the \nmanufacturer of a gun; it is caused by the person who is misusing the \ngun. So the Senate is taking steps in every area we can to curb this \nabuse of our legal system.\n  Today, we are addressing one portion of that in trying to stop gun \nmanufacturers from being sued erroneously. There are many areas in \nwhich you can\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\nsue a gun manufacturer. If the gun malfunctioned, then that kind of \nlawsuit, of course, would be allowed. They would also be allowed where \nthere is a knowing violation of a firearms law, when the violation is \nthe proximate cause of the harm for which the relief is sought. \nNegligent entrustment, defective product, or breach of contract or \nwarranty are certainly areas where litigation is warranted. But when we \nhave lawsuits filed by cities against plaintiffs such as Colt or \nBeretta, and the cities are filing a lawsuit against the gun \nmanufacturer to stop the manufacture of guns, that is wrong.\n  The second amendment is one of the most treasured of our amendments \nto the Constitution, and that is the right to keep and bear arms, the \nright to protect yourself and your family in your home. That is \nsomething I have a bill to address right here in the District of \nColumbia, to make sure no person is deprived of their right under the \nConstitution to protect themselves in their homes by owning a firearm. \nYou know, America is one of the few countries that doesn't have \nGovernment manufacture of guns. We don't. We have private manufacturers \nof guns and, therefore, we have the private use and private lawsuits \nthat sometimes are filed just because a gun is used in a crime.\n  Well, it is not the fault of the gun manufacturer a crime is being \ncommitted. We need to put the fault for a crime on the person \ncommitting the crime. So I am speaking for this bill. I think Senator \nCraig has laid out very well the issues of the gun laws. I certainly \nwant every gun to be sold with a lock, and most guns in America are. \nAnd if they are not, having that device added to the gun, I think, is \nfine.\n  I want everyone to have safety protection for guns in homes, because \nnothing could be worse than a child going into a gun cabinet and \ngetting a gun that is not understood by the child and is fired. That is \nwhy we have safety locks. Most gun owners are responsible gun owners, \nand they should have a safety lock on a gun, particularly if there are \nchildren in the home.\n  I want to add my support for the bill and the ability for our private \ngun manufacturers to face lawsuits that are legitimate, but not to have \na frivolous lawsuit that is filed against a gun manufacturer through no \nfault of the manufacturer for the misuse of the gun--not a malfunction, \nbut a misuse.\n  I applaud the efforts of Senator Craig, and I hope we can take one \nmore step toward curbing the lawsuit abuse that has been happening in \nthis country in many areas. Frivolous lawsuits have been filed against \ngun manufacturers not for the malfunction of a gun, but the misuse. \nThat is not the fault of the manufacturer, just as it is not the fault \nof other manufacturers of products that are misused.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this important \nlegislation. Let me say, in closing, I have heard a lot of debate about \nstopping the Defense bill to go to this bill.\n  We had a cloture vote on Defense. Many people voted against cloture, \nand therefore the bill was brought down. I hope we can address the \nDefense authorization bill. I voted for cloture so we could go \nforward--not to stop the debate, but to curb it and keep it to relevant \namendments so we may get this very important legislation through. With \nthe cooperation of the other side, we will be able to do that the very \nfirst week we return. But I do think relevant amendments, not 100 \namendments, including issues that do not even pertain to our defense, \nare legitimately cut off through a cloture vote.\n  If we can get cooperation from the other side, we certainly intend to \npursue the Defense authorization bill. I wish we could have done it \nthis week, and I voted for cloture so that we could. We did not win. \nThere were over 40 people who voted against cloture. So now we are on \nanother very important bill, and we intend to take up the energy \nconference report and the highway conference report, two major pieces \nof legislation that we will be able to send to the President this week.\n  I think we are going to have quite a successful week, a successful \nfirst part of this session of Congress to get important legislation on \nenergy to create more incentives for different sources of energy for \nour country so we can become more self-sufficient.\n  Certainly the highway bill will be a jobs creator to put the highway \npeople to work with the larger amount of money that is now available in \nthe highway trust fund. Mass transit is going to get its authorization \nas well in this highway bill.\n  So we have a lot to do. I hope we can continue to pass this gun \nmanufacturers liability bill--it is a good bill--and go forward with \nthe other important business of our country. The first week we get \nback, I hope we will be able to address the elimination of inheritance \ntaxes, death taxes, and I hope very much that we can get the Defense \nauthorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill out by the first \nof the fiscal year so there will not be one day's delay in the money \nthat is needed by our Department of Defense for the needs of the men \nand women who are fighting for the continued freedom of our country by \nfighting terrorism overseas.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the other side has asked if we would \nconsider yielding back time. I will certainly work with the floor \nleader. We are checking to see if there is anyone else on our side who \nwould want to come for the purpose of debating the Kohl amendment. If \nthere is not, we will yield back time and accommodate as much as we \ncan.\n  While we work out our time here, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, while we are \nworking out the time situation to see if anyone else wants to debate, \nthe time under the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are ready to \nvote on the Kohl amendment. So I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESS CONDUCT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     prohibit a civil liability action from being brought or \n     continued against a person if the gross negligence or \n     reckless conduct of that person was a proximate cause of \n     death or injury.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``gross negligence'' has the meaning given \n     that term under subsection (b)(7) of the Bill Emerson Good \n     Samaritan Food Donation Act (42 U.S.C. 1791(b)(7)); and\n       (2) the term ``reckless'' has the meaning given that term \n     under section 2A1.4 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \n     Manual.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, although I am tempted to allow the reading \nto take place, it is a short amendment, and I am going to read the \nheart of it myself:\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a civil \n     liability action from being brought or continued against a \n     person if the gross negligence or reckless conduct of that \n     person was a proximate cause of death or injury.\n\n  The bill itself provides in section 2, page 3, that the purpose of \nthis bill--one of them--is that ``the possibility of imposing liability \non an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an \nabuse of the legal system. . . .''\n  And I agree with that.\n  On page 5 of the bill where it states its purpose:\n\n       Purpose.--\n       (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \n     ammunition products . . . for the harm solely caused by the \n     criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products by others. . \n     . .\n\n  And I agree with that. Nobody should be held responsible or \naccountable for harm which is perpetrated by others.\n  What about their own reckless or negligent conduct? When we look at \nthe language of this bill, it is not just that manufacturers and \ndealers are not held accountable for the misconduct of others, except \nfor three or four very narrowly described categories, they are off the \nhook for their own misconduct, their own reckless conduct, their own \nnegligent misconduct. And that is what my amendment seeks to correct or \nclarify.\n  The stated purpose of this bill is that if negligence or recklessness \nis caused by others, if the misconduct of a third party is the cause of \ndamage, that the gun dealer or manufacturer should not be held \naccountable. We agree with that. But what if their own recklessness, \ntheir own gross negligence contributes to the damage or, to put it in \nlegalistic terms, what happens if their own misconduct is a proximate \ncause of the damage, injury, or death to somebody else? Why should they \nbe off the hook for their own misconduct?\n  I ask unanimous consent, by the way, that Senator Durbin be added as \na cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what the amendment says is this act does \nnot prohibit a civil liability action from being brought or continued \nagainst a person if his own gross negligence or reckless conduct was a \nproximate cause of the death or injury.\n  We have heard about a number of cases that have been brought to the \nattention of this body. These are cases where manufacturers or dealers \nhave been held liable for their own misconduct, their own negligence, \ntheir own recklessness where the allegation against a dealer or \nmanufacturers had to do with their own behavior.\n  We heard about the tragic DC area sniper shootings case where there \nwas a settlement that was obtained from a gun supplier, called Bull's \nEye Shooter Supply, for their own negligence. Mr. President, 238 guns \nhad gone missing from Bull's Eye's inventory. Fifty had been traced to \ncriminal actions since 1997. If this bill had been enacted prior to the \nDC area sniper shootings, the victims would have been unable to even\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\nhave their case against that supplier heard in court. And there are \nmany other cases. There are so many cases that this is why police \nofficers, police chiefs, and police departments around the country \noppose this bill as it is written.\n  We should protect innocent manufacturers and gun dealers, just the \nway we should protect any innocent party in this country. But we should \nnot protect anybody--I don't care if it is a manufacturer of guns or a \nmanufacturer of automobiles or a manufacturer of refrigerators or a \ndealer in those products or any other products--we should not protect \ntheir folks from their own reckless conduct, their own negligence. And \nthis bill does that. It does not say that it does that. It says it is \nprotecting folks from the conduct of others. But the bill's analysis \nclearly indicates, when you go beyond the stated purpose, that it is \nthe manufacturers' and gun dealers' own negligence and recklessness \nwhich is immunized, with very narrow exceptions.\n  If they committed a violation of law, if they have committed a crime, \nyou can go after them; they are still on the hook. If they negligently \nentrust, knowing that the person to whom they have entrusted a weapon \nis going to go out and commit a crime or do something unlawful, they \nare still on the hook. But if they just left their guns sloppily around \nthe store, or if they hired employees who they knew or should have \nknown were going to illegally sell guns, steal guns, and then have \nthose guns used in a criminal endeavor--and these are real cases--if \nthat is the type of negligence or recklessness that is at issue, then \nthey are off the hook.\n  They are only kept on the hook, under the language of this bill, if \nthey designed something negligently, if they have negligently entrusted \nin a very narrow definition, or if they have committed a crime.\n  I want to read excerpts from a letter which has been signed by, I \nbelieve, 75 law professors:\n\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: S. 397 . . . described \n     as ``a bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being \n     brought or continued against manufacturers, distributors, \n     dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages \n     resulting from the misuse of their products by others,'' \n     would largely immunize those in the firearms industry from \n     liability for negligence. This would represent a sharp break \n     with traditional principles of tort liability. No other \n     industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed such blanket freedom from \n     responsibility for the foreseeable and preventable \n     consequences of negligent conduct. . . .\n       American law has never embraced a rule freeing defendants \n     from liability for the foreseeable consequences of their \n     negligence merely because those consequences may include the \n     criminal conduct of third parties.\n\n  Under American tort law, they say:\n\n      . . . actors may be liable if their negligence enables or \n     facilitates foreseeable third party criminal conduct.\n\n  These professors remind us:\n\n       Thus, car dealers who negligently leave vehicles \n     unattended, railroads who negligently manage trains, hotel \n     operators who negligently fail to secure rooms, and \n     contractors who negligently leave dangerous \n     equipment unguarded are all potentially liable if their \n     conduct--\n\n  Their conduct--\n     creates an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of third party \n     misconduct, including illegal behavior, leading to harm.\n\n  In this amendment, we make it clear that if the conduct of gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers is grossly negligent or reckless, and if \nthat is a proximate cause of the death or injury of someone else, they \nare not off the hook, and they should not be. No one in this country \nshould be. No one in this country is, as far as I know.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate that. My cosponsor, Senator Dayton, would \nlike 5 minutes yielded to him. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, for whom I have so much respect. He is a leader and \nchampion in so many important areas and has, once again, risen to this \noccasion. I am proud to be cosponsor of the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. President, this legislation eviscerates the liability for \nnegligence for one industry in America, the gun industry. I strongly \nsupport the second amendment.\n  I have enjoyed the support of the NRA in the past, probably not in \nthe future. Last year in this country, by the industry statistics, over \n1.3 million handguns were sold and over 2 million long guns--legally, \nproperly, in almost all cases constitutionally protected. Nothing in \nthis country, nothing being considered here, nothing that would ever \npass this body, in my lifetime, would prevent law-abiding citizens from \nlawfully buying and owning firearms. Nothing should and nothing will, \nnot because of the existence of the NRA, not because they are holding \nforth and preventing the marauding hordes from somehow overriding and \noverturning this constitutional amendment--it is not going to be \nchanged because the political support in this country would not be for \nit. The people would not support it. That right is constitutional and \nit is inviolable, but it is not inconsistent with that right to also \nrequire the responsible distribution and sale of those millions of \nfirearms.\n  We all know what damage they can do to innocent people when they are \nmisused by criminals or mistakenly used by children. We should do all \nwe reasonably can to prevent those tragedies to innocent people and to \ninnocent families. We should insist that everyone in the gun industry \ndo all they can to prevent them as well. That is what the legal \nstandard of negligence requires. It is what most people in this \nindustry consistently practice.\n  I own two handguns. I own two shotguns. They are in Minnesota, \npurchased from Minnesota dealers who take their responsibilities very \nseriously. They are not our concern. They need not be concerned because \ntheir own practices are a clear defense against any unwarranted \naccusations.\n  However, there are a few in this country, as there are in any \nindustry, that are not responsible manufacturers, distributors, or \ndealers. Senator Levin has cited evidence of the results of those \nirresponsible actions, and they should be our concern. They certainly \ndo not warrant our protection. They certainly do not deserve to be \nelevated to a special status that is not accorded to responsible \nmanufacturers and sellers of every other consumer product in America.\n  The Levin amendment, and I will read it again, says that if gross \nnegligence or reckless conduct of that person was the proximate cause, \na direct cause of death or injury to somebody else, this act shall not \nprohibit a civil liability action from being brought forth. How can \nanyone here be opposed to that? It defines those terms clearly in the \namendment, which was one of the specious excuses used to oppose it last \nyear. It defines its terms more clearly than does the underlying bill. \nSo if this amendment fails, it truly gives lie to the claim that this \nbill intends to hold the gun industry to any standard of liability. If \nnot for gross negligence that is a direct cause of death or injury to \nan innocent person, if not for that, there is no standard of liability \nat all.\n  The American Bar Association has taken a position in opposition to \nthis legislation, and I would just note a couple of references. I ask \nunanimous consent that following my remarks, this be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. It says that this proposed legislation would remove \ndefendants from one of the oldest principles of civil liability law--\nthat persons or companies who act negligently should be accountable to \nvictims harmed by this failure of responsibility. It states that under \nproduct liability laws in most States, manufacturers must adopt \nfeasible safety devices that would prevent injuries caused when their \nproducts are foreseeably misused, regardless of whether the uses are \n``intended'' by the manufacturer or whether the product ``fails or \nimproperly functions.''\n  Thus, as the Senator from Michigan noted, automobile makers have been \nheld civilly liable for not making cars crashworthy even though the \nintended use is not to ``crash the cars.'' Manufacturers of cigarette \nlighters must make them childproof even though children are not \nintended to use them. Under this proposed legislation, however, State \nlaws would be preempted so\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nthat gun manufacturers would enjoy a special immunity.\n  The letter also points out that this is happening in the existing \nlegal backdrop of the present unparalleled immunity that the firearms \nindustry already enjoyed from any Federal safety regulation. Unlike all \nother consumer products except for tobacco, there is no Federal law or \nregulatory authority that sets minimum safety standards for \ndomestically manufactured firearms because that industry was able to \ngain an exemption for firearms from the 1972 enacted Consumer Product \nSafety Act, the primary Federal law that protects consumers from \nproducts that present unreasonable risk of injury. Of all the products \nwe should have included in that legislation, firearms are among them \ngiven the inherent danger from their misuse or from their improper \nmanufacture. Instead, they are exempted from the consumer product \nsafety oversight by the Federal Government. That is the power of the \nindustry. I guess they have the power, they are demonstrating, to get \nthis bill enacted as well and remove themselves from all liability. \nThat is not in the best interest of America. It is not a fair standard \nfor America. It is an injustice to other businesses, manufacturers and \nsellers of every other product in America.\n  If we are going to recognize, as we should, that excessive litigation \nis a problem for this industry and for most all others, we should deal \nwith tort reform in its entirety as it applies fairly and equally to \nall businesses and all industries, not single out one for special \ntreatment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                    Government Affairs Office,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the American Bar \n     Association to express our strong opposition to S. 397, the \n     Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and to similar \n     legislation to enact special tort laws for the firearms \n     industry. The ABA opposes S. 397, and has opposed similar \n     legislation in the past two Congresses, because we believe \n     the proposed legislation is overbroad and would unwisely and \n     unnecessarily intrude into an area of traditional state \n     responsibility.\n       The responsibility for setting substantive legal standards \n     for tort actions in each state's courts, including standards \n     for negligence and product liability actions, has been the \n     province of state legislatures and an integral function of \n     state common law since our nation was founded. S. 397 would \n     preempt state substantive law standards for most negligence \n     and product liability actions for this one industry, \n     abrogating state law in cases in which the defendant is a gun \n     manufacturer, gun seller or gun trade association, and would \n     insulate this new class of protected defendants from almost \n     all ordinary civil liability actions. In our view, the \n     legitimate concerns of some about the reach of a number of \n     suits filed by cities and state governmental units several \n     years ago have since been answered by the deliberative, \n     competent action of state courts and within the traditions of \n     state responsibility for administering tort law.\n       There is no evidence that federal legislation is needed or \n     justified. There is no hearing record in Congress or other \n     evidence to contradict the fact that the state courts are \n     handling their responsibilities competently in this area of \n     law. There is no data of any kind to support claims made by \n     the industry that it is incurring extraordinary costs due to \n     litigation, that it faces a significant number of suits, or \n     that current state law is in any way inadequate. The Senate \n     has not examined the underlying claims of the industry about \n     state tort cases, choosing not to hold a single hearing on S. \n     397 or its predecessor bills in the two previous Congresses. \n     Proponents of this legislation cannot, in fact, point to a \n     single court decision, final judgment or award that has been \n     paid out that supports their claims of a ``crisis''. All \n     evidence points to the conclusion that state legislatures and \n     state courts have been and are actively exercising their \n     responsibilities in this area of law with little apparent \n     difficulty. S. 397 proposes to exempt this one industry from \n     state negligence law. The proposed federal negligence law \n     standard will unfairly exempt firearms industry defendants \n     from the oldest principle of civil liability law: that \n     persons, or companies who act negligently should be \n     accountable to victims harmed by this failure of \n     responsibility. Negligence laws in all 50 dates \n     traditionally impose civil liability when individuals or \n     businesses fail to use reasonable care to minimize the \n     foreseeable risk that others will be injured and injury \n     results. But this proposed legislation would preempt the \n     laws of the 50 states to create a special, higher standard \n     for negligence actions for this one protected class, \n     different than for any other industry, protecting them \n     from liability for their own negligence in all but \n     extremely narrow specified exceptions. The ABA believes \n     that state law standards for negligence and its legal \n     bedrock duty of reasonable care should remain the standard \n     for gun industry accountability in state civil courts, as \n     these state standards do for the rest of our nation's \n     individuals, businesses and industries.\n       The proposed federal product liability standards will \n     unfairly insulate firearm industry defendants from \n     accountability in state courts for design defects in their \n     products. The proposed new federal standard would preempt the \n     product liability laws in all 50 states with a new, higher \n     standard that would protect this industry even for failing to \n     implement safety devices that would prevent common, \n     foreseeable injuries, so long as any injury or death suffered \n     by victims resulted when the gun was not ``used as \n     intended''.\n       Under existing product liability laws in most states, \n     manufacturers must adopt feasible safety devices that would \n     prevent injuries caused when their products are foreseeably \n     misused, regardless of whether the uses are ``intended'' by \n     the manufacturer, or whether the product ``fails'' or \n     ``improperly'' functions. Thus automakers have been held \n     civilly liable for not making cars crashworthy, even though \n     the ``intended use'' is not to crash the car. Manufacturers \n     of cigarette lighters must make them childproof, even though \n     children are not ``intended'' to use them. Under. this \n     proposed legislation, however, state laws would be preempted \n     so that gun manufacturers would enjoy a special immunity.\n       Enactment of S. 397 would also undermine responsible \n     federal oversight of consumer safety. The broad and, we \n     believe, unprecedented immunity from civil liability that \n     would result from enactment of S. 397 must be viewed against \n     the existing legal backdrop of the present, unparalleled \n     immunity the firearms industry enjoys from any federal safety \n     regulation. Unlike other consumer products, there is no \n     federal law or regulatory authority that sets minimum safety \n     standards for domestically manufactured firearms. This is \n     because the firearms industry was able to gain an exemption \n     for firearms from the 1972-enacted Consumer Product Safety \n     Act, the primary federal law that protects consumers from \n     products that present unreasonable risk of injury. Over the \n     last 30 years, an average of200 children under the age of 14 \n     and over a thousand adults each year have died in gun \n     accidents which might have been prevented by existing but \n     unused safety technologies. A 1991 Government Accounting \n     Office report estimated that 31 percent of U.S. children's \n     accidental firearm deaths could have been prevented by the \n     addition of two simple existing devices to firearms: trigger \n     locks and load-indicator devices. Sadly, these minimal safety \n     features are still not required.\n       This bill, if enacted, would insulate the firearms industry \n     from almost all civil actions, in addition to its existing \n     protection from any consumer product safety regulations. Such \n     special status for this single industry raises serious \n     concerns about its constitutionality; victims of gun violence \n     have the right--as do persons injured through negligence of \n     any party--to the equal protection of the law.\n       The risk that states may at some future date fail to \n     appropriately resolve their tort responsibilities in an area \n     of law--where there is no evidence of any failure to date--\n     cannot justify the unprecedented federal preemption of state \n     responsibilities proposed in this legislation. The ABA \n     believes that the states will continue to sort out these \n     issues capably without a federal rewriting of state \n     substantive tort law standards. The wiser course for \n     Congress, we believe, is to respect the ability of states to \n     continue to administer their historic responsibility to \n     define the negligence and product liability standards to be \n     used in their state courts. For these reasons, we urge you to \n     reject S. 397.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of the opposition time \nto the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nhas been proposed by the Senator from Michigan and cosponsored by the \nSenator from Minnesota. While this amendment appears to be innocuous, \nit would actually gut the very underlying purpose of this legislation. \nLet me explain briefly.\n  First, the purpose of this bill is to prohibit frivolous lawsuits \nfrom being brought against manufacturers or sellers of firearms, lawful \nproducts, but which result from the criminal or unlawful use of a \nfirearm.\n  Now, the Senate has many people who have had a lot of experience in \nthe legal profession, and any of us who have had any experience with \ncivil litigation, particularly tort litigation, know that the scope of \nthe discovery, the scope of the litigation is determined by what is \npled actually by the person who brings the lawsuit, or the plaintiff.\n  In my experience, and I am confident that it is generally true, in \nvirtually\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nevery civil lawsuit where damages are sought, not only is there a \npleading of ordinary negligence--or perhaps strict liability if it is a \nproduct or manufacturer--but in addition there is an allegation of \ngross negligence, which is what this amendment would except from the \ngeneral prohibition against lawsuits against manufacturers of these \nlawful products for harm resulting from criminal or unlawful use of a \nfirearm.\n  It is clear to me that the litigation expense, the harassment of a \nlawful manufacturer of this product, would not be avoided. In fact, one \nof the very purposes of this legislation would be undermined if this \namendment were agreed to. So I urge my colleagues to oppose it, as I \ndo.\n  The fact is, in America today, we are less competitive globally \nbecause of a variety of reasons, but it can be summarized this way: our \ntax policy, our regulatory policy, our lawsuit culture, the cost of \nhealth care, just to name four items. But the fact is, because of our \nlitigation culture today in this country, we are less competitive with \nother countries around the world, and we are seeing the exodus of jobs \nin America because, simply stated, manufacturers and producers of other \nlawful goods can do it cheaper and more efficiently elsewhere. That is \na threat to our economy and our prosperity that we enjoy in this \ncountry.\n  This is actually true in the case of gun manufacturers. For example, \none such manufacturer is located in the small town of Eagle Pass in my \nhome State of Texas. A company by the name of Maverick Arms, Inc., \nassembles Maverick and Mossberg brand firearms there and is one of a \ngroup of companies that is in the fourth generation of family ownership \nthat dates as far back as 1919. Maverick employs approximately 150 \nskilled workers in Eagle Pass, as well as supplying other work to other \nvendors.\n  Maverick and its parent company, Mossberg, cannot withstand the \ncontinued onslaught of frivolous litigation against this manufacturer \nfor merely doing what lawful manufacturers do--making a legal product \nbut in this instance one that is misused by a criminal. They know if \nthey get caught up in the litigation, too often emotions run high, \nreason and rationality is suspended, and these manufacturers become not \nonly sued but actually on occasion held responsible for the acts of \ncriminals.\n  I certainly respect the distinguished Senator from Michigan, and I \nwas just thinking, of course, his State is known in particular for \nmanufacturing automobiles. It strikes me that automobiles can be used \nsafely or unsafely, but certainly no one would claim that General \nMotors or any other manufacturer of an automobile should be held \nresponsible if someone decides to take that automobile that is \noperating in completely good condition and decides to run over somebody \nand kill them or cause them physical harm.\n\n  For the same reason, firearms can be used both for lawful purposes \nand safely or they can be misused. For the same reason we would say \nGeneral Motors or any car manufacturer would not be responsible for the \ncriminal use of an automobile, so should manufacturers of firearms not \nbe held responsible for the criminal acts or misuse of their lawful \nproduct.\n  We know in the end that what this is all about is trying to drive gun \nmanufacturers out of business. Unfortunately, that means American jobs \nare being threatened. Eventually it means that the second amendment \nrights of law-abiding citizens are compromised.\n  I wish we would focus more of our efforts, as we have in the recent \npast, on criminals, the people who misuse firearms, the ones who cannot \nlawfully own or sell firearms, and leave those who are making a lawful \nproduct that can be and is used safely day in and day out out of the \npicture.\n  Indeed, the effect of this amendment, I submit to my colleagues, is \nto undermine the effect of the entire bill which would protect these \nlawful manufacturers from frivolous litigation when their product is \nmisused by a criminal and causes harm to some person. So I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I thank the \nmanagers for the courtesy they showed us in the course of managing this \nbill.\n  I rise, as I did in the previous consideration of this bill, to \nsupport my colleague from Michigan. I do so because I basically want to \nbe counted among those who are trying to bring a measure of relief to \nthose professional people, such as doctors and educators, a whole list \nof people I enumerated last night when I addressed this bill on the \nSenate floor, who need help. In my judgment, Senator Levin--both of us \nare lawyers--is reaching back to the very fundamentals of the common \nlaw. These standards which the Senator wishes to have in this bill are \nthe same standards that have withstood the test of time in court \nlitigation from the very beginning of the judicial process, indeed in \nEngland and in our country. It is for that reason that I support it.\n  I also draw the attention of my colleagues to my amendment, which is \nnot pending, but as I understand, it is filed at the desk, amendment \nNo. 1625. I rise at this time to speak to it because it really \naddresses, in a very narrow way, one of the ultimate goals of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  My concern is that the gun dealers across America need some \nprotection themselves in this legislation. Ninety-nine percent are \nhonest, law-abiding citizens. Yet they are subjected to the problems of \nour society today; namely, people can come in and steal from them.\n  My amendment adds to the bill, which has a provision in it on page 8 \nof the exclusions, and it would simply say, in actions brought against \na gun dealer, a dealer which has a record of misconduct, negligence, \nand other types of criteria should not be entitled to the exemptions \nprovided by this piece of legislation. So I want to be supportive. It \nprotects those dealers who are trying to act in a lawful way who may \nhave an accident, for some reason, and it does clearly remove from the \nprotection of this bill dealers such as the one the Senator cited in \nthe sniper case which struck my State of Virginia and Maryland and the \nDistrict and paralyzed our businesses. People were afraid to go out on \nthe street at night to conduct their ordinary affairs of life because \nof the threats.\n  That was a stolen weapon from a gun dealer that, for one reason or \nanother, allowed some 200 weapons to disappear from the shelves of that \nstore or inventory over a period of a year or two. That dealer, in my \njudgment, would be protected as it now stands, unless the provisions \ncomparable to perhaps those from the Senator from Michigan or in my \namendment are brought to the attention of the Senate. At some time, I \nwill arduously try to get my amendment in that status--I believe it is \ngermane--that it can be considered by this body, as is the amendment of \nthe Michigan Senator now being reviewed.\n  So I say to my distinguished manager, I hope that whatever procedure \nby which you hereby determine such amendments can be heard--others \nnot--that mine, which I understand is germane, can be heard by the \nSenate at an appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me get back to the Levin amendment which is our pending business. \nThis amendment was tabled last year, and it should be again defeated or \ntabled. It is an amendment which would, in effect, be a poison pill for \nthe entire bill because, in effect, what it says is if you allege gross \nnegligence or recklessness, then the exemption the bill provides \nevaporates. So you are a lawyer. All you do is allege gross negligence \nor recklessness and, bingo, you are back in court again. So it totally \nundercuts the purpose of this legislation.\n  Secondly, last year the bill didn't contain a definition of gross \nnegligence or recklessness. This year that was corrected, at least \nafter a manner of speaking. But what definition do we have of gross \nnegligence, for example? The bill provides that we turn to section B of \nthe Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. The definition of \ngross negligence under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\nDonation Act is totally different from the case law definition of any \nState in the Union. It is totally different from the settled or \nstandard concept of gross negligence in tort law.\n  Let me illustrate the difference. Under this bill, the term would \nmean: Voluntary and conscious conduct, including a failure to act by a \nperson who at the time of the conduct knew that the conduct was likely \nto be harmful to the health or well being of another person.\n  That is not gross negligence. Black's Law Dictionary captures the \nessence of the definition. It defines gross negligence as the \nintentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of \nthe consequences as affecting the life or property of another. And it \nconsists of the conscious and voluntary act or omission which is likely \nto result in grave injury when in the face of clear and present danger \nof which the alleged tortfeasor is aware. And the standard, obviously \nin comparison to the Levin standard to be inserted into the statute \nthis year, is quite different. Even if the judge were to look to the \nstandard itself, he would find that that standard is significantly \ndifferent than the usual concept of the term and does not rise, in any \nmeaningful way, to what any of us who have practiced tort law would \nunderstand gross negligence to mean.\n  Third, this is a highly regulated industry by law, by Federal law and \nState law and even some local laws. And most of the acts that would \nmeet the definition of gross negligence would already be in violation \nof law. And if they are in violation of law, they are not exempted from \nthis legislation. We don't try to exempt any gun manufacturer for \nconduct which is in violation of law. So by definition that would be an \nexemption from the provisions of the bill, if it becomes law, and \ntherefore would not need to be included.\n  The bottom line here is that if there really is a problem, that is to \nsay, the conduct is so bad that it is a violation of law, no lawsuit is \nprecluded under our bill in any way. And if it doesn't rise to that \nlevel, then it should not be considered to be within the concept of \ngross negligence under that term as it has always been applied in tort \nlaw. The definition that is to be substituted this year is clearly not \na definition most of us would deem appropriate under these \ncircumstances.\n\n  So in fact if the gross negligence or reckless conduct of a person \nwas the proximate cause of death or injury--that is the allegation--you \nare in court irrespective of this bill, and clearly it totally \nundercuts the purpose of the bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that our colleagues vote against the Levin \namendment or table it, as was done last year, and recognize that this \nis designed to totally undercut the bill and, for that reason, would \nnot be an appropriate amendment to be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains for the proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 18\\1/2\\ minutes, \nthe Senator from Michigan has 8 minutes and 11 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Idaho has how much time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis statement.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The reason I am supporting this bill, from a 30,000-foot \nview of it rather than getting down into the weeds, is I think this is \na defining ``cultural moment'' in the history of our country--when \nunder what circumstances can someone get in your wallet, hold you \nresponsible financially for an event, no matter how unfortunate it \nmight be. Generally speaking, in the law of negligence, the first thing \nyou have to establish in civil liability is a duty. You have to prove \nthat the person being sued had a duty and violated that duty and the \nviolation was the proximate cause and the damages flow from that event.\n  Here is what this bill does not do. It does not let a gun \nmanufacturer off the hook from the duty of producing a reliable and \nsafe gun. If you defectively produce a weapon, you can be held liable. \nIt doesn't let a seller or a distributor off the hook for violating a \nstatute or making a sale illegally because it says, if you violate the \nlaw that exists, then you have broken a duty. Duty can be established \nby relationships. It can be established by a statute. So this bill does \nnot allow someone to sell a gun without following the procedures that \nwe have set out to sell a gun. It doesn't allow someone to make a gun \nthat is unsafe. You are on the hook, and you can be held accountable \nbased on a simple negligence theory or a negligence per se theory, if \nyou violate a specific statute during the sale of a gun or \nmanufacturing of a gun.\n  But what this bill prevents, and I think rightfully so, is \nestablishing a duty along this line: That you have a responsibility, \neven if you do a lawful transaction or make a safe gun, for an event \nthat you can't control, which is the intentional misuse of a weapon in \na criminal fashion by another person.\n  That is the heart of this bill. It doesn't relieve you of duties that \nthe law imposes upon you to safely manufacture and to carefully sell. \nBut we are not going to extend it to a concept where you are \nresponsible, after you have done everything right, for what somebody \nelse may do who bought your product and they did it wrong and it is \ntheir fault, not yours. So it does not matter whether you use a gross \nnegligence standard, a simple negligence standard, you have blown by \nthe concept of the bill in my opinion. The debate should be, is there a \nduty owed in this country for people who follow the law, manufacture \nsafely, sell within the confines of the laws we have written at the \nState and Federal level to the public at large if an injury results \nfrom the criminal act of another? If that ever happens, this country \nhas made a major change in the way we relate to each other and a major \nchange in the law.\n  There are other efforts to make this happen. There is an effort, on \nthe part of some, to hold food manufacturers liable if you choose to \nbuy a lawful product and misuse it by eating too much of it, creating a \nduty on the part of the people who sell food to manage your own \nbehavior, the behavior of another. Once you leave the store, if you \nfollow this out, they should go home with you and make sure you are \ndoing everything else right.\n  That to me is why this amendment from my good friend from Michigan \nshould not be adopted and why we need to pass this bill. I am all for \nlegal duties where there is a reason for them to exist. Safely \nmanufacture a gun? You better believe it. If you put it in a stream of \ncommerce and it hurts somebody and it is your fault, you will have a \nday in court.\n  If you sell a gun and you don't do it right and you have it in the \nwrong hands, then you will have your day in court.\n  The bill even has a negligent provision. If you negligently entrust a \nweapon to someone you know or should know should not have that gun, you \nwill have your day in court. What we are not going to do, under a gross \nnegligence or simple negligence standard, is create a duty on the part \nof sellers and manufacturers for an event that they can't control, \nwhich is the intentional misuse of a weapon to commit a crime or \nsomething akin to that, something that you can't control, nor should \nyou be required to be responsible for the actions of others in that \narea of life. If we ever hold people who make products accountable for \nthe misdeeds and the mistakes of others when there is no rational \nrelationship or no rational ability to control it, then we have \nfundamentally changed America. This bill is very important, I say to \nSenator Craig. We have to pass this bill and stop this kind of legal \nreasoning because it is going to undermine our country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. I wonder if \nSenator Graham might wait. I want to comment on his remarks, and I \ndon't want to do this without him being aware of it.\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\n  The good Senator said that if you have done everything right, you \nshould not be held accountable. Of course. That is a given. I accept \nthat. But what if you have been reckless, what if you have been grossly \nnegligent and that gross negligence--by the way, I am perfectly happy \nto accept the Black's Law Dictionary definition if my good friend from \nArizona wants to substitute that for the definition in this bill. That \nis not the issue. But if the gross negligence and recklessness is a \nproximate cause of injury, why should the manufacturer or dealer be \nimmunized then?\n  What the Senator from South Carolina says is a truism; of course you \nshould not be held accountable for the wrongdoing of other people. The \nquestion is whether you should be held accountable for your own \nrecklessness, your own gross negligence. We should not immunize people \nagainst their own negligence. That is the issue. That is the only issue \nof this amendment. We don't see but what this bill does is eliminate \nrights, rights of people to get compensation against others who have \nbeen a cause of their death or injury. That is what the bill does, and \nthat is what is wrong. There is no other industry, no other industry \nhas that immunity. But this industry would be given that immunity for \nthe first time that I know of in American history or tort history. You \ncan perform, perpetrate an act of gross negligence or reckless conduct \nand not be held accountable. Now, if you commit a crime you will be \nheld accountable, or if you negligently entrust, you will be held \naccountable, but all the other acts of negligence, which are \nperpetratable, are going to be immunized. It is not a matter, by the \nway, of alleging gross negligence or recklessness. It is a matter of \nproving recklessness or gross negligence, because the amendment says, \nnot that the allegation is enough; it is that if you show gross \nnegligence or recklessness caused your death or injury, you must have, \nstill, a cause of action.\n\n  I am happy to yield at this time to my dear friend from Illinois.\n  I don't know how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 5 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield 5 minutes. Does the Senator from Rhode \nIsland want any time?\n  Mr. REED. No. Go ahead.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  Let me describe a tragedy, a tragedy which hits a little close to \nhome for me. My grandson is 9 years old.\n  This is a tragedy involving a 10-year-old little boy in Philadelphia. \nOn February 11 of last year, this little boy, Faheem, was on his way to \nschool, walking from home to school. As he came into the schoolyard \nthrough the gates, a gang member came up and shot him in the face. He \nremained conscious for a short period of time, lapsed into a coma, and \ndied 5 days later. That is a tragedy.\n  The reason I bring it up is because the amendment of Senator Levin, \nbefore us, addresses this tragedy. Where did the gun from come? It \nturns out it was in the hands of a gang member, one of these drug gang \nkids, crazed, trying to find money, shooting in every direction. He had \nthe gun in his hand.\n  The obvious question to be asked is, Where did this drug gang member \nget his gun? We know where he got it. He got it through the American \nGun and Lock Company of Girard Avenue, in Philadelphia, PA.\n  Did he buy it there? No. What happened was one of the gang members \nwalked into this gun store with his girlfriend and he said, My \ngirlfriend wants to buy some guns.\n  Why did he say his girlfriend? Because the gang member had a criminal \nrecord. He couldn't buy the guns. So the gun owner, the gun store \nowner, sees the girlfriend buying the guns for the gang member standing \nnext to her, and decides he is going to charge a handling fee because \nshe is a third-party purchaser.\n  They knew what was going on. The girl friends buy guns for the gangs \nto use on the street. So the store sold the gun, clearly understanding \nwhat was going on here, even charging a handling fee for it. It gets on \nthe street in the hands of a gang member and a 10-year-old little boy \nwalking into the schoolyard is shot in the face and killed.\n  So the question is this: Did the gun dealer do anything wrong? That \nis the question. I think it is a legitimate question. I think the gun \ndealer knew exactly what was going on here. The gun dealer wanted to \nmake some money. The gun dealer was willing to look beyond the obvious \ncriminal standing in front of him to the straw purchaser, this \ngirlfriend, and let the girlfriend buy the gun and even charge a \nhandling fee. What Senator Levin's amendment says is this is gross \nnegligence. If you did not know this gun was going to be used in a \ncrime, you were certainly negligent in allowing this to occur on your \npremises and we ought to be able to go to court. The family of this \nlittle boy who was murdered on the street should be able to go to court \nand say that gun dealer should be held responsible.\n  Do you know what? This bill before us will never allow that gun \ndealer to be held responsible for that misconduct. He sold the gun to \nthe girlfriend of the gang member. The gun hits the street. The gun \nkills the little boy. And the courthouse doors will be closed to that \nfamily because of this bill unless we pass the amendment of Senator \nLevin.\n  That is what this is all about. If you think that is fair to let that \ngun dealer off the hook and to say to the family of that 10-year-old \nboy, ``We are sorry; you don't have the right to go to court and hold \nthat gun dealer personally responsible,'' then you naturally would have \nto oppose the amendment of Senator Levin. But if you think this \nbusiness, as every business in America, has a responsibility to do the \nright thing, there is a standard of care in the products they sell and \nthe way they sell them, that this company, like every other company in \nAmerica, should be held responsible for their own misconduct, then I \nsuggest you should vote for the amendment of Senator Levin.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 13 minutes 19 seconds for the \nSenator from Idaho, 36 seconds for the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have heard some of the most fascinating \narguments in relation to the Levin amendment on both sides. I think it \nis clear if the Levin amendment were to become part of this legislation \nand this legislation were to become law, it would be relatively \nmeaningless as to where we are in relation to the kind of junk or \ndilatory lawsuits that are currently being filed against gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers who not only produce a legal product to \nthe market but sell it in the legal context.\n  It is important that we understand the arguments about gross \nnegligence and reckless conduct. The idea that has been expressed by \nthe Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Texas, and certainly the \nSenator from South Carolina, is that once you argue that, then \nobviously as an attorney the process must prove you are either right or \nwrong. In so arguing it, and in the effort of making proof, you have in \nlarge part destroyed the intent, of the legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am more than happy to yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This has been a fascinating legal discussion. May I have \na minute or two to answer?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will allow the Senator to take as much time as he \ndesires.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I missed it. I think the fact pattern goes along the \nlines of a criminal goes in with a girlfriend or some other person and \ntries to purchase a weapon. What responsibility would someone have \nthere?\n  If the dealer or the seller or the person in question had a \nreasonable opportunity to know a crime was afoot, or this was a sham \ndeal, then I argue the bill would cover it under negligent entrustment. \nBut here is what we would not want to do, in my opinion. You wouldn't \nwant to hold the seller or the distributor liable if he had no reason \nto understand that a criminal conspiracy by two people he is not \nresponsible for\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nwas about to happen. Because that would be unfair. But if he had a \nreason to know, a reasonable opportunity to know, then that would be a \ntotally different scenario.\n  That is a classic example of what we do not want to do. If a person, \nabout to make a sale, should have known something was afoot to violate \nthe law, they can be held responsible. But if you as a dealer are a \nvictim of a criminal conspiracy you had no part or knowledge of, we are \nnot going to make you responsible. That is the essence of this bill. \nBecause to do so would undo legal concepts that stood 200 years, would \nput people out of business, and makes no sense.\n  I yield back to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, over the last good number of years, law-\nabiding gun manufacturers in this country producing a legal product to \nthe market, law-abiding gun dealers performing within the confines of \nthe Federal firearms licensing process, have spent over $225 million \ndefending themselves from the very arguments the Senator from Michigan \nwould like to have continued.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has well spelled out that there is a \nduty and there is a responsibility. But if that duty is taken beyond \nyour ability to know it, to understand it, to be able to act against \nit, then you ought not be responsible.\n  We have gotten ourselves into a very litigious society. So in a way \nit has cost our society more than almost any other society in the \ndeveloped world today. Why? Because we would like to shove blame off \nonto someone else. When society wrongs society, it has to be somebody \nelse's fault besides the one who perpetrated the wrong. So we have \nattempted to reach back through law, time and time again. As a result--\nwe have heard it, whether it is the cost of an automobile or whether it \nis the cost of a firearm today or whether it is the cost of almost any \nconsumer product--it is going to cost you more because somewhere the \nproducers have to mount large amounts of money to pay their legal fees \nto fend off someone looking for an excuse to blame someone else for the \naction of someone who should have been responsible for themselves.\n  That is the essence or the underlying construction of what has \nbrought us to the floor today. This argument will not be argued in \nbehalf of gun manufacturers. Over the course of the next several years \nit will be argued in behalf of a lot of law-abiding, producing \nAmericans who have simply grown tired and fed up with the idea that \nthey always have to be sued although what they are doing is legal, \neven though they are within the law. That is because somehow somebody \nused what they have made illegally, and as a result they should have \nknown and they are responsible because surely the person who \nperpetrated the crime cannot be held responsible because society either \nproduced them or the environment in which they became irresponsible was \na societal responsibility.\n\n  Oh, my goodness, where do we rest the blame? I think many of our \nparents suggested that we were responsible for our actions and we would \nhave to pay the price. But the argument here is quite the opposite, \nthat someone who might have a deep pocket somewhere down the road, \nbecause what they produced is a legal product for the market which was \nthen used in a criminal act, should pay that price. And the criminal--\nnot suggesting they would go free, but certainly suggesting they can't \nafford to pay, so someone else ought to pay, and the argument goes on \nand on.\n  You have heard my arguments over the course of the last 48 hours. We \nare the only nation who doesn't have a government-owned weapons \nfactory. It has always been a product of the private market. If we \nchoose to run them out of our country, then all of the firearms our men \nand women in the military use, our law enforcement community uses, our \nlaw-abiding citizens own, will be made in some other country.\n  I do not believe that is where our country wants to go, and it is \nclear that is not where a majority of the Senate wants to go. I do \nbelieve the Senate, as reflected by its vote on the cloture motion to \nproceed and ultimately get us to this bill, is reflective of society as \na whole.\n  I hope a majority of the Senate will oppose the Levin amendment. I do \nnot believe you can suggest you are going to correct a problem in one \ninstance and then open another door and allow a death by a thousand \ncuts, as obviously would occur here, if that case were the one we are \narguing.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 5 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the next 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. He has made very strong arguments \nhere. Nobody who is thinking should vote for this amendment.\n  I rise today to speak against this amendment No. 1623, an amendment \nwhich, in my view, would have the effect of gutting this gun liability \nbill. This amendment, if passed, could actually expand the number of \nlawsuits against gun makers and sellers dramatically. This is because \nthe definition of gross negligence referenced in the amendment \neliminates the requirement that a duty of care exists in order to be \nnegligent in one's actions toward another.\n  As any of us who has been to law school knows, a duty toward another \nis the first element of any tort. But this amendment wipes out this \nelement from the definition of gross negligence. In other words, this \namendment would allow anti-gun lawyers to easily claim that gun makers \nand sellers know their products are ``likely to be harmful,'' without \nhaving to prove any duty or clear connection to the injured party.\n  This turns common law tort principles on its head. This is nothing \nmore than a calculated effort by opponents of this legislation to \nexpand the reach of this doctrine to get at conduct that had not \npreviously been covered.\n  Furthermore, this amendment is simply not needed. Virtually any act \nthat would meet the definition of gross negligence referenced in this \namendment would already be a violation of Federal, State or local law, \nand therefore would not receive the protection of this law anyway.\n  This amendment is an attempt to undermine this legislation. We \ndefeated this amendment soundly last year--soundly. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to defeat it again.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague and friend from Idaho who has led \nthis fight courageously and in every way with the highest of standards. \nFrankly, this is one that should not see the light of day. I hope our \ncolleagues will vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am prepared to yield back the balance of our time if the \nSenator from Michigan is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe I have half a minute remaining, and I would like \nto use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have been told people should not be held \naccountable for the wrongdoing of others; that is true. The question is \nwhether they should be held accountable for their own wrongdoing.\n  This amendment would make sure that gun dealers and manufacturers--\nsuch as any other dealer or manufacturer--could be held accountable for \ntheir own wrongdoing. That is the issue. It is very clear in the \nwording of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from 75 law professors describing \nwhat this bill would do in terms of eliminating responsibility for \nmanufacturers' and gun dealers' own conduct be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The University of Michigan\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                                    Ann Arbor, MI.\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: As a professor of law at \n     the University of Michigan Law School, I write to alert you \n     to the legal implications of S. 397 and H.R. 800, the \n     ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.'' My colleagues, \n     who join me in signing this letter, are professors at law \n     schools around the country. This bill would represent a \n     substantial and radical departure from traditional principles \n     of American tort law. Though described as an effort to limit \n     the unwarranted expansion of tort liability, the bill would \n     in fact represent a dramatic\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n     narrowing of traditional tort principles by providing one \n     industry with a literally unprecedented immunity from \n     liability for the foreseeable consequences of negligent \n     conduct.\n       S. 397 and H.R. 800, described as ``a bill to prohibit \n     civil liability actions from being brought or continued \n     against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of their products by others,'' would largely immunize those \n     in the firearms industry from liability for negligence. This \n     would represent a sharp break with traditional principles of \n     tort liability. No other industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed \n     such a blanket freedom from responsibility for the \n     foreseeable and preventable consequences of negligent \n     conduct.\n       It might be suggested that the bill would merely preclude \n     what traditional tort law ought to be understood to preclude \n     in any event--lawsuits for damages resulting from third party \n     misconduct, and in particular from the criminal misuse of \n     firearms. This argument, however, rests on a fundamental \n     misunderstanding of American tort law. American law has never \n     embraced a rule freeing defendants from liability for the \n     foreseeable consequences of their negligence merely because \n     those consequences may include the criminal conduct of third \n     parties. Numerous cases from every American jurisdiction \n     could be cited here, but let the Restatement (Second) of \n     Torts suffice:\n\n\n  Sec. 449. TORTIOUS OR CRIMINAL ACTS THE PROBABILITY OF WHICH MAKES \n                       ACTOR'S CONDUCT NEGLIGENT\n\n       If the likelihood that a third person may act in a \n     particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which \n     makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, \n     negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not \n     prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby. \n     (emphasis supplied)\n       Similarly, actors may be liable if their negligence enables \n     or facilitates foreseeable third party criminal conduct.\n       Thus, car dealers who negligently leave vehicles \n     unattended, railroads who negligently manage trains, hotel \n     operators who negligently fail to secure rooms, and \n     contractors who negligently leave dangerous equipment \n     unguarded are all potentially liable if their conduct creates \n     an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of third party \n     misconduct, including illegal behavior, leading to harm, In \n     keeping with these principles, cases have found that sellers \n     of firearms and other products (whether manufacturers, \n     distributors or dealers) may be liable for negligently \n     supplying customers or downstream sellers whose negligence, \n     in turn, results in injuries caused by third party criminal \n     or negligent conduct. In other words, if the very reason \n     one's conduct is negligent is because it creates a \n     foreseeable risk of illegal third party conduct, that illegal \n     conduct does not sever the causal connection between the \n     negligence and the consequent harm. Of course, defendants are \n     not automatically liable for illegal third party conduct, but \n     are liable only if--given the foreseeable risk and the \n     available precautions--they were unreasonable (negligent) in \n     failing to guard against the danger. In most cases, moreover, \n     the third party wrongdoer will also be liable. But, again, \n     the bottom line is that under traditional tort principles a \n     failure to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable \n     dangerous illegal conduct by others is treated no differently \n     from a failure to guard against any other risk.\n       S. 397 and H.R. 800 would abrogate this firmly established \n     principle of tort law. Under this bill, the firearms industry \n     would be the one and only business in which actors would be \n     free utterly to disregard the risk, no matter how high or \n     foreseeable, that their conduct might be creating or \n     exacerbating a potentially preventable risk of third party \n     misconduct. Gun and ammunition makers, distributors, \n     importers, and sellers would, unlike any other business or \n     individual, be free to take no precautions against even the \n     most foreseeable and easily preventable harms resulting from \n     the illegal actions of third parties. And they could engage \n     in this negligent conduct persistently, even with the \n     specific intent of profiting from sales of guns that are \n     foreseeably headed to criminal hands. Under this bill, a \n     firearms dealer, distributor, or manufacturer could park an \n     unguarded open pickup truck full of loaded assault rifles on \n     a city street corner, leave it there for a week, and yet be \n     free from any negligence liability if and when the guns were \n     stolen and used to do harm. A firearms dealer, in most \n     states, could sell 100 guns to the same individual every day, \n     even after the dealer is informed that these guns are being \n     used in crime--even, say, by the same violent street gang.\n       It might appear from the face of the bill that S.397 and \n     H.R. 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability \n     for truly egregious misconduct, by virtue of several \n     exceptions set forth in Section 4(5)(i). Those exceptions, \n     however, are in fact quite narrow, and would give those in \n     the firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks \n     of foreseeable third party misconduct.\n       One exception, for example would purport to permit certain \n     actions for ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on, \n     however, to define ``negligent entrustment'' extremely \n     narrowly. The exception applies only to sellers, for example, \n     and would not apply to distributors or manufacturers, no \n     matter how egregious their conduct. Even as to sellers, the \n     exception would apply only where the particular person to \n     whom a seller supplies a firearm is one whom the seller knows \n     or ought to know will use it to cause harm. The ``negligent \n     entrustment'' exception would, therefore, not permit any \n     action based on reckless distribution practices, negligent \n     sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals (as in the \n     above example), careless handling of firearms, lack of \n     security, or any of a myriad potentially negligent acts.\n       Another exception would leave open the possibility of \n     liability for certain statutory violations, variously \n     defined, including those described under the heading of \n     negligence per se. Statutory violations, however, represent \n     just a narrow special case of negligence liability. No \n     jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to \n     every detail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there \n     is no need. Why is there no need? Because general principles \n     of tort law make clear that the mere absence of a specific \n     statutory prohibition is not carte blanche for unreasonable \n     or dangerous behavior. S. 397 and H.R. 800 would turn this \n     traditional framework on its head; and free those in the \n     firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like, \n     so long as the conduct has not been specifically prohibited. \n     If there is no statute against leaving an open truckload of \n     assault rifles on a street corner, or against selling 100s of \n     guns to the same individual, under this bill there could be \n     no tort liability. Again, this represents radical departure \n     from traditional tort principles.\n       My aim here is simply to provide information, and insure \n     that you are not inadvertently misled about the meaning and \n     scope of S. 397 and H.R. 800. As currently drafted, this Bill \n     would not simply protect against the expansion of tort \n     liability, as has been suggested, but would in fact \n     dramatically limit the application of longstanding and \n     otherwise universally applicable tort principles. It provides \n     to firearms makers and distributors a literally unprecedented \n     form of tort immunity not enjoyed or even dreamed of by any \n     other industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sherman J.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the legislation before us \ntoday is a good tort reform bill. It deals with a discrete area of \nabuse in our legal system. We in this Congress have the responsibility \nto monitor our legal system. If it is not functioning well, we ought to \ndeal with it. It is a practical act to protect manufacturers and \nsellers of a lawful item, and it has constitutional implications \nbecause the destruction of our firearms industry in America indeed \nwould implicate and undermine the constitutional right Americans have \nof keeping and bearing arms. It is good for jobs.\n  We know American manufacturers are under siege from lawsuits, and we \ncould end up losing an entire industry, which is a pretty big industry. \nIt is good for our police and national defense; that is where they get \ntheir firearms. The Secretary of Defense wrote us a letter indicating--\nactually, the legal counsel wrote the letter to say they support it \nbecause they are concerned about the manufacturing capability of \nfirearms used by our military. The same companies fighting these suits \nare also the companies that produce firearms for the military and our \npolice forces.\n  It is good because it restores the historic principles of what \nliability should be in our country. Where and how should one be liable? \nWhat acts can justify someone coming and taking your property? What \nkind of acts of wrongdoing do you have to commit before that is \npossible? Also, we might ask ourselves, what industry might be next? If \nwe erode the classical defenses and principles that protect legitimate \nbusinesses in this case, what business might be next? I was pleased to \nhear that we achieved a bipartisan consensus, it seems, with \n61 cosponsors for the legislation. I had hoped we would move it through \nrather rapidly. I knew a good number of Senators cared deeply about it \nand did not approve of it, and they wanted to speak about it. But the \ntruth of the matter is, this is taking quite a long time. We have had a \nfilibuster even on a motion to proceed to the bill, which included 30 \nhours of post-cloture debate on that, and 66 Senators voted to have \ncloture and bring this bill up on the floor for debate. So we have \ngood, strong, bipartisan support for moving forward with this \nlegislation.\n\n  I know the majority leader is committed. We can complete it, even if \nwe have to go into the weekend. Hopefully, that won't happen, but I am \nprepared to be here and I think most Senators are. After this amount of \neffort, let's complete this. We can see the end in sight. I urge that \nthe discussions going on allow us to proceed more rapidly. I hope we \nwill have good success on that.\n  I believe the opposition to this legislation spins out of a hostility \nto firearms by some. If you look at it, it is mostly in the big cities \nwhere they are not familiar with hunting, outdoors, and recreational \nshooting. The emotional fervor for radically limiting the historic \nAmerican right to keep and bear arms arises out of a fear of crime and \na desire to be safe and, I think, a misunderstanding of the nature and \ncharacter of decent, law-abiding citizens in this country who possess \nfirearms and use them to hunt and for recreational purposes on a \nregular basis. But I understand crime is a big part of the objection to \nfirearms. It is out of that fear and concern that we have mayors and \ncities passing laws that create strict liability, such as the District \nof Columbia. In a recent case that ruled against the Beretta Company, \nBeretta wrote us that if this law remains in effect, they could become \nliable for every murder using a Beretta handgun that may occur in \nWashington, DC, even though they may have lawfully sold the gun through \na dealer in Alabama, Minnesota, Maine, or California. But if it ended \nup here some way by some criminal and somebody got shot, they have the \nability to hold the manufacturer or the dealer liable for that. They \nbecome an insurer against criminal activity by criminals.\n  It is not a sound principle of law. It cannot be defended on \nprinciple. That is what we are trying to curtail here--this utilization \nof the legal system, the court system, the lawsuit system, to effect a \npublic policy end that has not been supported by the people and \nactually could threaten the ability to keep and bear arms and threaten \nan entire industry in our country. I understand what is bringing this \nup.\n  I want to share some important things. What is causing crime? We \ndon't know for sure. We know some of the causes. What can we do to deal \nwith it? How can we utilize gun laws to reduce crime and violence and \nmake\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\nour communities safer, do the right thing? Does passing more and more \nburdensome laws and regulations that fall on lawful gun owners help \nreduce crime? I submit to you it does not.\n  There are dramatic numbers that I think indicate the effectiveness of \ngun law prosecutions to reduce crime. When I came to the Senate in \n1997, I had been a U.S. attorney and, as such, prosecuted criminals who \nutilized guns and violated Federal gun law. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has done that, too; he has been a prosecutor. He dealt with \nthese Federal gun laws. What we did was focus on the law that dealt \nwith criminal behavior, and we were aggressive about it. I remember \ncoming up with a name for our project. We called it Project Triggerlock \nin, I guess, the late 1980s. We had a newsletter and we talked with all \nour sheriffs and local police about the new, tough Federal gun laws \nthat crack down on the utilization of a gun during a criminal act, and \nthe 5-year mandatory penalty without parole if you carry a firearm \nduring a drug offense, or if you possess a firearm after having been \nconvicted of a felony, you would go to jail and it would be without \nparole.\n  I thought it was an effective thing and we worked hard to prosecute \nthose cases. Then I was elected Alabama attorney general and then I \ncame to the Senate. When I came here, there was one new gun law after \nanother that attempted to restrict gun ownership and the ability to get \nguns. We were voting on them all the time. I began to say, what are we \ndoing prosecutionwise with the laws we have? I began to inquire in the \nJudiciary Committee, of which I am a member. In 1997 when Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno or the division chief, or the head of the ATF came \nup, I began to ask questions.\n  If you can see this chart, you begin to see where my concerns came \nfrom. Going along in the 1990s, in 1992 and 1993, there were 3,700 and \n3,800 gun prosecutions per year. They began to drop off 20 percent. By \n1996, they had fallen 20 percent, and by 1997, 20 percent. We began to \nask questions about that and push this issue with the Attorney General. \nI raised it every time she came before the committee with her staff \npeople. I think maybe that or other things happened that began to show \na trend change. We started moving up a little bit. By 2000, we were \nback up to 6,000 gun prosecutions.\n  President Bush campaigned on it. When John Ashcroft came up for his \nconfirmation, I reminded him of the promise the President had made. I \nasked Attorney General Ashcroft: Will you make prosecution of gun \ncrimes a high priority by the U.S. Department of Justice? He said: Yes, \nsir, I will. Now we have Attorney General Gonzales. Look at these \nnumbers; they have doubled since 2000. We have 11,000 prosecutions per \nyear now. Many of those carry significant time in jail. If a person \ncarries a fully automatic weapon--a MAC-11 or a machine gun of some \nkind--during a drug trafficking offense, the penalty they suffer is 30 \nyears in jail without parole. We saw that happen all over Miami. People \nwere shooting. There were gang wars, with machine guns that were used \nto shoot people down.\n  These tough laws that were passed in the early 1980s cracked down. \nNow you don't see machine guns among drug dealers. In fact, because of \nthese prosecutions you are seeing fewer and fewer drug dealers carrying \nguns and fewer other criminals carry guns because they know if they get \ncaught, they will be sent to Federal jail without parole for a long \ntime.\n  I want to talk about that. Somewhere along in 1998, 1999, or 2000, we \nhad before the Judiciary Committee the testimony of a very impressive \nU.S. attorney from Richmond, appointed by the Clinton administration. \nHe was an African American. He had developed what he called Project \nExile. I called it ``Project Trigger Lock with Steroids.'' It was a \nbetter plan than I had developed. He believed if you utilize these laws \naggressively, you could save lives. He saw people in his community \ndying in shootouts and criminal fights, he believed, unnecessarily. So \nhe started this project.\n\n  He put up billboards that said: You use a gun, we will send you off \nfor a long period of time. You will be exiled. You will go off to a \nFederal jail. You don't get to go to the county jail. You will go off \nto the Federal jail, 10 years without parole, 20 years without parole, \ndepending on the offense. He had some dramatic results from that \nproject.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased, I say to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Project Exile in Richmond, which the Senator referenced, \nin Richmond was a fascinating demonstration, as I think the Senator is \npointing out. In the testimony of a person arrested for holding up a 7-\nEleven--he went in with a baseball bat; this is true evidence--when he \nwas being questioned as to why he used a bat instead of a gun in the \ncommission of a crime, he said, Because if I use a gun in the \ncommission of a crime, I do time in a Federal jail, just as the Senator \nhas spoken to. So he chose the baseball bat as his weapon and not the \nfirearm. That happened in Richmond under Project Exile.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more. The U.S. attorney in \nPhiladelphia was aggressive on some of these cases, and they would make \na big bust with State and local law enforcement and Federal officers. \nThe criminals did not want to go to the Federal court. They were afraid \nthey would go there and sort them out, and the ones who had the guns \nwould be the ones sent to Federal court, and they would get tough time.\n  Here are some of the numbers that occurred on Project Exile. From \n2000 to 2003, Federal gun crime prosecutions nationally increased 68 \npercent. There is this perception that Republican administrations, \nbecause they are dubious and concerned about encroaching controls on \nthe right of lawful Americans to have guns, that they are somehow soft \non gun crime, that they do not care about people being victimized by \ncrime.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth, as these numbers will show. \nFrom 2000 to 2003, Federal gun prosecutions increased 68 percent. \nBetween the year 2002 and fiscal year 2003, the number of Federal \nfirearms prosecutions nationally increased nearly 24 percent. In \nColorado, for example, under their Project Exile program, Federal \nfirearm charges between 1999 and 2003 were brought against more than \n600 defendants, and in 365 of those cases that were completed, prison \nsentences were handed down totaling 18,671 months or 1,600 years.\n  As these prosecutions have increased, the number of crimes where a \ngun is used has decreased. Surprise. Between 1999 and 2000 and between \n2001 and 2002, the violent crime victimization rate plunged 21 percent. \nApproximately 130,000 fewer Americans were victims of gun crime in 2001 \nand 2002 than in 1999 and 2000.\n  Project Exile began as a coordinated approach to fighting gun \nviolence in the Richmond metropolitan area. That is where it started. \nIt began in 1997 by a group of Federal prosecutors. They did a \ncommunitywide effort. In 1997, there were 140 homicides in Richmond. \nJust one year after the project was initiated, the overall murder rate \ndropped 36 percent, the number of firearm homicides dropped 41 percent, \nand robberies dropped by one-third.\n  In 2000, 3 years after Project Exile was implemented in Richmond, \nthere were only 72 homicides during the year 2000, close to a 50-\npercent reduction. In its first year, Project Exile achieved the \nfollowing: 372 persons were indicted for Federal gun violations, 440 \nguns were seized, and 196 persons sentenced to an average of 55 months \nof imprisonment.\n  There are three essential elements: Federal prosecution; integrated \nand coordinated partnership among local, State, and Federal law \nagencies; outreach for community involvement; and increased public \nawareness where we make sure the people in the community know in \nadvance that if they carry a gun around while they are carrying on \ntheir criminal activities, they are in big trouble.\n  One of the main reasons that Project Exile has been so successful is \nthe campaign to educate citizens about the lengthy terms they would be \nfacing. Billboards all over Richmond broadcast it: An illegal gun gets \nyou 5 years in Federal prison. It resonated throughout the community. \nPolice and criminals knew the stories of what was happening on the \nstreets. The criminals would throw away guns when officers\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\napproached. They would confess to almost anything, but they would not \nconfess to having a gun, and they specifically referred to Project \nExile. So we know it was having an impact.\n  There are a number of important laws that are bread-and-butter laws \nthat allow proper focus on criminal use of firearms. What I want to say \nis real simple. I don't want to overstate all of this, but it is \nsignificant. The simple fact is, it is not how many laws we pass, it is \nnot whether we pass some convoluted law about this, that, or the other \nin Federal laws. It is whether we are allowing the gun prosecutions to \ndrop 20 percent or whether they have gone up from under 4,000 to almost \n12,000, three times.\n  If we maintain aggressive, systematic prosecution of dangerous \ncriminals who carry firearms and they are sent to jail for long periods \nof time, we will protect the public. That is what I am saying. These \nother things make life more difficult for lawful gun owners and \nimplicate, sometimes improperly, the constitutional right to keep and \nbear arms. But the real power of reducing crime, making our streets \nsafer, resides in effective prosecution of these cases.\n  I could not be more pleased to see some of the good numbers we are \ngetting in terms of reducing crime.\n  Look what is happening in States. It further amplifies what I have \nsaid. The overall homicide rate in jurisdictions that have the most \nsevere restrictions on firearms purchases and ownership--let's look at \nthis. Let's look at the homicide rate on the States that have the \ntoughest firearm purchase laws, States that make it the hardest to buy \na firearm: California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and \nWashington, DC. Their homicide rate is 23 percent higher than the rest \nof the country.\n\n  The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968 imposed unprecedented \nrestrictions on gun manufacturers, dealers, and owners. However, in the \n5 years after its enactment, the national homicide rate averaged 50 \npercent higher than in the 5 years before the bill was enacted. The \nnational homicide rate was 75 percent higher 10 years after the \nenactment of the Federal Gun Control Act, and 81 percent higher after \n15 years. So passing a law that is not effectively prosecuted--not \naggressively, systematically prosecuted, to the extent the criminals \nknow you mean business--does not mean anything. You end up with just \nrestrictions, regulations, costs, and burdens on honest Americans.\n  I have offered legislation--I am having a hard time getting any \ncosponsors on the Democratic side, but I think the Federal crack \ncocaine laws tend to be too tough, and they tend to fall \ndisproportionately on African Americans. I think we ought to fix it and \ndo something about it. I have proposed and written legislation and \noffered it more than once to do just that.\n  I am not here as one who believes locking people up and throwing away \nthe key is the answer to fighting crime, but it is a big part of \nfighting crime that people receive substantial punishment if they \nrepresent a danger to the community or if they commit a serious crime.\n  Look at the incarceration rates: From 1980 to 1994, the 10 States \nwith the greatest increase in prison population averaged a decrease of \n13 percent in violent crime, while the 10 States with the smallest \nincrease in prison population averaged a 55-percent increase in violent \ncrime.\n  They say lock everybody up. Everybody does not shoot someone. There \nis only a small number of people in this country who have the \nmaliciousness, the violent nature, or the hostility or meanness to go \naround shooting somebody. The more of those you can identify, the more \nof those you lock up, you can reduce the violent crime rate. You can \nmake our communities safer and protect innocent Americans from that \nkind of activity. It is just as plain as night and day.\n  If you put violent criminals behind bars and keep them there, good \nthings can happen. In 1991, 162,000 criminals who were placed on \nprobation committed 44,000 violent crimes during their probation. A \nfourth of them committed a violent crime while they were out on \nprobation. Twenty-one percent of the persons involved in the felonious \nkilling of law enforcement officers during the last decade were on \nprobation or parole at the time they murdered a police officer.\n  Some say if you really like police officers, you will vote against \nthis bill because somehow this bill has something to do with protecting \npolice officers from being murdered. Police officers are not telling me \nif one of their brothers or sisters is killed by a criminal that they \nwant to sue Smith & Wesson. They are saying they want the criminal \nconvicted and prosecuted. They believe if more criminals were \nprosecuted aggressively and fewer were given parole and probation \nearly, then more police officers would be alive and healthy today. This \nis what we need to do.\n  I want to share this story on this general subject. It came to my \nattention recently, in June of this year. Leura Canary, a fine U.S. \nattorney in Montgomery, AL, the Middle District of Alabama, presides \nover 23 counties in the southwestern part of the State as a Federal law \nofficer, and she works with others. She was presented a national award \nfor most improved gun violence program.\n  I saved this release and would like to share it with you because it \nis emblematic of what we can do to save lives, protect the innocent, \nand reduce crime in America.\n  She calls their program Alabama ICE. It emphasizes cooperation among \nFederal, State, and local law agencies. They developed in the region an \neffective task force, a task force to combat gun crimes. The task force \ndeveloped a training program and a case preparation technique plan. It \nproduced significant results. Look at this. Federal gun prosecutions in \nthe middle district of Alabama tripled in fiscal year 2003 over fiscal \nyear 2002. Three times as many were prosecuted. And the number of gun \ncrime matters referred for prosecutions increased 257 percent in that \nsame period. Between 2000 and 2003, the number of gun prosecutions in \nthe middle district has increased 513 percent.\n  She obviously took Attorney General Ashcroft's injunctions and \ndirections to heart, a fact mentioned by Attorney General Ashcroft in \nhis keynote address.\n  According to local officials, these efforts--local officials, not the \nU.S. attorney--have had a measurable effect on violent crime. In \ncalendar year 2003, there was a 42-percent reduction in criminal \nhomicides in the city of Montgomery over the previous year, 2002, a 42-\npercent reduction in the number of people murdered in the city of \nMontgomery.\n  Montgomery Police Chief John Wilson, whom I have known for quite a \nnumber of years, and who has been a professional in his career, who was \nan early partner in this effort, Alabama ICE task force, said:\n\n       Alabama ICE is the only new program we implemented during \n     this time period which targets violent crime in our city. I \n     believe that ICE is a major factor in these reductions in the \n     number of violent offenses. Without this program, these \n     criminals would still be in our community committing crimes.\n\n  And, I would add, murdering people.\n  Local Alabama ICE task force members also expressed their reactions \nto the program and the award. Chief Anthony Everage of the city of \nTroy, a midsized or smaller city, said this:\n\n       I think this is an excellent example of what can be \n     accomplished through a joint effort by the United States \n     Attorney's Office of the Middle District and law enforcement. \n     Ms. Canary presented this very effective program along with a \n     plan of action to our agency and the implementation has and \n     will continue to make Troy a safer place.\n\n  ``When Alabama ICE was implemented in Dothan, it was as though \nsomeone threw a large rock into still waters. The ripple effect \nshuddered through the criminal culture almost overnight. The word is \nout, get caught committing a crime while holding a gun and you're done. \nEven Johnny Cochran can't get you off,'' said Dothan Police Chief John \nWhite.\n  Actually, Johnny Cochran supported this effort and warned that people \nwho commit crimes with guns suffer serious Federal time, because he \nknew innocent people's lives are at stake.\n  District Attorney Randall Houston of the 19th Judicial Circuit of \nAutauga, Elmore, and Chilton Counties, stated:\n\n       Working with Federal prosecutors has expanded our charging \n     options and our ability to lock up the most dangerous \n     criminals in our community. We received this award because of \n     the effectiveness of our partnership in combating crime.\n\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\n\n  Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County said:\n\n       This award represents the positive result of criminal \n     justice agencies on Federal, State, and local levels working \n     in concert to confront and effectively reduce the incidents \n     of gun violence in our community.\n\n  Is that not what it is all about, reducing gun violence?\n\n       Actual, measurable reductions in violent gun crimes have \n     occurred in all of the fine programs implemented throughout \n     the United States, and of those the program in the Middle \n     District, administered under the direction of U.S. Attorney \n     Leura Canary, was chosen as one of the best. It puts an \n     exclamation point on the statement of hard work that so many \n     law enforcement agencies in central Alabama do each day to \n     provide for the safety of the public.\n\n  Sheriff Jimmy Abbett of Tallapoosa County said:\n\n       Alabama ICE has been very beneficial to our department in \n     the successful arrest and convictions of persons in our area. \n     The U.S. attorney has provided a willingness to work with \n     local agencies. . . . The program . . . has provided local \n     law enforcement agencies another tool to take the habitual \n     criminals off the street.\n\n  That is what it is all about. Violent crime rates have reached the \nlowest level in 30 years, almost to the level of 1950. The crime rate \nwent up steadily beginning in the 1950s into the early 1960s to the \nmid-1970s. In 15 years the murder rate doubled in this country. \nPresident Reagan came in and we saw about a 20-percent reduction. Then \nthat flattened out during the crack cocaine years and then in the 1990s \nwe began to see this go down.\n  One of the reasons is the Project Exile program that began in 1997 \nand is now spreading all over the country, which focuses on the \ncriminal use of firearms. Whereas I am proud to review any legislation \nanybody wants to offer, I would note this, that I am willing to bet--I \ndo not have the numbers on it, but I am willing to bet that perhaps 90 \npercent of the cases prosecuted in Federal court under these Project \nExile type programs, the main ones are prosecuting any criminal in \nAmerica who carries a firearm or possesses a firearm after having been \nconvicted of a felony. If one is a felon, they are no longer able to \npossess a firearm. If firearms are kept out of the hands of felons, we \nare going to have less murders.\n  The next one is very close and very significant. It is carrying a \nfirearm during the commission of a crime. It can be a crime of \nviolence, a drug crime, a burglary, or a robbery. If someone is \ncarrying a gun during criminal activity, they have a mandatory 5 years, \n60 months, without parole, if they are convicted, in addition to what \ntime they get for the underlying crime. That information is getting out \nthere. The word is out there. Fewer and fewer criminals are carrying \nguns because of that.\n  Then there is carrying a sawed-off shotgun, possessing a firearm \nwhere the serial number has been erased or erasing a serial number. \nThose are the kinds of activities that form the bread and butter of the \ncriminal prosecutions I mentioned today. That is what will break the \nback of crime. That is what can hold out hope that if we effectively \nand professionally maintain the pressure on the criminal gun element \nthrough these prosecutions, we can reduce crime, make our communities \nsafer, and save innocent lives.\n\n  I do not think suing gun manufacturers is the right approach. That is \nnot the way we are going to deal with it. We have the right approach. \nIt was proven by the U.S. attorney in Richmond. It is being replicated \nall over America today. The Attorney General is driving this as one of \nhis highest priorities, and if we stay on it, we are going to continue \nto see the murder rate in this country go down. Who knows, the murder \nrate could actually reach the level of the 1950s. We are not far from \nthat today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will take a moment to talk about the bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I hope the Senator is not too disturbed with me. I \nnoticed in the New York Times today they had my picture in there and \nthey described it as that of Senator Reed. It probably will cost him \n50,000 votes in his home State. But it was not my fault and if the \nSenator sues anybody, sue the New York Times.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, I say to my distinguished friend and \ndear friend from Alabama, I am not perturbed. I just fear for his \nsafety, and I thank him.\n  Mr. President, we have heard over the course of the last few days \nnumerous homilies about personal responsibility. The irony, of course, \nis this legislation says everyone is responsible except for gun \nmanufacturers, gun dealers, and gun trade associations.\n  There has been a discussion about the law. If one breaks a law they \nshould be punished, but such discussions fail to capture the fact that \nwe have essentially two systems with our legal system. There is the \nsystem of laws, the statutes, the ordinances that are passed by \nlegislative bodies such as this body, and then there is the civil law: \nthe criminal law and the civil law.\n  The Senator from Alabama went on at length about how we can enforce \ncriminal laws more effectively; we can do good things with respect to \ncriminal law enforcement. But I think we are ignoring the sense that \nthere is also this civil law, where people can go to court if they have \nbeen injured and seek redress.\n  What this legislation would do is prevent many Americans who have \nbeen injured from going to court and seeking redress, either some type \nof compensation or some type of equitable remedy.\n  It is important that we recognize this bill will deny a voice to many \npeople, modest people, who have been injured and who seek redress.\n  I was trying to think of a somewhat mundane example about these \ndifferent systems. Since so much of this legislation talks about, well, \nif a particular statute is violated, one will be liable, but there is \nthis intersection of obligations both under the criminal law and \nstatutes and under the general principles of civil law.\n  The example I think of is there are some jurisdictions that make it a \nviolation of the law to operate a cell phone in one's hand while they \ndrive, and if one had an accident in that circumstance and someone is \ninjured, the person could be prosecuted for violating the law, but they \nalso could be sued because they have an obligation and duty to pay full \nattention as they drive. In other jurisdictions without this law, one \ncould not be criminally charged but, of course, they could be sued.\n  Here is what essentially this legislation does in lots of respects. \nIt says we are disregarding those instances where one has a duty to \nsomeone under the civil law. We will let them proceed with their suit \nif there is a criminal violation or a statutory violation, a violation \nof regulations, but for the vast number of other responsibilities we \nowe to each other, that are defined for the civil law, one will not \nhave the opportunity to go to court.\n  Essentially, what we have said is we all have these obligations and \nresponsibilities, except this now special, privileged class of gun \nmanufacturers, gun dealers, and gun associations.\n  There is the presumption that has been persistent throughout that the \nlaw of the United States in general does not recognize any type of \nobligation if there is a criminal intervention, if a criminal gets \ninvolved in proximity to the injury. As I mentioned before, the black \nletter law of this country that is established in the restatement of \ntorts clearly says if there is a criminal intervention, one can still \nbe held liable for negligence if they fail to perform their duty, even \nif in the chain of action of causation there is a criminal act. So this \nnotion that we are charging these gun dealers and gun manufacturers \nwith the crimes of another, a bad person or criminal, is without \nsubstance.\n  What Senator Levin said so eloquently and others said so eloquently \ntalking about his amendment, is this is about the responsibility of the \nmanufacturer, the gun dealer, and the gun associations to fulfill their \nduties to the general public and to specific individuals who have been \nharmed: the duty to secure weapons, the duty to act reasonably, the \nduty to look beyond the superficial aspects of someone coming into a \nstore.\n  We have seen classic examples: The fellow who walks in with the \ngirlfriend and picks out 12 weapons, gives her\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\ncash, she pays for it. It is so suspicious that the operator of the gun \nstore calls ATF and says, well, I got the money, they got the guns, but \nwatch out for them. That was the circumstance that led to a chain of \ncausation to the serious wounding of two New Jersey police officers. \nThat gun dealer had an obligation to avoid straw purchases. He did not \neven follow the standards of the industry in terms of being careful of \nselling multiple guns to some person under those circumstances.\n  So it is not about the crimes of others being attributed to gun \ndealers and gun manufacturers. It is not about social conditions that \nare being excused by these suits. It is about whether an individual had \na duty to another person who was injured and failed to carry out that \nduty.\n  One of the major reasons we are here, taking very radical action to \nchange 200 years of legal history in the United States, taking the \nradical action of going into 50 States and saying, We don't care about \nyour laws--the General Assembly of Rhode Island, the General Assembly \nof North Carolina, of Alabama--we don't care about your laws, we don't \ncare that for 200 years, you specified the standards for negligence in \nyour State, we are changing them for these special people. We don't \ncare that your courts should have the right to take the claims of your \ncitizens who have been harmed. We don't care about that. And we are \ndoing it for a very narrow, defined group of individuals. This is a \nradical departure from the standards we have adopted and abided by for \n200 years.\n  The pretext for all of this is that there is this huge crisis with \nrespect to manufacturers that threatens their existence, that they are \nfinancially on the ropes, that these suits are numerous and literally \ndriving them to bankruptcy.\n  Where are the facts? The facts that we can establish from the public \nfilings of certain companies suggest that there is no crisis. There is \nno crisis at all. This is a manufactured crisis. This is a pretext to \ndo the bidding, I believe, of the gun lobby. If you look at the facts \nas reported, there is no financial crisis that is apparent.\n  Yesterday, my colleague, the Senator from Idaho, read a letter from \nthe president and chief executive officer of Smith & Wesson that talked \nabout or tried to explain their filings with the Securities and \nExchange Commission, their 10-Q filing, and concluded with a stirring \npassage about the necessity, the criticality of this legislation to \nSmith & Wesson. It gave the suggestion, of course, that my discussion \nof their financial reports was somehow inaccurate or incomplete. So I \nwent back and I got their 10-Q report, which was filed on March 10, \n2005, for the period January 31 to March 10. It was filed, let me say, \nMarch 10, 2005.\n  They go on to describe these suits, as generally is done. They \nconclude:\n\n       We monitor the status of known claims and the product \n     liability accrual, which includes amounts for defense costs \n     for asserted and unasserted claims. While it is difficult to \n     forecast the outcome of these claims, we believe, after \n     consultation with litigation counsel, it is uncertain whether \n     the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse \n     effect on our financial position, results of operations, or \n     cash flows.\n\n  They are not quite certain whether those cases will cripple them. \nThey go on to say:\n\n       We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for \n     defense costs.\n\n  They go on and say further:\n\n       We do not anticipate material adverse judgments and intend \n     to vigorously defend ourselves.\n\n  In a sworn statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission, they \nsay: We don't know if this is going to be critical to our financial \nstatus. In fact, we don't anticipate material adverse judgments. We \ndon't think any of these cases will be resolved in a way that will \nnegatively affect our position, and we will vigorously defend \nourselves.\n  They went on to say, and we said this before on the Senate floor:\n\n       In the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred \n     $4,535 in defense costs, net of amounts receivable from \n     insurance carriers, relative to product liability and \n     municipal litigation.\n\n  That is $4,500, basically, out-of-pocket costs they have received \nfrom reimbursements from insurance companies. That is the nature of \ninsurance: You pay the premium; if something happens, you get \nreimbursed.\n\n       During this period, we paid no settlement fees relative to \n     product liability cases. As a result of our regular review of \n     our product liability claims----\n\nlooking at these claims we talked about here as strangling their \nability to be competitive and to survive----\n\n     we were able to reduce our reserves by $286,022 for the nine \n     months ended January 31, 2005.\n\n  This is such a perilous threat to a company like Smith & Wesson that \nthey are actually reducing the reserves they have on hand to handle \nthese claims.\n  Again, this is not a crisis. Again, their own data suggest--this from \ntheir Web site. This is 2001. These are the industry municipal cases \npending or on appeal: 32 and 10 in 2001; in 2002, 26 and 8; 2003, 20 \nand 5; 2004, 13 and 4; 2005, 4 industry municipal cases pending and 2 \nproduct liability cases pending against Smith & Wesson.\n  The curve is going the wrong way for a crisis. It is going down: \nfour, and two pending cases. It suggests that the courts are doing \ntheir job, that the present system we have in place is actually \nhandling these cases pretty well. There is no flood of cases coming \nover the transom. In fact, this is exactly consistent with their \nreduction of the reserves for liability because it appears that these \ncases are dwindling, not increasing. It appears that the system is \nworking pretty well right now. Yet we are here today debating \nlegislation that will deny the rights of individual citizens to go to \ncourt, rights they have enjoyed for 200 years in this country, rights \nthat stem not from the actions of criminal third parties but from the \nfailure of the individual defendants to take appropriate action in \ntheir duty with respect to the general public and specific individuals.\n  It is the same with respect to other companies for which we have \npublic records. Many of these companies are privately held. Beretta USA \nis domiciled in the United States, but it is a subsidiary of an Italian \ncorporation which is privately held, and they are not publicly \nreporting. But all of this suggests again--not only with Smith & Wesson \nbut with Sturm, Ruger--that there is no material adverse impact \nreflected by these individuals in their reporting under the pain of \npenalty for perjury under the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n  Also, there is a general record of claims and legal cases which goes \nto suggest that these suits are not an epidemic. As we have indicated \nbefore, from 1993 to 2003, 57 suits were filed against gun industry \ndefendants out of an estimated 10 million tort suits. I am not good at \nmath, but that is way below 1 percent. This is not an epidemic. This is \nnot a crisis. Certainly this is not a crisis that is going to threaten \nour national security.\n  We have heard claims that the gun industry is being forced to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars. The alleged litigation costs have \nrisen in $25 million increments. In fact, I think they have risen since \nwe started this debate, from what I have heard, without any kind of \nfactual data to support them. They are just claims that they are \nspending all of this money. In fact, if you look at these SEC reports, \nit hardly adds up to $200 million. Indeed, it seems, based on Smith & \nWesson, that reflecting the declining cases they are actually reducing \ntheir reserves and potentially, hopefully, reducing what they have to \npay out of pocket. But these estimates grow and grow and grow. In 2004, \nit was $150 million in July. In November 2004, other estimates, $175 \nmillion. Now it is up to $200 million. I think I heard in this debate \n$250 million. No substantiation, no documents, no data.\n  This is not a crisis. Yet we have displaced the Defense bill to take \nup this legislation. We have displaced other legislation that could be \nextremely valuable in order to take up this legislation. Because there \nis no crisis----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his \nleadership on this issue. The Senator from Rhode Island is a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I think it raises some questions and \nbears repeating that we left the Department of Defense authorization \nbill, which was on the floor of the Senate, the bill for our Department \nof Defense that covers our\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\nsoldiers and their families, buys the necessary equipment so they can \nexecute the war successfully and come home, with amendments pending \nrelative to payments to widows and orphans for soldiers who died in the \nline of duty, with amendments pending to provide additional assistance \nto totally disabled veterans, with an amendment pending that would have \nprovided additional compensation to members of the Guard and Reserve \nwho happen to work for the Federal Government and are activated.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island, can the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island tell me, before we moved to this special interest \nlegislation to protect the gun industry manufacturers and dealers from \npersonal responsibility for their wrongdoing, would the Senator from \nRhode Island describe for those following the debate what was on the \nfloor of the Senate when the Republican leadership decided to move to \nthis bill?\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his question. There \nwere a series of extraordinarily important questions with respect to \nthe quality of life for our soldiers and their families: childcare \namendments, amendments with respect to veterans health care, amendments \nthat applied not only to active-duty personnel but their dependents. We \nhad passed legislation already, an amendment that would increase the \nnumber of up-armored HMMWVs we are providing to our soldiers. That \nstands in abeyance until we finish the legislation.\n  There were important inducements for additional service and \nenlistment that are necessary to meet the growing and real crisis in \nrecruiting military personnel. If you want to talk about a crisis, it \nis a crisis, the fact that our Army, despite efforts, has fallen short \nof the recruiting goal at a time when we need every person to fill out \nthe demand for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. \nIt is extraordinarily serious.\n  I don't know if I can find it, but I saw an editorial cartoon in a \nmagazine, a newspaper, which had a picture of a humvee and three \nsoldiers. The caption, if I recall it, is:\n\n       Why don't we just take a 4-week recess during this \n     difficult time and then return to this operation afterwards?\n\n  Essentially, I think it captured the dilemma the soldiers are feeling \nright now. What are we doing?\n  As the Senator previously indicated, in the Army Times, they wrote of \nthis:\n\n       Senate delays action on the defense bill.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record, \none from the Hill and the other from the Army Times, which talk about \nthis issue of leaving the Defense bill and also the impact on \nprocurement of weapons because of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, July 28, 2005]\n\n                  Frist: Lawsuits Threaten Gun Supply\n\n                           (By Roxana Tiron)\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) interrupted \n     debate on the 2006 defense authorization bill to consider \n     legislation to block lawsuits against gun manufacturers, \n     saying that ``frivolous'' litigation could leave the Defense \n     Department without a U.S. source for sidearms.\n       Despite Frist's alarming claims, the military is not \n     currently facing any shortage of small arms, according to \n     Pentagon officials.\n       American gun manufacturers supply the military with \n     hundreds of millions of dollars worth of small arms, which \n     includes a broad variety of firearms from pistols to machine \n     guns. The weapons are worth even more when ammunition, \n     modifications and special features such as optical sights are \n     included.\n       The U.S. firearms industry has been facing repeated \n     lawsuits, an attempt to hold manufacturers liable when guns \n     that were sold lawfully are subsequently misused by \n     criminals, explained Lawrence Keane, senior vice president \n     and general counsel for the National Shooting and Sports \n     Association, a nonprofit organization representing the \n     firearms industry.\n       The Senate is considering a new version of a gun-liability \n     measure that was effectively killed by its own supporters \n     last year. Sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), the \n     measure would prohibit civil-liability actions against \n     manufacturers, dealers and importers of firearms and \n     ammunition in any state or federal court.\n       In April, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled \n     that any victim of a shooting in the District could sue the \n     industry, which Keane said would make gun manufacturers \n     ``absolutely and automatically'' liable for a criminal \n     shooting in D.C. Beretta USA, the manufacturer of the M9 \n     pistol, the standard firearm for the armed forces, expressed \n     concern that a single jury ruling in the District could \n     bankrupt the company.\n       ``Every criminal shooting in the district gives rise to a \n     suit against the industry, and these are the types that need \n     to be stopped,'' Keane said.\n       ``Without this legislation it is probable the American \n     manufacturers of legal firearms will be faced with a real \n     prospect of going out of business, ending a critical source \n     of supply for our armed forces, our police and our \n     citizens,'' Frist said.\n       Frist's decision to take up the gun-liability measure comes \n     amid an Army review of more than a half-dozen requests for \n     proposals for new small arms. In fact, the Army has extended \n     the request for six months to allow more companies to compete \n     and included the Marine Corps's requests, according to an \n     Army spokesperson.\n       While the Defense Department refused to comment on \n     ``speculative legislation,'' an Army spokesperson said the \n     Army currently is not experiencing any problems with the \n     supply of its sidearms. The Army is the purchasing agent for \n     most services' sidearms; some exceptions exist for special-\n     operations forces.\n       Army leaders are revamping their small-arms inventories to \n     be better suited to the kind of guerrilla wars being fought \n     in Iraq. The spokesperson said the Army has not had problems \n     buying these weapons, although the spokesperson acknowledged \n     that because the Defense Department is the largest gun \n     purchaser, it could serve as a ``relevant hypothesis'' for \n     Frist's arguments.\n       ``These frivolous suits threaten a domestic industry that \n     is critical to our national defense, jeopardize hundreds of \n     thousands of jobs,'' Frist said. ``Many support this \n     legislation, and I am hopeful that with the cooperation of \n     members we can complete all action on this legislation before \n     the recess.''\n       Frist used the gun-liability legislation in part as a \n     strategy to divert attention from amendments related to \n     treatment of detainees and the Pentagon's base closures and \n     realignments. The Bush administration opposes those \n     amendments.\n       Keane argued that the liability bill still allows \n     manufacturers to be sued if they violate any laws governing \n     gun sales.\n       ``There is nothing in the legislation that prevents the \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau from enforcing the gun-\n     control act because a dealer has violated regulations,'' he \n     said.\n       According to Keane, the gun industry has spent at least \n     $225 million on lawsuits in the past 10 years and small \n     companies such as Charco 2000 have filed for bankruptcy \n     because of lawsuit expenses. Both Beretta and Sigarms, the \n     two top suppliers to the military have been sued numerous \n     times.\n       ``If . . . [a company] like Beretta, which has been sued, \n     is driven out of business, it will not be able to fulfill \n     [its] contractual obligation,'' to the military, Keane said.\n       He argued that these issues should pose immediate concern \n     to the Defense Department. The firearms (buying) system \n     hasn't ``collapsed,'' said the spokesperson.\n       Beretta recently received a contract to supply 18,744 M9 \n     semiautomatic pistols to the U.S. Air Force with an option to \n     purchase an additional 5,190 pistols.\n       The pistol is produced at the Beretta USA headquarters in \n     Accokeek, MD., where it has been made for 20 years. The Air \n     Force plans to buy 34,374 M9s between 2004 and 2007 at a \n     price of $39 million, according to Air Force budget \n     projections. Meanwhile, the Army is planning to buy $8 \n     million worth of modifications to the M9 and M11, which is \n     produced by Sigarms, between 2006 and 2007.\n       The Navy is planning to buy 1,069 M11s through 2011 at a \n     total cost of $722,000 and to spend $5.6 million on \n     modifications to the M9 pistols, which are supposed to be \n     completed this year.\n       According to Hoovers, a business-information service, \n     Beretta's revenue is estimated at $72.7 million annually.\n       Another major gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, which \n     provides firearms to law-enforcement officers, told the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission that it is expecting its \n     sales to reach $124 million this year, 5 percent higher than \n     last year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Army Times, July 26, 2005]\n\n                  Senate Delays Action on Defense Bill\n\n                             (By Rick Maze)\n\n       Senate Republican leaders decided Tuesday that a gun \n     manufacturers' liability bill is more important than next \n     year's $441.6 billion defense authorization bill.\n       With Democrats expressing amazement that there could be any \n     higher legislative priority in a time of war than the annual \n     defense bill that includes money for pay and benefits, \n     operations and maintenance, and weapons purchases and \n     research, Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate Republican \n     leader, decided Tuesday that a bill protecting gun \n     manufacturers from lawsuits over the illegal use of firearms \n     was a higher priority.\n       The decision came after Republican leaders failed to muster \n     the 60 votes needed to prevent amendments not strictly \n     related to the defense budget from being offered to the \n     defense bill.\n       In a count of 50-48, seven Republicans joined Democrats in \n     voting not to restrict debate, a move that Democratic leaders \n     said would have prevented consideration of amendments to help \n     veterans and survivors\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\n     of deceased service members, along with other issues.\n       With Congress planning to leave town Friday for one-month \n     break, debate on S. 397, Protection of Lawful Commerce in \n     Arms Act, is expected to last two or three days, and then \n     Senate leaders plan to take up an energy bill, an estate tax \n     reform bill and an Interior Department funding bill that has \n     a $1.5 billion bailout attached for veterans' health care \n     programs, leaving no time until September to get back to the \n     defense bill.\n       The House approved its version of the defense bill in May \n     and has been waiting for the Senate to catch up to begin \n     negotiations with the Bush administration on a final version.\n       Delay in the Senate is partly a result of senators spending \n     three weeks this spring debating federal judicial nominations \n     before reaching a compromise on President Bush's nominees.\n       It all points toward a difficult autumn. When the Senate \n     returns in September from its month long summer recess, it \n     will need to consider recommendations of the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Commission, due to finish its work by \n     Sept. 8, and begin deliberations on the John Roberts to the \n     Supreme Court vacancy left by retiring Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask a question through the Chair. The Senator from \nRhode Island, who has been speaking about the lack of emergency, the \nlack of crisis in the gun industry, and the fact that this is certainly \nnot emergency legislation--I don't believe it is even wise legislation \nfor us to consider--the Senator from Rhode Island is a graduate of West \nPoint and a former officer in the U.S. Army. I would like to ask the \nSenator, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, as he has read \nthese Army Times articles which raise questions about why the U.S. \nSenate would give up on the Department of Defense authorization bill \nfor our troops, leave it behind and move to this bill, the special \ninterest bill to protect the gun industry from their liability for \ntheir own wrongdoing, I would like to ask the Senator, what kind of \nimpact can this have on the morale of the men and women who read about \nthe Senate leaving this important legislation?\n  Mr. REED. I think at a minimum it puzzles them why we would shift \nfrom their concerns, which are so central to our national security and \nso central to the families of America, to move to a bill that is so \nnarrowly focused on a special interest group and does not help them one \nbit in terms of anything we might do on this bill.\n  Perhaps it is summed up. I have located the cartoon. It is as I \ndescribed before--a group of soldiers in a humvee, and the caption is:\n\n       I move we adjourn for 5 weeks and take up this contentious \n     issue after the summer recess.\n\n  Frankly, no one in our military has the option of adjourning for 5 \nweeks to take up contentious issues after that time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Rhode Island will further yield for a \nquestion to the Chair, I wish to make sure those following the debate \nunderstand what this bill does. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwho has followed this issue more closely than any other Senator on our \nside of the aisle, is my understanding correct that if this is enacted \ninto law, as a result of this legislation, if you are a gun dealer and \nyou sell a gun to someone you knew or should have known was in a drug \ngang, a criminal, a drug trafficker, someone who is likely to misuse \nthat gun, use it for criminal purposes, that this bill says that the \nvictims of the violence from that purchaser cannot hold the gun dealer \nresponsible for his negligence in selling this gun to someone they knew \nor should have known was going to misuse it and create victims, tragic \nvictims, in their community?\n  Mr. REED. The legislation generally bars all suits involving \nnegligence and restricts the exemption to some categories of specific \nviolations of Federal law which arguably, in your hypothetical, it \nwould not reach. The only exception, to be fair to the legislation, \nthat might allow someone to go to court under the concept of negligent \nentrustment, which as drafted in the legislation would say you have to \nsuspect, know that the person would use the weapon illegally, and that \nperson has to use the weapon. But most commonly what happens is there \nis a straw purchaser, so the negligent entrustment argument doesn't \nwork because that weapon is not being used by that person; it is given \nto a third party.\n  But I think the Senator's comment is exactly right. There are so many \ncases where this legislation has been carefully crafted to prevent \npeople going to court, and the best examples are the ones of which we \nare already aware. The sniper case in Washington, DC, where a young \nteenager walked into a shop, shoplifted apparently a 3-foot assault \nweapon which was used to murder too many people here in the District of \nColumbia. That suit would be prevented by this legislation; in \naddition, the case of the straw purchaser and the police officer in New \nJersey, prevented by this legislation. We have a case pending now where \nan individual, a young man, was killed by a weapon that was taken out \nof a factory, and the gun manufacturer would be exempt, immune from \nliability, even though he had no background checks on his workers who \nwere criminals and drug addicts, he had no security devices and, in \nfact, missed any rudimentary standard of care that most reasonable \npeople would say is associated with running a gun factory.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from Rhode Island another \nquestion, through the Chair. If someone owned a daycare facility and \nhired, without any background check and without adequate investigation, \nan employee with a long criminal record of being a sexual predator, \nsomeone hired this person to work in a daycare center and that employee \nthen harmed one of the children at the daycare center, I think the \nSenator from Rhode Island and I would agree that many would argue that \ndaycare center was negligent, it had a responsibility it did not meet, \nand that this daycare center should be held responsible, even in court, \nfor the harm that came to the child.\n  The example that the Senator from Rhode Island used was a gun \nmanufacturer, who hired employees with long criminal records, including \nfelonies, that had guns stolen out of the manufacturing plant by some \nof these employees with criminal records, and the guns were then used \non the street to harm innocent people.\n  In the second example we have used--not the daycare center but the \ngun manufacturer--this bill would say you can sue the daycare center \nbecause they didn't do a background check on the employee who molested \nthe children, but you can't hold the gun manufacturer liable for hiring \nemployees with a criminal record, putting guns on the street and \nkilling innocent children.\n  Mr. REED. That is exactly right, in my reading of the legislation. \nThere are certain jurisdictions that have specific laws with respect to \nbackground checks on daycare centers. The gun industry is virtually \nunregulated, which is a very important point here. There is very little \nregulation deliberately on the manufactured weapons, the standards. As \nyou point out so often with respect to product safety, toy guns are \nregulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, real guns are \nunregulated in terms of their safety. So there is no legal--very little \nlegal statutory requirement. So it depends upon claims of negligence to \nget at this harm and to redress the harm caused, and this bill \nessentially wipes out that civil liability under our court system.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island because I think it is \na critical point, how many other businesses in America enjoy this \nexemption from liability, how many other businesses, producers of goods \nor services are held harmless for their own negligence and wrongdoing \nin courts of law across America? How many other businesses would have \nthis special interest legislation that is being considered and may be \npassed by this Chamber?\n  Mr. REED. Virtually no other. Comments were made on the floor with \nrespect to legislation passed back in 1994 with respect to general \naviation. I think it is important at this juncture to clarify that. \nThere was very limited legislation that applied to general aviation \naircraft, 18 years or older, in terms of liability because of the \nconcern about the manufacturing base. But there is a distinct \ndifference between this legislation and the General Aviation \nRevitalization Act of 1994, and it goes to the point we just discussed. \nThere is no more highly regulated industry than the aviation industry. \nEvery time an engine is worked\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\non, there has to be a log entry made which is subject to the \njurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration. It is the most \ndetailed legislative scheme we have in place perhaps because the safety \nof the passengers, all of us, depends upon it. So giving a limited \ngrant of immunity to an industry that is so highly regulated is quite \ndifferent than telling an unregulated industry you have no liability. \nThat is essentially what this bill does, with very minor exceptions; \nclearly, I think exceptions which were artfully crafted to avoid the \ncases that exist today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask, through the Chair, if the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island would further yield for a question. We have talked \nabout the gun manufacturer who did not do a background check on his \nemployees and the employees stole guns without serial numbers on them--\nthe guns went onto the street and were used to kill innocent people--\nthat that gun manufacturer would escape liability under this bill that \nis before us. I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island about \nthe example where someone who is a gun dealer, knows that under the law \nyou cannot sell guns to felons, people convicted of a felony, sees \nsomeone who comes in with another person, we call them straw \npurchasers, someone else who is going to buy the guns, a girlfriend, \nsome other person. We had a case I believe the Senator referred to, a \n10-year-old boy in Philadelphia on his way to school gets right to the \ngates to go into the schoolyard, a gang member comes up and shoots him \nin the face. He survived, was conscious for a few hours and then lapsed \ninto a coma and died. It turns out that the gun was traced to a store \nwhere it was sold to one of these straw purchasers--the other \npurchaser, the real purchaser who wasn't eligible to buy it, standing \nnext to them. So it was pretty clear what was going on. The store clerk \ncharges extra because there is a straw purchaser involved, \nacknowledging they know that this gun is being bought by one person to \nbe given to another.\n\n  So what the Senator from Rhode Island is telling us is that this bill \nsays the family of that 10-year-old boy shot in the face, who died by \nthat gun, cannot even go to court to hold responsible the gun dealer \nwho knowingly sold this gun to a straw purchaser to avoid the law.\n  Is that my understanding of this as it is written?\n  Mr. REED. I think the Senator is right. The only exception that could \nbe argued would, I believe, be the exception with respect to negligent \nentrustment. As I pointed out, that has been defined to mean that the \nindividual who receives the weapon--you have to have also the suspicion \nthat that person is going to use the firearm. In the classic case of a \nstraw purchaser, they are the conduit to someone else----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Middleman.\n  Mr. REED. Middleman. So that the argument made by lawyers would say \nnegligent entrustment, saying they gave it to inflict harm. Therefore, \nthis very narrowly defined exception would not apply. Generally, the \ncase I believe would be thrown out of court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, when it comes \nto protecting gun dealers from civil liability, from being held \nresponsible in court for their wrongdoing, I have read repeatedly that \nwhen you consider all of the licensed gun dealers across America, it is \na very small percentage that repeatedly sells guns that, when traced, \nare used in the commission of crimes. It turns out, in my State of \nIllinois and in many other States, that the gun dealers who are the \nreal wrongdoers, the ones who are abusing the system, are not the gun \ndealers selling in downstate Illinois, where I live, to the hunters and \nsportsmen and people who go to target ranges or want a gun for self-\ndefense, the real perpetrators of crime or wrongdoing who are protected \nby this turn out to be a handful of dealers in my State who again and \nagain and again sell guns that end up involved in criminal activity.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, who are we trying to \nprotect here when it comes gun dealers?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator asks an important question. According to \nFederal data from the year 2000, 1.2 percent of dealers accounted for \n57 percent of all guns recovered in criminal investigations--1.2 \npercent of dealers, 57 percent of the guns recovered from criminal \ninvestigation. In fact, the national crime tracing data from 1989 \nthrough 1996 gathered by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms and Explosives has a virtual scorecard on these egregious \nofferings.\n  Badger Outdoors, Inc., in West Milwaukee, WI, the dealer sold more \nthan 554 guns traced to crimes, 475 of these guns had a ``short time to \ncrime,'' as defined by ATF; that is, almost immediately they were in \nthe hands of someone and had some type of criminal activity.\n  I could go on.\n  Well, for the benefit of the Senator, Realco Guns in Forestville, MD; \nSouthern Police Equipment in Richmond, VA; Atlanta Gun and Tackle in \nBedford Heights, OH; Colosimo's Inc, in Philadelphia, PA; Don's Guns & \nGalleries in Indianapolis, IN.\n  Mr. DURBIN. These are the gun dealers.\n  Mr. REED. Elmwood Park, IL; Breit & Johnson Sporting Goods in Elmwood \nPark, IL.\n  Mr. DURBIN. These are the gun dealers that repeatedly sell guns that \nare traced to crimes. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island this \nquestion. The argument used for this gun legislation is, how can you \nhold a gun dealer responsible? For goodness sakes. How will they know \nwhat is going to happen to this gun? They sell the gun to a purchaser, \nthe gun leaves the shop. Why in the world would you hold the gun dealer \nresponsible? In the cases we have cited, in the examples which the \nSenator has used, you have gun dealers, 1.2 percent, who are \nresponsible for more than half the guns traced to crimes. In these \ndealers you have repeated sales, and over and over again, hundreds of \ntimes, to those who will use them in crime. It obviously raises a \nquestion which the supporters of this legislation can't answer, and \nthat is why you are trying to protect these miserable bums. Why are you \ntrying to say they can't be held responsible for the devastation and \nkilling and violence that goes on, on our streets when they are sitting \nthere churning out firearms that are used day after day in the \ncommission of a crime.\n  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, why do we not create an \nexception in this law for those who are repeat offenders as gun dealers \nwho continue to sell these guns used in crime and we know it and we \nhave the facts to prove it.\n  Why in the world should we protect them in this legislation?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator's point is extremely well taken. I think there \nshould be at least that exception. I would argue, frankly, that the \nbill could be further modified to essentially allow individuals who \nhave been harmed--move away from the issue of municipal suits but that \nis exactly the political implication--to let those suits survive. In \nfact, as Senator Levin urged, increase the standard from negligence to \ngross negligence, so further undercutting the argument about frivolous \njunk lawsuits.\n  That would be a broader remedy, but your proposal is very wise.\n  Let me give you an example of that store in Elmwood Park, IL, which I \npresume is close to Chicago.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. This dealer has sold more than 347 guns traced to crime; \n271 of those guns had a short time to crime as defined by ATF--again \nshort transit from the time it was sold to the crime scene. The guns \nwere involved in at least 27 homicides, 46 assaults, 23 robberies, and \n271 additional gun crimes. The dealer also sold at least 5,429 handguns \nin multiple sales. That is another possible important remedy, the issue \nof multiple sales.\n  Anthony Garner was arrested for gunrunning after he bought 16 \nhandguns from Breit & Johnson that were then sold to Chicago gang \nmembers. At least one of those guns was used in a gang-related killing. \nAndrew Young, age 19, was killed by Mario Ramos, a gang member with a \ngun from Breit & Johnson.\n  The list goes on and on. We have these statistics. These are \ncollected by the ATF. We know what's going on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, I am a member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we are considering two different \nbills to deal with criminal gang activity across America, which is a \nserious problem.\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\n  We are coming down with a variety of different ways to deal with \nthese criminal gangs, to investigate them, to break them up, to arrest \nthem, to make certain they face serious sentences for intimidation of \nwitnesses, for recruiting young people into their gangs.\n  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, how can a Member stand in the \nSenate and say they are dedicated to stopping criminal gang activity in \nAmerica and vote for this bill which allows gun dealers who have clear \nhistories of selling repeatedly to gang members firearms that are being \nused to kill innocent people? How can a Member say they are against \ncriminal gangs but are in favor of the gun dealers who are providing \nthem with their firearms?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator raises an excellent point. I phrase it slightly \ndifferently, but I reach the same conclusion.\n  If gun dealers--who now have the threat of a civil suit if there has \nbeen negligence--are so cavalier in their attitude about guns, selling \nthem to criminals, to straw purchasers, what happens when they are \nfully immunized or virtually immunized from any type of liability? What \nhappens when they know that no family is going to come in and say, My \nson or daughter died because of your negligence, and we are going to \nsee if we can take you to court and get something back--we will never \nget the child back--but something back.\n  What about the surviving spouse or children who need something to \nmaintain the quality of their life because they have lost their \nbreadwinner?\n  There is the case of Conrad Johnson, killed by one of the DC snipers. \nThose cases would be barred by this legislation.\n  It is not that the individuals, families, and the survivors are \ndenied their day in court, but any incentive to be responsible, to be \nscrupulous, to look harder to determine whether that person is buying \nthe weapon at the direction of another, as a straw purchaser, is \nvirtually eliminated. The consequences are going to be much worse. \nThese dealers will be more flagrant, more blatant, less restrained. It \nis hard to see how they could be more blatant than they are today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask a final question. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion in the Senate about the fact there is no exception for gun \ndealers who sell their guns to people who turn out to be on the FBI's \nMost Wanted list or those who may be involved in terrorism.\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island is undoubtedly aware, immediately \nafter September 11, we raided one of the al-Qaida headquarters in \nAfghanistan and discovered one of their training manuals in which they \ngave advice to terrorists coming to the United States about buying \ntheir firearms in the United States because it was easy to buy a gun in \nthis country.\n  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, when it comes to the exceptions \nin this bill, is there any exception such as the one suggested by \nSenator Kennedy that would put gun dealers on notice not to sell guns \nto people who are on the FBI's Most Wanted list so that we would say, \nyou cannot get off the hook and be held, that you are not liable, not \nresponsible for wrongdoing with a weapon if you did not take the time \nto check the FBI's Most Wanted list when you made that sale.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is again accurate. Unless Senator Kennedy's \namendment is allowed to be voted upon, there is no prohibition against \nlooking at the person's picture on the FBI's Most Wanted list, looking \nat the person and saying: Have a nice day. Take the gun.\n  Again, one could argue that if that person actually uses the weapon, \nit might be negligence, but if he or she is a straw purchaser or buying \nlots of weapons to pass out, they would escape liability.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might just say, in closing, to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, when we traced criminal guns used in Illinois to kill people \nand commit serious crimes and tried to figure out where they were \ncoming from, the largest supplier of guns to the State of Illinois of \nwas Mississippi. In Mississippi, the enforcement of local gun laws is \nso relaxed and the enforcement of Federal laws is so relaxed that \npeople could literally buy a van full of cheap ``Saturday night \nspecials,'' get on the interstate highways and head north to Chicago, \nSpringfield, and St. Louis, selling those guns on the street.\n  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, is there anything in this bill \nwhich will make it more difficult for those gun traffickers to buy \nthese guns, turn them loose on the streets to kill innocent people in \nmy State or any State in this country?\n  Mr. REED. I don't see that. In fact, I don't see that as the purpose \nof this legislation. This is not about preventing criminals from \ngetting weapons. It is preventing victims of gun violence from getting \ntheir day in court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for his questions.\n  The line of questioning that the Senator from Illinois has opened \nraises the issue: What are the exceptions? How can someone get to court \nif they have been harmed?\n  Since we have had a robust discussion, and I see the Senator from \nOhio in the Senate, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, when this bill was before the Senate in \nthe last Congress, I came to the Senate to oppose it. I opposed it \nbecause it denied certain gun crime victims, certain individuals who \nwere victims of crimes committed with guns, their day in court. It \nsingled out a particular group of weapon victims that it treated \ndifferently than we treat any other victims in the whole country. It \nset them apart.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before the Senate is no better than the one \nwe had last year. In fact, it is worse. Not only does it grant immunity \nto the gun industry, the bill also prevents Federal, State, and local \ngovernment agencies from shutting down gun dealers who violate the law. \nLocal and State governments are responsible for ensuring that \nrestaurants are clean, that doctors are properly licensed, stores do \nnot sell alcohol and cigarettes to our children. Why can't they also \nensure that gun dealers and manufacturers operate responsibly? Why do \nwe want to take that right away from them? Yet the current language of \nthe bill before the Senate would do that.\n  I have great respect for the many firearms dealers and manufacturers \naround this country who are legitimate, honest and hard working. The \nvast majority of dealers have no tolerance for buyers who circumvent \ngun laws. These dealers are also responsible, ensuring that they have \nadequate inventory control systems in place so that guns do not get \nlost or become missing.\n  This bill would not help them. The responsible dealers don't need \nthis bill. Cases filed against responsible dealers and manufacturers \nwho have done nothing wrong can already be tossed out if they have no \nmerit, as any frivolous lawsuit will be tossed out in a court of law if \nthey are filed against any manufacturer of any product or against any \nwholesaler or retailer of any product.\n  Who, then, will benefit by the passage of this bill? The people who \nwill benefit are the irresponsible dealers and the irresponsible \nmanufacturers.\n  Let me describe some cases. Everyone remembers all too well the \ntragedies of the DC sniper cases. Some of the victims of the DC snipers \nsued Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, the gun dealer that negligently allowed \na Bushmaster rifle to reach the hands of John Allen Mohammed and Lee \nBoyd Malvo. That suit was successful. In the settlement, the negligent \ndealer--we could have assumed he would have been found negligent in a \ncourt of law--agreed to pay the victim and their families $2.5 million.\n  If this bill had been in effect a few years ago, these victims would \nhave had no recourse in court.\n  Or perhaps we remember Danny Guzman, from Worcester, MA. On December \n24, 1999, Danny Guzman was shot and killed by a gun that was taken from \na factory run by Kahr Arms. Unfortunately, Kahr Arms hired Mark Cronin, \nan individual with a history of crack cocaine addiction and theft. \nCronin was given unfettered access to the untraceable, unstamped guns \nin the factory. He bragged, in fact, that it was so easy to remove guns \nthat he ``does it all the time and he could just walk out with them.''\n  Cronin removed one of these guns from the factory. That gun ended up \non\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\nthe streets, and tragically it was used to kill Danny Guzman. Those are \nthe essential facts.\n  Danny Guzman's estate, on behalf of his widow and two young \ndaughters, sued Kahr Arms, alleging that it operated its plant in a \ngrossly negligent manner, and in the spring of 2003, a State judge \nallowed that case to proceed. If this bill passes, however, the widow \nand children of Danny Guzman would be out of court.\n  As we can see, this bill cuts to the core of civil liability law and \nguts it. As my colleagues know, now, under current law throughout this \ncountry, the victim needs to prove the defendant acted in an \nunreasonable manner--basic negligence law, the law those who are \nlawyers learn about in the first and second year of law school. It is \nthe law of negligence that prevails in courts of law in every type of \ncivil case. It is not unusual. It is what it is.\n  Under negligence law, if the defendant fails to meet his or her duty \nto act in a responsible fashion, they are liable for negligence as long \nas that failure leads to harm to the victim. That is what is required. \nIt is negligence. It is as simple as that. That is the standard. It is \na standard we have developed over 200 years in this country, a standard \nwe inherited from the British system. So we have hundreds and hundreds \nof years of experience in how to apply the rules of law, the common law \nnegligence.\n  This bill says that those rules will no longer apply for one set of \nvictims. These rules that we have taken hundreds of years to develop \nwill no longer apply to one set of victims and to one set of \ndefendants.\n  When we study law, one of the first things we learn is the difference \nbetween civil and criminal law. Someone who did not commit a crime can \nstill be held liable in civil law to someone else and have to pay \nmonetary damages. That is a basic concept.\n  This bill, however, changes that fundamental idea of civil law \nbecause under this bill a victim cannot sue a gun dealer for damages \nresulting from illegal actions of a third party without also showing \nthat a dealer is guilty of a violation of the law, even--even--when the \ndealer has been negligent. Again, that is a fundamental change in our \nlaw with one group of civil defendants.\n  If this bill were to become law, a plaintiff would not only have to \ndemonstrate that a gun dealer acted negligently, but also that the gun \ndealer broke the law--broke the criminal law. In other words, the \nplaintiff would--with one lone exception that has already been talked \nabout on the floor a few moments ago--have to prove the gun dealer \nviolated a statute or is guilty of a crime.\n  We do not require this in any other place in our law. Why do we want \nto do it in this case? If those who come to the floor in favor of this \nbill think it is such a great idea to do it in this case, if they think \nit is such a great idea to require that they have to violate a criminal \nlaw before you can sue them, then why not just pass that law for \neverybody? Why not make it the law of the land that in any civil suit \nin this country you have to have violated a criminal law? Why not \nchange our civil law, turn it upside down, in all 50 States of the \nUnion, if it is such a great idea?\n  I do not see anybody coming to the floor who is in favor of this bill \nsaying it is such a great idea to do that. I do not see anybody \nproposing to do that. Yet they want to do it for one set of victims. \nThey want to single out one set of victims. If you are a victim of \nguns--and it could be that somebody, a manufacturer, a gun dealer, has \nbeen negligent--we are going to require, for you to get inside the \ncourthouse door, for you to even enter the courthouse door, before you \ncan get what every American has the right to have--and that is a trial \nby jury, a trial, the opportunity to have your case heard by a judge \nand a jury--we are going to require you to prove there has been a crime \ncommitted.\n  We do not require that for any other group of people. So if they \nthink it is such a great idea, let them come to the floor and propose \nthat, to make it a universal law for every civil suit in the country.\n  I would like to talk for a moment about the language in this bill \nthat might well prevent the Government from enforcing our gun laws \nagainst irresponsible gun dealers. This provision goes well beyond \nbarring civil suits by private citizens who have been wronged. This \nprovision is a new provision. It was not in last year's bill. This \nprovision potentially curtails the ability of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms, the ATF, from enforcing the gun laws that are \ncurrently on the books.\n  Two former ATF Directors recognize the potential harm that comes from \nthis provision. According to Stephen Higgins, ATF Director from 1982 to \n1995, and Rex Davis, ATF Director from 1970 to 1978, this broad, new \nlanguage contained in this legislation in front of us today would \nlikely prohibit the ATF from initiating proceedings to revoke a gun \ndealer's license, even when that dealer supplies guns to criminals.\n  Let me repeat that. According to both of these former ATF Directors, \nthis broad, new language would likely prohibit the ATF from initiating \nproceedings to revoke a gun dealer's license, even when that dealer \nsupplies guns to criminals.\n  So not only are we shielding these bad apples, bad actors, people who \nought to not be doing business, not only are we shielding them from \ncivil liability, now we are coming along and saying the ATF cannot \nenforce the law against them. What in the world are we thinking?\n  I think that everyone in this body can agree it is important for us \nto enforce gun laws that we have on the books. Why in the world is \nthere attached a provision to this bill that would make it harder for \nATF to enforce our laws and shut down wayward and dangerous gun \ndealers? Why in the world would we want to do this? I don't know.\n  Why would we want to strip away the opportunity of a gun victim to \nget into court? Why do we want to do either one of those things? I \nguess the answer is pretty simple. This bill ties the ATF's hands, ties \nthe hands of private citizens, ties the hands of State and local \nagencies. It shields a certain group of defendants--gun manufacturers \nand dealers--from liability. This bill grants immunity. It overturns \nwell over 200 years of civil law, 200 years of tort law, 200 years of \ncommon law.\n  If it passes, this bill would fundamentally change our justice \nsystem. It would do this by denying one group of citizens access to the \ncourt system in order to protect another group.\n  Why in the world are we about to do this? The only reason I can think \nof is because there are the votes here to do it. There is the power to \ndo it. It can be done. One group in the country can get it done.\n  Now, Mr. President, I can count. I know how this vote is going to \nturn out. But that still does not make it right. Just because there are \nvotes to pass this legislation does not mean it is the right bill for \nour country, for the victims, or for the American people.\n  I said this last year, and I will say it again. I will make a \nprediction about this bill. I will make a prediction about the effect \nit will have on this group of victims. Yes, the passage of this bill \nwill get rid of some frivolous lawsuits. There is no doubt about that. \nWe could get rid of a lot of frivolous lawsuits in this country by \nprohibiting access to the courthouse. There will be lawsuits that will \nnever be filed because of this bill. That is true. There is no doubt \nabout that.\n  But, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, mark my words: If this \nbill passes, in the future there will be a case, or cases, that will be \nso egregious, so bad, that it will sicken your stomach, and Members of \nthis Senate will read about it, and Members of this Senate will look up \nfrom their paper, or will look up from the evening news, and will say: \nI didn't intend to do that. I didn't intend for that victim not to be \nable to go into court. I didn't intend for that child, that man, that \nwoman not to be able to sue that defendant. Oh, I never intended that.\n  There will be that case, and that day will come. And whether it is a \nterrorist who is the defendant or whether it is some horrible criminal \nor whether it is some horribly negligent gun dealer--whoever it is--\nthere will be some case, and we will see it, and we will live to regret \nthis day. You cannot arbitrarily close the door to the courthouse and \nsay, ``You cannot come in, victim, if you are of a certain class,'' and \nnot\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\nhave injustice done. You cannot do it. That day will occur, and we will \nregret what we are about to do.\n\n  There is an additional aspect of this bill that has not been talked a \nlot about; and that is the fact that it is retroactive. It would \nactually kick existing cases out of court. How dare we do that. How \ndare we have the audacity to do that. How dare we in this Congress come \nto the Senate floor and wipe out every lawsuit that has been filed in \nthis country that would come within the parameters of this bill. How \narrogant are we to do that? Did we really get elected to the Senate to \ntell crime victims that their case is frivolous, without ever even \nknowing the facts of that particular case?\n  We will have in front of us, in a few weeks, a Supreme Court nominee. \nThere will be a lot of talk, as there already has been, about the \nseparation of powers. There will be a lot of talk about judicial \nrestraint, as well there should be. I probably will be talking about it \nas well.\n  What about legislative restraint? We do not talk much about that. We \nget mad here on Capitol Hill when we pass a bill and the Supreme Court \nsays we did not have the power to pass that bill. I think we should \nremember what our role is. I do not think anyone elected us to the \nSenate to bar their ability to go into court--not to completely bar the \ndoor. I think it is one thing to set standards and parameters and maybe \nlimits. You can talk about that. But to totally say, ``You can't go \ninto court,'' I think we ought to think long and hard before we do \nthis.\n  If passed, this bill would kick people out of court retroactively. It \nwould not just bar people from coming to the courthouse. Apparently, \nthat is not enough. No. What this bill does is kick people out who are \nalready in court. It kicks people out who have already survived motions \nto dismiss and motions for summary judgment. It likely even tosses out \nvictims who have won at trial and are defending their cases on appeal. \nTo me, that is just plain wrong.\n  The courts are supposed to decide these cases. Juries are supposed to \ndecide them. People are supposed to have their day in court. That is \nhow our system is supposed to work. I do not think it is my job or the \njob of other Members of the Senate to judge these cases. It is not our \njob to determine whether these cases should or should not proceed. It \nis not my job to determine whether someone is negligent or is not \nnegligent.\n  I also think it is not my job to tell a victim that he or she does \nnot have the right to go to court and present a case to a judge or a \njury. People in this country are supposed to have their day in court. \nThat is fundamentally the American way. This bill creates two classes \nof victims in this country. If you are injured by any industry in \nAmerica, you can file a lawsuit in State court in an attempt to redress \nyour injury. After the passage of this bill, however, if you are \ninjured by the gun industry, you are likely out of luck.\n  Other industries face legal challenges. Other industries, other \ndefendants, have had lawsuits filed against them they do not like. \nOther defendants, every single day in this country, face suits that in \ntheir eyes, many times, are frivolous, that they cannot stand, that \nthey do not think are fair. But they are not here petitioning us, \ntelling us we should pass a law that blocks the ability of someone to \nsue them. Other industries are involved in cases where many people die. \nWe understand that. We do not grant to them this kind of immunity from \ncivil liability.\n  I support the second amendment. I support individuals' rights to own \nguns. I support gun manufacturers. I support legitimate gun dealers. \nAnd I support responsible tort reform. I certainly understand there are \nsome abuses in the system, and that sometimes Congress needs to act to \nprevent these abuses. For example, just recently, I voted in favor of \nclass action reform, and we passed that legislation to modify certain \nclass action procedures.\n  But what we are about to do in this Congress, in this Senate, is \nwrong. This bill keeps victims out of court altogether. This bill is \nunfair to victims. But more important than that, it is a horrible \nprecedent. If we do this, this time, what is to stop a future \nCongress--where there are the votes, maybe configured differently--from \nsaying: ``Oh, there is another group of victims, and we need to protect \nthem, another group of victims that we are not going to protect, \nanother group of defendants that we are going to protect, another group \nof victims to whom we are going to say, you can't sue them, you can't \nget your day in court''?\n\n  If we deny this group of victims in front of us today their rights, \nwhat is to stop a future Congress from denying another group of victims \ntheir rights?\n  We need to think about this long and hard before we cast this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           The Good Neighbor\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President,\n\n     The roses red upon my neighbor's vine\n     Are owned by him, but they are also mine.\n     His was the cost, and his the labor, too,\n     But mine as well as his the joy, their loveliness to view.\n\n     They bloom for me and are for me as fair\n     As for the man who gives them all his care.\n     Thus I am rich because a good man grew\n     A rose-clad vine for all his neighbors' view.\n\n     I know from this that others plant for me,\n     That what they own my joy may also be;\n     So why be selfish when so much that's fine\n     Is grown for me upon my neighbor's vine?\n\n  The appreciation of a good neighbor is among the oldest, most \ncherished, and enduring of human values. It is a value that transcends \nboth time and space.\n  This value was vividly and eloquently expressed more than 2,000 years \nago in the Bible which commands us in eight different passages to love \nour neighbors: Leviticus 19:18, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:39, Mark \n12:31, Luke 10:27, Romans 13:9, Galatians 5:14, James 2:8. In fact, \nthis is one of the most repeated commands in the Scripture. In other \npassages, the Bible tells us how to treat our neighbors, Proverbs 25:17 \nand Romans 15:2; and in others warns us against mistreating our \nneighbors, Deuteronomy 19:14, Exodus 20:16, Proverbs 3:29.\n  The appreciation of a good neighbor is also a value that knows no \ncultural or geographical boundaries. An old Chinese proverb, for \nexample, maintains that ``a good neighbor is a found treasure.''\n  In the United States, towns and states celebrate Good Neighbor Days. \nAcross the country, municipalities, corporations, radio stations, and \nnewspapers present Good Neighbor Awards. Stores and businesses proclaim \n``Good Neighbor Days'' to promote sales. Since the early 1970s, the \nFederal Government has celebrated an annual Good Neighbor Day. This \nyear Good Neighbor Day will be observed on September 25.\n  The web site for the national Good Neighbor Day points out that \n``being good neighbors is an important part of the social fabric that \nmakes ours a great country.'' Indeed it is. Good neighbors are always \nthere when you need them, offering a helping hand, providing comfort.\n  Seldom have I observed a stronger sense of neighborliness than among \nthe coal miners in the West Virginia communities where I spent my \nboyhood years. Fred Mooney, a leading figure in organizing the West \nVirginia coal miners in the early Twentieth Century, in his \nautobiography, ``Struggle in the Coal Fields,'' recalled how his coal-\nmining neighbors, although themselves quite poor, sacrificed to help \nhim and his family with food and clothes after he had been fired from \nhis job and blacklisted for his union activities. Mooney explained, \n``This is the spirit of fellowship, love, and devotion that permeates \nthe life of a union coal miner. He will give until it hurts and then \ndivide the rest.''\n  That, Mr. President, is loving thy neighbor: ``giv[ing] until it \nhurts'' and expecting nothing in return.\n  I have observed this sense of neighborliness following mine \nexplosions, floods, and other disasters that have befallen on my state \nover the years. I will never forget how the people of Buffalo Creek, \nWV, came together following a disastrous flood in that community. How \nthey worked together and shared together while caring for and \ncomforting each other, thus enabling themselves and their neighbors to \nsurvive that horrible tragedy. Being a good neighbor involves most \noften small, simple acts of kindness. The former Speaker of the House \nof Representatives, Tip O'Neill, liked to point\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\nout that ``all politics is local.'' Being a good neighbor is also \nlocal. It begins right over the backyard fence. It involves small, \nsimple acts of kindness, as well as dramatic gestures during \ncatastrophic events.\n  A good neighbor is the friendly face who shows up with a cake or a \npie at the house of a family who has a member who is ill. A good \nneighbor is a person who mows the lawn of the widow down the street. He \nmay be the handyman who is quick to pull out his tool belt when a \nneighbor has a busted pipe, or a mechanic who starts his neighbor's car \non a cold winter morning so he can get to work. He is a neighbor who \nwill cheerfully shovel your sidewalk when it snows, or rake leaves, \njust to make life easier for you.\n  Such simple acts of kindness are part of the social fabric that makes \nfor a better community, a better country, and a better world.\n  I am thinking now of a neighbor who lives about 3 miles from where I \nlive in McLean, VA. I have known him a good many years. His name is \nJames Nobles. Jim Nobles is a neighbor who is always seeking ways to \nhelp my wife Erma and to help me. Many is the time that he has come to \nmy home and sat and talked with my wife, who has gone through a long \nperiod of illness, an illness of going on 5 years. Many times Jim \nNobles has come by and sat on the front porch with Erma and talked with \nher. So when Erma and I have been busy or tired, Jim Nobles somehow \nappears at our door with a basket of food or a cake from the local \nGiant store. He provides us with transportation if we need it.\n  On cold winter days, often to my surprise and my delight, I have \nlooked out the glass windows, and I have seen him out shoveling the \nsnow from the walkway to the mailbox. I find he has already shoveled \nthe snow off my sidewalk.\n  When he is able, he makes sure that my newspaper is on my porch in \nthe morning. There it is, the Washington Post. There it is, Roll Call. \nThere it is, The Hill. Jim Nobles gets up, comes over to my house, 3 \nmiles from where he lives, and brings the papers off the sidewalk onto \nmy porch. I can always tell that it is Jim Nobles because he also \nplaces the newspapers in the same fashion in the same place right there \nat my door. That is a good neighbor. He comes when my hedges have grown \na little too long. He tops off the hedges. He shapes them up. When \nthere are some dead limbs on the trees in my front yard, he cuts off \nthose dead limbs and hauls them away. That is Jim Nobles.\n  Sometimes Jim goes on a vacation. He is retired now. He goes on a \nvacation. He has a place somewhere down in Virginia, perhaps 100 miles \naway or more from where we live. Sometimes he goes and spends a few \ndays there at that place. Then what am I to do but go out and get the \npaper. I have to get up, go out and get the newspaper. It is not a \ngreat chore, but it is something.\n  But lo, to my surprise, the newspaper keeps on being delivered to my \ndoor. So for quite a while, I wondered, who is the other good neighbor \nwho pinch-hits when Jim Nobles is away?\n  On two or three occasions, I have sat up just to try to catch that \nother good neighbor delivering that newspaper. I remember on one \noccasion I got up early and I put a little chair beside the front door \nand I sat there and watched, waiting for that person to walk up and \ndeliver my paper. Jim Nobles was away. But, you know, that neighbor on \nthat particular occasion didn't come, didn't deliver that paper.\n  So time has gone on, and this morning, I decided I am going to catch \nthis neighbor this time--this good neighbor who delivers my newspaper \nwhen Jim Nobles is away on vacation. So there I sat. This time, luck \nwas with me. I saw her come down the street, pick up the newspaper, \npick up the Roll Call and The Hill. She came up to the door and put the \npapers in the spot there and away she darted. It was then that I turned \nthe key in the door. I said, ``Lady, would you wait just a minute? I \nwant to know more about you. What is your name? I want to thank you for \ndelivering this to my door when Mr. Nobles is not here.''\n  I came to find out that this was a lady from the Philippines. She \nworked in the area. She doesn't live in the immediate area, but she \ncomes into the area on a bus, she gets off the bus, and on her way to \nthe residence where she works during the day, she stops, picks up the \nnewspaper out there on the sidewalk near my mailbox, walks up to my \ndoor, and puts that paper down. Finally, I found this caring, good \nneighbor whose name I had been wishing to learn. Her name is Ms. Mary \nLucas, from the Philippines. I told her this morning that I was in the \nPhilippines 50 years ago this year. I had breakfast at that time with \nthe late President Magsaysay, who was later killed in a plane crash.\n  So there she was, a good neighbor making her way to work, doing a \nspecial favor for someone like myself and then going on, not receiving \nmy thanks. This could have gone on a long time, as it had already gone \non a long time. I finally found her and found out her name.\n  I must confess that at times I feel a little guilty because I am not \na better neighbor. My work in the Senate, my family life, and my other \nresponsibilities prevent me from performing the kind, neighborly acts \nthat Mr. Nobles and Ms. Lucas have performed for me over the years. But \nthey, in the truest neighborly ways, never expressed any complaint. \nThey never want anything in return; they never expect anything in \nreturn. They just want to be good neighbors. And they are. Indeed, they \nare treasures.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to \nsay how fortunate I am to have such good neighbors. I thought it might \nencourage all of us to think a little more about being better \nneighbors. It is the human touch that makes a better community, a \nbetter country, a better world. And so on this day in July, in this \nyear of our Lord, I want to thank God for good neighbors, for the \ninspiration they have given to me and to Erma, for the goodness they \nhave shared with her and with me.\n  I close with a bit of verse by Edgar Guest:\n\n     I have a kindly neighbor, one who stands\n     Beside my gate and chats with me awhile,\n     Gives me the glory of his radiant smile\n     And comes at times to help with willing hands.\n     No station high or rank this man commands;\n     He, too, must trudge, as I, the long day's mile;\n     And yet, devoid of pomp or gaudy style,\n     He has a worth exceeding stocks of lands.\n\n     To him I go when sorrow's at my door;\n     On him I lean when burdens come my way;\n     Together oft we talked our trials o'er,\n     And there is warmth in each good night we say.\n     A kindly neighbor! Wars and strife shall end\n     When man has made the man next door his friend.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for my fellow Senators, let me try to bring \nus up to speed on where we are. We now have all of the amendments filed \nand are looking at them and have studied a good number of them over the \nlast hour and a half to determine how we might dispose of them. We are \nhoping we can put something together.\n  Senator Warner from Virginia is here to talk a bit more about his \nlegislation. I see my colleague, the floor manager from the Democrat \nside, also here. I do want Members to know we are working to see if we \ncannot bring some finality to this process in a precloture environment \nor resolve that issue so we can complete our work on not only this but \nclear the issue of an energy conference which is privileged, a CAFTA \nrecognition of the House bill versus the Senate vehicle, which is \nprivileged, and that can come before us so that we can complete our \nwork in a timely fashion tomorrow and not spill ourselves into \nSaturday, as could be the case strictly under the rules of the Senate. \nWe hope we may be able to avoid that.\n  I hope that within a little while, we may be able to look at a \npackage and offer it to our colleagues for their consideration.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation and \ncollaboration. I am pleased also that you are looking closely at these \namendments. My position is simple. I believe the amendments are \nrelevant. I hope we can have votes on all of them. I particularly think \nSenator Warner's amendment is relevant, pertinent, and important. I \nhope he can offer that. But it is my hope that we can bring all\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\nof the pertinent amendments up, with appropriate timing, and conclude.\n  As we stand now, as the rules require, there will be a cloture vote \nsometime tomorrow. I think I understand also that after that cloture \nvote, moving from the gun liability bill to any of the other \nprovisions--energy or the Transportation bill--would require unanimous \nconsent. That is another factor that should be considered. So I hope we \ncan resolve this this evening.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague for that concern. We will be diligent \nin it. As you know, in the current environment, these conference \nreports are privileged and they can take us off the floor by the action \nof leadership for that consideration. That might occur later in the \nevening tonight. I am not sure that is the case, but that could occur.\n  Mr. REED. If I may say, my understanding is that once cloture is \ninvoked, to move off the 30 hours of cloture cannot be done by a \nprivileged motion, but by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I don't dispute that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \nkeeping the Senate advised. I have an amendment that has been filed. I \nthink at this point I will make the motion and ask for the reaction of \nthe managers.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that we lay \naside the pending amendment such that my amendment No. 1625, which is \non file, could be given the status of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Under the \ncurrent environment, I will object.\n  I do so with this concern in mind. I don't question the sincerity of \nthe Senator from Virginia for the offering of his amendment. I will say \nthat it is similar to but not exactly like the Levin amendment that we \nhave just disposed of. It deals with the issue of negligence or \nreckless conduct.\n  There are differences, and the Senator from Virginia may wish to \npoint those out. But it is important for the Senate to know that in \ntheir similarities, the Senate rejected overwhelmingly, by the largest \nvote yet, the issue of negligence and reckless conduct, for it is \nclearly recognized now by a majority of the Senate that this would \ndrive a major loophole through this legislation and deny the very \nlegislation and its intent. I certainly would not want that to happen. \nFor that purpose, I will object to laying aside the pending amendment \nand bringing the Warner amendment to the Senate floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend for being \nabsolutely forthright. I am fully aware of the parliamentary situation. \nThe distinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader--to the \nextent that he has participated--are acting within the rules of the \nSenate. I do not ascribe any impropriety whatsoever to the exercise by \nany Senator at any time of the rules of the Senate. But it does put \npersons like myself who feel very strongly about amendments we have in \na unique situation. I would like to support this bill, but I have grave \nreservations about those provisions relating to the dealers, and I'd \nlike to have my amendment considered. I will express them momentarily. \nBut the parliamentary situation, as the Senator has explained, does not \nallow me the opportunity at this juncture--although I may persist by \nother means--to get this amendment to be given the pending status.\n  I inquire of the Presiding Officer if the Parliamentarian would \nexamine amendment No. 1625 to determine whether it is germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that the \namendment is germane to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. So I have here an amendment that is \nclearly germane. I regret deeply that I am not able to bring it up such \nthat I and other Senators could debate it and have a rollcall vote, \nwhich I would ask for, and if granted, we could allow each Senator to \nexpress his or her views on this amendment.\n  Now, the manager said that we had a debate on the Levin amendment, \nand I supported the goal of the Senator from Michigan. And I listened \nto my distinguished colleague from Ohio as he spoke on this general \nsubject. But my amendment is quite different from the Levin amendment. \nThe Levin amendment would cause the gun industry, as some said, to \nsuffer a death by a thousand cuts because it would essentially gut the \nbill. The Warner amendment does not come anywhere near to gutting the \nbill.\n\n  I feel very strongly that of the gun dealers across this country, if \nwe were able to make an assessment and evaluation, 99 percent of them \nare law-abiding citizens. They not only want to stay within the law, \nbut they also do not want to be a part in any way of the use of a \nfirearm that might be involved in a crime.\n  My amendment is to focus in on those dealers who have, over a period \nof time, experienced, again and again, the loss of firearms from their \ninventory. And if it can be factually established that a dealer has a \nrecord of practices that for one reason or another--probably due to \nnegligence--enables weapons in that dealer's inventory to find their \nway illegally into the hands of criminals, then that dealer should not \nbe granted the benefits afforded by this bill. Nor should such dealers \nbe spared from a closer inquiry into why they have an established \nrecord of having guns go out of that dealership that they cannot \naccount for.\n  My amendment does not affect the protection from the frivolous \nlawsuits that exist under this bill. My amendment only addresses that \nnarrow category of dealers who have a record of, again and again, \nmismanaging their inventory in such a way that they cannot account for \na large number of weapons.\n  More specifically, my amendment does not take away the protections \nwhich 99 percent of the gun dealers should be able to avail themselves \nof, the honest ones, under this bill. I don't do that. My amendment is \nsolely directed at those very few--I repeat, very few--dealers who have \nestablished a history of lost or stolen weapons as defined by the \nAttorney General of the United States pursuant to regulations that my \namendment would call upon the Attorney General to promulgate for the \nindustry. My amendment would enable the industry and, most \nparticularly, the small gun dealers to know exactly what are the \nregulations that should be followed to maintain that inventory and \nconduct their business so that weapons cannot disappear and, by such \ndisappearance, fall into the hands of criminals. That is what my \namendment does. Maybe 1 percent of the dealers would be affected by \nthis amendment. The other 99 percent are accorded the benefits of the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Why can't we in the Senate voice our opinions on this concept? \nRegrettably, the decision has been made that at this time the amendment \ncannot be, even though germane, brought up in such a way as the entire \nSenate can focus upon it.\n  My amendment is not an attempt to gut the bill. Indeed, I recognize \nthe gun industry, as I said last night, needs some reasonable, \nbalanced, measure of tort reform. My amendment is offered in good \nfaith, I say to the Senate. It is not just to protect the possible \nvictims from criminal use of a weapon, but it is to protect the law-\nabiding gun dealers.\n  If this legislation remains as it is now, without some type of \ncorrection, such as mine, there will undoubtedly be unintended \nconsequences.\n  We need look no further than our own backyard, based on the \nexperiences we had here in the Nation's Capital and in adjoining \nMaryland and in my State of Virginia, with snipers committing wanton \nmurder. The snipers illegally obtained their gun out of a gun shop that \nthe record shows lost over 200 weapons over a period of a year or two. \nIf another such tragic incident were to occur with a gun dealer who had \na similar record of irresponsibility, and that gun dealer was immune \nfrom lawsuit, that would cast a very negative feeling all across \nAmerica toward the gun industry and the gun dealers. They would be \ncalled to task to explain why they supported a law, if this is to \nbecome law, that would allow that to happen.\n  My words are one thing, but I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\na document that I find very interesting. In my modest career in the \nNation's Capital and in Virginia, I have met a number of lawyers in my \ntime, but one whom recently passed on--I remember working with him on a \nnumber of cases, even when I was in private practice--I will never \nforget. I go that far back, knowing Lloyd N. Cutler of the prestigious \nlaw firm of Wilmer, Cutler, and Pickering.\n  Lloyd Cutler was asked by the Brady organization--Jim Brady, we all \nremember, was President Reagan's press secretary who suffered a \nfrightful injury at the time there was an assassination attempt against \nour President. He and his courageous wife in the ensuing years have \nbeen unrelenting in their efforts to try and have a balance across \nAmerica between the rights of those who acquire guns under the second \namendment--and I strongly support the second amendment of the \nConstitution.\n  But in any event, on January 15, 2004, Mr. Cutler wrote the \norganization which asked him to diagnose cases and the basic tenets and \nprovisions of the legislation that is pending today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print portions of this opinion into the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2004.\n     Re effect of S. 1805 (108th Cong.) on Johnson, et al. v. \n         Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, et al., No. 03-2-03932-8 \n         (Wash. Super. Ct.)\n\n     Mr. Michael Barnes,\n     President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Barnes: As you have requested, I have reviewed the \n     likely effect on litigation brought against a firearms \n     manufacturer and dealer in Johnson, et al. v. Bull's Eye \n     Shooter Supply, et al., No. 03-2-03932-8 (Wash. Super. Ct.), \n     if S. 1805 (108th Cong., 1st Sess.) were enacted into law in \n     its current form. . . . The Johnson case is a suit for \n     damages brought by victims of the Washington, D.C., area \n     snipers, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, against \n     Bushmaster Firearms, Inc., the manufacturer of the semi-\n     automatic assault rifle used by Muhammad and Malvo, and \n     Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, the firearms dealer from which \n     Malvo allegedly stole that rifle. S. 1805, also known as the \n     Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, would broadly \n     prohibit many kinds of civil actions against manufacturers \n     and dealers of firearms for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of firearms manufactured by or obtained from them.\n       S. 1805 contains much of the language of an earlier bill, \n     S. 659 (108th Cong., 1st Sess.), which similarly would \n     broadly prohibit civil actions against firearms manufacturers \n     and dealers.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will read the last paragraph:\n\n       Accordingly, I conclude that the Johnson case does not fall \n     within the saving provision of the Daschle amendment or any \n     other saving provision of S. 1805 would have to be dismissed \n     if S. 1805 were enacted into law.\n\n  S. 1805 is legislation from the 108th Congress that is nearly exact \nto the bill before us today in the Senate. The Johnson case is a case \nbrought by the victims of the DC snipers--I repeat, the DC snipers, the \nserious murders about which I spoke. Those victims could not have \ncollected had this underlying legislation before the Senate been law at \nthat time.\n  Is that what this Senate wants? I don't think so. I think I, and \npossibly other Senators, deserve the opportunity to go into greater \nlength with regard to that provision which does not by any reading give \nthe protection that is needed to victims should a dealer again and \nagain have lost or stolen weapons from its inventory utilized for \npurposes of a crime. The bill as drafted does not give the protection \nwe need, and I simply ask, let us impose on the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, if this legislation were to pass and remain on the books \nfor an indeterminate period, let that Attorney General of the United \nStates decide how best to analyze the gun dealers to establish a \nframework of regulations that would guide them in the conduct of their \nbusiness such that we hope a weapon would never escape the inventory \nand find its way into the hands of the criminal.\n  I fear some day we are going to see another case. I hope not. But if \nwe do, maybe somebody will come back and examine the record of this \ncolloquy and this debate and reflect on the gun industry's desire to \nget legislation that does not protect the American public against the \nnegligence and wrongful actions of a very small percentage of gun \ndealers, maybe at most 1 or 2 percent. That is all I ask.\n  I see the manager. Does the manager wish to pose a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not. I was only going to respond briefly to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Please. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, I don't question the sincerity or \nhow the Senator from Virginia feels about this issue and the amendment \nhe has offered. But I think it is important to recognize how the \ncurrent law works.\n  It does not mean it is perfect, and it does not mean it is always \neffective. But the Bull's Eye arms dealership in the State of \nWashington, from which John Muhammad and Lee Malvo, the two snipers who \nterrorized Washington, Northern Virginia, and Maryland for a time, \nstole their firearm, had a record of repeated recordkeeping violations \nand, as a result of that, their license was pulled. The owner of that \ndealership no longer has his license.\n  I don't know if the Bull's Eye is still in business, but if it is, it \nis under a new dealer. Why? Here is the reason why. If you are a \nlicensed firearms manufacturer in the United States--and all are under \nthe Federal firearms licensing--whether you are a manufacturer or a \nlicensed dealer, you must report within 48 hours missing weapons. If \nthey have been stolen or misinventoried, they have to be reported. They \nhave to be reported to the ATF, and they have to be reported to local \nlaw enforcement officers in the area as a possible theft, meaning that \nthose guns are out there in the market. So there already is a Federal \nlaw and a mechanism that is at work to attempt to accomplish this.\n  If, by that reporting, negligence can be demonstrated, this bill does \nnot protect in any sense of the word negligent entrustment. That is \nvery clear.\n  It was argued by a variety of our colleagues earlier in the day as it \nrelated to the Levin amendment--and that is the connective thread I \nspoke about earlier--it is important to understand that we are not \nwithout very strict laws today as it relates to the control of \ninventories of firearms in federally licensed firearms dealers' \nbusiness locations and manufacturers. If there is a demonstration of \nnegligence, licenses can be pulled and those people can be taken out of \nbusiness, and they are.\n  Of course, in the case of the DC snipers--the tragedy we all lived \nthrough here--we know the end result tragically enough--people lost \ntheir lives. One of those men will be executed and the other is now in \nprison for life, and the dealership, or at least the owner of that \ndealership at the time, is out of business and will not get another \nlicense. That is the situation.\n  It appeared at least that they made mistakes in their recordkeeping. \nAs a result of that, they lost their license. If that is the case--I \ncannot argue, I am not an attorney--that is a clear case of negligent \nentrustment, but it appears it may have been--if that is the case, I am \nquite sure that prosecution will move forward. If it is not, so on. \nNow, in the case of the West Virginia incident that we all know well, \nthe lemon jello case, a straw dealer or a straw purchaser, the firearms \ndealer was wise to it, and as a result reported it. So I think it is \nimportant to suggest that the law is out there and the law is clear and \nthe ATF enforces the law. The law says firearms stolen, report it; \ninventory off, report it; 48 or you run the risk of losing your license \nand being put out of business, manufacturer or dealer.\n\n  So I do not want any of our colleagues to assume that this is an open \narea of the law. It is not. By the level of enforcement that the \nFederal Government and the Justice Department can deliver, it is a \nclearly enforceable and an enforced section of firearms law in this \ncountry. I think that is important for the record to demonstrate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to reply to my good friend. \nThe Senator is absolutely correct about the reporting requirements, but \nthe reality is that some dealers ignore those requirements. They are \ntotally unscrupulous, negligent, and ignore them. The recordkeeping \nrequirements did not\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nprevent Bull's Eye from losing 200 guns. They went ahead and ignored \nit. I strongly urge that we allow my amendment. It is but really one \nsentence. It simply says: On page 8, line 21, before the semicolon \ninsert the following, or an action against a seller that has an \nestablished history of qualified products--that is the guns--being lost \nor stolen, under such criteria as shall be established by the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States by regulation for an injury or death \ncaused by a qualified product that was in the possession of the seller \nbut subsequently lost or stolen.\n  We have to have a stronger enforcement mechanism than is in the \nunderlying bill. It has to be strengthened. I say to my good friend, I \nrespectfully disagree, and I think the confirmation by this \ndistinguished counsel, Lloyd Cutler, who concluded that had this \nstatute that the Senator seeks been in effect at the time of the \nsnipers, they could have gotten out from under it.\n  Some sellers of guns repeatedly are losing firearms or having guns \nstolen and that is irresponsible behavior on its face. It has to be \nregulated, and it has to be regulated by the chief law enforcement \nofficer of the United States, the Attorney General.\n  So I thank the Senator for the opportunity to speak to this. I once \nagain plead with the Senator to allow this amendment, which is germane. \nIf it were not germane, I would say to myself I gave it a good try. I \nask the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, is this amendment of \nmine involved in any discussions, might I inquire?\n  Mr. REED. I say to the Senator from Virginia, we think his amendment \nis very commendable, and we would like to see it brought forward for \ndebate and a vote. I have made that point privately, and I make it now \npublicly. We think it is, as the Senator says, germane and relevant. I \nthink the Senator is owed a vote, and I would like to see it happen.\n  Unfortunately, we are having difficulties clearing any amendments, \nincluding the Senator's, for voting on the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it was my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho were working on a possible package of amendments, and the \nSenator now advises me my amendment is in that package under \nconsideration. Is that a fact?\n  Mr. REED. I have asked that that amendment be considered. We are \nwaiting. We were not impatient, but there is a limit to patience. I \nwould point out, too, that there will be an attempt this evening to \nmove to other matters such as CAFTA and the Energy bill which will take \naway time to debate a vote on the pending gun liability bill. I just \nthink we have wasted too much time, that we should establish some rules \nwith respect to the amendments, vote on those amendments and move \nforward towards a cloture vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may make a brief reply, I thank my colleague from \nRhode Island. I think the managers are working on this situation. I am \nglad that my amendment is part of the consideration, and I just hope it \nis granted. As far as the business of the Senate, I entrust it to the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader as to what matters should be \ntaken up at what time in relation to this bill. So I cannot make any \ncomment on that and do not make one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If I would not offend my distinguished friend from Rhode \nIsland or my dear friend from Virginia, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 792 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill please report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 792) to establish a National sex offender \n     registration database, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my agreement with the majority leader was \nthat we would pass by consent S. 792 which the Senate passed by consent \nlast year. We are now passing it once again to go to the House. This \ndeals with sexual predators. This legislation is called ``Dru's Law.''\n  My colleagues and I who have joined together to pass this legislation \ntonight do so in honor of this wonderful young woman who was tragically \nmurdered in a parking lot in Grand Forks, ND. The man accused of \nmurdering Dru Sjodin spent 23 years in prison. He was a violent sexual \npredator who was let of prison with a wave. So long. Check in now and \nthen. Compare that, for example, to Martha Stewart, who was let out of \nprison but had to wear an electronic ankle bracelet.\n  Violent sexual predators judged to be at high risk for committing \nanother violent sexual act are let out of prison with a wave. As a \nresult, this young woman, Dru Sjodin, was tragically murdered. This is \nthe man who spent 23 years behind bars. The psychiatrists said before \nhe was released that he was a high risk for committing another violent \nsexual act. Within 6 months, he is now accused of murdering this young \nwoman.\n  It is not only this man. It is Mr. Duncan. Remember the last couple \nof weeks, the two young children kidnapped, one murdered. The other is \nstill alive, with her family dead. We know about this man. He raped a \n16-year-old boy at gunpoint, a violent sexual predator. Last April, he \nwas put in the arms of law enforcement and let out on $15,000 bail. \nMore Americans are dead because of it.\n  This is not some mysterious illness for which we don't know the cure. \nWe know what causes it and we know how to stop it. Again, if Martha \nStewart has to wear an electronic ankle bracelet ordered by a judge, \nthen surely violent sexual predators, when and if released, can be \nhighly monitored by local governments. Surely, we ought to decide that \nif violent sexual predators are a high risk for reoffending, then the \nlocal State's attorney ought to be notified in case they want to seek a \ncivil commitment to protect the public at large.\n  This bill does three things: One, create a national sex offender \nregistry; No. 2, if a violent offender judged to be at high-risk is to \nbe released from prison, the local State's attorney must first be \nnotified so they can seek additional civil commitment; No. 3, if a \nhigh-risk sexual predator is released, then there must be maintenance \nand monitoring of that sex offender. No more ``so long, see you at the \nprison door,'' for a violent sexual predator.\n  We must stop this. How many more Americans will lose their lives? How \nmany kids are going to be killed before we do the right thing?\n  Tonight the Senate takes an important step in the right direction. \nSenator Specter and I and others who have authored this legislation--\nSenators Dayton, Clinton, and others--have decided that enough is \nenough. It is long past time to do what is right with respect to \ndealing with sexual predators and protecting the American people. We do \nthis in the name of and in honor of Dru Sjodin, a young woman who \ntragically lost her life.\n  Perhaps in her name, with this legislation, we can save other lives. \nI feel good about what we do tonight in passing Dru's Law.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Dorgan \nsubstitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nCAFTA vote, the Senate proceed to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 6, the energy legislation; provided further that there be 3 hours \nequally divided between the chairman and ranking member or their \ndesignees. I further ask consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time, Senator Feingold be recognized in order to raise a Budget \nAct point of order and that Senator Domenici or his designee be \nimmediately recognized in order to make a motion to waive the \nrespective point of order. I further ask consent that if the point of \norder is waived, the Senate then proceed immediately to a vote on the \nadoption of the conference report with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I apologize for not raising this with the \nmajority leader a second ago, but I would ask consent that this \nlegislation be known as the Domenici Energy bill. I ask consent. I \nwould ask that we do a correcting resolution, that it be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. FRIST.

I know everybody is tired.\n  Senator Domenici kept his word on the Energy bill. It was very \ndifficult. The conference was a real conference. They met until 3 \no'clock in the morning. Senator Domenici has worked very hard on this \nbill. There are a lot of people who do not like the bill, but it is not \nbecause of him. He did everything he could to please Democrats and \nRepublicans. So that is why the majority leader and I join in the \nrequest that has just been granted regarding Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, within several minutes, we will start 20 \nminutes of debate on CAFTA, equally divided. We will have a rollcall \nvote. We will go to energy after that. We will complete debate on \nenergy tonight. We will not have a further rollcall vote tonight after \nthe CAFTA vote.\n  We will begin--and we will announce the time a little bit later as to \nthe two votes on energy tomorrow, one on the point of order and one on \nthe bill. Following that, we will be going to the amendments that have \nbeen outlined with the time agreements on guns. The highway bill we \nwill expect at some point. I don't know when the House will finish with \nthat, but we will deal appropriately with that after it arrives. Since \nenergy arrived, we are going to energy first. That is the general \noutline. We have the unanimous consent agreements. I would recommend \nvery soon we go to the CAFTA bill.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic \ntime be allocated as follows: Senator Schumer, 10 minutes; Senator \nKerry, 30 minutes; Senator Wyden, 15 minutes; Senator Bingaman, 20 \nminutes; and whatever time is left over will be allocated to Senator \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my leader for yielding.\n  So the two votes required on the energy conference report will occur \nafter the leader's time tomorrow morning in morning business. \nApproximately at what time would those votes occur?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, in response, let me work \nout with the Democratic leader what time those votes will be.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am assuming, then, immediately following \nthose votes, we would be back on the gun liability bill, to complete \nthe work under the UC of that legislation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, or we could even be before. We could \nactually come on those amendments before as well.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So that is yet to be determined?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. We will determine that before we close \ndown tonight.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the leader.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of my \nconstituents to oppose the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. \nIt should be called the Special Interest Protection Act because it puts \none industry's bottomline ahead of the families and victims of gun \nviolence. It also slams closed the courthouse door to those seeking \njustice for victims of gun violence.\n  Remember when--not to long ago--the citizens of Maryland, Virginia \nand the District of Columbia were terrorized by a sniper. Remember when \n10 innocent people were killed while they were going about their daily \nroutines, mowing the lawn or getting gas, shopping, and getting ready \nto drive a bus. Their families have experienced tremendous loss and the \nNation mourned with them.\n  Now, Congress is considering legislation that inflict further pain on \nfamilies like those of the sniper victims. This legislation will \nliterally slam the courthouse door on the families of gun violence \nvictims and on all Americans who believe they were harmed by negligent \nactions related to guns. It gives gun dealers and manufacturers a free \npass. And it will prevent families and survivors from holding \nirresponsible gun stores accountable, if they are negligent. It \nactually would prohibit families from going to court, from letting a \njury of their peers decide if the gun store or manufacturer was \nnegligent.\n  If this legislation passes you could still go to court over a toy gun \nbut not a real gun. That is wrong.\n  Let me tell you about one of these families who have been victimized \nby gun violence. Conrad Johnson was the sniper's last victim. Do you \nremember hearing the news that he was shot at a bus stop in Montgomery \nCounty? Killed by the sniper getting ready for his route.\n  He was beloved by his family, friends and community. Two thousand \npeople attended his funeral.\n  He worked hard as a bus driver. He drove 35 miles before dawn every \nday for work. He was known for his friendly smile and can-do attitude.\n  And he loved his family--his Jamaican immigrant parents, his wife \nDenise--his high school sweetheart, his two sons and his big extended \nfamily. Over 30 members gathered at the hospital after he was shot. He \nwas full of life. He was always finding ways to take care of his family \nand help his community. He was a volunteer coach for the boys and girls \nclubs of Fort Washington. He loved being a DJ for functions thrown by \nfamily and friends, and he was always washing the family car on the \nweekends.\n  Conrad Johnson was the snipers last victim. Conrad's family is one of \nmany\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nMaryland families still grieving because of the snipers' reign of \nterror. Five Maryland families lost loved ones in the sniper's first 24 \nhours.\n  Today, I stand here for the rights of families like those of the \nsniper victims to have their day in court, the rights of families like \nJames Martin's. James was shot when he stopped to buy groceries for his \nchurch program. Or James ``Sonny'' Buchanan's family. Sonny, a \nlandscape architect, who was engaged to be married, was shot with one \nbullet as he worked early one morning. Or the wife, son, and daughter \nof Premkumar Walekar. He was a taxicab driver, shot that same morning \nas he went about his normal fill up routine at a local gas station on \nAspen Hill Road. Or the husband and 7 year old son of Sarah Ramos, who \nwas shot just 25 minutes later, as she sat on a bench waiting for a \nride to her babysitting job. And the family of Lori Ann Lewis Ramos, \nshot just a short time later, as she stopped at a gas station to clean \nher car.\n  Today, I also stand here to protect all the victims who were and are \nseverely injured by gun violence. They also deserve their day in court. \nThere is the young boy who was a victim of the DC area sniper--Iran \nBrown, who was shot in the chest as he was dropped off at Benjamin \nTasker Middle School in Bowie, Iran spent over a month in intensive \ncare because of the gunshot to his chest or Rupinder ``Benny'' Oberoi, \na young man who was shot in the back as he closed the store he worked \nat for the night. Benny needed 26 staples in his chest and extensive \nsurgery to repair the damage caused by the bullet that pierced his \nback.\n  These families have been through so much. They can never recover that \ntremendous loss. We owe it to them to make sure families all over \nAmerican who are like them can have their day in court.\n  That is why we need to oppose this legislation today.\n  Now, there has been a lot of talk about language was added to S. 397 \nto protect this case or that case. The U.S. Congress should not be in \nthe business of deciding which negligence actions should be allowed \ninto a court. That is up to the courts to decide. That is what our \ncivil justice system is all about. It gives these families the right to \noffer evidence to prove the gun shop was negligent.\n  We need to reject this legislation and protect that right.\n  We need to ensure that the families of victims and the victims \nthemselves, who have faced such unprecedented tragedy, are not \nvictimized again by having the courthouse doors slammed on them.\n  We stood with law enforcement during the dark and dangerous days of \nthe snipe; now today they stand with us. People feared for their lives. \nThanks to the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local \nlaw enforcement they found the snipers. Thanks to brilliant forensic \nwork they traced the weapon. This legislation makes a mockery of \neverything law enforcement tried to do.\n  If this legislation passes, irresponsible dealers get off scot-free \nand victims of gun violence are left without the protection of our \njustice system. I believe families of victims of gun violence deserve \ntheir day in court, like the sniper victims' families had--like Conrad \nJohnson's family, and Sarah Ramos' family, and all the families.\n  They may not win their case, but they have the right to make their \ncase. The courts should decide based on the facts and the evidence.\n  Let me be clear, I do not believe Congress should stand in the way by \noffering special protection, by offering blanket protections for the \nnegligent actions of the gun dealers, sellers and manufacturers. It is \nmy duty to my constituents to fight with them and to fight against \npassage of this bill. It would be irresponsible for the Congress not to \nallow these victims of terror to seek redress in the courts. Gun \nviolence terrorizes our citizens and we owe them nothing less.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to express my support of S. 397, \nthe Protection of Lawful Commerce Act introduced my colleague Senator \nCraig of Idaho.\n  The number of frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers has \nsignificantly increased in recent years. Since 1998, dozens of \nmunicipalities and cities have filed suit against America's firearm \nindustry, falsely alleging that manufacturers are responsible for the \nunforeseen acts of criminals. Firearms manufacturers have already spent \nmore than $200 million in legal fees yet have not been found liable by \na single court for the criminal misuse of their highly regulated \nproducts. Unfortunately, these lawsuits appear to be designed to impose \na political agenda that 33 State legislatures have already rejected. \nLawsuits against manufacturers who have nothing to do with the crime at \nhand thwart the will of the people by bypassing their elected \nrepresentatives and attempting to impose novel legal theories by \njudicial fiat. Worse, these suits--even while unsuccessful--drain \nsignificant resources from these companies that are the backbone of \nsupplying our military and police officers with the weapons to protect \nthemselves on the job. We cannot allow this trend to continue.\n  S. 397 is a narrowly crafted bill that stops the lawsuit abuse, while \ncontinuing to hold those individuals and companies that knowingly \nviolate the law liable for their actions. Specifically, the bill \nprovides that lawsuits may not be brought against manufacturers and \nsellers of firearms or ammunition if the suits are based on criminal or \nunlawful use of the product by a third party. This bill provides \ncarefully tailored protections that continue to allow legitimate suits \nbased on knowing violations of Federal or State law related to gun \nsales, or on traditional grounds including negligent entrustment, such \nas sales to a child or an obviously intoxicated person or breach of \ncontract. The bill also allows product liability cases involving actual \ninjuries caused by an improperly functioning firearm, as opposed to \ncases of intentional misuse.\n  Many of my constituents have raised concerns about frivolous lawsuits \nin the gun industry. Pennsylvania leads the Nation in the number of \nlicensed deer hunters and ranks among the leaders in firearm hunters. \nThere are nearly three million hunting licenses sold in Pennsylvania \neach year. Over one million hunters go out in the field each fall. \nThese suits, by threatening the survival of firearms makers, threaten \nto end that outdoor tradition and the family time that often \naccompanies it.\n  The hard-working men and women in Pennsylvania who make up our labor \nunions also support S. 397. This should be no surprise, however, as \nworking men and women recognize a threat to their jobs and their way of \nlife when they see one. The numbers are telling. Pennsylvania has 227 \ncompanies involved in firearms manufacture. There are over 3,000 \nfederally licensed firearms dealers. According to the National Shooting \nSports Foundation, there are approximately 34,000 jobs and $909 million \nin salaries and wages supported by those businesses and sportsmen in \nPennsylvania. Additionally, these Pennsylvania sportsmen spend about $2 \nbillion in the State, generating approximately $119 million in \nPennsylvania State tax revenue.\n  Many families' lives are negatively impacted by these reckless \nlawsuits. While many of the personal tragedies behind these lawsuits \nare horrific, the individual responsible is--as it has always been in \nour system of justice--the criminal not the lawfully operating company. \nIf a lawsuit is based on a defective firearm, a knowing violation of \nthe law or the breach of a contract, that suit should proceed--and S. \n397 would allow it to proceed. However, the frivolous suits with novel \nlegal theories and invented liability have already cost jobs, including \nhere in Pennsylvania, and they will cost more jobs if they continue. \nThey will force company closures and they will close family businesses. \nSuing law-abiding gun makers and dealers for the acts of criminals is \nlike suing automobile makers for the damage caused by reckless drivers. \nIt is wrong and goes against the entrepreneurial and industrial spirit \nof this country.\n  I agree there is a need to reduce violent crime, and I share the \nconcerns of gun control advocates with the number and severity of \nviolent acts occurring within our Nation. During a June 13th field \nhearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in Philadelphia, we learned \nabout the many factors that contribute to the problem of youth violence \nincluding poverty, broken families, a\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nlack of mentors, and loose enforcement of current gun laws. I believe \nit is necessary to focus on the root causes of these problems rather \nthan develop a policy that appears helpful on the surface. I have \nworked and continue to work on the issues of poverty, broken families \nand mentoring, however I believe that greater enforcement of existing \ngun laws is a key part of the solution to eradicating gun violence.\n  The program ``Project Exile'' is an example of how stricter \nenforcement of current laws can make a difference. For this reason, I \nhave been involved in implementing Project Exile in Philadelphia. This \nprogram began in Richmond, VA, and has proven to be extremely \nsuccessful in reducing gun crime by simply enforcing existing Federal \ngun laws. The program adopts a zero-tolerance policy for Federal gun \ncrimes. Federal, State and local law enforcement and prosecutors work \nhand-in-hand to expedite prosecution of each and every Federal firearms \nviolation under Project Exile. Thanks to Project Safe Neighborhoods and \nProject Exile, Federal prosecutions of firearms offenses have gone up \n91 percent since 2000. Nationally, those prosecutions have jumped 76 \npercent in the same time period. That means that more criminals are \nserving hard time for breaking Federal gun laws. More criminals off the \nstreet means our citizens are safer. That is a much more effective way \nto fight crime than punishing innocent manufacturers through frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. 397. Doing so will help an \nindustry that is being unfairly targeted for violent crimes, and allow \nus to continue to focus on the real causes of violent crimes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 397, the \nprotection of lawful commerce in arms bill, also known as the gun \nliability immunity bill. Regardless of whether you support this bill or \noppose this bill, I can certainly understand that the issue of gun \nliability is an important one.\n  But let me ask my colleagues: Is this really more important than all \nthe other important issues before the Senate right now? With only a few \ndays left before the August recess, is giving liability protection to \ngun manufacturers really more important than passing the Department of \nDefense authorization bill during a time of war? Even this bill's most \nvocal supporters could not make this argument with a straight face.\n  As I travel around my State of Illinois talking to constituents, I \nhear many concerns from them. They tell me about the lack of affordable \nhealth care, the quality of our Nation's schools, the rising cost of \ngasoline, and the war in Iraq. Parents worry about how the budget \ndeficit will affect their children's future. Veterans complain about \nthe long delays in applying for and receiving disability benefits and \nabout the amount of those benefits.\n  My constituents have no shortage of suggestions and ideas for what \nCongress should be doing, but I can honestly say that none of them are \nsaying, ``Senator, please go back to Washington and make sure that gun \ncompanies aren't being sued by victims of gun violence.'' I haven't \nheard that one yet.\n  And that is why I have chosen to speak on the floor today to--\nhighlight the misplaced priorities of the Senate's leadership. Even \nthough we have 139,000 troops fighting for our freedom in Iraq and a \n$440 billion Defense bill that could help these troops, we are here \ndebating gun liability instead of talking about how to strengthen our \nnational defense.\n  That is regrettable, and that is one of the reasons why so many \nAmericans are disillusioned with their Government. Because we are not \nfocusing on the problems that truly matter to them. Because some are \nmore interested in scoring political points, or catering to a special \ninterest.\n  I believe--as do my Democratic colleagues--that the first priority of \nthe Senate should be to provide for our men and women who are in harm's \nway. And that means spending the necessary time to debate the Defense \nbill. If that takes us the rest of the week--or even next week--then \nthat is what we should do.\n  How can we go home to our constituents in August and tell them that \nwe left Washington, DC without finishing a bill to help our military \nbecause we spent too much time protecting gun manufacturers? That is \nshameful.\n  I have talked to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and many \nof them were planning to offer good, commonsense, bipartisan amendments \nto the DOD bill--amendments that would have helped our military and \nstrengthened our national defense. I also have filed several amendments \nthat I would have offered, and I believe that many of my colleagues \nwould have supported them as well.\n  One of my amendments would have protected members of the National \nGuard and Reserve against employment discrimination. This amendment is \nsupported by the Reserve Officers Association and is cosponsored by \nSenator Salazar.\n  I have heard that there have been instances where prospective \nemployers are reluctant to hire guard and reservists because of fears \nthat these employees could be called up for extended tours of duty. \nThese citizen-soldiers are getting through initial stages of interviews \nonly to be summarily dropped from the process upon disclosing the fact \nthat they are members of the Guard and Reserve.\n  My amendment would have gotten to the heart of this problem by \npreventing employers from forcing members of the Guard and Reserve to \ndisclose their military service during the interview process. However, \nmy amendment would not have prohibited them from disclosing their \nmilitary status if they thought it would be beneficial during an \ninterview process.\n  But instead of helping members of the Guard and Reserve, we are \ntalking about gun manufacturer liability. That is wrong.\n  Another amendment I would have offered relates to the medical records \nof our servicemembers.\n  For years, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs have attempted to modernize their medical records to create a \ntwo-way exchange of patient health data to better care for our Nation's \nservice members. This would decrease costs and improve the flow of \ninformation when active members of the military leave the DOD system \nand move to the VA system. Greater use of technology would also reduce \nmedical errors, which kill up to 98,000 people a year.\n  Unfortunately, the DOD has not managed to create a fully functional \nelectronic medical records system. Last year, a GAO report found that \none of the primary reasons for the delay in developing this system is \nthe lack of congressional oversight.\n  My amendment would have helped provide some of that oversight. I \nwanted to get some answers from DOD on why this project is being \ndelayed and how the Department is proceeding with this important \nproject.\n  But debate over these amendments, and many others, is being silenced \nin favor of the one we are having now--about helping gun manufacturers.\n  This is why the American people are tired of what goes on in this \ntown. Because there are real issues they sent us here to debate--real \nproblems they expect us to solve. But even when we have a chance to do \nthis--even when we have a defense bill where we could add amendments \nthat could help our troops and care for our veterans--the Senate passes \non that chance and heads directly into another fight singed with more \npolitics and more ideology.\n  We can do better than that. We owe ourselves better--and we certainly \nowe the American people better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Army Times, criticizing \nthe Senate leadership's decision to stop consideration of the DOD bill, \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Army Times, July 26, 2005]\n\n                  Senate Delays Action on Defense Bill\n\n                             (By Rick Maze)\n\n       Senate Republican leaders decided Tuesday that a gun \n     manufacturers' liability bill is more important than next \n     year's $441.6 billion defense authorization bill.\n       With Democrats expressing amazement that there could be any \n     higher legislative priority in a time of war than the annual \n     defense bill that includes money for pay and benefits, \n     operations and maintenance, and weapons' purchases and \n     research, Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate Republican \n     leader, decided Tuesday that a bill protecting gun \n     manufacturers from lawsuits\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n     over the illegal use of firearms was a higher priority.\n       The decision came after Republican leaders failed to muster \n     the 60 votes needed to prevent amendments not strictly \n     related to the defense budget from being offered to the \n     defense bill.\n       In a count of 50-48, seven Republicans joined Democrats in \n     voting not to restrict debate, a move that Democratic leaders \n     said would have prevented consideration of amendments to help \n     veterans and survivors of deceased service members, along \n     with other issues.\n       With Congress planning to leave town Friday for one-month \n     break, debate on S. 397, Protection of Lawful Commerce in \n     Arms Act, is expected to last two or three days, and then \n     Senate leaders plan to take up an energy bill, an estate tax \n     reform bill and an Interior Department funding bill that has \n     a $1.5 billion bailout attached for veterans' health care \n     programs, leaving no time until September to get back to the \n     defense bill.\n       The House approved its version of the defense bill in May \n     and has been waiting for the Senate to catch up to begin \n     negotiations with the Bush administration on a final version.\n       Delay in the Senate is partly a result of senators spending \n     three weeks this spring debating federal judicial nominations \n     before reaching a compromise on President Bush's nominees.\n       It all points toward a difficult autumn. When the Senate \n     returns in September from its month-long summer recess, it \n     will need to consider recommendations of the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Commission, due to finish its work by \n     Sept. 8, and begin deliberations on the nomination of John \n     Roberts to the Supreme Court vacancy left by retiring Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JULY 29, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m. on Friday, \nJuly 29; I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the \nmorning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved \nto date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2361, the Interior appropriations bill, as under the previous order. I \nfurther ask that following the use or yielding back of the time on the \nInterior conference report, it be temporarily set aside and the Senate \nproceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2985, the \nLegislative Branch appropriations bill, as under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then \nresume consideration of the Energy conference report and there be 30 \nminutes equally divided for closing remarks between the chairman and \nranking member or their designees with all of the provisions of the \nprevious consent remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9249-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

As my colleagues can see, we will have a very busy day \ntomorrow with rollcall votes throughout. We should be able to complete \nour business tomorrow. I expect that we will. Again, it will be a very \nbusy day.

Mr. President, we will be closing tomorrow afternoon, \nhopefully not too late in the afternoon. This has been a very \nproductive several months. If you look back and reflect upon the issues \nthat have been discussed and the bills that have been passed, there \nhave been many. We are governing in a way that meets the expectations \nof the American people, governing with meaningful solutions to their \neveryday problems. We passed a budget which was the fifth fastest in \nhistory. We passed a bankruptcy bill, a class action reform bill to rid \nfrivilous lawsuits. We had six circuit court nominations, judges that \nhad been either filibustered or threatened to be filibustered in the \npast. Now we will continue all of that work tomorrow with an Energy \nbill, a highway bill, a gun liability bill, a legislative conference \nreport, and the Interior conference report. So it has been a very \nproductive Congress and one that we will continue to work very \naggressively on as we come back after the recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9249-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CONDITIONAL \n                  RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3045) to implement the Dominican Republic-\n     Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes evenly divided. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, is one more failed chapter in a book of trade failures. How \ndeeper must the hole get before we understand we are in trouble? How \nmany more Americans must lose their jobs, with manufacturing, \nengineering and, yes, more white-collar jobs going overseas, \noutsourced, before we understand we are in trouble?\n  We have the largest trade deficit in the history of this country, $2 \nbillion a day every day, 7 days a week. This is unsustainable. \nEverybody in this room knows it.\n  When will we understand that the next trade agreement is one in which \nwe ought to stand up for the economic interests of our country, stand \nup for the interests of American workers? Let's not be ashamed of \nbelieving that our interest is in this country's economic opportunity, \nsupporting our workers, our manufacturers, our farmers. This trade \nagreement pulls the rug out from under our sugar beet growers, from \nunder our farmers, pulls the rug out from under American workers one \nmore time.\n  The House passed this bill by two votes last night. There is a 15-\nminute vote in the House. This one lasted well over an hour, while they \nwere trying to get the rest of the votes. Let me describe what they had \nto do to get the votes, because this trade agreement is awful. It is \nbad for the country. It is going to pile debt on top of debt and make \nmore American jobs disappear overseas. Here is what they said, from \ntoday's paper: The last-minute negotiations for Republican votes \nresembled the wheeling and dealing on a car lot. Republicans who were \nopposed or undecided were courted during hurried meetings in Capitol \nhallways, on the House floor, and at the White House. GOP leaders told \ntheir rank and file that if they wanted anything, now was the time to \nask, lawmakers said, and members took advantage of the opportunity by \nrequesting fundraising appearances by Cheney and the restoration of the \nmoney for their programs. Lawmakers said many of the favors bestowed in \nexchange for votes will be tucked into the huge energy and highway \nbills Congress is scheduled to pass this week before leaving for the \nAugust recess.\n  Why do my colleagues think it was necessary to do what they did last \nnight in the House to try to buy these votes with side deals and \nspecial deals and keeping the vote open for over an hour? Because this \nis a terrible agreement, and everybody knows it. When will we have the \nbackbone to stand up for this country's economic interests? What will \nit take? How many more bad trade agreements? This isn't rocket science. \nThis is our trade deficit. Year after year after year we are drowning \nin trade debt, and there is not one person on the floor of the Senate \nwho wears a blue suit who is going to lose their job because of a bad \ntrade agreement. It is working folks who lose their jobs, who find out \ntheir job left for China because they were making $11 an hour and the \ncompany can hire somebody for 30 cents an hour and work them 15 hours a \nday, 7 days a week. So the American people lose their jobs.\n  No politicians are going to lose their jobs. That is why they keep \nwriting bad trade agreements. That is why the country is deeper in \ndebt, the largest trade deficit in the history of this country. NAFTA, \nCAFTA, ``SHAFTA,'' GATT, you name it. With every single step we have \ntaken with this trade strategy, the country has gone deeper into debt, \nand more Americans have found their jobs in peril. When, oh when, will \nit stop? Apparently not tonight.\n  Last night they bought CAFTA by two votes in the House. It passed by \na slim margin in the Senate. But what this demonstrates to me is this \nCongress has not yet awakened to the reality of what it is doing to \nthis country. Kids and grandkids wondering about their economic future \nwill find they have less opportunity than their parents did. The one \nthing we all aspire to have happen always is that we want things better \nfor our kids. We want to leave a place that is better for our children. \nThat is not going to happen with these kinds of trade agreements in \nwhich we trade away American jobs, in which we decide that jobs that \nused to be performed by proud Americans to build products in this \ncountry are gone.\n  There is no social program in this Congress we deal with that is as \nimportant as a good job that pays well, with good benefits. That is the \nway people are able to take care of their families and pursue a career \nand have the opportunity to expand this great country of ours. Yes, we \nlive in a global economy, we are told. It is a global economy, all \nright. The global economy has galloped along for the major corporations \nso they can produce where it is cheap and sell into this marketplace. \nBut it is unsustainable. This won't last. The global economy has \ngalloped along but without rules.\n  Now a corporation can decide to do business through a mailbox in the \nBahamas. It can decide it wants to produce in China or Indonesia or Sri \nLanka and hire people for 20 cents an hour and force them to work in \nunsafe plants. They can hire 12-year-olds to\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\nwork 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. All of that is just \nfine with this trade strategy.\n\n  It is not fine with this Senator. It is not fine at all. Because I \nunderstand where it takes this country. We will not long remain a world \neconomic power without a first-class manufacturing capability. And our \nmanufacturing base is shrinking dramatically. Why? Because major \ncorporations have decided they don't want to produce here. Is it \nbecause our workers don't do well? Not at all. That is not what it is \nabout. It is about corporate profits by hiring people to work for 30 \ncents an hour and then selling the product at 30-cents labor to the \ngrocery stores or on the store shelves of Toledo and Fargo and \nBrainard, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, New York.\n  I am telling my colleagues, this will not work much longer. Yet this \nCongress acts completely deaf and blind to the realities of what has \ncome from our recent trade agreements. The North American Free Trade \nAgreement was one of the last agreements. We had all these economists \ntell us how many jobs it was going to create in our country. The fact \nis, our country has lost massive numbers of jobs as a result of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. That bad agreement turned a modest \ntrade surplus with Mexico into a huge deficit, and turned a modest \ndeficit with Canada into an even larger deficit. Yet people still say \nthat agreement worked. That is total rubbish.\n  I hope the Senate will turn down this agreement. I know they have \nvoted for it once before, but now is the time to have some backbone, \nsome nerve, some will to turn down this bad trade agreement.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the past two decades, Congress has \nvoted again and again to open markets to exports from Central America. \nIn 1983, 392 Members of the House and 90 Members of the Senate voted \nunilaterally to reduce tariffs on exports from Central America and the \nCaribbean. In 2000, 309 Members of the House and 77 Senators voted in \nfavor of the Trade and Development Act which further unilaterally \nopened our markets to products from Central America and the Caribbean.\n  Today most imports from the region enter our market duty-free. In \ncontrast--and the purpose of this legislation--our exports have faced \nand continue to face a myriad of tariffs and nontariff trade barriers \ninto that region. Our products going that way, having tariffs and \nnontariff trade barriers, products coming this way to our country, no \nbarriers. That is the status quo.\n  In 2005, with the Central American Free Trade Agreement, Congress has \nthe opportunity to reduce tariff barriers to our exports going to these \ncountries. You can see it is a very unfair situation. If we maintain \nthe status quo, it is unfair to American workers, American \nmanufacturers, the economy of America, because their imports come into \nour country duty-free. Meanwhile, our exports that go to those \ncountries face tariff barriers of from 3 to 16 percent, some tariffs \nranging as high as even 150 percent.\n  This agreement, finally, after about 20 years of our doing favors in \nthat direction, levels the playing field for American workers, American \nfarmers, and American manufacturers so we can sell our products in \nthese countries.\n  This agreement takes a one-way street of trade and makes it a two-way \nstreet. It tears down unfair barriers to our agricultural exports and \ngives our farmers a chance to compete in a growing and vibrant market \nof over 40 million consumers.\n  A vote against CAFTA is a vote for the status quo. It is a vote to \nkeep import duties duty free, but it also keeps tariff barriers to our \nexport products high. If you vote that way, you are not voting for the \nAmerican worker, you are not voting for the American farmer, you are \nnot voting for the American manufacturer. You are voting for the status \nquo.\n  Well, that status quo is that the United States has been giving and \ngiving for 20 years. This is our opportunity to get, to benefit our \nworkers, to have a level playing field for trade--a two-way street for \ntrade.\n  I don't see how anybody can justify not leveling the playing field \nfor American exporters. That would end up creating jobs here in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreements ignores American workers, and ignores Central American \nworkers, too. It ignores the labor injustices that still exist in those \ncountries and it turns its back on American workers who continue to \nstruggle to keep their jobs.\n  It did not have to be this way. We know how to negotiate free trade \nagreements to improve conditions for workers in other nations and level \nthe playing field for American workers. We have done it before and we \ncan do it again.\n  These Central American nations are important neighbors and partners \nto the United States. I have long supported their efforts towards \nprogress since President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress. Continuing in \nthat tradition, we owe it to our friends in Central America to ensure \nthat proper labor protections are included and enforced.\n  The President abused his power and presented Congress and the \nAmerican people with this take-it-or-leave-it plan, ignoring a strong \nbipartisan recommendation to assist displaced American workers. \nCongress had the opportunity to ask the President to meet that \nresponsibility. Instead, partisan back room deals were made and the \nRepublican Congress approved the agreement by a narrow majority in the \nSenate and a razor-thin majority in the House.\n  This Central American agreement is not free trade. It does not create \na fair playing field for American workers. It fails to address the \nissues that we hear time and again are so important to them, and it \ndoes not deserve to pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Chairman \nGrassley for the fine work he has done on a very difficult issue. I \nwill start from a different perspective than others might have \nconcerning this agreement.\n  First of all, I have been leading the opposition to almost every \nmultinational agreement that has come along. I have stood on the floor \nof the Senate for probably, collectively, 6 or 8 hours talking about \nhow destructive the Kyoto agreement would be should we be a party to \nit. I have talked about the Law of the Sea Treaty. It was passed out of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee unanimously and was ready for action \nwhen we found out what it was. I led the opposition, and we have not \npassed it yet. We would be losing our sovereignty to the U.N. on a lot \nof the areas of the sea and the air above it. This is something I have \nbeen active in for a long time.\n  In 1994, I had a very interesting experience. I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I led the opposition to NAFTA at that time. Then I was \nelected to the Senate in a special election, and it came up in the \nSenate, and I led the opposition to NAFTA at that time. In Oklahoma, my \nState, I was the only Member of the House or Senate who opposed NAFTA.\n  I am here to say that this is not NAFTA. For those who use the \nargument that NAFTA was wrong and NAFTA should not have worked and, \ntherefore, CAFTA is no good, they just don't know what they are talking \nabout. CAFTA is totally different. I can recall standing on the Senate \nfloor from this very desk saying if we support NAFTA and adopt it, we \nwould have problems--transportation problems--where we would be \nallowing Mexican truckers to pick up a load in Brownsville, TX, and \ntake it to Oklahoma City and not comply with our wage-an-hour \nrequirements and environmental requirements, and all these things \nhappened; they came true.\n  That is not what CAFTA is. We have two reasons we need to support \nCAFTA. One is what the Senator from Iowa talked about--the tariffs. I \ntalked to my farmers, the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, and the Farmers Union, \nand showed them the tariffs they are paying right now, and what the \nother side is paying, and this is a win-win situation for our farmers. \nFor example, for grains, we pay 10.6 percent; they pay nothing today; \nfor vegetables, we pay 16.7 percent, they pay nothing; for wood \nproducts, we pay 10 percent, they\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\npay nothing. There is a long list--I can go on and on--of commodities \nand products where we are penalized and they are not.\n  Under this bill, we will level that playing field and allow farmers \nin Oklahoma to be on the same level as those other countries. The other \nreason--and I think this is very important--is the national security \nreason. I am ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. I can \nremember the days in Central America when President Reagan was our \nPresident, and then the first President Bush, when we gave freedoms and \ndemocracies to all those countries down in Central America.\n  We remember Daniel Ortega and the activities of the Sandinistas. \nRight now, we are in a position where we can either punish or reward \nour friends. These countries with whom we will be in an alliance are \nour friends. They are supporting us in Iraq and supporting us in \neverything we do. Those other countries are not supporting us. The \nChavezes, the Ortegas, and the Castros are the ones starting to emerge \nagain. Can you imagine, after what we went through with the Sandinistas \nin the 1980s, and we have Ortega running for President again? I am not \nabout to reward him and give him what he wants, keeping us from having \nthat trade.\n  If you want to know the kinds of people who are opposing CAFTA, I \nwill read you a few: Earth Justice, Friends of the Earth, \nEnviroCitizen, Freedom Socialist Party, and the Social Welfare Action \nAlliance, and others like that.\n  The conservative groups supporting CAFTA are the American \nConservative Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the Heritage Foundation, \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, Club for Growth, and it goes on and \non.\n  This is an issue where we are on the right side not just for our \nfarmers and for national security and our friends in Central America \nand South America, but also it is right for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired but 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 3045) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the conference report on H.R. 6, which the clerk will please \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to bill (H.R. 6), \n     to ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and \n     reliable energy, have met, have agreed that the House recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of July 27, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 3 hours of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is obvious that I am two things \ntonight. First, I am very happy and I am very tired. I do not know \nwhich one I am more of, but I am both. I am sure there are many who \nthink differently than I. I hope in the Senate there is an overwhelming \nnumber who think as I do. There will be some who do not. But after 6 \nyears of effort in the Senate, and for a time period going back about \n15 years, we have not had an energy policy program of any significance \nfor the United States of America. When I say 6 years, we have been \nstruggling for 6 years to get a current one, and 4 of those years we \nhave produced them and they have failed. I have not been part of all of \nthat, but I left the Budget Committee, the Senate might recall, after \nmany years, with 2 years remaining to be there. That would have made my \n30th year on the Budget Committee, and I still would have been \nchairman. I left it because this would be a nice challenge, and I \nthought maybe during the 6 years, as chairman of this committee, I \nmight be party to putting together a bill that might do something about \nAmerica's energy future.\n  Everybody should know that the Senator from New Mexico knew that we \nwould not do anything for tomorrow, nothing much. We would not have any \nanswers for people who said, what are you going to do tomorrow morning \nor next week on the gasoline prices? But I did know that we had a \nchance of doing something that we could come to the floor and say \nwithin 5 to 10 years this bill will create jobs, job security, and \nclean energy.\n  Now, if that can be done in the complicated maze that we call the \nenergy policy of the United States--and let me repeat, the reason that \nwe can say to Americans that they have more jobs, they will have job \nsecurity and have cleaner energy being produced, I almost asked, and I \nwill, who could ask for anything more? I think that is a song or \nsomething, but who could ask for anything more?\n  So I start by saying I was very lucky today. I got a call from a \nreporter for the Albuquerque Tribune. I do not know him very well, but \nI speak to him occasionally, and I say to my friend from Tennessee, he \nasked me a neat question. He asked: Senator, people are talking about \nand maybe nitpicking this bill, and I want to ask you, what do you \nthink things will look like in America with reference to energy 5 to 10 \nyears from now?\n  That was a terrific question because it permitted me to open my \nremarks tonight the way I should have over the last couple of months. \nFor once, the Congress is going to do something important from which we \nas a Nation will benefit, not tomorrow but in the next 5 to 10 years. \nCertainly, we will begin to feel it in a big way within the next 5 to \n10 years. One might say therefore that we could have put most of it \noff, and we probably would have eked along and would have had some \ndifficult times, but we could have said, it will work out. But what we \nhave done is to make sure that where we have the power, we have done \nsomething to make it better.\n  I repeat, energy is the reason we have jobs. Energy is the reason we \nhave warm homes, electricity, automobiles, everything we look at, \nhumankind-made movement and activity, based on energy use.\n  That means it is pretty important that we do it somewhat right. Some\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\nmay say it will all work out. This is a great, powerful nation, \neverybody will wiggle and do this and do that and it will come out. \nWell, believe me, after a year and a half of learning, I think it would \nhave been a real risk for America to say it will all work out.\n  What we have done is very complicated. It is a lot more than people \nspeaking about gasoline prices tomorrow morning. It is a lot more than \nthat.\n  So 5 to 10 years from now, we ought to look back and ask: Did this \nlegislation make a real difference?\n  I am going to start by saying something nobody cares about when they \nlobby us, but I am going to say that we are going to use less energy \nper person, per adult, per unit of our economy, sometimes called GDP, \nbecause of the efficiency and conservation provisions here than we \nwould have without it. That means simple things, believe it or not, in \nan energy bill, such as the appliances in our kitchens, the motors used \nin manufacturing plants, the buildings we live in, and the houses we \nlive in will be far more efficient and use far less energy 5 to 10 \nyears from now than today. For everything we use less of, we need to \nburn less coal or produce less energy or electricity or import oil \nless.\n  More of our electricity will come from renewable energy in 5 to 10 \nyears, such as solar, biomass, wind, landfill gas, waste. All kinds of \nthings that can produce energy in that manner will be coming on board \nor be on board.\n  We have streamlined the tax provisions. The licensing processes for \nclean technologies like geothermal have been streamlined so we will get \nwhatever we have instead of letting it be tied up forever.\n  Then we are going to be making great strides toward reducing the \ncarbon intensity of our economy. It is the carbon intensity of our \neconomy that causes significant pollution, and for many it is a source \nof global warming.\n  My colleagues do not have to believe that to vote for this, but what \nI am saying is that for those who do--and I am one--this bill will move \nus forward so that 5 to 10 years from now we can be saying we may have \ntechnology that will go after that carbon. One will be new nuclear \npowerplants. I say to the Senator from Idaho, if a nuclear powerplant \ncannot be built in America after this bill is signed, then I think the \nSenator and I, who have been ardent, devoted fans, will say it cannot \nbe done. I think the Senator will agree with that. Everything that can \nbe done reasonably will be there. The uncertainties will be eliminated. \nThat which frightens investors will be eliminated. The other things are \nall in place.\n  With reference to coal, we will have provided incentives and tax \nrelief so that new technology will be developed to take carbon out of \nthe coal that is burned and, yes, if we use the outside of my years, in \n10 years we may, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, have found a way \nto sequester the carbon and indeed be on the way to being able to use \nour biggest resource, to wit, coal, without atmospheric damage, global \ndamage, and with much cleaner effect. This bill might make that happen.\n  As I say, when people think of the Energy bill, they think of cars, \nautomobiles, but the electricity grid of the country--how many people \non our committee thought we were going to learn about the electricity \ngrid, such as when eastern America went black, but we found out. We \nhave a great electricity system.\n  When the blackout came, some people called this an ancient system. \nSome called it a one-horse system. No, it is the most refined. The \nproblem is that the system was not tied together properly, and it did \nnot have mandatory requirements for safety. So there were some good, \nsome not so good. That transmission grid will be far more reliable \nbecause we have put on the grid owners mandatory standards for \noperating that grid. So I would say you will not have one of those \nafter this bill gets implemented. That would have been good enough to \npass a bill, but that is just a little part of the bill--one or two \npages.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes. I ask \nSenator Bingaman, would that be all right?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is fine. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In addition, we will be building new transmission to \nmove electricity around the Nation. When I say ``we,'' don't think the \nGovernment is going to do it. We are just going to make sure we give \nthe incentive to get it done. Transmission to move electricity around \nthe Nation, where it is needed the most--that is going to make our \nconsumption more efficient.\n  This bill repeals an ancient law. Some people wonder why it even \nmentioned it because it has a funny name and they would say what in the \nworld does it have to do with energy, but it is called P-U-H-C-A, \nPUHCA. It is from the times when we had our Great Depression. It made \nit at least more difficult to get money invested in electricity and \nutility companies than it was in other enterprises. We have repealed \nthat. We have made some provisions that mergers will not be damaged. \nBut this should bring much more capital investment into the utility \ncompanies that make up this powerful institution, this entity called \nthe grid of the United States.\n  Most of us are aware of another thing, which the distinguished \nSenator, a new Member of the Senate and a new member of the committee, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, has put much in the public \neye when he introduced a bill about natural gas. One of our biggest \nproblems, and we surely ought to be as worried about it as we are about \nthe price of gasoline tomorrow, is our dependence upon imported natural \ngas. It is such a terrific product, from the standpoint of our ambient \nair, and it used to be so cheap, as everybody here knows. But what \nhappened is we used it for everything. Now, as we get in trouble with \nglobal warming, everybody who builds a plant uses natural gas. Not that \nit does not produce some carbon, but far less. And the price goes up.\n  So it looks as if America, which is paying the highest price of any \nindustrial nation in the world for natural gas, is about to put itself \nout of business. We could lose the fertilizer business, the plastics \nbusiness, many manufacturing companies. They are already going \noverseas. People will come up here and blame free-trade agreements, or \nlow pay overseas. That is not so. We do not have enough natural gas to \nkeep the price steady or bring it down. We must have liquefied natural \ngas from overseas. It is terrible to admit it. I wish I were here \nsaying we don't. We do. In the next 25 years we will have a crisis if \nthat doesn't occur.\n  We have modernized, streamlined, eliminated unnecessary delays in the \nports we will be bringing to America that will be the source of \ndistributing LNG. We have eliminated the unnecessary delays. That is \nterrifically important. Of the five most important things, one might \nsay that would be one of them because we might hit 8, 10, 12, 15--one \nstudy says 23--new ports will be needed to use LNG in inland America. \nIn other words, you locate them and then the gas can be put into \npipelines and delivered to America's users. We permitted that to be \ndone with more dispatch.\n  For the first time, and we know this, since Americans began a love \naffair with the car, we are going to put in place an ethanol program.\n  I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  People used to laugh at it. Let me put it this way. It is not too \nshabby, to put America's agricultural industry to work making fuel for \nvehicles. Some used to say that was foolish. It might have been when \ncrude oil was $5 a barrel, or $10. But it certainly is a good \ninvestment when crude oil is this expensive because all you are doing \nis trading the investment in ethanol--plants, cement, steel, thousands \nof jobs, agricultural revitalization--every dollar you put in that is a \ndollar you didn't give to the Saudi Arabians or you didn't give to \nthose who are selling us oil. You spent it here. We have a major new \nprogram, 7.5 million gallons mandated out here in the future. So that \nshould be very helpful, in terms of jobs and helping with our \nimportation.\n  We also gave significant credits for hybrid automobiles. I think we \nall know we had that. We doubled it. We know people want them now. But \nwe still put it in, the tax writers put it in, and we hope the \nmanufacturers will see the demand and get more on board quickly. We \nthink that was a contribution.\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\n  I think overall we are going to try to produce as much of our energy \ndomestically as possible. To do that we have streamlined the permitting \nprocesses where we can. For instance, the Senator from Colorado is on \nthe Senate floor, and the Senators from Utah have been interested--we \nhave a fantastic oil shale research and development program and provide \nleasing to see if we, one of these days, could implement the abundant \noil resources from oil shale. Nobody knows if we could ever work that \neconomically. If we could, we would not need any imported oil. We have \nmore oil locked up in oil shale than America would use over 200 years. \nWe just have to find a way to convert it. We are close. We are going to \npush that.\n\n  We are deeply divided on global climate change. We have had a couple \nof votes. I will not go through them. But the legislation we are doing, \nwhile it does not address a global warming tax, will do more to develop \nand deploy a new generation of clean technology that will make our \nconsumption cleaner and more environmentally friendly. If we ever do \nachieve a limit--say that, make the limit there--we may, indeed, have \nready the technologies that could do it. Right now we are just saying, \nDo it. That is why Senator Craig gets up and says, How? Right? I am \nspeaking for him--but how? Put everybody out of business?\n  No. New technology we are going to try to get developed will clean \nthe coal--take the carbon out of it, I should say. These are the kinds \nof things that are in this 1,200-page document.\n  I want to close. I am a pretty experienced fellow around here. I want \nto say that I have never worked in the process on a difficult bill \nwhere there has been more openness and inclusiveness in my 32 years. \nEvery step of this process this Senator has worked with the other \nSenator from New Mexico to ensure that we have a bipartisan bill.\n  That doesn't mean that Senator Bingaman likes every provision. It \ndoesn't mean that I like every provision. But nobody can say that \nanything was done in one closed back room, shoved down anybody's \nthroat, or done without staff, excellent staff, on both sides working \non it. I am thankful. Because of that, Senator Reid joined our leader \nand let us get this bill to the floor.\n  We took 2 weeks. Heretofore we took 6 weeks, and still had 200 \namendments left. We didn't get a bill, a real bill.\n  Believe it or not, Representatives Dingell and Barton met. Ourselves, \nwe spent 20-plus hours as a foursome. Then we had 3 days, 5 open days \nof conference meetings with amendments being offered. Every conferee \ncould offer amendments. They were voted on, some won, some lost--\nhonestly most lost, but that is the way it is. They voted.\n  The last of those conferences ended a couple of nights ago at 2:30 in \nthe morning. I probably was more tired then than now, obviously. Maybe \nnot as happy because I didn't know the product. But I think I know the \nproduct now. It is finished. It is a good product. It should pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  I urge Senators to consider that this bill, and the future that it \nenvisions, far outstrips anyone's individual parochial concern. I hate \nto say that because nobody is going to say that is why they vote \nagainst it. Nobody is going to say I didn't get some project or some \none theme. But I think if you are looking at what might be good down \nthe line--which maybe we ought to do more of--you ought to vote for \nthis.\n  One last comment. There will be a point of order made, and tonight I \nam going to say while everybody is around, or a few are: You heard a \nlot of numbers about what this bill costs. Please understand the point \nof order has to do with none of that. The point of order has to do with \na simple thing. This committee was given $2 billion to spend, in direct \nspending, nonappropriated money. When all the work was done we \nestimated it was $2.2 billion--two billion two hundred million--not \nbillion--$200 million. You know, the budget is hundreds of billions. \nThis is $200 million. I don't even know why a point of order should be \nmade.\n  I am going to cheat and tell you, sometimes when I was budget \nchairman we rounded numbers to 100. I am confessing that belatedly. \nMaybe we would have rounded this one to 200. Anyway, that is what we \nare going to vote on. I hope, even if you are against the bill, you \nwill let us vote whether or not the country should have this.\n  With that, I thank the Senate, thank the Chair, and most important, \nthank the Senators here. For the Republican Senators, as soon as \nSenator Bingaman is through I will start allocating on our side 5, 7 \nminutes, whatever you each would like. Senator Bingaman will use what \nhe wants and allocate the rest. He has one Senator. We will stay as \nlong as you like.\n  Thank you all for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say how pleased I am that we are \nable to bring back to the Senate a conference report on energy policy \nthat is truly a bipartisan consensus document. This bipartisan \nconsensus had its beginnings earlier this year in our committee, the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where the chairman, \nSenator Domenici, my colleague from New Mexico, reached out to those of \nus on the Democratic side and pledged to work in good faith to bring to \nthe Senate a comprehensive Energy bill.\n  We readily accepted that invitation and we had a very open and \nbipartisan committee process. The result of that process was a bill \nthat was recommended to the Senate by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources by a vote of 21 to 1. On the floor of the Senate when \nthis bill was first being considered, we continued to work together in \nthat open and bipartisan process. The result was that the Senate as a \nwhole passed the Energy bill by a margin of 85 to 12.\n  In conference, my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, was \nadamant that we use an open and a bipartisan process there as well, and \ninclude House Democratic Members and staff who had not been included in \nthe past in that same process.\n  I congratulate Senator Domenici on the passage of the resolution that \nwe adopted earlier this evening to designate this the Domenici Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. He successfully persuaded the chairman of our \nconference, Congressman Joe Barton, of the wisdom of proceeding in an \nopen and bipartisan manner, and it proved to work very well. The \nbipartisan and bicameral conference committee staff was able, in short \norder, to resolve many of the technical issues that are so important to \nget right in this complex area of legislation. As they encountered \nissues that were unresolvable by the staff and needed guidance from \nmembers, Chairmen Barton and Domenici and Ranking Member Dingell and I \nwere able to work together to forge compromises that we thought could \nbe recommended to the entire conference. Those compromises, in fact, \nwere embraced in almost all cases by our respective colleagues.\n  The result was a conference report that was signed by 13 of the 14 \nSenate conferees. That conference report is 1,724 pages in length. I do \nnot think you can judge the quality of legislation by the size of it, \nbut I do think the size of it indicates the comprehensiveness of this \nlegislation and the complexity of it. The conference report was adopted \nearlier today in the House of Representatives with 75 House Democrats \nvoting for the legislation, led by Congressman John Dingell.\n  Most of us came away from the conference with many provisions that we \nwere happy to have in the final conference report and some provisions \nthat we reluctantly had to give up on. I, for example, am very sorry \nthat the bill before us does not contain the renewable portfolio \nstandard which would require utilities to produce a percentage of their \nelectricity from renewable sources. I know Chairman Barton is \ndisappointed that he was not able to get a number of his priorities \nagreed to in the conference. But the nature of a good conference is \nthat it is a give and take and not everything ultimately can be agreed \nto. So compromise is the order of the day.\n  The result of this conference is a bill that has many more bright \nspots than flaws and a bill that deserves passage by the Senate and the \nsignature of the President. I will mention a number of the bright \nspots, and then I will acknowledge some of the flaws and gaps\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\nthat are contained in the conference report.\n  The conference report has strong provisions for increasing energy \nsupplies from a number of sources. As I have often said, increased \ndomestic energy production is one of the four key elements of sound \nenergy policy. We have good provisions for producing oil and gas in an \nenvironmentally responsible way, for unlocking the untapped energy \npotential on Indian lands, for relicensing of hydroelectric dams, for \nimproving geothermal leasing on Federal lands, and for opening a path \nto renewable resources in offshore environments. We are making a major \npush in the area of energy from coal toward new technologies that have \nbetter environmental characteristics and that will be adaptable to a \nfuture in which we may want to capture and sequester carbon dioxide.\n  The conference report has strong provisions for increasing energy \nefficiency. Over a dozen new appliance efficiency standards are called \nfor under this act. The Federal Government's own energy efficiency will \nbe enhanced through the strengthening of the Federal Energy Management \nProgram and through extension of authority to enter into energy-saving \nperformance contracts.\n  The conference report expands authorizations both for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program and weatherization and State energy \nprograms.\n  The conference report has perhaps some of the strongest provisions in \nthe area of protection of energy consumers. Both the electricity and \nnatural gas provisions of the conference report contain broad new \nprovisions to ensure market transparency and to prohibit market \nmanipulation. In the area of electric utility mergers, we have expanded \nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over \nmergers involving existing generation plants; that is, plants that are \nin existence at the time the merger takes place. We have also created \nnew requirements in the Federal Power Act for special scrutiny for \npossible cross subsidization as a result of mergers. Before the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission can approve a merger, it must find that \nany possible cross subsidization is actually consistent with the public \ninterest, which I think will prove to be both a flexible and a strong \nprotection for ratepayers and for workers and for other persons who \nshould be protected if we are being consistent with the public \ninterest.\n  The conference report authorizes a broad range of research and \ndevelopment and demonstration and deployment activities for new energy \ntechnologies that will help us toward our energy future. It couples \nthem with energy tax incentives and a comprehensive new approach to \nloan guarantees at the Department that will help these technologies \nover the final threshold into commercialization. This latter part of \nthe bill is a particular accomplishment of Chairman Domenici that I \nthink will pay off in this country for years to come.\n  The conference report also will result in major changes in our \nnational slate of transportation fuels. It requires that we reach a \ntarget of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. It sets a \npath forward for the development and commercial introduction of ethanol \nmade from cellulosic biomass which promises to have a profound impact \non our ability to manufacture and use renewable fuels in the future. \nOur work on fuels and fuel additives in this conference report is not \ncomplicated by the issue of developing safe harbors for product \nliability claims for any fuel additive, whether ethanol or MTBE. \nResolving this dispute involved including a provision that, when it \nfirst appeared in the publicly released base text of the conference \nreport, caused some confusion. I know that some Members may want to \naddress this issue in this debate. The best explanation, though, of the \nintent of this provision was given by Chairman Barton himself in the \ncourse of the final public meeting of the Energy bill conference Monday \nnight. He did it in the course of an exchange with Congressman Bart \nStupak of Michigan, who was about to offer a clarifying amendment to \nthis provision in the conference report. Based on the understanding \nconveyed in that exchange, Congressman Stupak decided that he did not \nneed to offer his intended amendment.\n  Since that exchange was crucial to how this provision was dealt with \nin conference, I ask unanimous consent that the transcript of that \nexchange be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there is much more that I could say on \nbehalf of the energy conference report that is before us, but I want to \nallow time for others to speak as well. It is worth acknowledging that \nin the process of conferencing with the House, we had to yield to their \nstrong demands and desires in a few areas. Some of those provisions, in \nmy view, were misguided. They include some weakening of environmental \nlaws and some additional subsidies to energy industries that are \nprobably unnecessary. I am sure that some of my colleagues will explore \nthose problems in more detail. But these flaws, serious as they are, do \nnot, in my opinion, lead to a conclusion that this bill should not be \nenacted. On balance, this is a good bill for the country and the best \nEnergy bill this Congress is going to produce. We should enact it into \nlaw.\n  To the extent that there are gaps in the bill, that there are \nsubjects that we should have covered and have not adequately covered, \nwe need to look to the future. It has taken Congress over 4 years to \ncraft this Energy bill. The Energy bill prior to that was the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992, passed 13 years ago. When we complete this bill, I \ndon't believe we have the luxury of waiting another 13 years to pass \nthe next Energy bill. The energy security needs of this country that \nare not addressed in this bill will not wait for another decade for \nattention. The threats posed by our dependence on oil imports or by \nglobal warming will continue to face us and will continue to grow as \nissues. This bill does maintain and increase our investment on a range \nof clean energy sources, but it does not contain a critical mechanism \nthat was contained in the Senate Energy bill; that is, the renewable \nportfolio standard that I referred to earlier.\n  This bill has positive and helpful measures to increase domestic \nrefining, but consumers will still face burdens at the gas pump. There \nis critical work to be done on these issues, but I believe the positive \nmessage coming out of this bill is that we have developed a truly \nbipartisan way to move forward on those issues in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. I think that I speak both for myself and for \nmy colleague who is chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources in saying that we intend to work together both in the short \nterm and in the long term to address the issues that need additional \nattention in this general legislation. He has my pledge to continue to \nwork in this Congress to advance the ball and to get to a finish line \non proposals that we could not achieve closure on in the context of \nthis bill.\n  Let me just mention three of those. First, flexible mandatory \nmeasures to address global warming. We had an excellent hearing which \nChairman Domenici chaired in the Energy Committee. In fact, during the \ntime that this bill was being considered in conference, time was taken \nout to have this hearing on the issue of global warming. I believe it \nwas a very useful hearing. Chairman Domenici stated that it was the \nfirst of several that we may be able to have to better understand that \nissue and see if a consensus can be reached on a path forward in \ndealing with it.\n  Second, doing more to tap the potential of renewable energy. Again, I \nbelieve that more can be done there, and I hope we can revisit that \nissue before this Congress adjourns.\n  Third, we need to continue to focus on oil savings. The United States \nimports more than 65 percent of our oil, and the Energy bill will not \nreduce those imports significantly. Reducing oil consumption will make \nus less dependent on foreign oil and ultimately save Americans money at \nthe gas pump. Although the oil savings approach that we took in the \nSenate bill did not win acceptance by the House of Representatives, \nthat is a concept that continues to hold promise as a way of addressing \nthe problem, and we need to\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\nrevisit that issue in legislation, in my view, as soon as we possibly \ncan.\n  We worked hard to create the Energy bill compromise before us today. \nWe should enact that compromise and move forward aggressively to ensure \nthat it is implemented rapidly by the executive branch of our \nGovernment. If there are negative consequences to what we have enacted, \nthen we can document those and work to correct those errors. If there \nare topics we need to address more effectively, then we certainly can \ndo that.\n  Again, I congratulate my friend and colleague on his accomplishment. \nBut securing our energy future in some sense is a job that is never \ndone. I look forward after we have had time to rest and reflect on what \nhas been done to again begin the effort to address policies that will \nincrease our energy security, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nprovide for more use of clean energy, lower gas prices, and deal with \nthe emissions that are leading to global warming.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague and all members of the conference \nand all Members of the Senate for the constructive approach they have \ntaken to the development of this legislation.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Chairman Barton. Are there other amendments from the House \n     conferees to Title XV? Mr. Stupak.\n       Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at \n     the desk, but if I may, before I offer it, I would like to \n     ask you, as chairman, a couple questions on Section 1504, if \n     I may?\n       Chairman Barton. The gentleman is recognized.\n       Mr. Stupak. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for \n     your willingness to come to a consensus on the MTBE. I know \n     it has been a difficult couple days, and I am trying to get \n     this thing resolved and I----\n       Chairman Barton. Well, I am not consenting, I am just \n     admitting that I don't have the votes in the Senate.\n       Mr. Stupak. Well, your willingness to work with the \n     conference committee.\n       Chairman Barton. I know when to fold them and this is one \n     time you got to fold them. So what was the question?\n       Mr. Stupak. Well, in light of that, Mr. Chairman, I just \n     want to be clear about one of the compromise provisions \n     that's been inserted into the amendment and this is Section \n     1504, called Claims Filed After Enactment. Can the chairman \n     clarify for us what this language means and is intended to \n     do, this Section 1504?\n       Chairman Barton. If you will suspend just briefly.\n       Mr. Stupak. Yes, sir.\n       Chairman Barton. The Section 1504 is a negotiated section \n     between the House and the Senate, that in lieu of the base \n     text language in the House bill on MTBE, we put in a section \n     that is permissive, that for prospective claims, defendants \n     may request that they be consolidated in a Federal court as \n     opposed to a State court. It is a permissive, not mandatory, \n     thing.\n       Mr. Stupak. So in that case, then it can remain in the \n     State courts. So this provision does not in any way give the \n     Federal courts a new subject jurisdiction over MTBE cases?\n       Chairman Barton. The base text that's before the conferees, \n     on existing MTBE lawsuits, changes nothing on prospective \n     MTBE lawsuits, that is, lawsuits that have not yet been \n     filed.\n       Mr. Stupak. Correct.\n       Chairman Barton. It gives the defendant in the lawsuit, the \n     prospective lawsuit, if it were to be filed, the right to \n     request that the lawsuit be sent to a Federal court.\n       Mr. Stupak. Or it could remain the State court if----\n       Chairman Barton. Well, it just gives them right to request \n     it. Now I am not an attorney, so I am not--but that's what \n     the section does.\n       Mr. Stupak. I just want to make sure that the Federal \n     courts don't have an exclusive right to try these cases and \n     it is my understanding they would not, based upon----\n       Chairman Barton. Well, of the existing cases that have \n     already been filed, they are in the hundreds, all but 12 are \n     in Federal court.\n       Mr. Stupak. Correct.\n       Chairman Barton. They are 12 that are in State court.\n       Mr. Stupak. So it is really----\n       Chairman Barton. I don't think this section is unduly \n     restrictive or adverse to the current situation.\n       Mr. Stupak. So Section 1504, then, is it fair to say, gives \n     those involved in future MTBE litigation or disputes, the \n     discretionary ability to remove their case to Federal court?\n       Chairman Barton. No, it gives them the right to request it.\n       Mr. Stupak. Okay.\n       Chairman Barton. That's all.\n       Mr. Stupak. Discretionary. They don't have to. It is within \n     their discretion to go to Federal court, if the defendants so \n     choose.\n       Chairman Barton. That's correct.\n       Mr. Stupak. And then it is up to the judge whether or not \n     the case is properly there or remanded back to State court?\n       Chairman Barton. That's my understanding.\n       Mr. Stupak. So we are not conferring a new substantive or \n     subject matter jurisdiction over these cases?\n       Chairman Barton. Not to my knowledge.\n       Mr. Stupak. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, I will not \n     offer my amendment.\n       Chairman Barton. We appreciate the gentleman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know Senator Kerry wants to speak, but I would like \nto ask that we may have time to arrange all of this right now. My next \nspeaker is Senator Craig. I would like to yield 5 minutes to him and \nthen we go to somebody on your side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Senator Kerry will be the first Senator on this side, \nfollowed by Senator Wyden. So why don't we go back and forth, if that \nis acceptable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might ask the Democrat side, since we have two \nSenators with 5 minutes each, would it be fair to say we go back and \nforth with 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KERRY. Under the order, I have 30, and I intend to use it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have 30.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have 15 under the agreement.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't want to be limited to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to limit you. You have an order. I am \njust talking about sequence.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thought you said limited to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did. I am wrong, so I am telling you you have 30; you \nare going to get 30. It is just a question of when.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to go back and forth. That is the way we have \nalways done it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise under the previous order \nas the Chair recollects it, the Democratic side set up specific times \nfor their members while on the Republican side 90 minutes was allocated \nbut not allocated in any definitive way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So what we are saying is the Senator from New Mexico \ncan speak for 90 minutes. I don't want to do that. I want to let my \nSenators speak, so I would like to change that. If we don't change it, \nI will speak for 90 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator was to allocate 90.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know I was. I would like to allocate if I could. If \nSenator Kerry is going to speak 30 minutes, I would like to have \nSenator Craig and Senator Thomas speak for 5 minutes each. That is 10 \nminutes. And then we go to Senator Kerry for his 30. Then we come back \nto Senator Alexander for his 5, and then we go back to Senator Wyden \nfor as long as he would like.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That will be very adequate. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that fair enough, Senators?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fair enough. Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think all of us stand here tonight happy \nthat a work product is before us, and it would be remiss of me not to \ncongratulate both of the Senators from New Mexico but clearly to \nrecognize Senator Domenici for his chairing of the Energy Committee \nhere in the Senate and the work he and Senator Bingaman have done to \noperate in a bipartisan way to bring us to where we are tonight.\n  You have heard from both of these Senators, and they have spoken \nclearly about the substance of the conference report that is before \nus. I will not go into the detail of that substance.\n\n  At the outset, let me thank at least two of my staff members, George \nO'Connor and Corey McDaniel. Both of them have worked on these issues. \nGeorge O'Connor has been with me literally all of these years as we \nhave worked and struggled through the process. I thank them and thank \nthe staff of the full committee for the tremendous effort at hand that \nhas produced this important conference report.\n  In the 5-year struggle that many Members have been engaged in \ndeveloping a comprehensive energy policy for this country, at times we \nthought it was for naught. We would bring it to the Senate, we would \nspend weeks voting on it, we would work with the\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\nHouse, but we could not produce a final conference report.\n  That work was not for naught. In that process of the last 5 years, \nnot only did we learn there were issues we simply could not arrive at a \nsolution on, but over that 5 years there was a learning process for all \nof us and for all Americans on a variety of issues.\n  Senator Domenici spoke tonight of a new, comprehensive national \npolicy to deal with nuclear energy and to bring it online. Five years \nago we could not have accomplished what we accomplished in the last \nseveral months. Why? The public was not with us in general nor was \nthere a growing realization that obviously did occur that the way to \nbuild new base load, to turn on the lights of America 10 years out, was \nwith an existing technology while we worked on future technologies. And \nwe wanted it to be clean. That new technology was an existing \ntechnology: It was nuclear.\n  Once again I believe the world is increasingly excited that America \nhas decided to take a leadership role in the area of nuclear instead of \nto hide behind the politics of the issue, as we have as we have lost \nthat leadership role over the last two decades. In our action here, \ncomprehensive work has been done of a bipartisan character.\n  Senator Domenici also reminds me, as he should, he wrote a book on \nthe issue, a book that is selling pretty well, but also a book that was \npart of that educational process that caused us, along with the critics \nof the issue, to begin to understand if we want clean energy, and we \ndo, and we want abundant energy, and we must have it, under current \ntechnologies there is only one place to go to get it.\n  Clearly, we have incentivized that. The Senator from New Mexico is \nright. If you cannot begin to design and ultimately build new nuclear \nproduction facilities in this country, new electrical productions in \nthis country fueled by nuclear reactors, then we will not get it done. \nBut we will, and not only will we go through a new generation, we will \ngo into new technologies. That is laid out in this bill. It is \ncritically important.\n  So while we are working on the new, we also do something else. We \nrealized the old must be renewed, and that was hydro. For the Pacific \nNorthwest, it was critical. In the Energy Policy Act of the mid-1980s, \nwe created a problem. We included everybody except the producer and \nsaid, You have a right to shape the new facility when it is relicensed, \nno matter what the cost and no matter what the demand, as long as it \nfits the environmental desire of the stakeholders involved. We could \nnot get licensing completed.\n  It went on for years and years and cost hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions of dollars, and nothing got done. When it did get done, the \nproduction plant usually produced less than it had before. That is \nunacceptable when we see so many of our hydro facilities needing to be \nrelicensed in the next 20 years. I and many others worked and we have \nwhat we believe is a new and better way to relicense our facilities \nwith that clear recognition.\n  There are many key components in this critical legislation that, as \nboth the Senators from New Mexico have said, put us back into the \nbusiness of producing energy, clean energy, appropriate for our \nnational needs, meeting the demands, creating jobs, and saying to our \nyoung people, there is a variety of abundant energy future for our \ncountry.\n  I applaud my colleagues for working with us in accomplishing what I \nbelieve to be a very comprehensive piece of work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield very soon to Senators.\n  I make one observation and ask one question and then I will yield to \nmy friend from Wyoming.\n  First, fellow Senators, Senator Bingaman mentioned something about \nrenewables. I failed to mention, while we did not accept the Bingaman \namendment, the tax portion of this bill allocates the largest \npercentage, largest piece of the tax incentives to renewables, to wind. \nSome did not like that. Some think it is great. One of the Senators is \nhere and smiling. He did not like that. But that means as much wind \nenergy as you can throw for the next 3 years, as much as you can \nmanufacture and use, will be manufactured and used. Hopefully during \nthat period of time Senator Bingaman can return and speak more to the \nissue of longevity and continuity.\n  I thank two people: Alex Flint, my staff director, and Bob Simon, the \nstaff director of Senator Bingaman. It is fair to say they have become \nfriends, too, just as my friend Senator Bingaman and I have.\n  With that, we have the order for the next hour or so. I will leave \nfor a while and leave it to one of my friends. Senator Murkowski is the \nlast one, although we have not provided for her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will be short. It is a real honor to be \nhere this evening to talk about the introduction of this bill, a bill \nfor which we have waited a very long time, and worked a very long time. \nI thank the chairman and the ranking member. We worked very hard on \nthis bill to get it into conference and worked very hard through \nconference.\n  Since we started formulating policy, we have worked on a number of \nissues. There have been changes. Many things have remained the same \nbecause the policies need to be the same. The issues are the same. We \nhave had to move forward.\n  We still need a comprehensive policy. That is an important issue \nbecause now, as we read in the paper, there are questions as to why we \nare not going to affect the gas prices tomorrow or the day after. We \nare talking about down the road. We are talking about where we will be \nover a period of time. This is a policy. It is very important \nto remember and to understand as we talk about the changes that will \neventually take place in the kind of energy we will use, in terms of \nrenewables, in terms of alternatives. We will be moving there, but we \nare not there. Alternative energy creates now about 3 percent of what \nwe use. It will be much higher than that, but it won't be higher than \nthat next year or next month.\n\n  We have to make sure what we are using now for energy can continue to \nbe maintained and that we will find new ways of dealing with the \nenergy. For instance, that we can take coal, our largest fossil fuel \nresource, and find ways to use it in a more environmentally sound way, \nfind ways to change the way it is moved, for hydrogen or synthetic \ndiesel, and do that over time.\n  It is important we understand that we have to do two things: We have \nto look to the future about alternatives. We have to find ways to use \nwhat is available now to keep up production in this country and to keep \nour economy strong. We ought not to forget that is what we need to do.\n  This is a bill that is very balanced. That is important. It has \nalready been talked about. I will not go into the details. We have \ntalked about renewables. We have talked about ways we can renew--\nwhether it is gasoline, ethanol, or opportunities for electric \ngeneration, whether nuclear or whatever--areas we can move to. That is \nvery important over time.\n  We ought to talk about coal. We do here. We spend a good deal of \nmoney. By the way, we divide this total expenditure in about six equal \nways between renewables, conservation, doing something to make coal \nmore usable. There are six distinct areas spread in fairly equal \namounts.\n  I will talk a second on coal. It is our largest fossil fuel resource. \nWe have more of it for the future than any other energy. We need to \nfind better ways to use that. Much of it will be generating \nelectricity. Sometimes we do not think about where electricity comes \nfrom; we just think it is automatically there. It is not. We have to \ncontinue to do that. Coal is in one place; the need for electricity is \nin another. We need transmission. We have to have new transmission \nideas and do things that are more efficient than they have been in the \npast. We need to find a way to make sure it is safe and secure.\n  The same thing is true with oil. We use oil a great deal. About 60 \npercent of it now is imported. We will continue to do that. Certainly \nover time we will find ways to get better mileage in\n\n[[Page S9261]]\n\nautomobiles. It is not going to happen right away.\n  Of course, there will be some arguments that we should put some \ndefined times when you have to get CAFE standards. It is very difficult \nto do that. But it will happen. It will happen in the marketplace. It \nwill happen as we can do it. And we can do it efficiently. We have to \nfind better ways to get more oil out of the ground. We produce a lot of \noil in Wyoming. The old oilfields are about exhausted, but below that \nis a great deal more oil if we find different ways of doing that, if we \nuse renewed production or carbon sequestration. And much of that is in \nthis bill.\n  We do have conservation and efficiency, as we should have. We have \nopportunities to make the use of energy more clean and better \nenvironmentally. We have ideas for producing more production of our \nresources available now. And we need to do all of these things as \nquickly as possible, but we cannot do them overnight.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish the senior Senator from New Mexico \nwere in the Senate because I wanted to say a few words to him \npersonally as well as about him, but in his absence I will certainly \nsay them.\n  In the Senate, we all have an ability, thank Heaven, to be able to \nseparate the policy from personality and from the personal. I know how \nhard Senator Domenici has worked through the years. I know how \ncommitted he is personally to developing an energy policy. That goes, \nalso, for the junior Senator from New Mexico, my friend Senator \nBingaman, who has worked closely and diligently under difficult \ncircumstances to try to deal with these energy issues.\n  On a personal level, I am genuinely happy for the Senator from New \nMexico because I know this is a moment of completion for him, and on a \npersonal level he is happy and he has worked hard to get there. All \nMembers are gratified when a colleague has that kind of \nsuccess. Nevertheless, on a policy level, I have enormous disagreements \nwith where this bill has finally put the Senate and our country.\n\n  Our Nation's energy crisis has reached historic levels. What we need \ntoday is not a policy that puts enough good stuff in it that enough \nSenators will grab onto it and say: OK, I can vote for that bill. What \nwe need is an energy policy that is as bold and big as the challenge is \nsignificant to the country. That is not, under any analysis, what we \nare getting in this bill.\n  This is, frankly, largely a lobbyist-driven bill. What underscores \nthat is when you measure what is happening in this bill--as you must in \nmaking any decent policy for our country--when you measure this bill \nagainst families who are struggling to balance their checkbooks, who \ncannot pay easily the additional cost of gasoline, when you measure \nthis bill against small businesses, which have had an enormous rise in \nthe cost of doing business--just the cost of getting to and from the \nbusiness, let alone the cost of trucks delivering goods to that \nbusiness. There has been something like a $25 billion to $30 billion \nenergy gas tax increase on businesses over the course of the last \ncouple years. They are paying those additional costs.\n  We passed, in the Senate, an energy provision to be able to provide \nloans--not grants, not giveaways, but loans--to those businesses so \nthat they might be able to adjust for the cash flow problems they have \nbecause of the increased cost of energy. The Senate passed it. The \nSenate passed it 3 years ago. But it was taken out in the conference.\n  Gone from this bill is any kind of emergency lending assistance to \nthe small businesses of our country that are hard-pressed because of \nenergy costs. Why? What is the reason for that? When you see our \nchildren breathing air already that is dangerously polluted, and you \nknow the levels of asthma among children are increasing, and the \ngreatest cause for the hospitalization of children in the summertime in \nAmerica is an asthma attack, which is air-induced, and the quality of \nour air is not being cleaned as much as it was, as rapidly as it could \nbe, nevertheless, you see us going backward with respect to the new \nsource performance standards in air quality, when you read about rival \nnations that are rapidly moving ahead of the United States of America \nwith respect to alternative energy technologies--and they are creating \nhigh-paying jobs by moving in that direction--but the United States is \nonly moving incrementally, without a genuine commitment--and I will \ncome to that in a minute--when you recognize that our dependence on \nforeign oil sees us sending $25 billion a year just to the Gulf States \nalone--Mr. President, $200,000 a minute, $13 million an hour, we send \nto those countries; And how much of that money falls into the hands of \nHamas, al-Qaida--when you see what the complication of oil dependency \ndoes to the foreign policy of the United States as well as the health, \neconomy, and security of our Nation, you have to ask yourself why we \nare not moving more rapidly to deal with these issues.\n  Senator Domenici said a moment ago this is the largest portion that \nhas gone to renewables. Well, let me show my colleagues this pie chart, \nwhich simply contradicts that. That is not accurate. It may be a larger \namount of money than it has been in the past, but of the money that is \nbeing put out in this bill, only 16 percent goes to renewables. And 10 \npercent goes to efficiency. That is a total, between them, of 26 \npercent going to renewables and efficiency. Mr. President, 37 percent \nalone, eclipsing renewables and eclipsing efficiency combined, is going \nto nuclear--going to nuclear.\n  When you add the combination of oil and gas, you have an enormous \nproportion of this bill's tax benefits and funding that is going to the \nstatus quo--the status quo--``same old same old'' energy policy of the \nUnited States, not to the creation of the new high-paying jobs, to \nclean air and to renewables and the kind of technologies we need. There \nis no explanation for that.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the Senate bill. I joined with colleagues, \n85 of us, in sending a bill to the conference that had about a 50-50 \nsplit. I was not pleased with a 50-50 split. I thought we could have \ndone better than that. Guess what. We are going backward in this bill. \nWhy? What is the rationale? What is the policy rationale for having \ntaken a Senate bill that had a larger amount of money going to \nrenewables and alternatives, that passed with 85 votes, and here we are \nwith a bill on the floor of the Senate that has a paltry 26 percent, \nonly 16 percent going to renewables? If you ask the American people, \nthe American people would overwhelmingly vote to do otherwise. But the \nSenate will not.\n  The conference committee takes a huge step backward in other places--\nfor instance, the requirement that U.S. utilities generate 10 percent \nof their electricity from renewable sources by 2020, 15 years from now. \nWe are trying to set a goal that just 10 percent of America's \nelectricity is going to be produced from alternatives and \nrenewables. We could achieve it. Other nations are moving to a much \nhigher level of alternatives and renewables. Not the United States of \nAmerica. We are going to do the ``same old same old.'' We are going to \ndo the nuclear and do the oil and gas.\n\n  Well, most of our electricity actually is not oil-fired. It is either \ncoal-fired or natural gas-fired. But the fact is that instead of \nsetting a standard, which we had in the Senate--in the Senate bill, we \nsaid 10 percent of the electricity by 2020 will be from renewable \nsources--that is gone, taken out of the bill. Why? Because special \ninterests on the House side demanded that happen.\n  As to language that recognized global warming, I remember how many \nSenators came to the floor, and they all embraced the language of \nglobal warming in a nonbinding resolution. They just said: We are going \nto deal with it, and this is important. Guess what. Even the nonbinding \nlanguage that acknowledged the problem of global warming has been taken \nout. There is nothing in this legislation to deal with one of the \nsingle greatest environmental challenges on the face of this planet--\nnothing.\n  And how do you explain this next one? The United States uses about 19 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. We had a requirement in the Senate bill \nthat we reduce oil consumption in America by 1 million barrels a day. \nImagine that: We\n\n[[Page S9262]]\n\nwere going to try to get 1 million out of 19 million. We were going to \nrequire that the country set a goal of reducing that dependency on oil. \nGone. It has been taken out. Why? Why would we not want, as a nation, \nto set a goal of trying to reduce our dependency?\n  I guarantee you, Mr. President, we are going to be back here in the \nSenate facing real energy crises as we deal with the realities of what \nis going to happen in the world, with a China that is going to move to \nsomething like 13 million barrels of consumption on a daily basis from \nabout 5 today. You have India that is going to go from about 2 million \nbarrels up to 5 million barrels a day.\n  You are going to have some trillions of dollars that are going to \ncontinue to be exported abroad, and you will see more efforts by China \nand other countries to take the fruits of their oil and buy American \ncompanies. Is America going to be stronger for that?\n  I would like to know why, instead, billions of American tax dollars \nare not going to go to renewables and alternatives, but they are going \nto go into oil and gas. Let me make it clear. I support clean coal \ntechnology. I think it is important. It is one of the most vast \nresources of the United States, one of our biggest reserves. And it is \nabsolutely technologically feasible for us to be able to burn coal more \ncleanly. We need to do that. I support our efforts to move in that \ndirection.\n  But why, at the last minute, is there a $1.5 billion deal that goes \nto Halliburton? Halliburton, which is making billions of dollars off of \nIraq, Halliburton, which is a hugely profitable company, is going to \nget $1.5 billion out of this instead of some of these other nascent \ntechnologies that are screaming for assistance.\n  Why is it that children are going to get weaker environmental \nprotections, dirtier air and water? Is there any person in the Senate \nwho has received mail from their constituents saying: Give me dirtier \nair for my kids. Give us dirtier water to drink. That is what you are \ngetting. That is what this bill gives you.\n  Americans get no relief at the pump. And we are left more dependent \non foreign oil than we are today. Imagine that. Here is an energy \npolicy that people are going to come and celebrate. I can see the \nPresident's signing ceremony now. And he will go out and tell America \nhow terrific it is going to be. But this does nothing to reduce \nAmerican dependency on oil.\n  Let me make it clear. Don't take my word for it. The President's own \neconomists say that oil imports will increase 85 percent by 2025 under \nthis proposal. The President's own economists found--and I quote them--\n\n       [C]hanges to production, consumption, imports, and prices \n     are negligible [in this bill].\n\n  In other words, the very things we want to affect--prices, \nconsumption, imports, production--are going to be negligibly affected \nby this bill.\n  You do not have to be an expert, you can be a kid in any classroom in \nAmerica, in middle school or elementary, and know that if the United \nStates of America only has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves--that \nis all we have in all of Alaska, underneath all of our national \nmonuments, in all of our waters that are accessible to the United \nStates. We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. Saudi Arabia \nalone has 65 percent of it. As I have said many times, and as this bill \nignores, there is no possible way for the United States of America to \nbuild its security in the long term by drilling our way out of this \ncrisis. We have to invent our way out of it. This bill barely scratches \nthe surface of the kind of invention America is capable of and the \nkinds of opportunities we know of.\n  I heard the Senator a moment ago say we do not have the ability now \nto be able to do better in our automobiles. That is just not true. For \na $200 expenditure, anybody could go out now and get their car \nconverted to be able to go use ethanol fuel, biomass fuel. It is just \nthat we do not do enough of it. Imagine what we could do for farmers \nacross our Nation. Imagine what we could do with respect to the \npossibility of new jobs and new production facilities and delivery \nfacilities and infrastructure. None of that is being adequately tapped \nwith respect to this legislation.\n  All you have to do is look at what this bill does for the \nenvironment. There is in this bill an amendment to the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. Do you know what it does? It allows unregulated underground \ninjection of chemicals during oil and gas development so that we \nthreaten clean water. Did anybody in America say, I think it is a good \nidea for us to have chemicals put into the underground water supply in \norder to bring out oil and gas? Why would we exempt it from the \nstandards we have applied to our Nation over the course of the last 30 \nyears? The oil and gas industry is getting an exemption for their \nconstruction activities from compliance with the Clean Water Act. Why \nwould you exempt construction activities from compliance with the Clean \nWater Act?\n  The Energy bill also requires an inventory of offshore oil and \nnatural gas resources. That is supposed to pave the way for offshore \ndrilling along America's coastlines, including areas off Florida's \ncoastline, which is banned.\n  This Energy bill should have been a net plus for the environment. \nInstead, it goes backward.\n  Are there some positive provisions in this bill? Of course there are. \nI could stand up here and talk about the importance of clean coal \ntechnology. There are other things. I am encouraged by the strong, new \nstandards and consumer protections in electricity. I am encouraged we \nfinally authorized Energy Star. But the bottom line is, we did better \nin the Senate bill that went to the conference committee. We did \nbetter. And there is no policy rationale, no common sense in going \nbackward from the standards that were set in that Senate bill.\n  The fact is, if we end our energy dependence on foreign oil, we \nstrengthen our national security. If we lead the world in inventing new \ntechnologies, we create thousands of high-paying technology jobs. If we \nlearn to tap clean energy sources, we preserve a clean environment for \nour families and for future generations. If we remove the burden of \nhigh gas prices, American consumers can spend elsewhere and give our \neconomy the boost it needs.\n  This Energy bill does not take anywhere near the advantage that we \nhad in the Senate bill or that we could have had even beyond the Senate \nbill.\n  I understand it is hard to get an Energy bill passed. We all \nunderstand the powers and the force of money in American politics and \nthe lobbying that takes place. But we have a powerful opportunity to \nmake a renewable electricity the standard in the United States. This \nbill ought to be increasing our electricity supply from renewables up \nto 20 percent of electricity from wind and solar and geothermal and \nbiomass facilities by 2020. Instead there is nothing.\n  The renewable portfolio standard is a simple mechanism to diversify \nenergy sources, to stabilize electricity prices, to reduce air \npollution and other harmful environmental impacts of electricity \ngeneration. The fact is, this administration has even let the big old \npowerplants off the hook by reneging on the new source performance \nstandards so that they don't have to live up to the higher standards as \nthey put new technologies in place. The result is, Americans will have \ndirtier air than they would have had otherwise.\n  Second, we need to take serious steps to help the domestic auto \nmanufacturers build the cars, trucks, and SUVs of the future. The \nmarket for hybrids is set to take off. Over the next 3 years, the \nnumber of hybrid models is going to increase to almost 20. By 2012, \nthere could be possibly more than 50 models. These are representative \nof real potential volume and unbelievable value. If we don't build \nthem, someone else is going to do it. The fact is, others are doing it \nmore effectively and rapidly than we have. The global market for \nhybrids, by one estimate, could be as much as 4.5 million units by \n2013, perhaps $65 billion alone in the United States. I believe we \nought to put American ingenuity back into our vehicles. We ought to be \nencouraging, to a greater degree, the ability to transform that \nmarketplace. That is why any Energy bill that we consider ought to have \nboth manufacturer and consumer incentives that are adequate to help \naccelerate that transition. This bill doesn't.\n  Third, Congress can't responsibly continue to ignore the global \nclimate change issue. Higher temperatures\n\n[[Page S9263]]\n\nthreaten serious consequences. I met the other day with our top experts \nfrom NASA. How many Senators realize that it is now not a question of \nwhether; it is a certainty. Nothing we do today is going to stop this. \nTo show you how far behind the curve we are, it is a certainty that the \nArctic ice sheet is going to melt. If the Arctic ice sheet melts \ncompletely, that exposes the Greenland sheet. Nobody can tell you with \ncertainty what is going to happen to Greenland. But any policymaker \nought to stop and shiver at the prospect that it is a certainty the \nArctic ice sheet will melt. The Greenland ice sheet will be exposed. \nAnd if it were to melt, with catastrophic consequences, say goodbye to \nFlorida, goodbye to the port of Boston, and New York, and a bunch of \nother places. That would be a catastrophic event. There is nothing in \nthis bill that tries adequately to deal with that reality.\n  What is going to happen with respect to drought, disease, floods, \nlost ecosystems? And from sweltering heat to rising seas, global \nwarming effects have already begun. Sit down with the top scientists. \nSit down with Nobel Prize winners and listen to them tell you about the \ncertainty of what is already happening, not a matter of scientific \nspeculation. The seas are rising. It is getting warmer. They will tell \nyou what is happening. This bill doesn't deal with it.\n  We tried, on this bill, to pass an economywide cap-and-trade bill, a \nbill that uses the marketplace to be able to work effectively. Didn't \nget enough votes. The compromise was, they passed the language that \ndidn't require anything, and they even took out of this bill the \nlanguage that didn't require anything. This is the most obtuse, head-\nin-the-sand ostrich policy I have ever seen in my life. A bunch of \nresponsible people in the Senate and House of Representatives, ignoring \nscientists all across the globe, turning their backs on foreign \nministers, trade ministers, environmental ministers, prime ministers, \npresidents of countries, all of whom have embraced, at political risk, \nthe reality of that science, and only the United States of America \nstands apart and alone, ignoring that reality. Where is the leadership?\n  Fourth, to ensure that technologies capable of providing clean, \nsecure, and affordable energy become available in the timeframe and on \na scale needed, we need to dramatically increase our commitment to \nresearch and development. I am in favor of advancing the research on \nnuclear waste and on third-generation, fourth-generation nuclear \ncapacity. A lot of people in my party are not, a lot of \nenvironmentalists aren't. I think it is responsible to do that. But it \nis not responsible to go rushing headlong with the greatest proportion \nof technology alternative here, without having dealt with those issues \nand dealt with the American public in a responsible way with respect to \nthat.\n  I think the bill ought to include provisions to dramatically increase \nFederal Government funding for new energy research and development, \nincreased incentives for private sector energy research and \ndevelopment, and expanded investment in cooperative international R \ninitiatives. It does not.\n\n  Maybe most important of all, we need to attack our energy crisis with \nthe same intensity that we showed under the leadership of Franklin \nRoosevelt and Harry Truman when we undertook the Manhattan Project or, \nsubsequently, when we did the space program and the Apollo program. Our \ncompetitors are showing that kind of urgency. Prime Minister Blair has \nbeen fighting hard to get the G8 to come together. He had to back off \nbecause of American pressure. We pushed backward, not forward. Great \nBritain wants to do almost 100 percent of its electricity from wind \npower over the course of the next years. Other countries are moving to \n80 or 90 percent goals of biomass for fuels. Not the United States of \nAmerica, despite so many farmers who are desperately waiting for that \nmarketplace to exist.\n  In Germany, where heating is a huge drain on energy, a new law sets \nthe standard of a house designed to use just 7 liters of oil to heat 1 \nsquare meter for a year. A new national campaign in Japan urges \nreplacement of older appliances with new hybrid products as part of \ntheir nationwide effort to save energy and fight global warming. In \nSingapore, air-conditioning is a big drain on energy. So new codes \nencourage the use of heated blocking window films and hookups to \nneighborhood cooling systems which chill water overnight. Other \ncountries are way ahead of the United States of America in exploring \nthese possibilities.\n  In Hong Kong, an intelligent elevator system uses computers to \nminimize unnecessary stops and minimize, therefore, unnecessary use of \nenergy. If these nations can reduce their dependence on foreign oil and \ninvest in advanced energy technology, surely the United States of \nAmerica can do better than this paltry 16 percent renewables and 10 \npercent efficiency.\n  Their urgency is more than justified because, frankly, this goes way \nbeyond our economy. Energy is a legitimate and central global security \nissue. The era when the United States and Japan comprised the bulk of \nthe world's demand for oil is over. Oil consumption from developing \nAsian nations will more than double in the next 25 years, from 15 \nmillion to 32 million barrels a day. We only have 3 percent, as I said \nearlier. There is no way the United States is going to be part of that \nbargain. The way the United States can be part of that future is by \ncreating those alternative sources and gaining our independence.\n  Chinese consumption is going to grow from 5 million to nearly 13 \nmillion barrels a day. India is going from 2 to 5 million barrels per \nday. This global race for oil is potentially a devastating, \ndestabilizing force, certainly a challenge to the security of our \ncountry.\n  We are going to be back here on the floor of the Senate in a short \nperiod of time lamenting that we didn't do more now. Increased American \nenergy dependence further entangles also our Nation in these areas of \nthe world. You look at our troops now. This is not good for our troops. \nIn recent years, U.S. forces had to help protect a pipeline in \nColombia. Our military had to train indigenous forces to protect a \npipeline in Georgia. We plan to spend $100 million on a special network \nof police officers and special forces to guard oil facilities around \nthe Caspian Sea and continue to search for bases in Africa so we can \nprotect oil facilities there. Our Navy patrolled tanker routes in the \nIndian Ocean, South China Sea, and the western Pacific. The reality is \nthat we have to protect oil at risk to our troops and at cost to \nAmericans to protect our way of life because we are not working the way \nwe could to provide an alternative to that.\n  This is a serious issue with real consequences. In the spring of \n2004, insurgents attacked an Iraqi oil platform. There was violence \nagainst oil workers in Nigeria. The result was depressed global oil \noutput and record high gasoline prices. The United States is now on a \ncourse where we are opening a target to terrorists. The more you rely \non oil, the more disruptive it becomes to your economy, the more it \nbecomes a target to terror, rather than growing it here at home.\n  If anyone needs an example of how energy dependence can shortchange \nnational security, you can look at the war on terror. Let's assume that \noil were to miraculously drop to $30 a barrel over the next 25 years. \nThe United States will send over $3 trillion out of the country, much \nof it to regimes that don't share our values. Today, America spends \nthese enormous amounts. About $25 billion a year goes to Persian Gulf \nimports alone. It is bad enough to think that those dollars aren't \ngoing to stay here and help grow our economy. But it is worse to \nconsider that they empower, in many cases, some of the most extreme \nelements in the world to be able to take advantage of that richness. \nThe fact is the madrassas in many of these countries and the deals that \nhave been cut in regimes like Saudi Arabia between those extremists are \npart of what has provided the recruitment and destabilization with \nrespect to the violent extremists of the world today.\n  We know that al-Qaida has relied on prominent Saudi Arabians for \nfinancing. The fact is that the bottom line of this policy is, it works \nfor Saudi Arabia. It works for oil and gas companies. But in the long \nrun, this is not going to be what the American people need or want.\n  Americans deserve better, and they also deserve the truth. We had a \ndebate\n\n[[Page S9264]]\n\non the floor of the Senate on an Energy bill, during which we were \ndebating efficiencies. This administration delayed an EPA report that \nslammed fuel economy. It didn't allow the report to come out until \nafter the bill had passed.\n  Washington failed the American people with respect to an opportunity \nto provide both the economic, health and security and energy policy \nthat this Nation so desperately needs. My hope is that as much as there \nare some good things in this bill, the Senate at some point will come \nback and get the real job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the legislation that the Senator from \nMassachusetts described bears very little resemblance to the \nlegislation I have been working on for the last couple of years with \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman and that 13 out of the 14 Senate \nconferees of both parties just approved.\n  Let me say what I believe we did and then spend a minute, at the end \nof my 5 minutes, correcting a couple of things the Senator from \nMassachusetts said.\n  Energy is not usually what we talk about at the dinner table, but it \nis today. For example, in Tennessee, if you are working at \nInternational Paper in Memphis or at Eastman Chemical in east \nTennessee, you know that if the price of natural gas stays as high as \nit is today, the highest in the world, those jobs are going to move \noverseas. And those are thousands of jobs in Tennessee and millions of \nblue-collar jobs in America. If you are a farmer and you know that the \nnatural gas price stays as high as it is today, you know you are going \nto have a big pay cut because of the cost of fertilizer. And if you are \na homeowner, you know the bills are up.\n  The first thing this legislation does is to take significant steps to \nstabilize the price of natural gas and hopefully bring it down. That is \nworth talking about at the dinner table.\n  The second thing it does is to change the way we produce electricity \nso that it is by low-carbon and no-carbon means. That is worth talking \nabout at the dinner table because it helps deal with global warming, \nand it helps deal with clean air. The third thing it does is begin a \nlong-term switch from a dependence on oil, especially foreign oil. That \nis worth talking about because of our national security. Does it really \ndo that? I would submit that it does. To begin with, the conservation \nand efficiency provisions in this bill will save the building of 50 \nmajor powerplants over the next 20 years. That is the first and most \nimportant thing we should do.\n  The second thing it does is to focus on accelerated investment and \nresearch for the next generation of nuclear power.\n  If you really care about global warming, you want to support nuclear \npower because 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity in America \ntoday comes from electricity generated by nuclear powerplants.\n  The third thing it does is to adopt a strategy that the Natural \nResources Defense Council and many others have urged on us, which is to \nexplore seriously making gas from coal and turning that into \nelectricity and taking the carbon out and putting it into the ground.\n  The fourth thing it does is to create new supplies of natural gas to \nbegin to lower the price of gas and further produce clean air.\n  Mr. President, that is really the way to address global warming. That \nis really the way to reduce the price of natural gas. That is a serious \npolicy to change the way we produce electricity so it is low carbon/no \ncarbon--conservation and efficiency, nuclear power, coal gasification, \ncarbon sequestration, and new supplies of natural gas. And then, for \nthe long term, a focus on hydrogen fuel cell economy, but that is \nseveral years away.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked passionately about renewable \nenergy. We all hope we can expand renewable energy. I fought very hard \nand I am glad to see in this legislation, for the first time, a carve-\nout for solar power, which was getting nothing from our renewable tax \ncredit. But how much are we going to spend on energy that produces 2 \npercent of the electricity we use?\n  If you look at the figures in terms of the tax incentives in the \nbill, the Senator from Massachusetts didn't multiply very well because \nwe spend 20 percent of the money on renewable. That is for 2 percent of \nthe electricity. We spend 18.6 percent on energy efficiency and \nconservation. Most of us wish that were more. We spend 18 percent of \nthe money on oil and gas production. That is 40 percent of our energy. \nOf the amount we spend on electric reliability, we spend $400 million \nof that for clean energy renewable bonds. That is renewable. We spend \n20 percent on clean coal.\n  Mr. President, if anything, I think we are overspending on renewable. \nWe have committed of taxpayers' money $3 billion over the next 5 years \nbuilding giant windmills with flashing red lights. The Senator from \nMassachusetts may want a national windmill policy. That is for a desert \nisland. For the United States, we need a serious clean energy policy, \nand that is this bill. So I congratulate Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman. I am proud of this bill and I hope we adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, sometimes the test of legislation in the \nSenate is did we do less harm than good. Some might say, by that test, \nthis Energy bill is worth voting for. I will tell you that test is not \ngood enough when America is at war and our dependence upon foreign oil \nis putting our citizens at risk each and every day.\n  The test in the Senate that, well, maybe this legislation has some \ngood is unacceptable when there is a rare opportunity and a rare \nobligation to avoid the terrifying human costs of future wars. In those \nrare instances, the test in the Senate should be did Congress meet its \nobligations. I have concluded that in this energy bill we have not.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil will not be reduced as a result of this \nlegislation. As a result, we have not reduced the prospect of going to \nwar once again in the Persian Gulf in the next decade. I do not \nunderstand how we will explain to every man and woman who fights so \ncourageously in Iraq and Afghanistan, or how to explain to every \nveteran who fought in the Persian Gulf in the last decade, how we \nfailed to meet our obligation to avoid future wars.\n  For this reason, I want to express a deep regret to those soldiers \nand veterans because your children are now no less likely to be asked \nto fight a very similar war. I want to express a deep regret to the \nfamilies of those soldiers and veterans because their children may \nsomeday face the very same burdens. I want to express a deep regret to \nthe American public, which is spending hundreds of billions of dollars \nto prosecute the war in Iraq and may someday be asked to spend far more \non the next war because the Senate is about to pass a pre-9/11 energy \npolicy. After 9/11, it became clear that energy policy was a national \nsecurity issue and that reducing our dependence on foreign oil had to \nbe a national security priority. That hasn't been done.\n  So today Americans continue to pay what I call a terror tax--the \nprice we pay in insecurity for our dependence on foreign oil. I call it \na terror tax because when each of us pulls up to the corner gasoline \nstation and pays $2.40 a gallon, or so, for gasoline, a portion of that \nmoney goes to foreign governments that in turn send it out the back \ndoor to Islamist extremists who use the money to perpetuate hate and \nterrorist acts. But in this bill Congress has squandered a golden \nopportunity to dam that river of terrorist funding.\n  It is not good enough to accept business as usual when our citizens \npay record prices at the gas pump, only to see foreign governments wink \nand nod while terrorists make off with substantial amounts of the money \nand use the funds to target America. The recent bombings we have seen \nhave been a sober reminder of just how vulnerable America, our allies, \nand our strategic partners remain to terrorism. In my view, there is an \nindisputable link, not only between the American dependence on foreign \noil and the price our citizens pay at the pump but between our oil \naddiction and our vulnerability to attack here at home.\n  What I have come to learn as a member of the Energy Committee, and as \nthe one member of the conference who was unwilling to sign the report, \nis\n\n[[Page S9265]]\n\nthat any energy policy proposed in the future should have to contain a \nstatement of how that bill will reduce the terror attacks. There ought \nto be a statement in the future with respect to energy legislation on \nhow that legislation would actually reduce our dependence on foreign \noil in the short term and in the long term.\n\n  If that had been required for this legislation, there is no way this \nbill would get a passing grade. This legislation does virtually nothing \nto reduce our dependence on foreign oil. You look at what was said in \n2003, not by partisans on one side or the other but by the Bush \nadministration's Energy Information Agency. They said that bill would \nhave increased our imports of foreign oil by 2025 by about 85 percent. \nThis legislation, with respect to oil imports, would produce virtually \nthe same result.\n  Now, to give the country a sense of just what we were up against--\nthose of us who wanted to break our dependence on foreign oil--I would \nlike to discuss an amendment I tried to offer in the conference. In the \nconference, I proposed that the automobile industry be required to \nincrease auto efficiency by 1 mile per gallon for each of the next 5 \nyears. The reason I did that is a basic fact of energy policy. You \ncannot transform this country's energy sector if you give the \nautomobile industry a free pass. So when I made that proposal, I said \nto myself, what a modest step, just 1 mile per gallon for just 5 years. \nYet it would have had a huge impact in terms of reducing our dependence \non foreign oil. Unlike this legislation, which doesn't reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, that would have made a difference.\n  In the 2001 report, the national academy found that the technology \nexists today to raise the average fuel economy nearly 40 miles per \ngallon by 2012 without sacrificing safety. My proposal was much more \nmodest than what the leading scientific experts in this country found \nwas both technologically feasible and affordable to consumers. Yet the \nconference rejected even this modest proposal out of hand.\n  I particularly thank Senator Bingaman, who supported it and said we \nought to at least, at the very minimum, not go to the American people \nand say, gosh, 5 miles a gallon over 5 years is too much. But even that \nmodest advance could not make it into this legislation. So, as a \nresult, Americans will get no relief from this terror tax brought about \nby our addiction to foreign oil. And at the same time, their hard-\nearned dollars will flow out the back door straight to the entrenched \nenergy interests.\n  Now, even the President has said that when oil is trading at upwards \nof $55 a barrel, the oil companies are not in need of any more \nincentives. When the President says the oil companies don't need a deal \nfrom the Government, that ought to tell you something--you are going \ntoo far. But even so--even with the remarks of the President, who was \ndead right--this bill is now stuffed with a smorgasbord of subsidies \nfor a whole host of energy special interests. The buffet of subsidies \nis so generously larded that, in many cases, it will allow second and \neven third helpings from the energy subsidy buffet table. Loan \nguarantees are letting these special interests double dip and even \ntriple dip on some energy projects. Projects that would already be \nsubsidized in other provisions of the Energy bill will also receive \nloan guarantees under the incentives title.\n  They are also going to get tax credits in the finance title. That is \ndip 1. Then they are going to get loans under the incentives title. \nThat is dip 2. Then there will be loan guarantees on top of that. That \nis dip 3. These guarantees are some of the largest subsidies in the \nSenate Energy bill, and they are risky ones.\n  Mr. President, the subsidy title of this legislation, in my view, is \na blank check for boondoggles that simply doesn't decrease our foreign \noil dependence.\n  In closing, the most patriotic thing this Congress could have done in \nthe summer of 2005 was to write an energy bill that did three specific \nthings: reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower gasoline prices for \nworking families and businesses, and end the energy subsidy smorgasbord \nthat has offered these heaping helpings of taxpayer dollars to the \nenergy industry for decades.\n  I am sad to say, as one who was involved in this from the outset as a \nmember of the committee and the conference committee, that the final \nproduct does not accomplish any of those three things. It doesn't \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. Nobody has to take my word for \nit. That has been on the front pages of the papers all this week. It \ndoesn't lower gasoline prices. And, again, you don't have to take my \nword for it. The President has already stated that. It doesn't end the \nsubsidy buffet for the big energy interests, and you won't have to take \nmy word for that either. You are going to hear those special interests \nbreaking out the champagne bottles all over town in the next few days.\n  My constituents have been hit especially hard by high energy costs, \nand they and millions of Americans had hoped that the Congress would \nstep up and take bold action, truly bold action, to shake us free of \nour dependence on foreign oil and these other concerns that I have \naddressed tonight.\n  What I hope is that, as the country sees how little is actually \naccomplished here, there will be an opportunity--and an opportunity \nsoon--to come back and address some of the shortcomings that have been \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate tonight.\n  I hope there will be a transformational policy put in place with \nrespect to the automobile sector. That is the ball game in terms of \nenergy conservation and reducing oil consumption. This legislation took \na pass on it.\n  With respect to reducing carbons, again, there was a marketplace \napproach--a bipartisan marketplace approach--that the Congress could \nhave moved ahead on.\n  The bottom line, the Congress could have done much better. I think \nour colleagues in the Senate know this bill is literally a series of \nmissed opportunities. It is right to vote no on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have waited my time in the queue this \nevening because I wanted to take a few minutes to speak not only about \nthe importance of this Energy bill we are poised to vote on tomorrow, \nbut to acknowledge those who did I think yeoman's work in getting us to \nwhere we are.\n  As my friend from Oregon has pointed out, this is not a perfect piece \nof legislation. He and I would disagree on certain areas of it. But I \nthink when we look at the work product of what we do in the Senate, the \nday that we come to complete agreement--complete agreement--on all \naspects of legislation we move forward, I think we will have all lost \nour collective senses. We will always find room to improve our \nlegislation. We will always find room to make something better. We need \nto look at where we are at this point in time with the Energy bill we \nhave before us.\n  As was pointed out earlier this evening, we have not had an energy \npolicy updated or presented or worked through this Congress for 13 \nyears. Thirteen years is a long time to be floating without a specific \npolicy, a specific policy direction, particularly in an area that is as \nimportant as energy.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday to address a group of a couple \nhundred young people in a junior statesman-type forum. It was an \nopportunity for me to speak on the subject of my choosing. Since we \nhave been so focused on energy these past couple weeks and we have been \nmoving this bill through the conference process, I spent my time to \ntalk about what we had been doing and the significance of energy to us \nas a nation, as a people, and particularly to these young people.\n  As Senator Alexander, the Senator from Tennessee, mentioned earlier, \nenergy is not typically something we talk about at the dinner table. We \nneed to understand as a country how important energy is to our daily \nworld.\n  I have often described the way Americans think about energy--we have \nthis kind of immaculate conception notion of energy: It just happens. \nYou flip the switch and the lights go on; you adjust the thermostat and \nyou are cooler or warmer, and it just happens. There is no connection \nbetween how we respond to the energy we have, whether it powers us, \nheats us, cools us, it moves us. We do not think about it. We do not \nconnect the dots between what we are consuming and where from it comes.\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\n  As I explained to this group of young people, we get most of our \nenergy from the ground. It comes from underneath, whether it is oil or \nwhether it is natural gas that is extracted off our shores, say, in \nLouisiana, or whether it is from our coal resources that we mine. \nSometimes that is not a particularly visually appealing thought, to \nthink that we have to dig it out, we have to drill it out, we have to \nextract. But the fact of the matter is, we are energy consumers. We are \na nation that is dependent on our energy for what we do, for who we \nare, for the strength of this Nation. If we couldn't move, if we \ncouldn't communicate the way we do, we would not be the Nation we are.\n  So it is important for us as Americans to realize, to appreciate, to \nconnect those dots and say, this is important to us. It is important to \nus to have an energy policy that is comprehensive, that is sound, that \nis balanced, that not only looks to the production from the traditional \nsources, such as oil, gas, and coal, but looks to the production from \nthe sources for the future in the renewables, in the alternative \nsources of energy. That also has as a component of our energy policy \nthe conservation aspects, the efficiencies. This must be part of the \nplan.\n  That is what this Energy bill we have before us is and does. It is \ncomprehensive in those ways.\n  The point has been made tonight that we have done nothing in this \nEnergy bill that is going to bring down the price of gasoline at the \npump tomorrow. I am not going to stand before you tonight and say that \nif we pass this legislation tomorrow and if the President signs off on \nthis in the next couple of weeks the American consumer is all of a \nsudden going to see the price of gasoline drop at the pump. I cannot \nmake that promise, and I would be foolish to do so. We know that is not \ngoing to happen just because we enact this bill.\n  Here is the point: If we had done this 8 years, 10 years ago, 5 years \nago when we had been working on energy policies over this period of \ntime, perhaps we would not be at this point where we are paying $2.40 \nat the pump, as we are paying in my hometown of Anchorage right now. \nPerhaps we would not be at this point if we had enacted an energy \npolicy some years prior to this. But we did not, and we are here now.\n  Now we have an opportunity to do something, to move forward with a \npolicy that does make some sense. So we have to start somewhere. We \nhave to put in place the procedures and the mechanisms that will work. \nWe have to understand that we cannot expect an immediate fix. We did \nnot get to $2.40 a gallon gasoline overnight. We are not going to \nremedy it overnight. So our expectations need to be realistic.\n\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said when he was talking about natural \ngas, one of the things we will see through what we are putting in place \nwith this legislation is a stabilizing effect, hopefully, with our \nnatural gas prices as we are able to provide for those incentives and \nencourage more LNG facilities around our coasts so we can get more of \nthe natural gas into this country. Those things have to all start \nsomewhere, but the recognition is let's be realistic in terms of when \nwe are going to see the results.\n  People want to know, What does it mean to me today? We need to \nappreciate the fact that we have to look to what it is going to mean to \nus tomorrow. With the provisions we have put in place, hopefully we \nwill not see the blackout we had a couple years back. We have enhanced \nthe reliability standards of our electricity grids so that we are not \ngoing to see that.\n  Points have been made on the floor tonight that what will come out of \nthis Energy bill is not a cleaner America. I challenge that absolutely. \nThe provisions that have been put in place, the incentives that have \nbeen put in place, whether it is the clean coal gasification that will \nwork to reduce those emissions, to reduce the carbon, to make our air \nmore clean, our waters more clean--these are things we are putting in \nplace through the incentives. My colleague called them subsidies. The \nfact is, when you are changing technology, when you are making things \ndifferent to make them better, to make them cleaner, to make them more \nefficient, it is going to cost some money. Should we not help to make \nit cleaner, to make it more efficient? That is what the incentives are \nfor. So let's work to make those happen.\n  Think about these processes. We have provisions in place for enhanced \noil recovery, and in my State of Alaska, we have some aging oilfields \nout in the Cook Inlet. They have been producing and doing a darn fine \njob for a couple decades, but these fields are declining. With the \ntechnology and the processes now available, we can, through enhanced \noil recovery, through injection of the carbon dioxide, inject into \nthese aging wells, enhance the oil so that we get more oil from these \naging wells while we are sequestering the carbon. We have a win-win \nsituation. It is an environmentally more sophisticated and more helpful \nprocess, and we are getting more of the energy source we are seeking. \nIt is through these types of technologies that we benefit, that we \nproceed to win in so many different ways.\n  Again, I want to reinforce that what we will have an opportunity to \naccept tomorrow is a comprehensive policy, a policy that has balance to \nit, that is not totally loaded to the production side.\n  I come from a State where, quite honestly, we want to see additional \nproduction coming out of the State of Alaska because we have the \nresource there and we want to be able to help meet the Nation's energy \nneeds. But we know--I know--that is not necessarily the energy for the \nlong-term future of this country; that the direction we take is in the \narea of renewables and the alternatives. We have to start. We are \nmaking a start with this legislation.\n  It is not just a focus on production, it is the renewables, the \nbiomass, the geothermal, the solar, the wind, ocean currents; we have \nocean energy for the first time. Think about the possibility of \nharnessing the currents in our oceans, the temperature differentials in \nthe ocean waters. There is so much potential out there.\n  Again, when we are talking about new technology and new processes, it \ntakes a little bit of money, it takes a little bit of help, and this is \nwhere we can step in to provide that.\n  Senator Bingaman made a comment at the conclusion of his initial \nremarks that we do not want to wait another 13 years to take up an \nenergy policy again. It is probably premature to be talking about the \nnext energy policy when we have not even concluded this one, but I \nthink we need to recognize that what is happening in this country now \nand as we collaborate with other nations in clean energy research, the \ntechnology changes so quickly--or we hope we can encourage the \ntechnology to change so quickly--that we have to keep on top of this. \nWe have to have an energy policy that is current, that does look toward \ntomorrow. So we want to make sure this is not the end of the \nconversation, that once we conclude with the Energy bill, we close the \nbooks and don't start looking at it for another 10 years. I am not \nwilling to do that, and I think most of my colleagues would be joining \nme in saying we need to be constantly on top of and involved with this.\n  I want to comment before I conclude that there have been several of \nmy colleagues on the other side who have mentioned there is absolutely \nnothing in this Energy bill that reduces our reliance on foreign \nsources of oil, that, in fact, we become more dependent on foreign oil. \nI do have to tell my colleagues, as one of the Senators from Alaska who \nhas been very focused on ANWR and opening ANWR, I am sitting back in my \nchair here listening to this, scratching my head--scratching my head--\nbecause they are saying to me we are not doing anything to reduce our \nreliance on foreign sources of oil, we must do more domestically.\n  We have been saying we have a portion of the answer. Opening ANWR is \nnot going to make us not rely on foreign sources of oil. We know that. \nBut it can help us. Should we not be doing all that we can domestically \nto help us?\n  I know the critics and that we are going to go into this argument in \nSeptember all over again so I do not need to take the body's time \ntonight to dwell on these facts, but for those who say there is not \nenough there to make a difference, the mean estimate coming out of ANWR \nwill be what we have been getting from the State of Texas\n\n[[Page S9267]]\n\nfor the past 75 years. The mean estimate coming out of ANWR is what we \nhave received from Saudi Arabia for 25 years. That is not insignificant \namounts of oil. This can help us.\n  ANWR is not contained in this Energy bill, much to my dismay. The \nHouse included it on their side. We know that in the Senate ANWR, when \nit was tried to be placed in the Energy bill, was subject to a \nfilibuster. It was subject to a filibuster by some of the same \nindividuals who tonight have stood and said this Energy bill does not \nprovide for any lessening of foreign dependence on oil. Well, I would \nlike to suggest that this energy policy that we are about to vote on \ntomorrow is one piece of what we need to look to as a Nation. The piece \ntomorrow will be the piece that includes the focus on conservation, the \nfocus on renewables, alternatives, the focus on efficiencies.\n  Last year we were successful in moving forward the Natural Gas Act \nthat provided incentives for construction of the natural gas pipeline \ncoming out of Alaska, where we hope we will be able to provide to this \nNation a good source of domestic natural gas. That is a huge piece for \nus. I would also like to think that before the end of the year we would \nalso be able to put into place the rest of the comprehensive energy \npolicy that would include oil coming out of a tiny sliver of the \nCoastal Plain of Alaska's North Slope.\n  I publicly thank Chairman Domenici and the ranking member, Senator \nBingaman, of the Energy Committee. Both Senators did an incredible task \nshepherding this legislation through the floor. Their staffs were \nexcellent. There was a great deal of hard work. It was a pleasure to \nsit in my first conference and see the manner in which it was \nconducted. It was a very open, very respectful deliberation of some \nvery difficult issues conducted by the Members on our side as well as \nChairman Barton from the House side. It was a pleasure to be a part of \nit. I am proud of the product that has come out of this body, and I \nurge the Members' support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this Energy bill. \nEven though I am opposed to the bill, I first want to pay my \ncompliments to both Senators from New Mexico, Mr. Dominici and Mr. \nBingaman, for the work that they have done. While I am opposed to the \nEnergy bill for a variety of reasons, which I will elucidate in a \nminute, it was Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici who worked very \nhard to make the bill better.\n  The bill that left the Senate was considerably better. I thought the \nHouse bill could not have been much worse. The bill that comes back to \nus obviously is somewhere in between. Without the efforts of the two \nSenators from New Mexico, it would have been considerably worse.\n  I want to say one other thing. It was of monumental strength that the \nodious MTBE provisions that the House had clung so steadfastly to, that \nbrought the bill down last time it came around, are not in the bill. \nThat is because the Senate, on the Democratic and Republican sides, \nhung tough. The MTBE provisions were a disaster. To reward polluters \nand stick taxpayers who had lost their supplies of drinking water with \na bill for what had happened would have been a disgrace. To pay the \nMTBE companies over $2 billion because they could no longer sell as \nmuch of their product as before was doing what we do for very few \nbusinesspeople who produce far more worthy products.\n  So I want to compliment my two colleagues for knocking out that \nprovision. It is the reason we are sitting here with a conference \nreport.\n  Let me talk about one provision in the bill that bothers me greatly \nbut then talk about what bothers me more than that because what bothers \nme most is not what is in the bill but what is not in the bill. What is \nin the bill is an ethanol provision that will force people on the \ncoasts, States that do not grow much corn, to buy ethanol whether they \nneed it or not. I understand the need to help agriculture. I have voted \nfor many of those types of provisions myself. I know the dairy farmers, \napple growers and cherry growers in New York State, and they do need \nsome help. I am not adverse at all to the Government helping. But this \n``Gyro Gearloose'' way of helping the corn growers of the Middle West \nby foisting the costs upon drivers, particularly on the east and west \ncoasts, at a time when gasoline is already $2.30, $2.40 or $2.50, makes \nno sense.\n  We want to keep the air clean, and we need to make sure that gasoline \nburns, but there are many ways to do it, not only with ethanol or \nMTBEs. To require the refiners throughout the country to use MTBE or at \nleast pay for MTBE, even when they are not going to use it, is a \ndisgraceful subsidy. We already subsidize ethanol heavily, and it is \nvery unfair to do it.\n  If one wants to encourage ethanol, I have no problem with encouraging \nthe creation of ethanol plants in places such as New York or maybe \nNevada, where there is not much ethanol now. The real cost of ethanol \nis not in making it but in transporting it. While it is dubious, recent \nstudies have shown that the energy cost into making ethanol exceeds the \nenergy benefit into using it as a substitute for gasoline. Nonetheless, \ngrowing it near the source of use would make it far more efficient. I \nam very regretful that it is in here.\n  New York drivers will pay 5, 6, 7 cents a gallon more than they have \nto because of this ethanol provision. It is unfair to make the \nsalesperson in Rochester who drives 500 or 600 miles a day and has \nenough trouble earning a living pay a direct subsidy to a corn grower \nin Iowa, however much that corn grower needs help. It is not a way to \ndo business, and yet that is what we have done here.\n\n  So the ethanol provision is rotten. The ethanol provision is a \nboondoggle. The ethanol provision occurs only because of the political \npower of the ethanol makers and the growers of corn in the Middle West \nand some other parts of the country, not because it is right. It is \nindefensible on the merits. It should not be in the bill.\n  Having said that, what bothers me even more is what is not in the \nbill. I love this country, and I try to think what could make this \ncountry decline, what has made other great powers decline, whether it \nis the Roman Empire or Great Britain in the 19th century. When one \nreads history, it is that they became so preoccupied with enjoying \nthings day to day that they were unable to look beyond the horizon a \nlittle bit and try to solve problems that might be upon them 5 or 10 \nyears down the road. That is exactly what we are doing with energy.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil, our lack of being able to solve our \ngrowing energy needs is a crisis in the making. It is not a crisis \ntoday, but it is going to be a crisis 5 and 10 years from now. Even \nnow, energy costs are akin to a slit on the wrist. We slowly bleed and \nit weakens our economy.\n  Yet, in this bill, we do some things but not close to enough, and \nnothing major and nothing of vision to reduce our dependence on fossil \nfuels in general and imported fossil fuels, in particular. \nConservation--we know that we should do both things. I do not disagree \nwith the far left or the far right. The far left, conserve only, get \nrid of fossil fuels; far right, produce more oil, forget about \nconservation. We should be doing both. I am not adverse to better \nutilizing fossil fuels, to figuring out coal gasification, even to \nlooking at oil and gas reserves off our coasts, if it is done in a \ncareful and pro-environmental way, as it was done when we sold some \ntract in the east Gulf several years ago.\n  Conservation has to be part of any plan to reduce our energy \ndependence. CAFE standards, not in the bill; major incentives for \nconservation, not in the bill, even mild provisions, such as the \nSenator from Oregon offered to raise CAFE standards a mile per gallon a \nyear were rejected. That is because of the cloud of the big three auto \ncompanies in America and, frankly, I regret to say, the unions that \nserve them. They have been arguing for the status quo for years. For \nthat reason now, I hate to say it but foreign automakers are again \novertaking them.\n  We have to look to the future. I am happy to help our auto industry \nwith new incentives to figure out ways to burn less fossil fuel and \nhave alternative sources, but we are not doing it. It is no good for \nthe auto companies, it is no good for the autoworkers, and it is no \ngood for America.\n  So conservation is not in the bill, nor is a dramatic program to \nreduce our\n\n[[Page S9268]]\n\nenergy independence. There are some subsidies here and there for wind \npower, solar power and biomass. There are subsidies for coal, gas and \noil. But the emergency that we face to really engage in crash programs, \nto use hydrogen better, to use fuel cells better, to find other \nalternatives, is virtually a necessity or will be a necessity 5 years \nor 8 years from now, lest our economic vitality continue to be sapped.\n  It is amazing to me that China, a country not regarded for its fealty \nto the environment, has stronger CAFE standards, stronger incentives \nfor alternatives to gas and oil than we do. That is a sign that this \ngreat American experiment, this noble experiment, as the Founding \nFathers called it, may be at least in this area losing its bearings. If \nwe are more interested in providing immediate subsidies to the powerful \nfew in the energy industry who are around us than figuring out a grand \nplan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and on fossil fuels in \ngeneral, we are not serving the people of America.\n  The amazing thing is I think the people of America are ready for a \nvision, if we look at all the surveys, finding a way to be independent \nof imported oil.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Dependence on foreign oil gets our foreign policy \ntwisted in a knot, which, of course, saps our country of wealth every \nminute, every second, 365 days a year, and the American people want \nsome change. They are willing to make some sacrifice and tighten their \nbelts. As China is ahead of America in this area, the American people \nare ahead of this Congress. Again, we seem more concerned with feeding \nparticular special interests, some good, some bad, than we do with \ncoming up with a vision as to how we are going to reduce our energy \nindependence.\n  So is this bill an evil, horrible bill? No. The ethanol provision is \nodious, but the bill on balance may take a small, few steps forward, \nbut not close to what is needed. I cannot think of an area, in a large \npolicy way, where the needs and the political possibilities are not far \nahead of what we have done tonight.\n  I regret to say I am going to vote against this bill, not only \nbecause of the ethanol provisions in it, but because at a time \ndemanding vision, at a time demanding foresight, at a time demanding an \neffort to solve problems that are only problems today but could become \ncrises 5 years from now, we have done mostly the prosaic, the mundane, \nthe expected. That is not what a great power does. That is not what \ntrue leaders do. That is what this bill does.\n  So despite my respect for the leaders of the bill and the wonderful, \nharmonious way in which they worked, I have to say, to me, this bill is \na serious disappointment and I have no choice but to vote against it \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nenergy conference report. I thank the managers of the bill, the two \nSenators from New Mexico, for their diligent effort in putting together \nan energy bill. While I cannot support the final product, I respect \nthat they have made every effort to make this a bipartisan process and \nI thank them for their leadership.\n  I voted against the Senate energy bill last month because it \ninadequately addresses several major priorities that should be included \nin a sound energy policy--reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, \nimplementing CAFE standards, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions that \ncause global warming, and protecting the coastline from offshore energy \ndrilling.\n  Unfortunately, the bill has only become worse in conference and \namounts to a missed opportunity to create an effective comprehensive \nenergy policy. This bill does not do enough to lead this Nation toward \nenergy independence and energy security.\n  The bill also does not address an issue that faces Americans daily--\nsoaring gas prices. A a time when gas prices are skyrocketing and our \ndependency on oil is steadily increasing, we are voting on a bill that \nthe President himself has said will do nothing to address those prices. \nThe people of New Jersey, and in fact this Nation, deserve a bill that \ntackles this problem. I'm sure all Americans will be disappointed to \nknow that instead of helping them at the gas pump, the bill provides \ngiveaways to the Nation's fossil fuel industries.\n  To truly make a dent in our energy independence, we need at least a \nsavings of three to five million barrels of oil per day, yet this bill \ndoes not include any oil savings provision. Furthermore, this bill \nmisses an opportunity to effectively reduce this Nation's oil use by \nincreasing the fuel economy of passenger vehicles. Indeed, improving \nfuel efficiency, or CAFE, standards is not only a cost effective way to \nimprove our energy security, but it would be instrumental in reducing \nsoaring greenhouse gas emissions. During the debate on the Senate \nenergy bill, Senator Durbin proposed an amendment that would have \nraised CAFE standards and closed the SUV loophole, both of which would \nsave this country over 101 billion gallons of oil by the year 2016.\n  In addition, the bill does not do enough to encourage the use of \nrenewable energy sources. One of the few good provisions of the Senate \nenergy bill was the ten percent renewable portfolio standard. My home \nState of New Jersey has been a leader in the area of renewable \nportfolio standards as it already has a 20 percent RPS. It is about \ntime that the rest of the Nation follow suit. A Federal RPS is a \ncrucial step in weaning this country from its dependence on foreign oil \nsources and I am disappointed that this conference report excludes this \nprovision.\n\n  The bill also includes a seven and a half billion gallon ethanol \nmandate. Those in favor of an ethanol mandate claim that it will \nenhance U.S. energy security. In fact, increasing the renewable fuel \nstandard would not significantly reduce U.S. oil imports because each \ngallon of gasoline blended with ethanol to make gasohol has less energy \nin it than regular gasoline. Therefore, we need increased petroleum \nproduct imports to make up that energy loss. In addition, producing \nethanol requires a significant amount of fossil fuel. Worst of all, the \nethanol mandate amounts to a new gas tax for my constituents. With the \ncost of living in New Jersey being one of the highest in the Nation and \ngas prices at an all-time high, an ethanol mandate is not acceptable \nfor New Jerseyans.\n  I am also extremely disappointed that energy conferees voted down an \namendment in conference that would have stricken the seismic inventory \nof the Outer Continental Shelf. This seismic inventory is paramount to \nopening the door to drilling off the coast of New Jersey. This is a \ncrucial issue for the state of New Jersey.\n  My State is the East Coast hub for oil refining and with three \nnuclear power plants, many traditional power plants, and hopefully an \nLNG terminal in the near future. We have made these contributions to \nenergy production and we have made them without offshore drilling.\n  A seismic inventory threatens New Jersey's way of life. It is a \nslippery slope toward drilling that threatens not only New Jersey's \nenvironment, but also its economy. Drilling endangers New Jersey's \npristine beaches as well as jeopardizes the tourist industry, which \ngenerates $5.5 billion in revenue for my State and supports 800,000 \njobs. Furthermore, the seismic explosions put our marine life and \nfisheries at risk. I made my opposition to undermining the moratoria on \ndrilling in the Outer Continental Shelf when I spent hours on the floor \nduring the Senate energy debate to defend against amendments that would \nweaken the moratoria in any way. That effort was successful, but this \ninventory that remains in the bill will weaken the current moratoria on \ndrilling, and I am very concerned about the potential consequences.\n  Another major issue that the energy conference report fails to \naddress is climate change--one of the most pressing issues facing our \nplanet today. The science makes it increasingly clear that that \ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity are changing the \nearth's climate. The rest of the industrialized world understands the \ndanger of this problem and the United States must catch up.\n  I have long been a proponent of legislation that would counter this \nproblem and encourage reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. My \nadvocacy on behalf of climate change legislation is not limited to the \ncurrent Congress.\n\n[[Page S9269]]\n\nSenator Brownback and I led the way to passing a greenhouse gas \nregistry and reporting amendment to the Energy Bills in the 107th and \n108th Congresses. The current voluntary programs encourage reductions \nfrom only a small group of industry leaders, and have little to no \neffect on most of the economy. Despite these well-intended programs, \ngreenhouse gas emissions have risen on average one percent per year for \nthe last several years. Our Nation can do better.\n\n  The potential effects of global warming are dire for my State. If we \ndo not control climate change, New Jersey could face a receding \ncoastline along the shore, loss of habitat in our beautiful beach towns \nlike Cape May, and more extreme weather events such as storms and \nflooding. Similar to the effects of the seismic inventory, this \ndevastation would directly affect New Jersey's economy. If our beaches \nare threatened, and our coastline damaged, New Jersey will see an \neconomic impact of catastrophic proportions. Our second largest \nindustry, tourism, will be devastated.\n  This is an issue for New Jersey and the rest of the United States, \nbut it is also an issue for the world. Unless Congress acts, the \neffects of global warming may be devastating to the worldwide economy \nand environment.\n  Finally, while the bill does not include the MTBE liability provision \nthat has stalled past energy bills, it does include a provision that \nmoves MTBE claims from State court to Federal court when the claims are \nbased on State tort law, nuisance law, or consumer law. This provision \namounts to backdoor immunity for MTBE producers by unfairly depriving \ninjured parties and their representatives of their right to have their \nclaims heard in their State forum. This language could even derail many \nlegal claims entirely, effectively shielding those companies \nresponsible for MTBE contamination from their full financial liability \nfor the damages they have caused. This is unacceptable.\n  I voted against this bill when it was in the Senate with the hope \nthat it would have been improved in conference. Unfortunately, the bill \nhas only been made worse. A sound energy bill must move this country \ntoward energy security and independence. This bill does not come close. \nI must, therefore, vote against this conference report and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rose earlier to discuss my general \nthoughts regarding the Energy bill conference report. I now want to \ntake an additional moment to provide my thoughts regarding a specific \nprovision in this conference report.\n  I am pleased the conference report includes provisions that will help \nsome of our most vulnerable citizens, low-income energy consumers. \nWhile we need to protect against energy price volatility to protect our \neconomy, industries and households, nobody is harder hit by high-energy \nprices than low-income energy consumers.\n  The conference report increases the authorization for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, from $2.0 billion to $5.1 \nbillion to reflect the increased demand for energy assistance due to \nhigh energy prices. At current funding levels, LIHEAP serves less than \n15 percent of the eligible population. The increased funding \nauthorization is much needed. I hope we can also increase \nappropriations to meet this increased demand for energy assistance.\n  The conference report also contains a provision originating in the \nHouse bill that authorizes the Secretary of Interior to begin a new \nprogram to assist low-income energy consumers. Section 342 of the \nreport authorizes the Secretary to grant a ``preference'' to low-income \nenergy consumers when disposing of royalty in kind gas.\n  This provision originated from a constituent of mine, John Harpole, \nwho is the president of a natural gas production company and also an \nadvocate for low-income energy consumers. Pursuant to this \nauthorization the Secretary of Interior may begin a demonstration \nprogram that would provide royalty in kind natural gas to low-income \nenergy consumers at below market cost. In order to do so, the Secretary \ncould enter into agreements with natural gas distribution companies to \nprovide them natural gas at below market value as long as they \nguarantee such gas will be delivered to low-income energy consumers. In \npractice, the transfer would occur through accounting mechanisms, not \nthe actual exchange of natural gas molecules.\n  The specific details of the demonstration project will be worked out \nthrough a public and transparent process that will include the public \nand all interested parties. The benefits provided under this section \nare intended to supplement and not supplant funds otherwise provided \nunder the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Finally, the \nSecretary would be required to issue a report to Congress on the \neffectiveness of the program, with specific recommendations for \nmodification. I look forward to working with you and the Department of \nInterior to implement this program.\n  Mr. President, America has an energy problem. We waste tremendous \namounts of energy, and that keeps prices high. We continue to consume \nmore energy than we produce, and that means our oil imports keep going \nup. And the more we are held hostage to foreign oil, the more our \nnational security is impacted.\n  I recognize that the energy conference report represents a compromise \nbetween competing House and Senate approaches to addressing our \nNation's energy needs. As with all compromises, the report is not \nperfect. Much remains to be done to promote energy independence and \nincrease our national security. But even so, this Energy bill is an \nimportant first step forward, and I support its final passage.\n  I am very pleased with many aspects of the Energy bill. The bill \nretained incentives for new, cleaner coal technologies, and incentives \nfor energy efficiency and conservation. It improves electric \nreliability standards and provides much needed regulatory reform. It \ncontains incentives for the production of wind and other renewable \nenergy, and it contains a strong renewable fuels standard to promote \nthe production and use of American-grown renewable energy sources such \nas ethanol and biodiesel.\n  By beginning to address our Nation's need to develop additional \nsources of energy and to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels, the \nSenate's bipartisan work on the Energy bill was more comprehensive and \nmore forward-thinking than the final version agreed to in conference. I \nam disappointed, for example, that the House and Senate conferees did \nnot retain the Senate's national renewable energy standard, and that \nother strategies for reducing our dependence on foreign oil are not \nincluded in the final bill. Conferees also decided to take a more \naggressive stance on oil shale development than I and my Senate \ncolleagues had advocated, and they rolled back certain environmental \nprotections. These changes could significantly impact Colorado's \nWestern Slope, and I will monitor the implementation of both provisions \nclosely.\n  Because there is so much more that we must do in this country to \nensure greater independence from foreign oil, I am going right back to \nwork. I believe strongly that we must reduce America's dependence on \nforeign sources of energy, particularly our dependence on foreign oil, \nand that we must do more to protect the environment. Greater energy \nindependence is vital to protect our national security. Energy \nindependence is also good for Colorado's economy--we are home to the \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, and to countless companies \nand entrepreneurs working on developing alternative fuels, including \nwind, biofuels, solar, and many, many other clean energy technologies. \nIn the Senate, I will continue to work hard to establish a viable \nnational renewable energy standard, to promote oil savings, to adopt a \nresponsible climate change policy, and for increased production of \nrenewable fuels. I will also continue to work on cost-effective \nmeasures that will help us achieve greater energy efficiency and \nconservation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate on these and other priorities for Colorado.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the conferees who have \nbeen meeting over the last few weeks to complete this comprehensive \nenergy legislation. In particular, I want to thank the chairmen and \nranking members of the House and Senate committees for their leadership \nin guiding this\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\nhighly complex and important legislation through the process. Congress \nhas tried several times to approve a comprehensive energy bill. Under \ntheir wise guidance and counsel, I believe that we will be successful \nthis time. It is critical that we provide the country with the \nresources and tools to meet our growing energy needs and this bill will \ngo a long way in accomplishing that goal.\n  There are many good and worthy provisions in this legislation. In \nbroad terms, having a national energy policy will enable the country to \nmore effectively utilize our resources to reduce our dependency on \nimported oil. It will enable us to diversify our sources of energy with \nrenewable fuels, develop resources like nuclear power in the future and \nconduct research into hydrogen fuel cells. The bill recognizes that we \nneed to develop ways to utilize one of our country's largest resources, \ncenturies worth of coal deposits, and develop ways through research to \nburn it cleanly so it doesn't contribute to pollution and harm our \nenvironment.\n  However, I must express my disappointment that many of the provisions \ndealing with MTBE were not ultimately included in the final bill. As a \nlawyer and a former judge, the issue of liability is an issue that is \nnear and dear to my heart. That we are denying liability protection to \nMTBE producers is disturbing to me. When Congress set out to encourage \nclean air by passing the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and passed a \nparticular fuel standard, Congress knew that MTBE would be widely used \nto satisfy the standard. As a result, manufacturers produced and \nmarketed MTBE to satisfy the Congressional standard. Now, manufacturers \nface significant lawsuits solely because they produced a product that \nCongress encouraged them to produce.\n  Manufacturers did not make mistakes in production, they did not cut \ncomers in an attempt to increase profits, and they did not try to trick \nconsumers. All they did was exactly what Congress wanted them to do. It \nis only fair that any fuel producer who responds to a congressional \nmandate should be protected against legal action based upon the use of \nthat mandated product. No one should be penalized for obeying the law. \nI am disappointed that there was a failure to address this issue.\n  Texas is proud of its heritage as an energy producing State. Texas \nwill continue to play a vital role in providing for the Nation's energy \nneeds. Even in light of my disappointments with the bill, I believe \nthat this legislation provides strong leadership and guidance to \naddress the critical energy needs of our country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have before us today an opportunity to \nchart a new course for the Nation's energy future.\n  The energy bill includes vitally important measures to boost \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency, to improve our electricity \ngrid, and to protect consumers from bad corporate actors like Enron.\n  I am very pleased that it includes the lion's share of the renewable \nfuels standard bill I introduced earlier this year with Dick Lugar and \nmany of my colleagues. This is an accomplishment of historic \nproportions. Oil refiners will be required to blend 7.5 billion gallons \nof ethanol and biodiesel annually by the year 2012--more than twice the \ncurrent rate. This RFS is 2.5 billion gallons higher than what was in \nthe House bill. Obviously, this is great news for farmers, biofuels \nproducers, and the rural economy in Iowa and throughout the country. It \nis the single most important provision in the bill, certainly in the \nnear term, to displace ever increasing amounts of foreign oil that we \nimport into this country. The RFS is a big step in the right direction \nand I am very proud to have helped get it done.\n  I am also excited that the ``bioeconomy'' amendment I authored with \nSenators Lugar, Obama, Coleman, and Bayh was included in the bill. It \ngives a real boost to biomass R to expand the production and use of \nbiobased fuels, chemicals and power. It provides grants to small \nbiobased businesses to get their products into the marketplace. It will \nincrease purchases of biobased products by the Federal Government by \nextending the farm bill's biobased purchasing preference to Federal \ncontractors and the Capitol complex. In short, with appropriate \nfunding, it will make it possible to convert much more biomass--corn, \nsoybeans, wheat, and other crops--into petroleum substitutes for \neveryday use in our homes, businesses and vehicles. And we will do it \nwithout negatively impacting our abundant food supply.\n  The RFS, complemented by these biobased initiatives, will be a heck \nof a one-two punch for our farmers, small businesses and rural \ncommunities.\n  I am also very pleased that the final bill extends the wind \nproduction tax credit, and that it includes my amendment to allow \nfarmer-owned co-ops to pass on this tax credit to individual members of \nthe co-op. The biodiesel tax credit extension is also a valuable asset \nin the bill. So is the tax credit for the installation of new E-85 \npumps. I have pushed for all of these provisions for some time. The tax \nincentives for renewable energy and conservation, while less than \nneeded, still represent a major boost for clean energy.\n  The energy bill we will soon vote on is by no means perfect. It drops \nseveral of the Senate's best bipartisan provisions to reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil--the Renewable Portfolio \nStandard, and the oil savings amendment, in particular. These were \ncommon sense provisions that should have been included. It is a \nterrible mistake not to have done so.\n  The bill also does too little to improve fuel economy and address \nclimate change. It lavishes tax breaks to oil companies reaping record \nprofits from $2+ a gallon gas, and spends more reviving a nuclear \nindustry that has never proven cost-effective and has not solved the \nproblem of nuclear waste. It also includes some very questionable \nenvironmental provisions to aid oil and gas companies.\n  Like I said, not a perfect bill, but it is a start, and we can thank \nthe bipartisan process that was taken in the Senate for that. The \nchallenge now will be to take the next steps toward a truly sustainable \nenergy future--one that our farmers, who are increasingly at the \nforefront of the country's clean energy strategy, can help lead. I will \ncontinue to work to make this a reality.\n  When we draw our energy from the corn and soybean fields of rural \nAmerica rather than the oil fields of the Persian Gulf, we do four \nthings: We increase America's energy security; we boost our rural \neconomy; we create a cleaner environment; and we put downward pressure \non prices at the pump. That's why I intend to vote for this bill, and I \nhope many of my colleagues will follow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Senators \nBingaman and Domenici for their hard work to develop a bipartisan \nenergy bill over the last several months.\n  When the energy bill came to the Senate floor, Democrats had one goal \nin mind: enhance our national security by moving America toward energy \nindependence.\n  Together, we were able to achieve some our goals: a renewable \nelectricity standard, the 3-year tax credit for renewables, oil \nsavings, global warming, and a Federal ban on MTBE. That's why I voted \nfor the Senate energy bill.\n  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts of our Senate negotiators, \nthe conference rejected all these provisions. I sincerely hoped to have \nbeen able to vote for the energy bill conference report. I cannot \nsupport the bill.\n  I truly believe we have missed an incredible opportunity to establish \na renewable electricity standard, provide help to consumers facing \nrecord prices at the gas pump and, most importantly, to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  For these reasons, I will vote against the energy bill conference \nreport.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to comment on two specific \nprovisions of the conference report. I am pleased that the provisions \ncontained in the conference report on hydroelectric relicensing, \nsection 241--Alternative Conditions and Fishways, have been improved \nover the provisions contained in both the House and Senate bills. I \ncontinue to have concerns that the new process for alternative \nmandatory conditions and fishway prescriptions will add complexity and \ndelay to the process. The requirement that the resource agencies afford \nall parties an opportunity for an on the record trial-type hearing on \nmaterial\n\n[[Page S9271]]\n\nissues of fact could prolong these proceedings. However, I understand \nthat the intent behind the provision is that these not be lengthy \nhearings. Rather they are to afford an opportunity for a review of \nnarrow issues of fact, and not a review of the application of the facts \nor the decisions based upon them.\n  I am pleased that the provisions allow all parties to the \nproceedings, including States, tribes and third parties, to participate \nequally. I understand the conference language ensures that the heads of \nthe resource agencies retain discretion to employ scientific data and \nother information submitted by any of the parties to licensing or \nrelicensing proceedings in determining what conditions will provide for \nadequate protection and use of tribal lands and what fishways are \nneeded for the protection of fishery resources for which the United \nStates has a legal or trust responsibility to preserve and protect on \nbehalf of Indian tribes. I also am satisfied that the conference \nlanguage preserves the principle that Indian lands and fishery \nresources held in trust by the United States, or for which the United \nStates has legal responsibility, will continue to be protected and \npreserved in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Federal \nPower Act of 1920 and subsequent rulings of the Federal courts that \nreaffirm these protections for tribal lands and fishery resources.\n  Finally, I understand the motivation behind these provisions to be an \neffort to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of conditions \nand fishways--and not to be an opportunity to undermine the conditions \nand fishways that resource agencies determine are necessary for the \nadequate protection of federal reservations and fish resources. I \nexpect that the resource agencies will carry out these provisions with \nthis intent in mind.\n  Mr. President, section 354, Enhanced Oil and Natural Gas Production \nThrough Carbon Dioxide Injection grants the Secretary authority to \nprovide royalty relief in order to achieve the dual purposes of the \nsection, which are both to promote the capturing, transporting, and \ninjection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon dioxide and \n``other appropriate gases or other matter'' for sequestration, and to \npromote oil and gas production by providing incentives to undertake \nenhanced recovery techniques using injection of these substances. It is \nmy understanding that the provision is intended to encourage the \nsequestration of greenhouse gases, and the ``other gases or matter'' \nreferred to are gases and matter that fall within that definition. I \nunderstand the intent to be that any royalty relief under this section \nbe made available only where doing so achieves the dual purposes of \nbenefitting the environment through sequestration of greenhouse gases \nwhile also bringing about enhanced recovery.\n\n\n                           BLM Cost Recovery\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Domenici, \nchairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and Senator \nBingaman, the ranking Democrat, and all the Senate conferees for their \nexcellent work on a number of areas in the conference report agreement \non H.R. 6, especially those relating to processing of energy permits. I \nwould like to point out one particular provision that will provide a \nbasis for future work to ensure more energy supplies from Federal \nlands.\n  Section 365 of the H.R. 6 conference agreement outlines a multistate \npilot program to improve coordination of energy permit processing in a \nnumber of Western States. That section includes a provision to allow a \nshare of the money from Federal oil and gas lease rentals to be used by \nthe Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and \nother agencies to ensure adequate resources for processing and \nconsidering applications for permits necessary for natural gas and oil \ndrilling and other operations.\n  As the conference on H.R. 6 was getting underway, the BLM released a \nproposal that, if implemented, would begin charging fees for permit \nprocessing. Called a ``cost sharing'' proposal, it was really a ``cost \nshifting'' one. And it came at a time when Federal revenues from \nleasing and production of Federal oil and gas as a result of such \npermits being issued total approximately $1.8 billion each year.\n  In one Wyoming office alone the proposed fee which could be as high \nas $4,000 for a single application would generate $11 million, far in \nexcess of the office's total oil and gas program budget. I would prefer \nthat producers put this money back into the communities where they are \ndoing business and expand their investment to produce more energy.\n  In the strong belief that the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto budget and pay for advance environmental work and consideration of \nthe permits necessary to explore and produce on its leased acreage, \nSenator Hatch and I filed an amendment to prevent the BLM from \ninstituting fees during the period of the permitting pilot program. I \nwas pleased that the House conferees joined my Senate colleagues in \napproving that amendment.\n  Now that the Energy bill conference agreement is before us, I hope \nthat my colleagues will agree that in the future we need to provide \nadequate Federal funding for energy permitting, and that we should \ncontinue to prohibit attempts to shift Government costs to the private \nsector as was attempted by the BLM.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I would like to associate \nmyself with his remarks and make an additional point. As a sponsor of \nthe Energy bill amendment, I want to make clear that even though we \nwere able to stop the specific proposal on fees for processing of \napplications for permits to drill during the pilot program relating to \nsuch permitting, the BLM should understand that our concern is with the \nbroader issue of cost shifting. We would be as concerned if BLM \nproposed to shift the permitting burden for any fluid or solid mineral \nleasing or permitting to those who are already required to pay for \ntheir Federal mineral rights through bonuses, rents and royalties. I do \nnot want to see additional attempts to shift costs in this manner.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield? In listening to this discussion \nand the points being made by my colleagues, I agree that we should not \nbe shifting costs as BLM apparently proposed. Nor should other charges \nand fees for other energy and mineral permitting be put forward. We \nwant our companies to put that money in the ground, not in the Federal \nTreasury with no guarantee that any of it will be spent on better \nenergy permitting.\n  Surely out of the $1.8 billion already being received from industry's \nexploration and development of Federal oil and gas resources alone we \ncan fund the planning, environmental, permit processing and other \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues were successful in amending the \nenergy conference agreement to stop the cost sharing proposal and \ncommend them for doing so.\n  I would also like to point out that as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, I plan to \nhold hearings this Congress on Federal lands energy and mineral access. \nAs part of that hearing, I intend to find out more about the ability of \nour Federal agencies to process leasing, drilling and other \napplications in a timely manner. Delaying permits is the same as \ndelaying energy and mineral supplies to those who need them.\n  In addition, shifting costs to those who need the permits for any of \nthese activities is also a way of discouraging what needs to be done to \nfind and produce the supplies we need. As a result, I will be glad to \nconsider including this subject in our hearings.\n\n\n                        seawater cooling systems\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend from Iowa, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, as well as my friend, Senator \nBaucus, the ranking member of the committee in a brief colloquy.\n  There is an important project under consideration in Hawaii that \nwould use deep seawater to cool buildings in downtown Honolulu. This \nproject may be funded, in part, by private activity bonds. I would like \nto ask whether piping used to bring cold water from the ocean to the \ndistributional facility would be considered part of the local system \nconsisting of a pipeline or network, which may be connected to a \ncooling source, providing chilled water to two or more users for \nresidential, commercial or industrial cooling as provided in section \n142(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is my understanding that if a traditional plant\n\n[[Page S9272]]\n\nwere constructed several miles from its customers, the network to \ndeliver cooling would qualify. It seems to me that piping used to draw \ncold water from the ocean is analogous to piping used with respect to a \ntraditional cooling system and also should qualify.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur with the chairman. The piping in this case is \nintegral to the delivery of cold water from the ocean to be used in the \nchilling of residential, commercial and other buildings and therefore \nshould qualify for tax-exempt financing.\n\n\n                      Energy Efficient Appliances\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, with respect to the credit for energy \nefficient appliances, section 1334 of the Energy Policy Act, I \nunderstand that the dishwasher credit amount is based on a comparison \nof changes to the Department of Energy's Energy Star specification for \nits 2007 qualifying level as compared to the existing Energy Star \nqualifying level for this product. In particular, the amount of the \ncredit for these products to be provided is determined, in that \nsection, by calculating the percentage increase in efficiency--measured \nas an ``Energy Factor'' or ``EF''--from the 2005 Energy Star level to \nthe 2007 Energy Star level. The current Energy Star specification for \ndishwashers is measured by EF. There is the possibility that the Energy \nStar Program might change the metric for measuring efficiencies of \nthese products from EF to another measurement and this might create \nconfusion in the calculation and implementation of the credit. I would \nlike to ask the bill's manager if it is his understanding that the IRS \nhas the authority, in consultation with DOE, to establish an equivalent \nlevel of efficiency for dishwashers in case the Energy Star Program \nestablishes an efficiency metric for these products that is different \nthan the current EF metric.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the Senator's understanding of the IRS's \nauthority to consult with DOE in this regard, and to establish an \nequivalent level of efficiency for dishwashers for determining the \namount of the credit.\n\n\n                              section 1503\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to engage my friend, the \nSenator from New Mexico, who serves as the ranking member of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and who acted as the ranking Senate \nconferee, in a colloquy regarding the conference report on the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. I thank my friend for his service in this body and \nhard work on this bill, and particularly his efforts in resolving the \ncontentious issues surrounding MTBE remediation litigation. It is my \nunderstanding that the language contained in section 1503 of the \nconference report addresses this issue in a matter consistent with \ncurrent law on three vital fronts. First, it would in no way preclude \nor abrogate the right of citizens and local governments to pursue all \navailable State and Federal remedies where there is environmental harm \nand other injury that results from contamination of MTBE into \ngroundwater and public water supplies. Second, nothing in the language \nwill alter the substantive law that courts currently apply in these \ncases and that they will apply to future claims. And finally, it is not \nintended to provide Federal courts with exclusive or subject matter \njurisdiction or grant Federal courts jurisdiction over nonproduct \nliability cases, such as environmental cleanup and cost recovery cases \ninvolving general petroleum spills initiated by State governments and \nprivate citizens. Rather, it is intended that under section 1503, cases \ninvolving general spills will remain in State court, where many of \nthese cases are currently handled. Does the Senator from New Mexico \nshare my understanding of this language and its intent?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I share the understanding of the \nlanguage expressed by my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for sharing his \nunderstanding of section 1503.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the joint explanatory statement \naccompanying the conference report on the energy bill is noteworthy for \nits brevity, but somewhat short on explanations. The managers simply \ndid not have time to say more than we did if we were to file the \nconference report in time for both the House and Senate to act on it \nbefore the August recess.\n  As a result, the statement of managers omits explanations of several \nimportant provisions that many of us believe are key to understanding \nthe agreements we reached on these issues and the meaning of these \nprovisions. In some cases, specific text had already been negotiated \nand agreed upon for inclusion in the managers' statement, and the \nassurance that the agreed upon text would be included in the managers' \nstatement was a critical component of the compromise reached on the \nlegislative text.\n  Would the senior Senator from New Mexico, as the chairman of the \nSenate conferees, be willing to put these explanations on the record \nfor the information of all Senators?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would be happy to. Senator Bingaman is \ncorrect. We had agreed upon text for insertion into the managers' \nstatement on a number of provisions, but it was left out in order to \nfile the conference report in time for us to complete our work this \nweek. I agree that those explanations should be placed on the record \nfor the information of all Senators.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The first of these explanations relates to section 210, \nwhich establishes two grant programs to improve the use of forest \nbiomass for energy production. Section 210 was included in response to \nFederal land managers and other experts that have recommended removing \nsome of the slash, brush, pre-commercial thinnings, and other non-\nmerchantable wood and plant material from many of our forests to \nimprove forest health and reduce the threat of uncharacteristic \nwildfire.\n  One hurdle that must be overcome is that in many regions of the \ncountry there currently are few economically viable enterprises using \nthis type of biomass. If a viable market for these materials existed, \nthe ultimate cost of forest restoration treatments would decrease as \nlandowners who currently pay to have this biomass removed could sell it \nat a profit.\n  During the conference, we deliberated about the potential for the \ngrants authorized by these programs to adversely affect current and \nfuture markets for using such material for other value-added products \nthat are not provided grants through these programs. Along with biomass \nenergy, alternative markets are a critical element of the effort to \nmake forest health treatments cost-effective. This was a significant \nconcern, was it not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman is correct. Section 210 was \nspecifically drafted to address the concern he identified by focusing \non nonmerchantable biomass that would not otherwise be used. It was our \nintent that the Secretaries implement the grant programs with \nsensitivity to alternative uses--both current and future--for the \nbyproducts of preventive treatments, to the affects of other grants or \nsupport for encouraging the use of forest biomass that are provided \npursuant to any other authority, and to the potential for alternative \nuses to provide a greater return to the taxpayer in the long run.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the second of these issues relates to \noil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The \nNaval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 established the \nNational Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Four years later, the Department \nof the Interior Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1981, Public Law 96-\n514, directed the Secretary of the Interior to open the Reserve to \ncompetitive oil and gas leasing, subject to specific terms and \nconditions.\n  Both the House bill and the Senate amendment transferred the \ncompetitive leasing program in the appropriations act into the Naval \nPetroleum Reserves Production Act. The Senate amendment went further, \nhowever, by requiring the Secretary of the Interior to prevent, to the \nmaximum extent practicable, and to mitigate, adverse effects from \nleasing and development activities. The conference report omits this \nadditional Senate language.\n  It is my understanding, however, that the Senate language was omitted \nbecause the Department of the Interior is already interpreting the \nstandard in existing law in the manner set forth in the Senate \nlanguage. For that reason, the conferees decided that the language was \nunnecessary. Is that the case?\n\n[[Page S9273]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. It is my understanding that the \ntransfer of the matter under section 347(a)(2) does not affect or \notherwise modify the standard for activities undertaken pursuant to \nPublic Law 96-514. The Senate included language in section 107(b) of \nthe Senate bill relating to mitigation of adverse effects that the \nmanagers have not adopted as unnecessary. It is the understanding of \nthe managers that the Department of the Interior is interpreting the \ncurrent standard in the manner set forth in the Senate language.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Finally, the conference report contains an entire title \ndesigned to help Native Americans promote the development of tribal \nenergy resources, including an innovative program of tribal energy \nresource agreements. Would the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nconferees comment on this title?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to, Mr. President. The managers \nrecognized the large supply of energy resources existing on Indian \nlands, as well as the desire of many Tribes to increase access to those \nresources. The Indian Energy title is designed to provide economic \ndevelopment opportunities to Indian tribes by assisting and empowering \nthem to develop and utilize tribal energy resources in a manner that \nmeets the needs of Indian country and the Nation as a whole.\n  The title will also continue and strengthen efforts to improve access \nto electricity for native people who are ten times more likely to be \nwithout such access than their counterparts residing outside of Indian \nreservations. Of particular note, is the creation of a new Office of \nIndian Energy Policy and Programs within the Department of Energy that \nis dedicated to working with Indian tribes on energy development \nmatters.\n  The Title also creates a new program in section 503 related to energy \nleases, agreements, and rights-of-way on tribal lands that continues a \npolicy of promoting tribal self-determination while preserving the \ntrust relationship between Tribes and the Federal Government. The \nleases, agreements, and rights-of-way section preserves the full \napplication of Federal environmental laws while authorizing eligible \nTribes to approve individual energy projects without duplicative \nFederal approvals.\n  The title contains several other provisions, all of which the \nmanagers believe will provide significant benefits to Indian country.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank Senator Domenici for placing these explanations \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, before I yield back the remaining time, since I see \nthere are no additional Senators waiting to speak, unless there are \nsome who appear, I want to take a few minutes to thank committee staff \nfor the excellent work that went into the development of this bill. We \nhave had superb staff work here in the Senate on the Democratic side \nand the Republican side. I particularly want to single out the staff \nmembers on the Democratic side who have worked so hard, over many \nweeks, months, and even years in the development of this legislation. \nTo the extent this work product is a step forward, it is a result of \ntheir hard work and their commitment, and clearly this is an \naccomplishment which could not have been achieved without that \nexcellent work.\n  Bob Simon is the staff director on the Democratic side. He has done a \nsuperb job. Sam Fowler is the chief counsel and also has done yeoman \nwork. Vicky Thorne; Bill Wicker; Patty Beneke; Deborah Estes; Mike \nConnor; Jennifer Michael; Leon Lowery; Jonathan Black; Al Stayman; \nScott Miller; David Brooks; Michael Carr; Sreela Nandi, who is an AAAS \nfellow sponsored by the American Chemical Society who works with our \ncommittee staff; Tara Billingsley, who is a Department of Energy \ndetailee who worked with the committee in May and June of this year; \nAmanda Goldman; Mark Wilson; Jonathan Epstein, who is a fellow in my \npersonal office who also worked hard on various aspects of this \nlegislation; and James Dennis in my office, who worked on the tax \nprovisions of the bill.\n  In addition, I want to acknowledge the extremely capable staff on the \nRepublican side, in particular Alex Flint, who was mentioned by Senator \nDomenici earlier, the staff director; Judy Pensabene, who is the chief \ncounsel on the Republican side; and the other many staff members who I \nam sure will be recognized by Senator Domenici before action on this \nlegislation is complete.\n  Let me also acknowledge key House staff who worked so hard during \nthis conference committee that we concluded: Mark Menezes, who is \ncounsel for Chairman Joe Barton; Sue Sheridan and Bruce Harris, who are \ncounsels for the ranking member on the House side, Congressman John \nDingell. \n  All of these individuals whom I named made a tremendous contribution \nto this legislation and all of them deserve our great thanks. No \nconstructive work is done here in the Congress without this kind of \nexcellent staff work and we are very fortunate in the case of this \nlegislation.\n  I am informed there are no other Senators wishing to speak at this \npoint. I am also informed we will have additional time tomorrow for \nstatements before any actual votes occur on or in relation to the \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor at this time.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young man from \nIllinois whose future was full of promise and hope. Last summer, 18-\nyear-old Brett Karlin of Buffalo Grove, IL, was anticipating a summer \nof youthful fun. Just weeks after his graduation from Adlai E. \nStevenson High School, on July 30, 2004, Brett and his best friend Andy \nset out on a fateful drive through the outskirts of a neighboring \nsuburban town. Neither Andy nor Brett was under the influence of drugs \nor alcohol, and Brett's seatbelt was fastened, but it was little help \nas they raced over the posted 30-mile-per-hour speed limit. As they \npushed the speedometer of the Honda Accord they were driving to 112 \nmiles per hour, the car skidded out of control and collided with a \ntree. The crash left twisted metal, protruding shards of shattered \nglass, and a head trauma that cost Brett his life 6 days later. A \nreckless pastime gone awry had cut a promising life short and left a \ngrieving family in its wake.\n  Unfortunately, tragedies like Brett's occur each day. According to a \n2003 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more \nthan 4,700 U.S. teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 died of \ninjuries caused by motor vehicle crashes in 2001. In my home State, \nteenagers make up only 6 percent of all Illinois drivers, but they \naccount for 16 percent of all crash fatalities. We must work to prevent \nthese tragic losses, and one of the ways we can do that is by \nencouraging legislators, teachers, and parents to educate America's \nteenage drivers about driver safety.\n  To memorialize Brett's life, Brett's father, Michael Karlin, founded \nthe Brakes for Brett nonprofit organization. Through peer presentations \nto high schools and religious and community groups, and by maintaining \nan informational Web site, Mr. Karlin, Andy, and other friends of Brett \neducate young adults about the dangers associated with reckless \ndriving. I commend Mr. Karlin and those who collaborate with the Brakes \nfor Brett organization for their work to save the lives of young \ndrivers.\n  Together, we can work to alert teens to the hazards associated with \nspeeding and joyriding, including its social, emotional, psychological, \nand financial effects.\n  In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated \nthat the economic costs of both fatal and nonfatal police-reported \ncrashes involving drivers age 15 to 20 were approximately $40.8 \nbillion. Our Nation\n\n[[Page S9274]]\n\nbears nearly three-fourths of these costs, primarily through medical \nexpenses, increased insurance premiums, taxes, and lost worker \nproductivity.\n  Yet these costs pale in comparison to the agony endured by parents, \nfamilies, and friends of a teen driver whose life ends tragically and \nprematurely.\n  Brett Karlin's family, despite their immense pain and grief, made the \ngenerous decision to donate Brett's organs, providing the opportunity \nfor others to live. That opportunity to give the gift of life often \ncomes in the wake of sudden tragedy. When families embrace that \nopportunity, organ donation often provides renewed hope for the donor's \nfamily as well as for the recipients whose lives are saved by the \ndonation.\n  A new person is added to the national organ donation waiting list in \nAmerica every 13 minutes, and sadly, 17 people each day die waiting for \ntransplants that cannot take place because of the shortage of donated \norgans. Illinois is fortunate to have the country's largest donor \nregistry with more than 6 million participants. Although tremendous \nstrides in promoting organ donation have been made, more than 320 \nIllinois residents died in 2004 while waiting for an organ transplant.\n  I commend Brakes for Brett for its valuable educational efforts. \nToday we remember Brett Karlin's life and honor him by recommitting \nourselves to teen driver safety education and organ donation. Through \nthese and similar efforts, we can make great strides to preserve young \nlives that might otherwise be lost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9274-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

In each of the four programs, continuing \ndisability reviews, IRS tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol, and unemployment insurance, additional funding dedicated to \nprogram integrity can reduce improper payments and return money to the \ntreasury.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the situation in \nNepal, which has received too little attention by the Congress.\n  I will not take the time to discuss in detail the history of this \ntiny country wedged between China and India. Suffice it to say that not \nonly is Nepal among the world's least developed countries, it is also \nfacing a ruthless Maoist insurgency and a political crisis instigated \nby King Gyanendra which together threaten to turn Nepal into a failed \nstate.\n  Last year, after receiving disturbing reports of widespread human \nrights violations by the Royal Nepalese Army, including arrests, \ndisappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings of civilians, the \nCongress imposed a number of conditions on our military aid to Nepal. \nThose conditions required the Nepalese Government to (1) comply with \nhabeas corpus orders issued by the Supreme Court of Nepal; (2) \ncooperate with the National Human Rights Commission to identify and \nresolve all security related cases of individuals in government \ncustody; (3) grant the National Human Rights Commission unimpeded \naccess to all places of detention; and (4) take effective steps to end \ntorture by security forces and prosecute members of such forces who are \nresponsible for gross violations of human rights.\n  Unfortunately, not only have those conditions not been met, the \nsituation was made significantly worse on February 1 when King \nGyanendra, with the backing of the security forces, dissolved the \nmultiparty government, arrested and jailed political opponents, human \nrights activists and journalists, and declared a state of emergency. \nThe state of emergency has since been lifted, but civil liberties, \nincluding freedom of the press and association, remain restricted, the \nformer Prime Minister has been jailed for corruption by an \nextrajudicial, politically motivated anticorruption commission, and \narrests of journalists and democracy activists continue.\n  Speaking with one voice, the United States, Great Britain, and India \ncondemned the King's actions as a setback for democracy. They said it \nwould make it more difficult to resolve the Maoist problem, and each \ncountry imposed varying types of restrictions on military aid. Since \nthen, however, the American Embassy has adopted a more nuanced \napproach, sending mixed messages that have been widely interpreted as \ngiving equal consideration and validity to the views and actions of the \nKing and the political parties. Unfortunately, the impression today of \nNepalese pro-democracy and human rights activists is that the United \nStates is not fully behind them.\n  The army insists it is complying with habeas corpus orders of the \nsupreme court. This is deceiving, however, because the security forces, \noften in plain clothes, have been re-arresting people who the court has \nordered released. In some instances they have waited at the courthouse \nsteps to take people back into custody immediately after they are set \nfree by the court. Since these arrests are often made without charges, \nthe whereabouts and treatment of these people is often unknown.\n  In April, the term of the National Human Rights Commission expired \nand the Government reconstituted the Commission in a manner that was \nincompatible with the 1990 Nepalese Constitution. The membership of the \nCommission has also changed, with the exception of the chairman. Not \nsurprisingly, none of the current members, appointed by the palace, \nexpressed publicly any disagreement with the King's February 1 actions, \nincluding the arrests and curtailing of civil liberties. The chairman \nof the Commission even expressed support for the King's actions. This \nhas caused legitimate concerns about the Commission's independence.\n  There is conflicting information about the Government's cooperation \nwith the National Human Rights Commission in resolving security related \ncases of persons in custody. According to human rights groups, the \nsituation has not improved. The Commission has said it is getting \nbetter access to places of detention, but it is not clear how \nmeaningful this access is. We know there are large numbers of people \nwho have disappeared, yet we are informed that when members of the \nCommission visit army barracks they have seen few detainees, are led \naround by army escorts, and that some barracks where detainees were \nreported to be held were completely empty. There is a concern that the \narmy is summarily executing prisoners. Meanwhile, the International Red \nCross has suspended its visits to prisoners because of the army's \nfailure to provide the access it requires.\n  The issue of ending torture and prosecuting members of the security \nforces who commit gross violations of human rights is also difficult to \nassess. According to human rights groups, torture is routinely \npracticed and impunity remains the norm. The army claims it disciplines \nits members who violate human rights, but many of the cases it cites do \nnot involve human rights violations. According to the army officer who \nheads the army's human rights cell, complaints about human rights \nviolations by the army are ``much ado about nothing.'' Those words \nspeak volumes.\n  Under our law, the Secretary of State is to determine whether the \nconditions have been met. As a sponsor of the law, I would expect that \nprior to making any determination she would consult with \nrepresentatives of reputable human rights groups, including the U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as with the British and \nIndian Governments. It is important that we and they be seen as united \non these issues. In that regard, I would hope that she would consider \nthe implications of such a determination in the context of the larger \npolitical crisis. We do not want to do anything that could be seen as \nfurther evidence that the United States supports the King when he is \nusing the army and police to crush the forces of democracy.\n  Last week, the Senate revisited the conditions on our military aid \nfor Nepal. Since those conditions were enacted prior to February 1, \nthey have in large measure been eclipsed by subsequent events. The \nSenate determined that modifications were needed, and those changes \nwere adopted unanimously on July 20, 2005, in an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2006 State-Foreign Operations-appropriations bill.\n  Nepal is a breathtakingly beautiful country facing immense \nchallenges. The majority of its people are illiterate, subsistence \nfarmers who are caught between the Maoists, who extort money and food, \nforcibly recruit their children, and commit atrocities, and the army \nwhich mistreats and often shoots those suspected of sympathizing with \nthe Maoists.\n\n[[Page S9276]]\n\n  The King, while professing to support democracy, seems determined to \ntake the country back to the pre-1990 feudal days. This is not the \nfirst time he has dismissed the Prime Minister, and since February 1 he \nhas surrounded himself with elderly advisers from the Panchayat era. He \nhas ignored repeated urgings by our ambassador, and other governments, \nto sit down with representatives of the political parties to develop a \nplan for the prompt restoration of multiparty democracy.\n  As in any country where multiparty democracy has existed for only a \ndecade and a half, Nepal's fledgling political parties suffer from \ninternal divisions and are struggling to establish their credibility \nwith the Nepalese people. This should surprise no one. Democracy is \nnever perfect, and that is particularly true in an impoverished, \nisolated kingdom whose people have been ruled by a monarchy that \nignored their needs for centuries. Yet, despite these obstacles, \nNepalese journalists, political activists and civil society continue to \nspeak out.\n  What is the alternative? A Maoist ``people's republic'' that could \nplunge Nepal into darkness? A return to an active monarchy that is \naccountable to no one?\n  Nepal is at an historic juncture. The Maoists have made steady gains \nover the past decade. Once a minor irritant, today they are a national \nmenace. Even since 2001, when King Gyanendra ascended the throne and \nbecame commander in chief of the army, the Maoists have grown stronger. \nAlthough they are unable to hold territory or to seize power in \nKatmandu, they pose an increasing threat to the security and \nlivelihoods of Nepal's people.\n  The King has made a tragic blunder, and the Nepalese people are \npaying a heavy price.\n  Former Prime Minister Deuba is in prison, which the State Department \nhas rightly called a setback for democracy. This week there were new \narrests. On July 25, several dozen journalists and civil society \nleaders were arrested and detained for over 24 hours during a peaceful \nprotest. On July 27, a pro-democracy student leader, Gagan Thapa, was \narrested while attempting to visit fellow detained student leaders. Mr. \nThapa is reportedly being held on suspicion of sedition. His arrest is \na threat to all democracy activists and should be strongly condemned by \nthe State Department.\n  The King's strongest card is the army, but it lacks an effective \ncounterinsurgency capability, it cannot defeat the Maoists in territory \nas rugged and isolated as parts of Afghanistan, and it has abused and \nalienated the very people it is supposed to protect. The army needs to \ndemonstrate that it is worthy, if it wants U.S. support.\n  Earlier this year, in order to avoid criticism at the U.N. Human \nRights Commission, the King agreed to permit the U.N. High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights to open an office in Nepal and deploy human rights \nmonitors. This is a welcome development, which the U.S. should strongly \nsupport. If the UN monitors are provided with unimpeded access, they \nshould be able to determine if the Maoists are prepared to stop \nattacking civilians and recruiting children, and if the army is serious \nabout respecting international humanitarian law.\n  Recently, the U.N. Secretary General's Special Adviser traveled to \nNepal to assess the situation. He concluded that a solution to the \ncrisis rests on three elements: ``a return to constitutional order and \nmultiparty democracy, an end to hostilities, and inclusive national \ndialogue towards a negotiated solution to the underlying causes of \nconflict.'' The U.N. has a long history in Nepal, and it could play a \nkey facilitating role on each of these elements. I would hope that the \nState Department would publicly support this.\n  No one should minimize the challenges. The Maoists have yet to \ndemonstrate that they are ready to abide by a ceasefire, which should \nbe a prerequisite for negotiations on their political demands. But our \npolicy should be unambiguous. Democracy is the only viable alternative, \nand we should make clear that we unequivocally reject the King's \nimperial ambitions, that the days of an active monarchy are over, and \nthat we support the political parties. Whether that means the \nrestoration of the 1999 Parliament or the formation of a new \nconstituent assembly, is for the Nepalese people to decide, but there \nshould be no doubt that we support a political process that is open, \ntransparent, inclusive and accountable to the people.\n  Democracy and dialogue are the key to peace in Nepal, and we should \ndo everything possible to reaffirm our willingness to work with the \npolitical parties, with Nepalese civil society, the Indian Government, \nthe British Government, other key countries, and with the United \nNations, towards that end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment, which if agreed to by the \nSenate-House conference committee will apply to U.S. military aid for \nNepal for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2005, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Nepal.--\n       (1) The Congress condemns the Maoist insurgency's \n     atrocities against civilians, including torture, \n     extrajudicial killings, and forced recruitment of children.\n       (2) The Congress recognizes the difficulties the Royal \n     Nepalese Army (RNA) faces in countering the Maoist threat, \n     but deplores the violations of human rights by the RNA.\n       (3) Funds appropriated under the heading ``Foreign Military \n     Financing Program'' may be made available for assistance for \n     Nepal only if the Secretary of State certifies to the \n     Committees on Appropriations that the Government of Nepal, \n     including its security forces:\n       (A) has released all political detainees, including those \n     detained before February 1, 2005;\n       (B) has restored civil liberties, including due process \n     under law, freedoms of speech, the press and association, and \n     the right of movement;\n       (C) has demonstrated, through dialogue with Nepal's \n     political parties, a commitment to a clear timetable for the \n     return to multi-party, democratic government consistent with \n     the 1990 Nepalese Constitution;\n       (D) is ensuring that the Commission for Investigation of \n     Abuse of Authority is receiving adequate support to \n     effectively implement its anti-corruption mandate and that no \n     other anti-corruption body is functioning in violation of the \n     1990 Nepalese Constitution on international standards of due \n     process;\n       (E) has determined the number of and is complying with \n     habeas corpus orders issued by Nepal's Supreme Court and \n     appellate courts, including all outstanding orders, and the \n     security forces are respecting these orders;\n       (F) is restoring the independence of the National Human \n     Rights Commission of Nepal (NHRC) in accordance with \n     constitutional provisions, including providing adequate \n     funding and staff;\n       (G) is granting civilian prosecutors and judicial \n     authorities, the NHRC, the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal, and international \n     humanitarian organizations, unannounced and unimpeded access \n     to all detainees, witnesses, relevant documents, and other \n     requested information, and is cooperating with these entities \n     to identify and resolve all security related cases involving \n     persons in government custody; and\n       (H) is taking effective steps to (i) ensure that Nepalese \n     security forces comply with the Geneva Convention on Law of \n     Land Warfare; (ii) end torture, extrajudicial killings, and \n     other gross violations of human rights; and (iii) prosecute \n     and punish, in a manner proportional to the crime, members of \n     such forces who are responsible for such violations.\n       (4) The Secretary of State may waive the requirements of \n     paragraph (3) if the Secretary certifies to the Committees on \n     Appropriations that to do so is in the national security \n     interests of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9276-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9276-S9277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN MEMORIAM: POLICE OFFICER NELS DANIEL NIEMI\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about \nthe unnecessary suffering that is occurring in the African country of \nNiger. Last year's severe drought and locust infestation destroyed most \nof Niger's harvest and the fodder necessary for keeping livestock. As a \nresult, an estimated 3.6 million people including 800,000 children \nunder the age of 5--are now facing starvation. Aid workers in the field \ndescribe the situation as desperate, and report that children are dying \ndaily and families have turned to a diet of acacia leaves and grass.\n  I urge the administration to continue to respond and to work with \nother donors to ensure Niger's humanitarian needs are met. In \nparticular, it is crucial that USAID make certain the recently \nannounced $7 million in additional emergency funds go immediately \ntowards alleviating the hunger in the hardest hit areas: the agro-\npastoral regions of Maradi and Tillaberi and the pastoral regions of \nTahoua and Zinder. Reportedly, there is a shortage of therapeutic \nfeeding centers and clinics, and weakened villagers cannot manage the \ntravel required to reach them.\n  We also need to address long-term food security issues in the Sahel, \nwhere drought and famine regularly afflict these poorest nations. \nEarlier this year I traveled to three of Niger's neighbors--Algeria, \nMali, and Chad. I heard firsthand accounts of how devastating the \nlocust crisis was, and I heard a consensus regarding the need for \npermanent mechanisms to facilitate crisis response and to prevent \nemergencies in the future. As the tragedy in Niger demonstrates, even \nwhen governments, international organizations, and NGOs are able to \nanticipate food insecurity almost a year in advance and implement their \nassistance programs, we can still have a crisis. Unfortunately, it \nsometimes takes media coverage of already emaciated children to jolt \ndonor countries into emergency action. We need to remain alert and \nresponsive to World Food Program appeals for extra funding before the \nstarvation begins, and we need to stay committed to long-term efforts \nto improve food security throughout the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9277-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING GUS FLOROS\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a \nwonderful Virginian and American, Mr. Gus Floros, who this year is \ncelebrating his 50th Anniversary of immigrating to America.\n  Born on May 25, 1928, in Greece, Gus Floros immigrated to the United \nStates in 1955 settling in Harrisonburg, VA. He quickly went to work in \nhis aunt and uncle's restaurant, Jess' Lunch, on Main Street in \nHarrisonburg. By 1967 he had purchased the restaurant and with a hands \non approach and a commitment to excellence, he made Jess' Lunch one of \nHarrisonburg's finest eating establishments. Gus has expanded Jess' \nLunch dramatically and in 2003 even built a sister location called \nJess' Lunch 2.\n  Gus Floros is a fine example of the great American dream coming true. \nHe is an inspiration to many. Upon his arrival in America, Gus had just \none dollar in his pocket. Today he owns two successful restaurants in \nHarrisonburg that attract both local residents and those who are \npassing by on interstate 81. Through his entrepreneurial spirit, Gus \nFloros has made Jess' Lunch an eatery known across the Commonwealth. I \noften stop in to see Gus and have one of his tasty hotdogs or \nhamburgers whenever I am in Harrisonburg. You can always find quick, \nfriendly service and a satisfying meal at Jess' Lunch and Gus is always \nthere working just as hard as he did back in 1955.\n  I congratulate Gus Floros on 50 years of prosperity and good fortune, \nand I wish him continued success as he continues to serve the residents \nof Harrisonburg with a warm smile and a hearty meal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9277-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9277-S9278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM BERNSTEIN\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a North \nCarolinian who passed away on June 12, 2005, but will always be dear to \nour hearts. Jim Bernstein's work ended as it began--in selfless service \nto underserved communities in need. A career arc that began with \nvolunteer service with the U.S. Peace Corps in Morocco ended with post-\nretirement volunteer service to the North Carolina Department of Health \n& Human Services' rural health initiatives. In between, Jim provided \nthe Nation and the State of North Carolina with more than 30 years of \ndistinguished leadership in a variety of health and social policy \narenas, including rural health, health care finance, public health, \nsocial service delivery, medicaid, nonprofit management and health care \nsystem innovation.\n  After earning a bachelor of arts degree in political economy from \nJohn Hopkins University in 1964 and a masters of hospital \nadministration from the University of Michigan in 1968, Jim began his \nlifelong health care service as the director of Indian Health Services \nfor Northern New Mexico. In 1970, he was awarded a 3-year fellowship in \nthe U.S. Public Health Service, and relocated to North Carolina to \nconcentrate his studies on rural health and fuel a passion that would \nserve as the basis for the next 35 years of his career.\n  In 1973, while still in his 20's, Jim became the director of the \nNation's first Office of Rural Health, located in North Carolina. In \nthat role--which he held for nearly 30 years--Jim spearheaded the \ndevelopment and implementation of a medical recruitment service \ndesigned to help rural and medically underserved communities recruit \nphysicians and other health care providers. Since then, more than 2,500 \nphysicians, nurse practitioners, physicians' assistants, dentists and \nother health care professionals have been recruited to North Carolina. \nHe also directed the development of 83 community-owned health centers, \nand led the creation of Community Care of North Carolina, a care \nmanagement program that today provides access to high-quality, cost-\neffective care to more than 643,000 North Carolinians. Those efforts--\nand countless others--have positioned the State's rural health function \nas a nationally recognized model of excellence.\n  Throughout his career, Jim served as a director, chairman or \nconsultant to more than two dozen professional organizations, \nincluding: National Rural Health Association, where he was president \nfrom May 1994 to May 1995; National Advisory Committee on Rural \nHealth--U.S. Public Health Service, Office of Rural Health Policy, 1994 \nto 1995; Institute of Medicine--Committee for Guidance in Designing a \nNational Health Care Disparities Report, Washington, DC 2001 to 2005; \nCommissioner, Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, where he was \nselected by the U.S. Congress to advise the body on Medicare finance; \n1990 to 1996; chairman, Advisory Panel to the Office of Technology \nAssessment's Study on Rural Health Care, U.S. Congress; 1988; Delegate, \nNational Medical Tour to the People's Republic of China, 1978; \nConsultant, National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine--Task \nForce on Study of Health Needs in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt; 1978. His \nextraordinary commitment to lifelong community service to these and \ndozens of other organizations garnered him the North Carolina Order of \nthe Long Leaf Pine in 2005.\n  In 1982, upon the recommendation of a State legislative study \ncommission, Jim helped establish the North Carolina Foundation for \nAdvanced Health Programs, Inc, NCFAHP. From 1982 to 2005, he served as \nthe foundation's president, helping it spearhead projects targeting the \nhealth care needs of low-income underserved communities. Under Jim's \nleadership, NCFAHP secured more than 40 grants totaling more than $17 \nmillion, allowing it to\n\n[[Page S9278]]\n\nimplement dozens of programs for enhancing health care delivery across \nthe State. He also served as national director of the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation's Practice Sights Program through NCFAHP.\n  Before retiring in 2005, Jim had, since 2001, served as assistant \nsecretary for Health at the N.C. Department of Health and Human \nServices. In that role, he oversaw the North Carolina Departments of \nFacility Services, Medical Assistance, Mental Health, Minority Health, \nPublic Health and Rural Health. He also served as an adjunct professor \nat the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, \nDepartment of Social and Administrative Medicine; 1979 to 2005 and as \nan adjunct assistant professor at the School of Medicine at Duke \nUniversity in Durham, NC, Department of Community and Family Medicine; \n1978 to 2005.\n  Jim's impact on North Carolina will never be forgotten. He was a \nchampion for rural health car and the belief that every individual \nshould have access to high-quality health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9278-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF BENNIE COOLEY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize an outstanding \nmarksman and employee at Idaho National Laboratory: Bennie Cooley, who \nwith teammate Todd Salmon has recently won the 2005 World Sniper \nChampionship.\n  Bennie Cooley is no stranger to such competitions, as he currently \nholds three world titles and seven national titles within the shooting \ndisciplines, but this competition was particularly special to him \nbecause many of the participants were some of the finest members of our \nArmed Forces and the national law enforcement community. Like him, I \nbelieve that all these competitors are world champions in their own \nright.\n  Bennie has made a career at the Idaho National Laboratory, beginning \nas a security police officer for the Laboratory before moving to the \nLaboratory's special response team where he became a team leader. He is \nnow a firearms safety engineer, ``part of a team that makes security \nsuccessful, especially in the safety realm . . . able to articulate \nanything that's necessary to help keep us safe,'' according to one of \nhis superiors, because of his knowledge of firearms.\n  Respect for firearms and marksmanship have been important qualities \nthroughout our Nation's history and it is rewarding to see those values \npreserved and practiced by people like Bennie Cooley.\n  As Mr. Cooley continues to assure the safety of Idaho National \nLaboratory and to demonstrate his excellence in the art of \nmarksmanship, I wish him good luck and offer congratulations and thanks \nfor his dedication to public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9278-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  350 YEARS OF JEWISH LIFE IN AMERICA\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nJewish community on 350 years of Jewish life in America. In September \nof 1654, 23 Jews founded the first Jewish community in America when \nthey sailed to what was then New Amsterdam. The Jewish community in \nthis country has a rich and fascinating history, surmounting numerous \nobstacles and working diligently to make great contributions to our \nNation. I offer my sincerest congratulations to the Jewish community on \nreaching this important milestone and express my endorsement of the \n350th Rabbinical Resolution and ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The resolution follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Let it be known that in Elul 5764 (September 2004) the Jewish \ncommunity of the United States began a year long commemoration marking \nthe 350th Anniversary of Jewish settlement in this country.\n  With the help of God and under the protection of the Constitution of \nthe United States, we have lived and prospered in this land. We have \nbeen an integral part of American life. We have worked with all other \nAmericans in the never-ending effort to keep secure the democratic way \nof life. Our ancient prophetic ideals and the teachings of our sages \nserve as cornerstones of this Nation's values. Our work, our hopes, and \nabove all, our living religion have been among our proudest offerings \nto the American community.\n  In some lands across the seas the Jewish people have felt the searing \nflame of prejudice, persecution and death. The American Jew has had the \nsad, yet inspiring opportunity to bring comfort to the oppressed, the \njoyous opportunity to participate in the reconstitution of the Jewish \nstate on the ancient soil of Israel, and the inescapable and ennobling \nresponsibility to mend the broken places in our world.\n  Even as we have worked for the well-being of our people abroad, the \nJewish people in America have struggled to preserve our noble heritage, \nour historic traditions, our ancient teachings, our ethics, and our \nspiritual ideals in the free climate of our Nation.\n  Mindful of our manifold blessings and with deep gratitude in our \nhearts to the God of Israel, who, in 1654, led our forebears to the \nshores of this great new land,\n  We have proclaimed the period from Elul 5764 (September 2004) through \nElul 5765 (September 2005) to be one of special thanksgiving, prayer, \nstudy, reflection and celebration to mark the 350th Anniversary of \nJewish Communal Life in America.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Dr. Bruce Halverson on the occasion of his retirement as \npresident of Augustana College in Sioux Falls, SD.\n  Dr. Halverson, a native of Sioux Falls, is the first alumnus to ever \nserve as Augustana's president. As a member of the class of 1966, he \nmajored in speech and drama, earning cum laude distinctions. He \ncontinued his education at the University of Washington where he \nsecured his Ph.D. in theater history in 1971.\n  Following graduation, Dr. Halverson compiled an impressive resume, \nincluding an array of educational and theatrical credits. As a theater \ndirector throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he worked with award-\nwinning actors, producing and directing pieces he occasionally even co-\nauthored. In addition to his professional stage work, Dr. Halverson \nserved as dean of the School of Theatre at Florida State University, as \nwell as artistic director and chairman of theater departments at \nvarious universities, including the University of Illinois, Grinnell \nCollege, and Ithaca College.

Most \nrecently, Dr. Halverson has shown his commitment to South Dakota by \nreturning to his alma mater in 2000 as the 22nd president of Augustana \nCollege.\n  During his presidency, Augustana implemented $13 million in projects \nto expand the campus, including constructing the Fantle Building for \nthe Center for Western Studies, enhancing the Elmen Center, and \ncreating the Center for the Visual Arts. A new football training \nfacility is also in progress. Under Dr. Halverson's leadership, \nAugustana's $50 million Sunrise Capital Campaign is expected to \nsuccessfully conclude around the time of his retirement. Further, he \nhas been praised for his work in securing a record number of State \nscholarships for Augustana students. In recognition of his dedication \nto the college, Augustana's board of trustees asked\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\nDr. Halverson to continue his work with the school following his \nretirement. As the school newspaper, Augustana Today, notes: Halverson \nhas laid the groundwork for his successor by enhancing Augustana's \nfinancial viability, encouraging faculty research, undertaking \nstrategic planning, and strengthening alumni support.\n  Additionally, Dr. Halverson is a steadfast proponent of eliminating \nbarriers for people with disabilities, particularly concerning theater \nand the arts. His compassion and outspoken commitment have moved him to \nwrite extensively on the topic, as well as travel all over our country, \nspeaking and presenting at various conferences. As Augustana's first \npresident proficient in sign language, it is clear that Dr. Halverson \npersonifies his values and takes to heart his role as an educator.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to share the impressive \naccomplishments of Dr. Bruce Halverson with my colleagues. I commend \nhim for his tireless dedication to theatre, education, and enhancing \nthe arts, especially in the State of South Dakota. The lives of \ncountless people have been enormously enhanced by Dr. Halverson's \ntalent and leadership as president of Augustana College. I wish the \nvery best for him, his wife Nancy, and their three sons Tait, Jeffry \nand Cole, as Dr. Halverson continues to contribute to and improve \neducation throughout South Dakota. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9279-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the city of Alexandria, SD. This year marks the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of Alexandria, and from August 14 through \nAugust 18, its citizens will gather to celebrate their proud past as \nwell as their hope for a promising future.\n  Located three miles from the banks of the James River in southeast \nSouth Dakota, Alexandria was originally named Clarksville after \nDearborn Clark, who donated the land upon which the town was built. It \nwas renamed Alexander in 1879, and later changed to Alexandria, to \nhonor Alexander Mitchell, the president of the Chicago, Milwaukee \nRailway. The first buildings were built in 1880, and the city was \nofficially incorporated in 1883. Later that decade, Alexandria was \nnamed county seat of Hanson County, a title it still maintains.\n  The frontier town grew quickly in the following years, and by 1893, \nthe population exceeded 1,000 people. Enjoying a robust agricultural \neconomy, Alexandria shipped more than 1,000 boxcars of grain annually. \nIn 1914, the city purchased an electric generator, and local \nbusinessmen financed a $1,200 project to make Alexandria one of the \nfirst communities in South Dakota with electric streetlights. In 1885, \nthe city applied to become the State capital, but came in fourth in the \nvoting.\n  Since the boom years of the early 1900s, economic circumstances have, \nof course, changed. Still, Alexandria continues to provide essential \nservices and support to local farmers and ranchers. The rugged days of \npioneer life have ended, but the residents of this extraordinary \ncommunity continue to exemplify the bold and enterprising pioneer \nspirit.\n  In her book, Hanson Heritage, Mildred Soladay celebrates the courage \nof the settlers who founded Alexandria: ``They had no past,'' she \nwrites, ``but the infinite future lay before them.'' Today, the \ncitizens of Alexandria do indeed have a past worthy of celebration, yet \nas they commemorate their city's 125th anniversary, the promise of \ntheir future remains infinite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9279-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAYOR HARRY MIMS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to say a few words \nabout one of Louisiana's finest public servants, Mayor Harry Mims of \nEast Hodge. Mayor Mims recently celebrated his 91st birthday and has \ndedicated the past 37 years to the people of East Hodge as their mayor. \nFirst elected in 1968, he has the distinction of being the first and so \nfar only mayor of this community, population of 366. In fact, some say \nthat if it I were not for Harry Mims, there would not be an East Hodge \nas he was instrumental in the city's founding.\n  Mayor Mims' motto that has made East Hodge thrive is one many small \ntown politicians understand, when there is work to be done, ``You have \nto do it yourself.'' One of the best examples of his drive to bring to \nEast Hodge some of the amenities and services enjoyed by their \nneighbors is his unyielding efforts to pave the streets of East Hodge. \nAt one point in recent history, the streets were too narrow for cars to \npass. The mayor wrote grant after grant to find the money he needed to \nmanage this small community and as a result of his tenacity, they now \nhave a new town hall, a large water system, two apartment buildings, a \nfire station, two trucks and a community center.\n  Last Saturday, the Louisiana Chapter of the National Conference of \nBlack Mayors honored Mayor Mims for his years of service to the people \nof East Hodge and the State of Louisiana. Mayor Mims told them he plans \nto run for 8 more years, if the Lord will allow him to. It is my \nfervent prayer that the good Lord allows Mayor Mims to continue to \nserve the people of East Hodge as he has so diligently for the past 37 \nyears and that he does so in the best of health. As the daughter of a \nMayor, I know that the people of East Hodge join me in this prayer. \nThank you Mayor Mims, for all that you have done and continue to do for \nthe people you serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9279-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9279-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9279-5", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on July 27, 2005, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following bill, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3453.

A bill to provide for teacher acculturation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing the Teacher Acculturation \nAct of 2005 as a means to address an issue that impedes effective \nlearning in our Nation's classrooms, and that is cultural incongruence. \nSuch a lack of congruence exists in a wide range of situations, from \nrural and underserved communities in remote areas to well-populated \nurban centers, from my State of Hawaii to areas on the Eastern \nseaboard. The dynamic I am describing exists along lines of race and \nethnicity, socioeconomic strata, age, and many other vectors, which can \nmuddy the stuff of learning that needs to be transmitted between \nstudents aiming to learn and teachers seeking to teach.\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues and I have said many times, our children are \nour future. Furthermore, our great Nation is dependent on the success \nof our educational system and what it is delivering to our children. An \nessential part of our educational system is a highly qualified teacher \nwith knowledge of the subject area, and the ability to teach that \nsubject to students. This is the most important factor in the academic \nsuccess of the student. My bill will address one attribute of that \nsuccess: the ability of the teacher to present the lesson in a way that \nstudents are ready to learn it.\n  I started my professional life as a teacher, so improvement of the \nfield of education is never far from my thoughts. Even after all of my \nteacher training, I remember walking into a classroom and thinking, \n``What do I do now?'' and, ``Will I be able to connect with my \nstudents?'' I have never forgotten those thoughts. Through my bill, I \nhope to work to help teachers answer these and similar questions, \nparticularly for those teachers who are placed in States that are new \nto them, or in parts of their home States with which they have little \nor no familiarity. In my State of Hawaii, according to an article \npublished Monday in the Honolulu Advertiser, Hawaii's 258 public \nschools need 1,400 to 1,600 new teachers every year to replace those \nwho retire or leave the system, particularly in the areas of special \neducation, speech pathology, autism, and hearing impairment. However, \nonly about 500 Hawaii teachers are graduating and earning their \nlicenses every year from both public and private colleges, and many of \nthem are being drawn away from the State to schools on the mainland. \nRecruiting trips by the Hawaii Department of Education are seeking \nhires in cities such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San \nFrancisco. I would like to help to ensure the success of these and \nother teachers in similar situations across the country, to help smooth \ntheir adjustment to their new homes, and thus, make a fluid transition \nto their new classrooms.\n  The Teacher Acculturation Act seeks to address cultural incongruence \nbetween the teacher and the student population in the classroom. To be \nsuccessful, the teacher must be prepared to teach in a way that \nstudents are ready to learn. And with a increasingly diverse student \npopulation, that becomes harder and harder as time goes by. To achieve \nthese ends, the bill proposes programs in three parts.\n  The first two parts recognize the success of ongoing and sustained \nprofessional development to affect positive change in teaching \npedagogy. The bill authorizes demonstration programs that aim to assist \nteachers in learning, developing, and implementing pedagogies that help \nall students learn. I have modeled the programs on the Lesson Study \ntheory of change, which is a model that uses a cohort of professionals \nfor lesson development, presentation of the developed lesson by a \nmember of the cohort to a class, observation of the presentation by \nother members of the cohort, and post-presentation analysis and \nreflection by the entire cohort, along with coaches, mentors, and \nsupervising practitioners. A group of teachers working together to \nimprove their pedagogy has been shown to be very effective, and this \nmodel is becoming more popular at every level in teacher education and \nprofessional development, from classroom work in colleges of education, \nto cohort work by candidates for National Board Certification--the \nhighest performance achievement available to a teacher in the United \nStates.\n  The first demonstration program would take place during the time the \nprospective teacher is in a college or school of education, and \nintroduces a multicultural awareness component into the pre-service \nteaching activities. In this program, prospective teachers would work \nwith members of the community, trained academics, and practicing \nteachers to learn about cultural characteristics of the student \npopulation, to develop pedagogies and curriculum to fit those cultures, \nand to study how to deliver the new lessons in a culturally relevant \nstyle. Prospective teachers would then deliver these lessons to the \nstudents in a real classroom setting while student teaching. Post-\nteaching analysis, reflection, and discussion would then allow the \nstudent teacher to analyze and reflect upon the performance.\n  The second demonstration program is structured similarly to the first \nprogram, but conducts a professional development activity during the \ntime the teacher is new to the profession--generally the first three \nyears--recognizing that many teachers develop teaching styles in these \ninitial years that they may use for the duration of their teaching \ncareers. Through this program, a cohort of teachers would undertake a \nyear-long program, which includes two summers, under the direction of a \ncoach trained in multicultural education. Participating teachers would \nalready be placed in teaching positions and have a defined learning \ncommunity to work with. If done right, such a program has the potential \nto involve the whole school community and, eventually, contribute to \nwhole school change.\n  These two programs taken together have the potential to develop a \ncadre of teachers adept at teaching in ways that are culturally-\nrelevant, ways that address the needs of the students, and ways in \nwhich the students are ready to learn. I truly feel that such programs \nworking with new and prospective teachers can make a difference in \naddressing the current achievement gap, particularly impacting the \ngroups most at risk of being on the losing end of the achievement gap.\n  The third section of the Teacher Acculturation Act of 2005 would set \nup Centers of Excellence in Multicultural Education. These centers \nwould support the professional development activities from the first \ntwo parts of the bill by providing trained mentors, coaches, and \nacademics, as well as undertaking research into the areas of \nmulticultural education. The centers would also develop activities for \nuse by schools and districts to provide ongoing professional \ndevelopment opportunities to all faculty or teachers.\n\n  We must never forget that a solid education is the cornerstone of our \nfuture. And a highly qualified teacher is needed to provide that \neducation. The teacher not only needs to be knowledgeable about the \nsubject being taught, but needs to know how to teach the subject to the \nstudents. This bill would help address the question of how. It seeks to \nprepare the teacher to deal with groups of students with different \nlearning styles, as well as to identify the needs of divergent groups \nof students and how to vary teaching to support the learning of these \nstudents. My bill seeks to improve learning among those groups who are \nunderserved today. Although my bill alone would not eliminate the \nachievement gap, it seeks to provide a good start.\n  This bill is supported by leading experts and organizations in the \nfield of multicultural education, including Ms. Joyce Harris, Executive \ndirector of the National Academy for Multicultural Education, Dr. James \nBanks of the Center for Multicultural Education at the University of \nWashington, and Dr. Randy Hitz, Dean of the College of Education at the \nUniversity of Hawaii. I ask unanimous consent that their letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                      Multicultural Education,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2005.\n     Hon.

What you are proposing is not only admirable but \n     very necessary. Today's school populations are more diverse \n     than they've ever been, and this diversity will only \n     increase. Further, while the student body is becoming \n     ethnically and racially more diverse, the teaching force is \n     not.\n       Some will argue that the 3 R's are all teachers need to \n     focus on, and students will be all right; but others of us \n     know that this is not the case for a growing number of \n     today's youth. What was fine decades ago will not necessarily \n     work in today's schools.\n       NAME thanks you for your foresight and courage. I'm sure \n     that you know you may have a Herculean task before you, but \n     please keep the faith. This is so important to make\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\n     sure that ALL of our children succeed. With the No Child Left \n     Behind Act and the cuts in some educational programs (for \n     example, The Dropout Prevention Program--who is more than \n     likely to drop out? The lower SES students and students of \n     color!), is it especially important that we have people of \n     your stature working to ensure that all of our children \n     receive an equitable education.\n       I have seen your website. I've read about your many \n     accomplishments on behalf of your Hawaiian constituency and \n     for the American people at large. Again, please know that \n     NAME stands behind you. Please contact me if there is \n     anything that the organization or I may do for you as you go \n     forward with. this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joyce E.

Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing to support the Teacher \n     Acculturation bill you are introducing in the Senate. I have \n     carefully reviewed the bill with faculty in the University of \n     Hawai`i, college of Education, and we think it has great \n     potential to improve education throughout the United States.\n       The relationship between the teacher and the student is the \n     key to success in education. The Teacher Acculturation bill \n     seeks to improve student achievement by ameliorating the \n     cultural mismatch between teachers and the students they \n     teach, thus improving the teacher's ability to address \n     educational needs of individual students.\n       The University of Hawai`i, College of Education is heavily \n     involved in indigenous education multicultural initiatives, \n     and other efforts to ensure that teachers are well prepared \n     to work with diverse populations of students. As one of the \n     nation's most diverse states, Hawai`i has significant \n     challenges in bridging cultural gaps between teachers and \n     students. But, nearly every school in every state in the \n     nation faces the challenge of bridging cultural differences \n     between teachers and students. Your bill will create models \n     for better preparing teachers to understand and address the \n     learning needs of the diverse student populations they serve, \n     thus improving their academic achievement.\n       Thank you for your leadership in preparing this innovative \n     and important bill, and thank you for the opportunity to \n     comment on the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Randy Hitz,\n     Dean.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide \nopportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hunting Heritage \nProtection Act of 2005. With the introduction of this important \nlegislation, we are able to acknowledge our Nation's rich heritage of \nhunting. The purpose of this bill is to pass that legacy on to future \ngenerations by protecting and preserving the rights of our Nation's \nsportsmen and women.\n  In 2001, over 13 million Americans contributed over $20.6 billion to \nthe U.S. economy while hunting--a true recreational activity. Many \nbelieve that in order to hunt you must own land, but that is not true. \nI believe that hunting should be available as a recreational activity \nfor everyone.\n  I have been an avid outdoor sportsman since my adulthood. I am also \nan avid conservationist, like most other hunters. Recreational hunting \nprovides many opportunities to spend valuable time with children, just \nas I do with my son. He has been hunting since he was a young boy where \nhe discovered and learned to appreciate one of the Earth's greatest \ntreasures, nature.\n  Over the years, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to \nwildlife conservation, by purchasing licenses, permits, and stamps, as \nwell as paying excise taxes on goods used by hunters.\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\nSince the time of President Teddy Roosevelt, father of the conservation \nmovement, sportsmen and women have been and will continue to be some of \nthe greatest supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation \npractices in the U.S.\n  Hunters need to be recognized for the vital role they play in \nconservation in this country. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act will \ndo just that. This bill formalizes a policy by which the Federal \nGovernment will support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting \nopportunities, as permitted under State and Federal law. Further, the \nbill mandates that Federal public land and water are to be open to \naccess and use for recreational hunting where and when appropriate. I \nshould clarify and stress that this bill does not suggest that we open \nall national parks to hunting. As I mentioned, the goal is simple--I \nwant recreational hunting on our public land to be available to the \ncitizens of this country where and when appropriate.\n  It is crucial that the tradition of hunting is protected and that the \nvaluable contributions that hunters have made to conservation in this \ncountry are recognized. And, we want to ensure that Federal land \nmanagement decisions and their actions result in a ``no net loss of \nhunting opportunities'' on our public lands. This bill allows Congress \nto address this issue and to honor our Nation's sportsmen and women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1523. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent increased expensing for small businesses; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of the Nation's millions of small businesses and self-employed \nindividuals. I am pleased to join with my colleague in the House, \nCongressman Wally Herger, in reforming the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to permanently extend the amount of new investment a business can \nexpense.\n  This bill is a critical incentive for the small business sector of \nour economy to invest in new technology, expand their operations, and \nmost important, create jobs.\n  We can never minimize the role that small businesses play in our \neconomy. They represent 99 percent of all employers, employ 51 percent \nof the private-sector workforce, provide nearly 75 percent of the net \nnew jobs, contribute 51 percent of the private-sector output, and \nrepresent 96 percent of all exporters of goods. In short, size is the \nonly ``small'' aspect of small business.\n  The bill I introduce today recognizes the vitality and uniquely \nAmerican innovation of the small business owners and entrepreneurs \nthroughout our country. It will make permanent the provisions in \nSection 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which enables small \nbusinesses to write off the cost of new equipment, rather than \ndepreciate it over a period of years.\n  As the chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am responding today to the repeated requests from \nsmall businesses in my State of Maine and from across the Nation for \ngreater expensing of new equipment.\n  By making permanent the current expensing limit of $100,000 and \nindexing these amounts for inflation, this bill will achieve two \nimportant objectives.\n  First, qualifying businesses will be able to write off more equipment \npurchases today, instead of waiting 5, 6, 7 or more years to recover \ntheir costs through depreciation.\n  That represents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time \nsmall businesses would otherwise be forced to spend complying with \ncomplex depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment contributes to \ncontinued productivity growth in the business community, which Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed is essential to \nlong-term economic growth and job creation.\n  Second, more businesses will qualify for this benefit because the \nphase-out limit will be made permanent at $400,000 in new equipment \npurchases. This will occur at the same time small business capital \ninvestment pumps more money into the many sectors of the economy. My \nbill is a win-win for small business and the economy as a whole.\n  Small businesses are always at the forefront of our national economic \nrecoveries and our national economic booms. This bill strengthens their \nability to lead the way. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation as we work with the President to enact this \nbill into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Expensing \n     Permanency Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASED EXPENSING FOR SMALL BUSINESS MADE \n                   PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 179(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to dollar limitation) \n     is amended by striking ``$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of \n     taxable years beginning after 2002 and before 2008)'' and \n     inserting ``$100,000''.\n       (b) Increase in Qualifying Investment at Which Phaseout \n     Begins.--Paragraph (2) of section 179(b) of such Code \n     (relating to reduction in limitation) is amended by striking \n     ``$200,000 ($400,000 in the case of taxable years beginning \n     after 2002 and before 2008)'' and inserting ``$400,000''.\n       (c) Inflation Adjustments.--Section 179(b)(5)(A) of such \n     Code (relating to inflation adjustments) is amended by \n     striking ``and before 2008''.\n       (d) Revocation of Election.--Section 179(c)(2) of such Code \n     (relating to election irrevocable) is amended by striking \n     ``and before 2008''.\n       (e) Off-the-shelf Computer Software.--Section \n     179(d)(1)(A)(ii) of such Code (relating to section 179 \n     property) is amended by striking ``and before 2008''.\n       (f) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Salazar, Mr. Obama, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1525. A bill to ensure that commercial insurers cannot engage in \nprice fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations to the detriment of \ncompetition and consumers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Medical \nMalpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2005.'' In the ongoing debate \nabout health care costs, this legislation is a targeted and responsible \nmove toward fixing one significant part of the system that is broken \nthe skyrocketing insurance premiums for medical malpractice.\n  For too long, doctors and hospitals have endured dramatic increases \nin the cost of their malpractice insurance. I doubt there is a single \nSenator who has not heard repeatedly from beleaguered physicians back \nhome. Rising insurance rates are reportedly forcing some doctors to \nabandon their practices.\n  Some of my colleagues in the other body seem content to echo the \nrefrains of the insurance industry and heap blame for the problem of \nrising insurance premiums rates on trial lawyers and the victims of \nmedical malpractice themselves. I have opposed arbitrary caps on \ndamages because they will inflict additional harm on the most \nvulnerable victims of medical malpractice.\n  Many of us have questioned the insurance industry's claim that \nlawsuits are causing the rise in premium costs since doctors in States \nthat have imposed damages caps have not seen a reduction in their \nmedical malpractice insurance premiums.\n  A newly released report provides shows that our questions were well-\nfounded. This report provides real evidence rather than anecdotal \nstories routinely trotted out by the insurance industry advocates. This \nstudy was prepared by a former State Insurance Commissioner and uses \nthe insurance industry's own numbers to debunk the myths being advanced \nby the insurance industry.\n  The study entitled, ``Falling Claims and Rising Premiums in the \nMedical Malpractice Insurance Industry,'' suggests that malpractice \ninsurers have been overcharging, even gouging, physicians \nunconscionably. I expect a number of Senators will be surprised to \nlearn that the malpractice claims payments actually went down, in real\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\nterms, over the past five years. In addition, even the insurers' own \nprojections of future losses are declining. Despite these downward \ntrends, year in and year out, these insurers are burdening doctors with \nincreased premium costs and shifting the blame for their increases on \nto lawyers and victims.\n  In the past five years, premiums have more than doubled even though \nclaims payments have been stable. In 2004, malpractice insurers' total \npremiums were three times higher than their payouts. During the years \n2000 to 2004, net premiums increased by 120 percent, while net claims \npayments increased by less than 6 percent.\n  I urge Senators to read this report. It is based entirely on data \nfrom annual statements filed under oath with State insurance \ndepartments by the Nation's 15 largest malpractice insurers. The \nstatements contain each insurer's estimate of how much it will pay out \nin malpractice claims, as well as data showing how much it actually \npaid out in claims and took in premiums. Claims and projected losses \nare down. It is only premiums that are rising, not claims.\n  What this boils down to is an insurance industry problem, not a \nproblem with the legal system. No wonder that the State attorneys \ngeneral of Connecticut and Missouri have reacted to the study by \nattacking industry practices and calling for an aggressive regulatory \nresponse.\n  As this study makes clear, high malpractice insurance premiums are \nnot the result of malpractice lawsuit verdicts. They are the result of \ninvestment decisions by the insurance companies and of business models \ngeared toward ever-increasing profits. I hope that this study once and \nfor all shines light on the real culprit in rising malpractice \ninsurance rates and informs the Senate with solid evidence of the best \nway to assist the good doctors who commit their professional lives to \ncaring for others. I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary \nof the study be printed in the Record.\n  To be sure, different States have different experiences with medical \nmalpractice insurance, and insurance remains a largely State-regulated \nindustry. Each State should endeavor to develop its own solution to \nrising medical malpractice rates because each state has its own unique \nproblems. Some States--such as my own, Vermont--while experiencing \nproblems, do not face as great a crisis as others.\n  But another fact of the insurance industry's business model requires \na Federal legislative correction its blanket exemption from federal \nanti-trust laws. Insurers have for years enjoyed a special benefit in \nour marketplace. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits insurance companies \nto operate without being subject to most of the Federal antitrust laws, \nand our Nation's physicians and their patients are suffering from this \nspecial treatment. Using their exemption, insurers can collude to set \nrates, resulting in higher premiums than true competition would achieve \nand because of this exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate \nany such collusion. If Congress is serious about controlling rising \npremiums, we must revoke this blanket exemption created in the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  That is why today I introduce the ``Medical Malpractice Insurance \nAntitrust Act of 2005.'' I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Boxer, \nCorzine, Durbin, Feingold, Mikulski, Obama, Rockefeller, and Salazar \nfor cosponsoring this essential legislation. Our bill modifies the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act for the most pernicious anti-trust offenses: \nprice fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations. I am hard-pressed to \nimagine that anyone could object to a prohibition on insurance \ncarriers' fixing prices or dividing territories for anticompetitive \npurposes. After all, the rest of our Nation's industries manage either \nto abide by these laws or pay the consequences.\n  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within \nthe power they are accorded in their own laws, and some States have \nantitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive \nactivities in the insurance industry. Our legislation would not affect \nregulation of insurance by State insurance commissioners and other \nState regulators. There is no reason to continue a system in which the \nFederal enforcers are precluded from prosecuting the most harmful \nantitrust violations just because they are committed by insurance \ncompanies.\n  This legislation is a carefully tailored solution to one critical \naspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance \npremiums. I hope that quick action by the Judiciary Committee and then \nby the full Senate, will ensure that this real solution is adopted \nbefore more damage is done to the physicians of this country and to the \npatients that they serve.\n  Only professional baseball has enjoyed an anti-trust exemption \ncomparable to that created for the insurance industry by the McCarran-\nFerguson Act. Senator Hatch and I have joined forces several times in \nrecent years to scale back that exemption for baseball, and in the Curt \nFlood Act of 1998 we successfully eliminated the exemption as it \napplied to employment relations. I hope we can work together again to \ncreate more competition in the insurance industry, just as we did with \nbaseball.\n  If Congress is serious about helping to control rising medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums, then we must limit the insurance \nindustry's broad exemption to Federal antitrust law and promote real \ncompetition in the insurance marketplace.\n  There being no objection, the executive summary was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\nFalling Claims and Rising Premiums in the Medical Malpractice Insurance \n                                Industry\n\n                            (By Jay Angoff)\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       This Report analyzes the 2000-2004 performance of each of \n     the 15 largest medical malpractice insurers in the United \n     States rated by A.M. Best, the principal rating service for \n     the insurance industry. The Report is based primarily on data \n     from the carriers' 2004 Annual Statements filed with state \n     insurance departments.\n       The Report finds the following:\n       Over the last five years the amount the major medical \n     malpractice insurers have collected in premiums has more than \n     doubled, while their claims payouts have remained essentially \n     flat.\n       Some malpractice insurers substantially increased their \n     premiums while both their claims payments and their projected \n     future claims payments were decreasing.\n       Malpractice insurers accumulated record amounts of surplus \n     over the last three years.\n       Taken together, the malpractice carriers analyzed increased \n     their net premiums by 120.2% during the period 2000-2004, \n     although their net claims payments rose by only 5.7%. Thus, \n     they increased their premiums by 21 times (120.2/5.7 = 21.09) \n     the increase in their claims payments.\n       As a result of these two dramatically different trends, the \n     ratio between these insurers' claims payments and premiums \n     fell by more than half between 2000 and 2004: it declined \n     from 69.9% to 33.6% on a net basis, and from 68.8% to 32.1% \n     on a gross basis. Put another way, in 2004 the leading \n     medical malpractice insurers took in approximately three \n     times as much in premiums as they paid out in claims.\n       Moreover, several insurers substantially increased their \n     premiums even though their claims payments actually fell--and \n     fell substantially. For example:\n       Healthcare Indemnity, Inc. (HCI), an affiliate of HCA \n     corporation, increased its premiums by $173 million, or 88%, \n     while its claims payments fell by $74 million, or 32%. As a \n     result, in 2004 it paid out only 43 cents in claims for each \n     premium dollar it collected.\n       ProNational, an affiliate of ProAssurance Corporation, \n     increased its premiums by $87 million, or 79%, while its \n     claims payments fell by $43 million, or 63%. As a result, in \n     2004 it paid out only 13 cents in claims for each premium \n     dollar it collected.\n       Medical Assurance, another ProAssurance affiliate, \n     increased its premiums by $151 million, or 89%, while its \n     claims payments fell by a third. As a result, in 2004 it paid \n     out only 10 cents in claims for each premium dollar it \n     collected.\n       In addition, Lexington Insurance Company, an affiliate of \n     AIG, reported that its net written premiums increased from \n     $21.1 million in 2000 to 483.0 million in 2004--an increase \n     of $461.9 million, or 2200%--while its net paid losses \n     increased by only $52.9 million. As a result, in 2004 it paid \n     out only 14 cents in claims for each premium dollar it \n     collected.\n       Finally, even the ratio between the amount the leading \n     malpractice insurers estimated they would pay out in the \n     future and the premiums they earn--what insurers somewhat \n     counter-intuitively call their ``incurred loss'' ratio--\n     declined by almost 25% between 2000 and 2004. Due to this \n     decline--which is in addition to the decline in the amounts \n     these insurers have actually been paying out--they estimated \n     in 2004 that they would ultimately pay out in claims only \n     51.4 cents of each premium dollar they earned. Perhaps most \n     striking, in 2004 these 15 insurers taken together increased \n     their earned\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\n     premium by 9.3%, even though their incurred losses--the \n     amount they estimated they would pay out in the future--\n     declined by 21.1%.\n       Because of the overall surge in malpractice premiums with \n     no corresponding surge in claims payments during the last \n     five years, the leading malpractice insurers have increased \n     their surplus by more than a third in only three years, and \n     they are now charging more for malpractice insurance than * * \n     *\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1526. A bill to provide education to students in grades 7 through \n12 about the importance of higher education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Roads to Success Act of 2005, which is legislation \ndesigned to expand higher educational and career opportunities for \nAmerican students. There is no doubt as to the benefit of receiving a \npost-secondary education. The level of education that individuals \naccumulate has an important influence on their experience in the labor \nmarket. According to 2002 U.S. Census Bureau statistics on educational \nattainment and earnings, the mean earnings of men with a bachelor's \ndegree is $63,354, while the mean earnings of men with a high school \ndegree is $32,363. This is a difference of more than $30,000 or 97 \npercent.\n  In recent years, there have been clear signs that more Americans are \npursuing higher education opportunities. In June 2002, USA Today \nreported that 63 percent of high school graduates go to college \nimmediately after graduation, the highest percentage in U.S. history. \nYet not all of the news on college graduation rates has been good. Only \n18 percent of African Americans and 11 percent of Hispanic high school \ngraduates earn a bachelor's degree by their late twenties, compared to \n33 percent of whites according to the National Center for Education \nStatistics, NCES, in 2001. Further, in 2000, NCES reported that 22 \npercent of low-income, college qualified high school graduates do not \npursue post-secondary education, compared to 4 percent of high-income \ngraduates.\n  As I travel through Pennsylvania, I still hear from too many middle \nschool and high school students that they do not have the preparation \nnecessary to enroll in higher education institutions. On a trip to the \nCommonwealth, I joined Andrew McKelvey--the founder of the McKelvey \nFoundation--to announce Federal funding for entrepreneurial \nscholarships to rural, low-income Pennsylvania high school graduates. \nDuring that trip, I had a frank discussion with Mr. McKelvey regarding \nthe need to not only ensure access to funding for students to pursue \nhigher education, but the need to inform students about the importance \nof higher education, as well as prepare students for the application \nprocess.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the ``Roads to Success Act of \n2005'', will help to educate middle school and high school students in \ngrades 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, about higher education and career \nopportunities. This bill will create a program which will provide \nstudents with access to information on higher education and career \ndevelopment, and prepare students with the skills necessary to plan for \nhigher education. The availability of information on higher education \nopportunities makes an enormous difference to students contemplating \ncontinuing their education at the undergraduate level.\n  My legislation will authorize a grant to Roads to Success, a \nnonprofit educational organization, to develop a core curriculum to be \ntaught in the classroom to equip middle and high school students with \nthe appropriate skills and knowledge to pursue post-secondary education \nand their career goals. Given the importance of higher education, it \nmakes sense to prepare students for the undergraduate process as part \nof their class instruction to ensure that all students have access to \nthe necessary information to attain their objectives. To this end, \nmiddle schools and high schools participating in the program will \ndedicate one hour each week of their classroom activity to higher \neducation and career preparation of students utilizing the core \ncurriculum.\n  Additionally, I seek to create a network of intensive academic \nsupport for students by encouraging public-private partnerships to \nemphasize the importance of higher education and career development. \nPartnerships with private entities create a unique opportunity for \nmiddle schools and high schools to supplement and enhance the core \ncurriculum by offering appropriate enrichments, including guest \nspeakers, videos and web-based services. For example, through these \npartnerships, middle school and high school students will gain first-\nhand knowledge of the skills that businesses are seeking by having the \nopportunity to speak with business leaders, as well as perhaps tour \nlocal facilities. This will underscore the significance and importance \nof higher education for students as they embark on their future career \npaths.\n  To implement this initiative, my bill will authorize $10 million \nannually for fiscal years 2006 through 2011, for Roads to Success to \ndevelop a core curriculum which has as its cornerstone increasing \nawareness of the importance of higher education, developing career \nawareness, building life skills, and providing education planning to \nstudents. Under this legislation, Roads to Success will award subgrants \nto five State educational agencies to offer higher education \npreparation programs using the core curriculum in middle and high \nschools with historically low rates of student application and \nadmission to post-secondary institutions.\n  It is my sincere hope that this act will ensure that students who \nwish to enroll in a higher education institution will have access to \nthe tools and resources necessary to help them plan for undergraduate \nstudy. We must take this step to encourage students to pursue their \neducational and career goals--especially those who might not otherwise \nhave this opportunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis act, and urge its swift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 527. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \nimmunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases, including \ninfluenza, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senator Reed and I are introducing \nthe ``Vaccine Administration and Supply Act.'' Congressman Waxman is \nintroducing a companion bill in the House. Our goal is to improve \nvaccine accessibility and administration across the country, by \nguaranteeing that every American has access to recommended vaccines, \nand strengthening our public health infrastructure.\n  Vaccines are one of the Nation's most significant success stories in \npublic health. They have wiped out mass killers such as polio and \nsmallpox, and protected millions of Americans from other life-\nthreatening or debilitating infectious diseases. They save lives, and \nsave costs too, in needless treatment and hospitalization for illnesses \nthat could have been prevented.\n  Today, the threat of infectious disease is ever present. Deadly \nstrains of naturally occurring viruses, such as avian flu, are moving \nfrom animals to humans. The possibility of bioterrorism is looming. \nAccessibility to vaccines and improving our public health \ninfrastructure are essential to protect the health of our communities \nand our Nation--and efforts to do so are long overdue.\n  We have made remarkable progress in protecting children from vaccine-\npreventable diseases by making vaccines available to uninsured and \nunderinsured children at no cost through the Vaccines for Children and \nImmunization Grant programs. As a result, childhood immunization rates \nand disease reductions are near all-time highs.\n  On the other hand, there is a huge gap in adult and adolescent \nvaccination. Each year, 46,000 to 48,000 adults die from diseases that \ncould be cheaply and effectively prevented by vaccination. Many of \nthese persons miss the opportunity to protect themselves against \nvaccine-preventable diseases because they don't have adequate insurance \ncoverage.\n  Our legislation will close this gap in public health by mandating \nthat the Secretary of HHS establish an immunization program for adults. \nUninsured and underinsured adolescents and adults will be vaccinated at \nno charge\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\nin any Federally qualified health center, or local or State public \nhealth department.\n\n  Participating States will also receive increased funding for the \nImmunization Grant Program, so that Program Managers can administer \nvaccinations to uninsured and underinsured citizens, as well as conduct \neducation and awareness campaigns on the importance of vaccination and \ncarry out strategies to increase vaccination rates throughout the \nStates.\n  In addition to increasing vaccine accessibility through State \nprograms, this bill will also improve the national immunization \ninfrastructure. Last year's shortage of influenza vaccine was a wake up \ncall for greater national coordination of vaccine allocation and \ndelivery. Our bill requires the Secretary of HHS to purchase and \nstockpile needed vaccines, and develop an emergency response plan, \nwithin one-year of enactment, to guide States in administering vaccines \nin the case of a shortage or emergency.\n  As our Health Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health \nPreparedness continues to discuss provisions to encourage the \ndevelopment of vaccines and other countermeasures to bioterrorism, this \nlegislation will establish the infrastructure needed to ensure the \nefficient administration of such countermeasures in a time of crisis.\n  The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials said it \nwell when stating, ``Immunization is a vital public health tool and an \nessential element in protecting the nation's health.'' In light of the \nobvious dangers, it is urgent for Congress to increase immunization \nrates and ensure the efficient allocation of vaccines in an emergency. \nI commend Congressman Waxman for his leadership on this important \nhealth issue in the House, and Senator Reed and I urge our colleagues \nin the Senate to join in this important effort to improve our public \nhealth preparedness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1528. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of horses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equine \nEquity Act of 2005 with my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and \nmy colleague from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  Each spring on the first Saturday of May, the sporting world turns \nits attention to my hometown of Louisville for the annual running of \nthe Kentucky Derby. It has been appropriately called ``the most \nexciting two minutes in sports,'' and has given us such great champions \nas Secretariat, Seattle Slew, and Smarty Jones.\n  The activities surrounding the Derby also allow Kentucky to show off \none of its signature industries, the horse industry. Long after the \npageantry and festivities of Derby day, the horse industry remains a \nvital part of Kentucky's economy and cultural heritage. Horses are \nKentucky's largest agricultural product. The horse industry contributes \n$3.5 billion to Kentucky's economy, and directly employs more than \n50,000 Kentuckians.\n  While many Americans appropriately identify the horse industry as one \nof Kentucky's signature industries, the industry's economic impact \nextends well beyond the borders of the Commonwealth. A recent economic \nimpact study by the firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu found that the \nhorse industry contributes approximately $39 billion in direct economic \nimpacts to the U.S. economy each year. The industry sustains 1.4 \nmillion full-time equivalent jobs each year, with over 460,000 of those \njobs created from direct spending within the industry.\n  Nearly 2 million Americans own horses, either for racing, showing, or \nrecreational purposes. While the popular image of horse owners might \nfocus on Millionaire's Row at Churchill Downs on Derby Day, the facts \ntell a different story. Only about one-quarter, 28 percent, of U.S. \nhorse owners have incomes greater than $100,000. More than one in every \nthree, 34 percent, horse owners has an income of less than $50,000.\n  Like many businesses, outside investments are essential to the \noperation and growth of the horse industry. Without investors willing \nto buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to thrive. \nUnfortunately, there are several unfair, unwise provisions in Federal \nlaw that discourage investment in the horse industry.\n  In an effort to address these concerns, today I introduce the Equine \nEquity Act with my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and my good \nfriend from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning. The Equine Equity Act includes three \nkey provisions.\n  First, it will provide capital gains treatment for horses that is \nequal to other investments. Nearly all capital assets are eligible to \nreceive more favorable capital gains tax treatment once they are held \nfor 12 months. However, horses and cattle must be held for 2 years to \nreceive capital gains treatment. This legislation would reduce the \ncapital gains holding period for horses from 24 months to 12 months.\n  Second, it will apply equal depreciation standards for all \nracehorses. Current law states that racehorses that begin training when \nolder than 24 months of age are depreciated over 3 years, while those \nhorses that begin training before reaching 24 months of age are \ndepreciated over 7 years.\n  Most horses begin training before they reach 24 months, but their \nracing careers do not last 7 years. This legislation would reduce the \ndepreciation period for racehorses to 3 years to more accurately \nreflect the racing life of horses.\n  Finally, the Equine Equity Act would establish equity in eligibility \nfor disaster assistance between horses and other livestock. Most \nlivestock, beef, dairy, sheep, and goats, are eligible for Federal \ndisaster assistance during a drought, but horses are not. This \nlegislation would make horses eligible for disaster-assistance programs \noffered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues from Arkansas and \nKentucky to join me in introducing this legislation of tremendous \nimportance to our States. I look forward to working with them and our \ncolleagues in the Senate to enact this bipartisan bill into law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today: I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the City of Yuma Improvement Act of 2005. This bill \nauthorizes the conveyance to the city of Yuma of six small parcels of \nFederal land currently held by the Bureau of Reclamation in exchange \nfor three railroad parcels owned by the city on which the Bureau of \nReclamation rail line exists. A companion bill has already been \nintroduced in the House by Congressmen Grijalva and Franks.\n  These land conveyances will enable the city to complete the \nredevelopment of the riverfront in downtown Yuma. The Riverfront Master \nRedevelopment Plan was approved by the City Council in November, 2001. \nThe plan was developed through a joint planning process with the city \nand the developer. The city's responsibility is to amass the property \nalong the riverfront. The developer must raise the needed capital. The \nredevelopment includes the development of a welcome center, a new \nhotel, a conference center, and mixed-use retail stores. This \nredevelopment is designed to connect Main Street with the Heritage Area \nand the river to enhance the quality of life of Yuma's citizens and one \nof the primary economic assets of the area--tourism.\n  Most of the land in this 22 acre area is already city-owned. However, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation does own several parcels within the \nredevelopment area that the city seeks to acquire. Since 2001, when the \nredevelopment plan was approved, the city and the Bureau have been \nworking together to effectuate this acquisition for this public \npurpose. These efforts include: relocating, at the city's expense, the \nBureau facilities that were within the redevelopment area and \ncompleting the necessary environmental analyses of the project area, \nincluding historic resource studies, site assessments, and asbestos and \nlead-based paint inspections.\n  Essentially, the deal is complete with one exception: the authority \nto accomplish the conveyances. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation \ndoes not have the authority to exchange the lands it possesses for the \nrailroad parcels it seeks--it must be done legislatively. There is \nbroad support in Yuma for this legislated land swap given its public \npurpose objectives, thorough planning, and the economic opportunity it \nbrings. I hope my colleagues agree and will work with me to pass this \nlegislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 1531. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto expand and intensify programs with respect to research and related \nactivities concerning elder falls; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, these people all have something in common: \nthe former Queen Mother of Britain; diet guru Dr. Robert Atkins; former \nTonight Show co-host Ed McMahon; former first lady Nancy Reagan; and \nformer Senator Bob Dole. What is it? They are all famous seniors who \nhave suffered a fall during the past three years that had serious \nrepercussions on their lives.\n  Queen Elizabeth's mother had a history of falling. She underwent a \nmajor operation in 1995 to replace her right hip and had a second hip \nreplacement in 1998 when she broke her left hip. In 2000, she tripped \nand fell in her sitting room and fractured the left-hand side of her \ncollarbone. Then, in 2002 at 101-years-old, she stumbled again in her \nsitting room while getting up from a chair and cut her arm.\n  Dr. Robert Atkins, the creator of the high-protein, low-carbohydrate \nAtkins diet, suffered a severe head trauma in 2003 when an accidental \nfall outside his New York office left him comatose. Although surgeons \nremoved a blood clot to relieve the pressure on his brain, the 72-year-\nold died eight days later.\n  In March of this year, former Tonight Show co-host Ed McMahon spent \nhis 82nd birthday in the hospital after a fall in his Beverly Hills \nhome left him with a mild concussion and a gash in his head that \nrequired stitches.\n  Just last month, former first lady Nancy Reagan slipped and fell in \nher London hotel room. Fortunately, she was not seriously injured, but \nwas told by doctors to limit her activities for two weeks until the \npain subsided and full mobility returned.\n  The final story hits even closer to home. In January of this year, \n81-year-old former Senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole felt \nlight-headed and suffered a near fatal fall while putting away a \nsuitcase. After a quick trip to the hospital to stitch up a cut from \nhis eyeglasses, he was taken back home. Later, he felt ill and had to \nbe taken back to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Doctors worked fast \nto save his life. In the fall he had severely damaged his left ``good'' \narm, and he suffered bleeding in his head which was worsened by the \nblood thinners he was given a month earlier after a hip replacement \noperation. After spending 22 days at Walter Reed, he told a reporter \nthat he was ``getting better slowly'' and that the recovery was \n``humiliating'' at times.\n  As evidenced, falling is a very common and serious problem for older \npersons. These stories demonstrate the fact that falls can happen to \nanyone--even the rich and famous. A new report finds that although the \nlife expectancy for Americans has reached an all-time high and senior \ncitizens are more active than previous generations were, they are also \nreporting to emergency rooms in greater numbers for fall-related \ninjuries. Falls can result in decreased physical function and mobility, \ndisability, reduced independence, and a diminished quality of life. \nLoss of confidence and fear of falling can lead to further functional \ndecline, depression, feelings of helplessness, and social isolation.\n  The statistics are overwhelming. More than one-third of adults age 65 \nyears and older fall each year. Falls are the leading cause of injury \ndeaths among individuals in that age group. In 2002, falls among older \nadults accounted for 12,800 deaths and 1,640,000 emergency department \nvisits.\n  Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly have \nincreased from 231,000 in 1988 to 327,000 in 2001. One in 5 older \nAmericans who suffer a hip fracture die within a year, and 1 in 5 \npeople with a hip fracture end up in a nursing home within a year. \nAmong people 75 years and older, those who fall are four to five times \nmore likely to be admitted to a long-term care facility for a year or \nlonger.\n  Annually, more than 80,000 individuals who are over 65 years of age \nsustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of a fall.\n  A recent study of people age 72 and older found that the average \nhealth care cost of a fall injury was $19,440. This figure does not \ninclude physician services. The total medical cost of all fall injuries \nfor people age 65 and older was calculated in 2000 to be $19.5 billion. \nBy 2020, the cost of fall injuries is expected to reach $43.8 billion, \nin current dollars.\n  Given our aging population, by the year 2040, the number of hip \nfractures is expected to exceed 500,000--the annual cost of which is \nprojected to be a shocking $240 billion.\n  To make matters worse, given the aging baby boomers, more and more \nelderly will be susceptible to falls. By the year 2040, the 65 and \nolder population will more than double to about 77.2 million, and the \nrelative growth rate is even faster for people over 85.\n  It seems that we've come to expect that a fall by an older relative \nis just a natural part of aging, when it is not. As the old adage says \nso well: ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' Almost \nwithout exception, these falls are preventable. Older adults who have \nfallen previously or who stumble frequently are two to three times more \nlikely to fall within the next year. We need to take action to ensure \nthat doesn't happen.\n  Last year, Senator Mikulski and I introduced the ``Keeping Seniors \nSafe From Falls Act of 2004,'' which passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. Today, we are reintroducing this legislation, and we look \nforward to working with our colleagues so that it not only passes the \nSenate, but is signed into law.\n  Our bill will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to \noversee\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\nand support national and local education campaigns focusing on reducing \nfalls among older adults and preventing repeat falls. It also calls for \nresearch in areas such as identifying older adults at high risk for \nfalling; designing, implementing and evaluating the most effective fall \nprevention interventions; improving diagnosis, treatment, and \nrehabilitation of older adults who have fallen; tailoring effective \nstrategies to specific populations; and eliminating barriers to \nadopting proven fall prevention strategies. In addition, the bill \nsupports demonstration and research projects to improve the science \nbehind preventing falls. It also requires the Secretary to evaluate the \neffect of falls on health care costs, the potential for reducing falls, \nand the most effective strategies for reducing fall-related health care \ncosts. Finally, the bill authorizes the appropriation of funds for each \nof fiscal years 2007 through 2009 in order to carry out its provisions.\n  I look forward to working again with Senator Mikulski, my colleagues \non the HELP Committee, and the wide variety of groups who support this \nbill. I urge you to support this legislation that will help to keep our \nnation's seniors--ourselves, our family members, and our friends--safe \nfrom falls so that they may have a chance to fully enjoy and savor \ntheir ``golden years'' in a safer and healthier fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping Seniors Safe From \n     Falls Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Enzi in \nintroducing the Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act of 2005. Falls are \na serious public health problem that affects millions of seniors each \nyear. This bill expands research and education on elder falls to help \nkeep seniors safe and in their own homes longer.\n  The facts are staggering. One out of every three Americans over age \n65 falls every year. In 2002, over 12,800 seniors died and \napproximately 1.6 million seniors visited an emergency department as a \nresult of a fall. Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \nseniors. It is estimated that annually more than 80,000 individuals \nover 65 years of age sustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of a \nfall. Falls can be financially disastrous for families, and falls place \na serious financial strain on our health care system. By 2020, senior \nfalls are estimated to cost the health care system more than $32 \nbillion.\n  These facts do not begin to tell the story of what falls can mean for \nseniors and their loved ones. Falls don't discriminate. Many of us have \nfriends or relatives who have fallen. A fall can have a devastating \nimpact on a person's physical, emotional, and mental health. If an \nolder woman loses her footing on her front porch steps, falls, and \nsuffers a hip fracture, she would likely spend about two weeks in the \nhospital, and there is a 50 percent chance that she would not return \nhome or live independently as a result of her injuries.\n  With some help, there are simple ways that seniors can improve the \nsafety of their homes and make a fall far less likely. Home \nmodifications like hand rails in the bathroom, rubber mats on slippery \ntile floors, and cordless telephones that seniors can keep nearby can \nmake a big difference. Well trained pharmacists can review medications \nto make sure that two drugs do not interact to cause dizziness and \nthrow a senior off balance.\n  That is why I teamed up with Senator Enzi to introduce this important \nbill. This legislation is about getting behind our Nation's seniors and \ngiving help to those who practice self-help. This bill creates public \neducation campaigns for seniors, their families, and health care \nproviders about how to prevent falls. It expands research on elder \nfalls to develop better ways to prevent falls and to improve the \ntreatment and rehabilitation of elder falls victims. This legislation \nalso requires an evaluation of the effect of falls on health care \ncosts, ways we can reduce falls, and effective solutions that can be \nadopted that can help reduce health care costs associated with falls.\n  Reducing the number of falls will help seniors live longer, \nhealthier, more independent lives. This bill has the strong support of \nthe National Safety Council, the Home Safety Council and the National \nCouncil on Aging, and has been supported in the past by over 30 \nnational and local aging and safety organizations. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Enzi and my colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to get this bill signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1532. A bill to amend title 18 of the United States Code to \ncriminalize acts of agroterrorism, and to enhance the protection of the \nUnited States agricultural industry and food security through the \nincreased prevention, detection, response and recovery planning; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nAgroterrorism Prevention Act of 2005, which would amend Title 18 of the \nUnited States Code to criminalize acts of agroterrorism, and to enhance \nthe protection of the United States agricultural industry and food \nsecurity through increased prevention, detection, response and recovery \nplanning.\n  Since the events of September 11, 2001, Congress has taken \nsubstantive actions to protect America and indeed, the world from the \nthreat of terrorism. Yet, there is a significant component of the \nUnited States that is at risk from terrorist attacks, and that is \nAmerican agriculture. The United States agriculture industry accounts \nfor 13 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product, makes up 8 \npercent of our foreign trade, and accounts for over $192 billion in \ncash receipts. More specifically in Pennsylvania, agriculture is the \nnumber one industry with over 59,000 farms and ranches producing cash \nreceipts exceeding $4 billion annually. Less than 2 percent of the \nAmerican people are considered farmers or ranchers; however, they are \nresponsible for feeding 100 percent of the American population. It is \nincumbent upon us in Congress to do everything in our power to ensure \nthat the American farmer and rancher, and our Nation's food supply, are \nprotected from any act of terrorism.\n  During the 108th Congress, I held four forums on the issue of \nagroterrorism and food security at the Pennsylvania Department of \nAgriculture working in conjunction with the PA Secretary of Agriculture \nto address the needs and concerns of Pennsylvania's producers, \nprocessors, commodity representatives, veterinarians, public health \nofficials, university administrators, and local government \nrepresentatives. Collectively, the comments and issues raised at these \nforums provided the impetus to craft this necessary and timely \nlegislation.\n  This legislation would afford the American farmer, rancher, and the \nUnited States agriculture industry the protection it deserves. My bill \nwould amend Title 18 of the United States Code to criminalize the act \nof agroterrorism, ensuring that we have a legal recourse against \nindividuals seeking to disrupt our interstate commerce and foreign \ntrade, or who try to coerce our civilian population or government. An \nagroterrist act would be defined as a criminal act that consists of \ncausing, financing, or attempting to cause damage or harm to, or \ndestruction of, a crop, livestock, raw agricultural commodity, food \nproduct, farm or ranch equipment, a material, or any other property \nassociated with agriculture, or a person engaged in an agricultural \nactivity, that is committed to intimidate or coerce a civilian \npopulation; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \ncoercion; or to disrupt interstate commerce or foreign commerce of the \nUnited States agricultural industry. Further, I have included the death \npenalty provision in this legislation to be consistent with existing \nlaws concerning acts of terrorism.\n  Beyond criminalizing the act of agroterrorism, this legislation would \nprovide farmers and ranchers with on-farm bio-security resources; tools \nthat reduce the potential for disease outbreaks. Through these \nresources, our farmers and ranchers would be able develop preparedness, \nresponse and recovery planning techniques. These techniques would \nenable farmers and ranchers to control access to their farms, separate \nanimal shipping vehicles from animal feed facilities, and know what \nrisks visitors present. Ultimately, the intent of this provision is to \nensure that our first responders have the information, training, and \ncritical infrastructure they need to react aggressively to an incident \nof agroterrorism.\n  The impact of globalization affects agriculture in ways that many \nwould be unaware. For example, livestock and crop diseases can be \nobtained and disseminated with ever increasing ease. These diseases are \nendemic to other parts of the world and can be extracted from common \nmaterials, such as soil. Additionally, agricultural inspections at \nports of entry, the first line of defense against the entry of foreign \nanimal and plant diseases, have declined over the last two years at a \ntime when imports have increased. Therefore, I have called for the \nSecretaries of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Interior, Health and \nHuman Services, the Attorney General, and the Director of National \nIntelligence to coordinate and enhance monitoring, surveillance, and \nintelligence capabilities concerning threats, delivery systems, border \ncontrols, and actions that could be directed against the agriculture \nsector.\n\n  This legislation would authorize significant grant funding for States \nto establish state and local emergency response plans, information \nmanagement, and to provide training for first responders, in the event \nof an animal or plant disease outbreak. The 2001 foot\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\nand mouth disease outbreak in England required extensive intervention \nto eradicate and control the spread of disease. Therefore, the question \nremains if our Nation is ready to respond to such an outbreak, whether \ncaused by a natural event or an act of terrorism.\n  Additionally, this legislation would authorize funding for pilot \ngrant demonstrations concerning on-farm bio-security. The majority of \nour Nation's farmers, ranchers, and processors are family owned or \nsmall businesses, and they need our assistance in strengthening and \nchanging their practices to meet the challenges they are facing in this \nwar on terror. It is our duty as their representatives to provide the \ntools they need to preserve the American farm and ranch.\n  This legislation would ensure that our National Veterinary Stockpile \ncontains sufficient amounts of animal vaccine, antiviral, or \ntherapeutic products to appropriately respond to the most damaging \nanimal diseases affecting human health and the economy. Additionally, \nlet us not think that agroterrorism pertains only to animals. A plant \ndisease event can impact our agricultural economy as well. Therefore, I \nhave included provisions to ensure that our U.S. National Germplasm \nsystem can respond to such an event with the use of disease-resistant \nseed varieties.\n  Compounding the threat of agroterrorism is the fact that the United \nStates is currently experiencing a shortage of veterinarians in rural \nagricultural areas. This results in an inability to respond to a \ndisease outbreak whether natural or an act of terrorism. In response to \nthis decline, this legislation would provide both educational debt \nrepayment for veterinarians serving American agriculture during a \ndisease outbreak and capacity building grants for colleges and schools \nof veterinary medicine to design higher education training programs in \nexotic animal diseases, epidemiology, and public health.\n  The last provision of this legislation would require the Secretaries \nof Homeland Security, Agriculture, HHS, Interior, and the Administrator \nof EPA to submit a report to Congress that describes the feasibility \nand need for modernizing or replacing current federal Biological Level \n3 and Biological Level 4 laboratories responsible for research, \ntechnology development, diagnostic, and forensic activities on plant \nand animal diseases, including zoonotic diseases. As a nation we cannot \nadequately fight a modern war on terrorism using technology and \nlaboratories that have exceeded their capability and useful life span.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation, which \nwould secure our Nation's most critical infrastructure, our food \nsupply. As a nation, we cannot take for granted that our food supply \nwill not be susceptible to terrorist activities. The measures called \nfor in this legislation would not impose any new regulations on our \nfarmers, ranchers, or processors but rather would provide them with the \ntools necessary to counteract agroterrorism. Without question, the time \nhas come for concerted action to ensure the protection of American \nagriculture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1533. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board of Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I rise, along with my \ncosponsor, Senator DeWine, to reintroduce legislation called I TEACH, \nIncentives to Educate America's Children Act of 2005. This legislation \nis an investment to support teachers in rural areas, and high poverty \nareas. It provides a $1,000 refundable tax credit for those teachers \nwilling to serve in challenging schools. The bill also gives every \nteacher the chance to earn a refundable tax credit by offering a $1,000 \nrefundable tax credit for every teacher who earns accreditation by the \nNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards. A National Board \nTeacher in a rural school or high poverty school would receive a $2,000 \ncredit which hopefully would promote retention of our best teachers.\n  According to the most recent survey by the American Federation of \nTeachers, the average teacher salary is $45,771. While teacher salaries \nrose an average of 3.3 percent, the health insurance benefits spiked an \naverage 13 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The \nstarting salary for a new teacher is estimated to be $30,496. Given the \ncosts of college, the average student graduates with a debt of $19,400 \nand face loan payments of $210 a month, it is difficult for young, \neager graduates to pursue careers in teaching and pay off their student \ndebt and other living expenses.\n  It is sad when a dedicated young person decides that they simply \ncannot ``afford'' to be a teacher, but this happens. The I TEACH Act \nwill help by providing meaningful tax credits to teachers willing to \nserve in rural areas or high poverty schools, and it will provide a \nstrong financial incentive to keep quality teachers in the classrooms \nby rewarding teachers who earn National Board certification. Thirty \nStates provide some type of financial incentive to National Board \nteachers, and this refundable tax credit will support such efforts. For \nexample, West Virginia offers a $2,500 bonus for National Board \nteachers. If I TEACH is enacted, a National Board teacher in my State \nwould receive a 9 percent bonus which is a meaningful incentive.\n  Our teachers are essential professionals that inspire and educate our \nchildren, who represent the next generation. Our teachers deserve our \nrespect and real support. I urge my colleagues to work with me to enact \nI TEACH and reward our teachers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1537. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of Parkinson's Disease Research Education and \nClinical Centers in the Veterans Health Administration of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and Multiple Sclerosis Centers of \nExcellence; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise proudly today to introduce \nlegislation that would establish Parkinson's Disease Research Education \nand Clinical Centers and Multiple Sclerosis, MS, Centers of Excellence \nin the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA. The need for research and care is extremely pressing at a \ntime when VA is dealing with meeting the demands of veterans suffering \nfrom debilitating neurological diseases.\n  VA has been a leader in the advancement of medicine and should be \napplauded for its progressive and innovative research endeavors. Yet, \ncontinued strides in specialized research are necessary to address the \nspecific health care needs of our veterans. Through the establishment \nof the Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis Centers, VA \nclinicians and educators will be able to gain a better understanding of \nthese diseases that affect not just our veterans, but Americans across \nthe nation. It is through this understanding that clinicians will be \nable to provide more effective patient care, treatment, and education.\n  The establishment of the Parkinson's Disease Research Education and \nClinical Centers stems from the same spirit that inspired the \nconception of a great alliance formed between VA and the National \nParkinson Foundation, Inc., NPF, in June of 1999. This alliance created \nan opportunity for the two entities to come together to develop \nresearch and treatment symposiums, provide information concerning \nParkinson's disease, and also provide VA physicians that treat at least \n20,000 Parkinson's patients with continuing education.\n  Those affected with Parkinson's Disease not only suffer from symptoms \nthat manifest themselves physically, such as through tremors, muffled \nspeech, slowness and impaired mobility. There are also psychological \neffects characterized in the form of depression for those suffering \nfrom this diseases. Through these centers, clinicians and educators can \ndetermine better ways to manage symptoms associated with Parkinson's \nDisease, as well as those symptoms such as fatigue and spasticity \nassociated with MS that will give veterans suffering from these \ndiseases a better quality of life.\n  Since the time of its inception, the VA health care system was tasked \nwith\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\nmeeting the special needs of its veteran patients. Though VA is \nproviding the necessary care to those currently affected by the \ndisease, more can be done to develop new treatments to reduce the \nsymptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.\n  This legislation will provide VA with the opportunity to establish \nthese centers and mark a new phase in the pursuit of enhanced treatment \nfor those that struggle with the daily challenges imposed by these \ndiseases, which includes not only the veteran patients but their \nfamilies as well. The Parkinson's Disease Research Education and \nClinical Centers and Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence will also \nbe beacons of hope towards finding a cure for degenerative neurological \ndiseases.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this bill as a commitment to \nadvancing research and education for veterans battling Parkinson's \nDisease and Multiple Sclerosis. I also wish to thank Congressman Lane \nEvans, who serves as the ranking member of the House Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, for his leadership on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing America's \nBetter Classroom Act, an important incentive to support school \nconstruction and renovations. I believe that this bill is a wise \ninvestment in education and economic development. It creates jobs as we \nbuild and renovate our schools.\n  America's Better Classroom Act of 2005 is designed to respond to the \noverwhelming need for school construction. The Department of Education \nreports that the average public school building is 42 years old. In \n1995, GAO estimated that we needed $112 billion for school construction \nand renovations. A more recent survey in 2001 in the Journal of \nEducation Finance indicates that the need is increasing, and the unmet \nneed for school infrastructure over the next decade is over $200 \nbillion. My State, West Virginia, will need as much as $2 billion for \nschool construction and renovations, and the cost of construction \nincreases as the cost of building materials continues to escalate.\n  America's Better Classroom Act provides the financial tools to help \nbuild and renovate our schools. It will continue the Qualified Zone \nAcademy Bonding, (QZAB) Program that has helped economically \ndisadvantaged communities. This provision would provide $2.8 billion to \ncontinue and expand the successful QZAB Program. In recent years, this \nprogram has provided $4.2 million for support school construction and \nrenovations in disadvantaged communities. Effective programs deserve \ncontinued support.\n  But we should more broadly expand investment in school construction \nbecause so many school districts need help with school construction and \nrenovations but cannot qualify for the QZAB program. This is why the \nAmerica's Better Classroom Act creates a $22 billion Qualified School \nBonding Program. Funding will be allocated to states based on the Title \n1 formula so it is targeted, but the states will have flexibility in \nallocating support among school districts.\n  When I visit schools in West Virginia, I am often stunned by the \naging buildings and compelling needs. In our fast-growing Eastern \nPanhandle, we need new schools to deal with a growing population. In \nother parts of the State, older school building need renovations to be \nsafe and conducive learning environments for our students. Also as \ntechnology plays an increasingly important role in education, \nclassrooms need to be updated.\n  States and communities need the America's Better Classroom Act so \nthat we can make needed investments. Also, school construction can play \na positive role in helping to stimulate our economy and create needed \njobs. School construction is a reliable economic stimulus, and an \nimportant investment in our children's education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1539. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to promote the adoption of children with special needs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, throughout my career in the Senate, I \nhave sought to strengthen and improve policies for the most vulnerable \nchildren children who are at-risk of abuse and neglect in their own \nhomes. The foster care system is the basic safety net for such \nchildren, but common sense tells us that a safe permanent home is the \nbest place for a child. As Congress clearly stated in the 1997 Adoption \nand Safe Families Act, every child deserves a safe, permanent home. Now \nthe challenge is to reform our program to deliver on this promise.\n  To truly fulfill that goal, we need to improve the Federal adoption \nassistance program, which is why I am introducing the Adoption Equality \nAct today. Current law only provides adoption assistance to special \nneeds children whose parents would have been eligible for the old Aid \nto Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as of July 1996. It is \nridiculous to base a child's eligibility for assistance on the income \nof the abusive parents from whom they will have been taken for their \nown health and safety. Because of this Federal regulation, only half of \nspecial needs children get Federal assistance under current law. I \nfirmly believe that every child with special needs who will not be \nadopted without assistance deserves Federal support. It is a basic \ninvestment to delivering on our commitment to help provide a safe, \npermanent home.\n  As we talk about the importance of families, shouldn't we invest in \nhelping to create and maintain such families, especially for our most \nvulnerable children?\n  By supporting the Adoption Equality Act, we send a clear signal that \nevery child deserves a safe, permanent home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1540. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army and the \nSecretary of the Interior to establish a program to improve water \nmanagement and contribute to the recovery of endangered species in the \nMiddle Rio Grande, New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the American West, we are frequently \nfaced with the challenge of how best to allocate our scarce water \nresources among numerous competing interests. There is no better \nexample of this challenge than the one that has developed in the past \nsix years in the Middle Rio Grande Valley in my home State of New \nMexico. However, how this challenge was addressed is illustrative of \nwhat can be accomplished when people are willing to put adversity and \ndivergent interests aside and work together to solve common problems.\n  In 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service listed as endangered the Rio \nGrande Silvery Minnow, a fish native to the waters of the Rio Grande in \nNew Mexico. The listing was followed by a five-year drought which began \nin 1999. The drought resulted in an insufficient amount of water to \nmeet the needs of the Silvery Minnow and led several environmental \ngroups to file the lawsuit Minnow v. Keys in Federal district court. \nAfter the district court issued a decision, the case was appealed to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit which held \nthat the Endangered Species Act required that water should be taken \naway from municipalities, farmers and industry in order to meet the \nneeds of the Silvery Minnow. In a water-scarce State like New Mexico, \nthe ruling rang out like a gun shot and created acrimony amongst those \nwho are entirely dependant on water from the Rio Grande.\n  In response, I established the Middle Rio Grande Collaborative \nProgram in 2000. The program is based on the premise that it is better \nto work in the spirit of cooperation to develop solutions to shared \nproblems regarding resource management including how best to meet the \nneeds of our endangered species. When left up to the courts, there are \nalways losers. Since 2000, the collaborative program has been a \nremarkable success, bringing together various stakeholders including \nFederal and State agencies, cities, Pueblos, environmental groups, \nfarmers and business interests in an effort to protect our biological \nheritage and ecological diversity while meeting the needs of those who \nare dependant on the waters of the Rio Grande. Often, the process has \nbeen difficult. However, I'm sure all would agree that it is far \npreferable to the alternative of continued litigation. The success of \nthe program is especially marked when one considers that the program \nhas lacked specific goals, an organizational structure, a decision \nmaking hierarchy, and formal authorization.\n  I rise today to introduce the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species \nCollaborative Program Act, a bill to provide the program with the \nauthority it needs to continue its important mission. This bill would \nstreamline the decision making process of the program, delegate \nresponsibilities among federal agencies, and provide adequate authority \nfor Federal participation. I have no doubt that this program will \ncontinue to serve as a model of how to deal with the West's resource \nmanagement challenges.\n  I would like to thank my dear friend and colleague Senator Bingaman, \nwho I have had the pleasure of serving with in the United States Senate \nfor the past 22 years for being an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect, conserve, and restore public land \nadministered by the Department of the Interior or the Forest Service \nand adjacent land through cooperative cost-shared grants to control and \nmitigate the spread of invasive species, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Land \nProtection and Conservation Act of 2005. I am pleased to have Senators \nInouye, Lautenberg and Levin join me in cosponsoring the bill. My \nlegislation encourages Federal, State, and local agencies, nonprofit \norganizations, Indian tribes and private entities to work together \nthrough a cost-shared, cooperative grant program to control and \nmitigate the spread of invasive species.\n  Invasive species are defined as harmful, nonnative plants, animals, \nor organisms likely to cause economic harm, environmental harm, or harm \nto human health. They are widespread throughout the United States and \ncause billions of dollars of damage annually to crops, rangelands, and \nwaterways. The globalization of trade, the massive volume of cargo \nshipments, and rising tourism have combined to increase the chance of \nintroductions of nonnative species into the United States. They are \nresponsible for damage to native ecosystems and vital industries such \nas agriculture, fisheries, and ranching. The economic, social, \nrecreational, and ecological losses attributable to invasive species \nare huge. A recent Cornell University study estimated that invasive \nplants and animals cost the U.S. economy $137 billion annually. The \ncosts are predicted to increase substantially as more invasive species \nenter the country.\n  The implications of the nationwide invasive species problem are \nenormous. The Ecological Society of America notes that invasive species \ncontribute to the listing of 35 to 46 percent of all threatened and \nendangered species. Nowhere, however, are the impacts greater than in \nmy home State of Hawaii. Hawaii is known for its biodiversity. Hawaii \nhas more than 10,000 species found nowhere else on Earth. \nUnfortunately, invasive species are the number one cause of the decline \nof Hawaii's threatened and endangered species. This is a serious \nconcern because of the 114 endangered species that have become extinct \nduring the first 20 years of the Endangered Species Act, almost half \nwere in Hawaii. Recently, gall wasps were found laying eggs in wiliwili \ntrees. These trees were once a dominant species in dry Hawaiian \nforests. Now they are nearly 90 percent gone with the remnants of the \nremaining trees, primarily found on Maui and the Big Island, threatened \nby the invasive gall wasp. The fragility of our native species is \ncompounded by the fact that most introduced species have no natural \npredators in the State, and such predators cannot simply cross a State \nborder to enter Hawaii. Hawaii's Invasive Species Partnerships, a group \ncomprised of a state council and island-based committees stated in its \n2004 report that ``the silent invasion of Hawaii by alien invasive \nspecies is the single greatest threat to Hawaii's economy, natural \nenvironment, and the health and lifestyle of Hawaii's people and \nvisitors.'' Hawaii is plagued with pest invasions to a greater extent \nthan almost any other location in the world. The invasion has limited \nour agricultural export market, decreased bio-diversity in the forests, \nand decimated native bird populations. It is imperative that this \nserious issue receive our full attention.\n  Let me give you just a few examples of invasive species problems in \nHawaii. Control efforts for the Formosan ground termite are estimated \nto cost residents in Hawaii more than $150 million per year. Damage to \nour agricultural industry and the related control costs of the \nMediterranean fruit fly are more than $450 million annually. Miconia, \nan invasive tree infesting more than 15,000 acres of rainforest in \nHawaii, eliminates the habitat of endangered plants and animals and \ncauses serious erosion problems that threaten our water supply. Bush \nBeardgrass is a drought-tolerant grass that increases the risk of \nbrushfires. Wildlife authorities say the grass is beyond control on \nKauai and the Big Island. Native birds in our rainforests are \nsuccumbing to malaria spread through introduced mosquitos. Coqui frogs \ncan reach densities of 8,000 frogs per acre and threaten Hawaii's real \nestate, export floriculture, and nursery industries. The brown tree \nsnake has invaded Guam and devastated native bird populations there. If \nthe snakes become established in Hawaii, economic costs have been \nestimated to exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. Red fire ants \nthreaten the agriculture industry in Hawaii and in 14 Southern States, \ncausing more than $2 billion in annual damage. As you can see, the list\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\nof problems is long and the time to address the issue of invasive \nspecies is now, before even more serious problems crop up.\n  With 73 percent of land in the continental U.S. held privately, our \nFederal lands will not be adequately protected without public-private \npartnerships. My bill requires coordination between the National \nInvasive Species Council, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, and State invasive species councils and \nplans. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ngrants to promote the development of voluntary State assessments to \nestablish inventories and priorities for controlling invasive species. \nThis is a critical step in establishing an invasives program, but many \nStates do not have the resources to carry out this critical assessment. \nThe legislation also provides additional grants to public or private \nentities, or Indian tribes, to carry out in partnership with a Federal \nagency an eradication, containment, or management project on Federal \nland or adjacent land. Control grants are cost-shared with partners. \nThe criteria for ranking control projects include shared priorities in \nState and Federal plans, the severity of the invasive species impact on \na State, and whether the project fosters results through public-private \npartnerships. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the bill provides \nrapid response funds for States facing new outbreaks of invasive \nspecies, to eradicate serious new outbreaks. Rapid response funds are \ncritical to States in order to combat newly identified invasives.\n  I was pleased to see that Federal departments would receive an \noverall increase for the seven invasive species general categories in \nthe President's fiscal year 2006 proposed budget. I appreciate the \nconsideration that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have \ngiven this important issue. However, I was dismayed to see that the \nbudget for the category of control of invasive species declined by $25 \nmillion from its fiscal year 2005 enacted level. Control is an \nessential element in combating invasive species and requires additional \nfunding.\n  I would like to acknowledge the fine work being accomplished by the \nNational Park Service in establishing its Exotic Plant Management \nTeams. These Teams are designed to provide a highly trained, mobile \nstrike force of plant management specialists to assist parks in the \ncontrol of exotic plants. Approximately 2.6 million acres in the \nnational parks are infected and 234 parks have invasive animals in need \nof management. To date, 17 Teams have been deployed throughout the \ncountry. I am grateful to the Pacific Island Team for its efforts to \nprotect increasingly rare native communities in the Hawaiian Islands \nfrom invasion. Control of exotic species is one of the most significant \nland management issues facing national parks. Although I applaud the \ncurrent efforts of the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest \nService, a more coordinated and forceful attack on invasive species is \nneeded. The attack must have robust funding and work in partnership \nwith the States.\n  I am particularly pleased that the State of Hawaii is taking a \nleadership role in addressing its invasive species problems. Two years \nago the Hawaii State Legislature established the Hawaii Invasive \nSpecies Council to coordinate the State's fight against animal and \nplant invaders, with the Department of Agriculture and the Department \nof Land and Natural Resources in leading roles. The Hawaii State \nLegislature has directed approximately $8 million to the invasives \ncampaign so far. The Hawaii Invasive Species Council and each county \ncouncil are committed to a proactive approach to preserve the \nenvironmental heritage and economic security of our communities for \ngenerations to come. In addition, many public and private partnerships \nhave been formed to protect our common natural resources. For example, \nthe East Maui Watershed Partnership brings together multiple public and \nprivate landowners and the County of Maui to control invasive species \nand protect 100,000 acres of our prime watershed areas. This is just \none example of many highly successful and dedicated partnerships in \nHawaii working to preserve our invaluable resources.\n  The National Environmental Coalition on Invasive Species, a coalition \nof representatives from major environmental organizations, has extended \nits full support for this legislation. Its letter of support calls this \nbill ``one of the best legislative proposals to date to deal with the \ngrowing threat that invasive species pose to our nation's ecological \nand economic health.'' The State of Hawaii, Department of Land and \nNatural Resources, also supports the bill. The Department acknowledges \nthat success in invasive species projects in Hawaii have come largely \nfrom the formation of strong partnerships between State, County and \nFederal agencies and private groups -exactly what my legislation \nendorses. My bill is also supported by the Conservation Council of \nHawaii, the National Wildlife Federation affiliate in Hawaii. I greatly \nappreciate these endorsements.\n  As Federal efforts to combat the growing tide of invasive species \nincrease, some landowners and private property advocates are concerned \nthat increased efforts to combat invasives and support native plants \nand animals could lead to the next big government invasion of private \nlands. Let me assure you this is not a property rights issue. Any \naction taken by governments or nonprofits through this bill can occur \nonly with the participation and willingness of the property owner.\n  There are increasingly severe problems and economic burdens \nassociated with invasive species in our Nation that are borne at the \nState and local levels. If ever there was a time to commit to defending \nthe security of our domestic resources for the future, it is now. My \nlegislation provides the support necessary for agencies, organizations, \nand individuals to implement cooperative projects to address new \nthreats and long-standing invasive species problems. This is an issue \nthat must be confronted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, as well as the letters of support from Hawaii and national \ngroups, and urge my colleagues to support my legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1541\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The member organizations of the \n     National Environmental Coalition on Invasive Species are \n     writing in support of the Pubic Land Protection and \n     Conservation Act of 2005.\n       Separately, our individual organizations have protested \n     millions of acres of land; worked with thousands of corporate \n     partners, affiliates, and community groups; and provided \n     scientific, economic, and legal analyses that advocate \n     responsible policy solutions to the international, national, \n     and local level.\n       Together, our organizations have over six million \n     individual members and supporters. The threat that invasive \n     species pose to our environment and economy and our interest \n     in finding equitable, practical, and cost-effective solutions \n     to this environmental problem unites us in this Coalition.\n       Invasive species that choke out, devour, and destroy native \n     wildlife and their habitat have infested more than 100 \n     million acres of the American landscape. An additional three \n     million acres are lost each year to invasive weeds--an area \n     equal to a strip of land two miles wide stretching from coast \n     to coat. Invasive species are one of the most critical \n     threats to America's natural diversity and pose clear risks \n     to the nation's waters, forests, farmlands, rangelands, \n     wetlands, natural area, and public and private property \n     values. Experts estimates that these fast moving invaders are \n     already causing $130 billion of damage each year to the \n     economy.\n       The Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2005 is \n     one of the best legislative proposals to date to deal with \n     the growing threat that invasive species pose to our nation's \n     ecological and economic health. We applaud this effort to use \n     federal funding as an incentive to encourage local government \n     agencies, private organizations, and individuals to be more \n     proactive in managing invasive and invading species. The \n     Native Heritage Control Grant Program offered in the bill is \n     noteworthy not only in that it provides such incentives, but \n     also in that it provides additional encouragement for \n     innovative technologies and work to benefit endangered \n     species. The Control Grant Program is aptly tailored to \n     encourage partnerships and work on federal and non-federal \n     land. Invasive species do not respect administrative or \n     political boundaries and we cannot hope to protect the best \n     federal lands without the cooperation of neighboring \n     landowners. Similarly helping private landowners and local \n     governments deal with their invasive species problems is also \n     extremely important, as recognized in this bill.\n       The Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2005 \n     reflects some of the latest scientific conclusions on \n     invasive species--we strongly support your esblishment of \n     `rapid response' funding to deal with incipient invasions. \n     There is broad consensus among organizations, scientists, and \n     state and federal agencies that eradicating invaders before \n     they become widely established is second only to prevention \n     as the most cost-effective and ultimately successful way to \n     stop invasions. This rapid response program will be critical \n     if the brown tree snake) Boiga irregularis) ever reaches \n     Hawaii from Guam, if the European green crab (Carcinus \n     maenas) ever reaches Alaska from California, or countless \n     other potential invasions occur on our coasts, inland \n     rangelands, grasslands, wetland, and waterways.\n       The Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2005 \n     contains useful deadlines and guidance to help ensure that \n     Assessment Grants, Rapid Response Assistance, and Control \n     Grants are delivered effectively, translating into meaningful \n     conservation results on the ground. The Coalition strongly \n     supports the inclusion of this language, which will help get \n     these programs up and running quickly, and help ensure quick \n     success against rapidly spreading problems. As this bill \n     recognizes, it is particularly important for Rapid Response \n     Assistance to be delivered as quickly as possible after a \n     state requests such assistance, because time is of the \n     essence to prevent new invaders from getting a foothold \n     within a state.\n       The National Environmental Coalition on Invasive Species \n     supports this proposed legislation as now written. The grant \n     programs it establishes are sorely needed to address the \n     widespread damage being caused by invasive species all across \n     America. We look forward to working with you and your staff \n     on this legislation that will help address America's dire \n     invasive species problem.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gaby Chavarria, Ph.D,\n       Vice President for Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife.\n     Peter T.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Conservation Council of Hawaii \n     commends you for introducing the Public Land Protection and \n     Conservation Act of 2004. This bill will be instrumental in \n     preventing the invasion of new invasive species, and help \n     prevent the spread of invasives that have already taken root \n     in the United States.\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\n       In Hawaii, we know first hand that invasive species choke \n     out, devour, and destroy native wildlife and their habitat. \n     Throughout the nation, invasive species have infested more \n     than 100 million acres of the American landscape and an \n     additional three million acres are lost each year to invasive \n     weeds. Invasive species are one of the most critical threats \n     to America's natural diversity and pose clear risks to the \n     nation's waters, forests, farmlands, rangelands, wetlands, \n     natural areas, and public and private property values. \n     Experts estimate that these fast moving invaders are already \n     causing $130 billion of damage each year to the economy and \n     are the second leading cause, after habitat loss, for \n     wildlife being listed as threatened and endangered.\n       The Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2004 is \n     one of the best legislative proposals to date to deal with \n     the growing threat that invasive species pose to our nation's \n     ecological and economic health. We applaud this effort to use \n     federal funding as an incentive to encourage local government \n     agencies, private organizations, and individuals to be more \n     proactive in managing invasive and invading species.

The Control Grant Program is aptly tailored to \n     encourage partnerships and work on federal and non-federal \n     land. Invasive species do not respect administrative or \n     political boundaries and we cannot hope to protect the best \n     federal lands without the cooperation of neighboring \n     landowners. Similarly, helping private landowners and local \n     governments deal with their invasive species problems is also \n     extremely important, as recognized in this bill.\n       The Public Land Protection and Conservation Act of 2004 \n     reflects some of the latest scientific conclusions on \n     invasive species--we strongly support your establishment of \n     `rapid response' funding to deal with incipient invasions. \n     There is broad consensus among organizations, scientists, and \n     state and federal agencies that eradicating invaders before \n     they become widely established is second only to prevention \n     as the most cost-effective and ultimately successful way to \n     stop invasions. This rapid response program will be critical \n     if the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) ever reaches \n     Hawaii from Guam, if the European green crab (Carcinus \n     maenas) ever reaches Alaska from California, or countless \n     other potential invasions occur on our coasts, inland \n     rangelands, grasslands, wetlands, and waterways.\n       The Conservation Council of Hawaii strongly supports this \n     proposed legislation. We look forward to working with you and \n     your staff on this legislation to ensure its successful \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marjorie Ziegler,\n     President, Conservation Council of Hawaii.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Hawaii, Department of Land and Natural \n           Resources,\n                                     Honolulu, HI, April 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Prince Kuhio Federal Building,\n     Honolulu, HI.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I would like to thank you and \n     acknowledge the State of Hawaii's support for the Public Land \n     Conservation Act of 2004. We feel this legislation will \n     achieve its stated purpose of encouraging Federal, State, \n     local and nongovernmental partnerships to assess and control \n     invasive species on Federal and adjacent lands.\n       I believe that Hawaii is the best state model for \n     developing strategies for federal agencies, not only to work \n     together more effectively, but also to work in partnership \n     with state and local government entities. Increasing success \n     in invasive species projects in Hawaii has come largely from \n     the formation of strong partnerships between State, County \n     and Federal agencies and private groups. Just as many \n     landowners and businesses are affected by the same invasive \n     species concerns, many agencies are responsible for the \n     pathways that bring potentially invasive species into Hawaii, \n     regulate their movement and control their spread.\n       Partnerships to address invasive species issues have been \n     responsible for the greatest improvements in Hawaii's ability \n     to respond to recognized priority pests. In Hawaii, combining \n     limited resources, authority, and expertise has led to the \n     creation of Invasive Species Committees that carry out on the \n     ground actions, the Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species \n     that has allowed agency staff to develop integrated policies \n     within the state and most recently the Hawaii Invasive \n     Species Council composed of State agency heads.\n       Implementation of current management plans developed by \n     coordinated efforts of relevant public agencies and affected \n     local constituents in Hawaii can help build the framework to \n     begin or enhance larger-scale regional strategies to combat \n     wide-ranging invasive species. Federal investments to support \n     local, State, and regional partners who are prepared to take \n     action now against known priority invasive species will \n     provide valuable lessons for other regions and promote \n     innovation and efficiency in protection and public outreach \n     strategies. By promoting their progress, these partnerships \n     will in turn help identify the policy and legal obstacles to \n     success as well as build a constituency for more effective \n     invasive-species prevention and control programs in other \n     areas.\n       Please let me know of any way that we can help support this \n     important piece of legislation. Mahalo.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Peter T. Young,\n                                                       Chairperson\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  II S. 1545. A bill to withdraw the Los Padres National Forest in \nCalifornia from location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwould ban additional oil and gas drilling in the Los Padres National \nForest. My colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, joins me in \nthis effort. Representative Capps introduced companion legislation in \nthe House of Representatives earlier this month.\n  Los Padres National Forest is on California's central coast, \nstretching from Monterey County's Big Sur down to Ventura and the \nwestern edge of Los Angeles County. Covering almost 1.75 million acres, \nit is California's third-largest national forest and one of the State's \nmost visited. Los Padres National Forest is an ecological treasure and \na recreational refuge in one of California's, indeed America's, most \ndensely populated areas.\n  It provides habitat for 20 threatened and endangered wildlife \nspecies, including the spectacular California condor. Los Padres also \ncontains unexplored archaeological sites that contain Native American \nhistorical artifacts.\n  Yet, despite these facts and strong local opposition to oil and gas \ndrilling in the Forest, the Forest Service announced today that it will \nopen up more than 52,000 acres of land to oil and gas drilling in Los \nPadres National Forest. While this is far less land than the Forest \nService previously considered opening, additional drilling is simply \nunacceptable. That is why I am introducing legislation to prevent this \nnew drilling, and any future drilling from occurring in Los Padres \nNational Forest.\n  Additional oil and gas drilling will threaten the pristine and \nunspoiled lands in the Forest. It could damage or destroy Native \nAmerican artifacts. And, it could ruin recreational opportunities by \ncontaminating streams and increasing air pollution.\n  My legislation is a critical step toward protecting the irreplaceable \nnatural, cultural, and recreational resources of the Los Padres \nNational Forest. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1548. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Forest \nService land to the city of Coffman Cove, Alaska; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that is very \nimportant to a small community in my home State of Alaska. This bill \nwill authorize the U.S. Forest Service to convey approximately 12 acres \nof land, which it no longer needs but continues to own in Coffman Cove, \nAK to the city of Coffman Cove. The bill authorizes that the land, a \nformer administrative site, be conveyed without charge to the city \nwhich has a population of about 230 people.\n  Coffman Cove was founded in 1965 as a logging community to provide \nsupport for the timber industry on Prince of Wales Island in the \nTongass National Forest. It operated for almost 35 years in that \ncapacity. Due to changes in Federal policy, the timber industry on the \nisland no longer provides the economic base necessary to sustain \nCoffman Cove. Attempts at economic diversification are very difficult \nso long as the Forest Service holds in Federal ownership these 12 acres \nwhich literally occupy the center of this small community.\n  Just a few years ago, the Forest Service in conjunction with the \ntimber industry completed the environmental cleanup of the logging site \nand facility at Coffman Cove. That cleanup was funded by the timber \nindustry as good corporate citizens. The result of the cleanup is that \nthe 12 acres can now be made available for disposal to the city.\n  This bill, in which I am joined by my colleague Mr. Stevens, would \nconvey title to the City without cost so that it\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\ncan begin a redevelopment plan for the community. The city of Coffman \nCove needs this land if it is to hope to reorient its economy from a \nprincipally logging community to a more diversified economic community. \nA small town of 230 people simply does not have the funds to purchase \nthis land and the Federal Government needs to pitch in by conveying \nfull title without cost to the community.\n  This is only fair since the Federal Government's change in timber \npolicy has created the city's dilemma. As a result of the change in \ntimber policy with which the Senate is so familiar, the city has been \nset adrift to fend for itself economically. And it has done a good job. \nIt will soon become the southern terminus for the Inter-Island Ferry \nAuthority's new northern route which will connect Prince of Wales \nIsland with Wrangell and Petersburg. The new route will go into service \nin the next few months and this should provide an economic boost to the \ncommunity.\n  But, Coffman Cove must control the land in the heart of its community \nif it is to economically diversify. For the new ferry route to bring \neconomic development to the City, the City must able to sell, rent, or \ndevelop its local land base. The 12 acres which are the subject of my \nbill are the 12 key acres right in the center of town. Now this is a \nsmall town and without control of this land, the City cannot ever \nsuccessfully diversity and recovers from the change in its economy as a \nresult of the change in Federal timber policy.\n  This Forest Service desires to retain a 3 acre site for its continued \nadministrative purposes. My bill does not affect that site and I expect \nthe Forest Service to have no problem with the land conveyance \nlocations provided in this bill. I appreciate the assistance of the \nForest Service in helping me to draft the legislation.\n  This conveyance fulfills the Federal Government's commitment that \nchanges in Federal timber policy would be matched by Federal help to \nthe local communities to diversify. It is absolutely appropriate and \nfair to offer Coffman Cove this former Forest Service administrative \nsite that no longer has value to the Federal government but that is \ncrucial to Coffman Cove as it plans its future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coffman Cove Administrative \n     Site Conveyance Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the community of Coffman Cove, Alaska, which originated \n     as a logging camp in the 1960's, was incorporated as a city \n     in 1989;\n       (2) the Forest Service property located in the center of \n     the City was used by the Forest Service as a work center;\n       (3) the Forest Service work facilities included part of the \n     logging camp, a log sort yard, and a log transfer site, all \n     of which supported the long-term timber sale operations and \n     other subsequent timber sales in the Tongass National Forest;\n       (4) as the long-term timber sale operations concluded, the \n     need for the Forest Service to use the Forest Service site in \n     Coffman Cove diminished;\n       (5) the Forest Service work center facilities that \n     supported timber operations have been removed and the site \n     has been restored;\n       (6) the location of the administrative site interferes with \n     the ability of the City to further develop commercial \n     operations and tourism support facilities relating to a new \n     ferry terminal;\n       (7) the City wants to acquire a portion of the site to \n     continue the transition of the City from a timber-dependent \n     economy to a more fully developed and diversified economy; \n     and\n       (8) the Forest Service expects that only approximately 3 \n     acres of the administrative site will be used in the future \n     for National Forest System purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Coffman \n     Cove, Alaska.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary shall convey to the City, without \n     consideration and without additional warrants or liability on \n     behalf of the United States, fee simple title to the parcel \n     of Forest Service land described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Description of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The parcel of Forest Service land referred \n     to in subsection (a) is the approximately 12 acres of land \n     identified in U.S. Survey 10099, as depicted on the plat \n     entitled ``Subdivision of U.S. Survey No. 10099'' and \n     recorded as Plat 2003-1 on January 21, 2003, Petersburg \n     Recording District, Alaska.\n       (2) Excluded land.--The parcel of Forest Service land \n     conveyed under subsection (a) does not include the portion of \n     U.S. Survey 10099 that is north of the right-of-way for \n     Forest Development Road 3030-295 and southeast of Tract CC-8.\n       (c) Right-of-way.--The United States may reserve a right-\n     of-way to provide access to the Forest Service land excluded \n     from the conveyance to the City under subsection (b)(2).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9307-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9307-S9308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 218--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2005 AS ``NATIONAL \n                   PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S9307, July 28, 2005, under ``SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS'' \nthe following sentence appeared: SENATE RESOLUTION 218--\nDESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 2006 AS ``NATIONAL \nPROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: SENATE RESOLUTION \n218--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2005 AS ``NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER \nAWARENESS MONTH\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nBunning, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 219\n\n       Whereas in the United States and around the world, more \n     than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of \n     extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of \n     extinction;\n       Whereas the actual and potential benefits derived from many \n     species have not yet been fully discovered and would be \n     permanently lost if not for conservation efforts;\n       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping \n     crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray \n     wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have \n     resulted in great improvements in the viability of such \n     species;\n       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound \n     research, careful coordination, and intensive management of \n     conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness \n     and education; and\n       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the \n     first steps in effectively informing the public about \n     endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 8, 2006, as ``Endangered Species \n     Day''; and\n       (2) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities to spend at least 30 minutes on \n     ``Endangered Species Day'' teaching and informing students \n     about threats to, and the restoration of, endangered species \n     around the world;\n       (B) organizations, businesses, and agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate on \n     educational information for use in schools; and\n       (C) the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nestablish ``Endangered Species Day'' on March 8, 2006. I am submitting \nthis resolution with Senators Chafee, Clinton, and Crapo whose co-\nsponsorship I greatly appreciate.\n  Additionally, I want to commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson for \nsuggesting the establishment of an ``Endangered Species Day.'' I have \nappreciated his hard work and dedication. Individuals like Mr. Robinson \ndo make a difference.\n  The designation of an ``Endangered Species Day'' provides a multitude \nof opportunities for young people, students, and the general public to \nlearn more about endangered species in both our country and abroad. It \nis my hope that establishing an ``Endangered Species Day'' encourages \nschools, civic organizations, agencies, and businesses to educate the \ngeneral public about the threats to and our efforts to restore these \nprecious species in our midst. I believe that ``Endangered Species \nDay'' will foster increased communication and awareness about many of \nthe most endangered species by encouraging such activities as school \nfield trips to the zoo or attending a lecture at the local library.\n  With the recent discovery of the once thought to be extinct Ivory-\nbilled Woodpecker in Arkansas and the Mount Diablo Buckwheat in \nCalifornia, I think this is an opportune moment to highlight the \nsuccess of many of our conservation efforts. For example, in my home \nState of California, I am especially proud of the conservation and \nmanagement efforts that have helped significantly restore populations \nof California condor, winter run chinook salmon, the least Bell's vireo \nsongbird, and the California gray whale.\n  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more needs to \nbe done. At this time, we have more than 1,000 species in the U.S. and \nabroad, which are designated as ``at risk'' for extinction. One small \nstep is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the \ncircumstances facing many of these endangered species and educating the \npublic about these species.\n  I am introducing this bill with the hope that ``Endangered Species \nDay'' can spark the wonder and interest in our youth to continue the \nconservation efforts we have begun but still are far from finishing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9308-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 220--TO EXPRESS THE CONCERN OF THE SENATE REGARDING \nTHE PASSAGE OF THE ANTI-SECESSION LAW BY THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS \n   OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND TAIWAN ON AN EQUAL FOOTING \n                         WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kyl, \nMr. Bond, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Allard, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \nBingaman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

DAVIDSON\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the Senate is acting to fill a vacant \nseat on the Election Assistance Commission EAC with the confirmation of \nMs. Donetta L. Davidson, of Colorado. Ms. Davidson was nominated by \nPresident Bush to serve the remainder of the 4-year term of DeForest B. \nSoaries, Jr, resigned. Her term will expire on December 12, 2007.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Rules Committee, \nSenator Lott, for facilitating and expediting action on this \nnomination. By confirming Ms. Davidson at this time, the Senate is \nensuring that the Commission will have a full complement of members as \nit faces action on some of the most important provisions of the Help \nAmerican Vote Act this fall.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, President Bush signed into law the Help America \nVote Act--HAVA. For the first time in our history, this landmark \nlegislation recognizes the need for a Federal partnership in the \nconduct of Federal elections by the States. While this partnership \nrespects the authority of State and local governments to administer \nFederal elections, it also provides Federal leadership and support \nthrough the establishment of minimum requirements that all States must \nmeet in all Federal elections.\n  One of the primary goals of HAVA is to bolster public confidence in \nour system of Federal elections by addressing the problems and \nirregularities that arose in the November 2000 general election. And \nthis is why, following that election, a bipartisan group of Senators \nand Members of Congress came together to enact the Help America Vote \nAct. Although the original bipartisan authors of HAVA initially viewed \nthe outcome of the 2000 elections very differently, in the end, we all \nagreed that the Federal Government had an appropriate role to play to \nensure that in our democracy, we made it easier to vote and harder to \ndefraud the system.\n  HAVA established a number of requirements for election administration \nand voting technology in Federal elections, including requirements for \nvoting systems, provisional ballots, and statewide voter registration \nlists. To date, Congress has appropriated over $3 billion in Federal \nfunding for payments to the States for nationwide implementation of \nthese requirements.\n  The Act also established a new Federal agency, the Election \nAssistance Commission--EAC. Among other things, the EAC serves as a \nclearinghouse to identify best practices for State and local election \nofficials to use to conduct elections. The EAC is designed to bring \ntogether all stakeholders who play a role in elections--from voting \nmachine manufacturers to voter registration organizations and other \ncivil rights and disability rights groups to State and local election \nofficials and administrators--to facilitate fair and transparent \nFederal elections throughout America.\n  Ms. Davidson joins the EAC at a crucial time. In less than 6 months, \nby January 1, 2006, all States are required to fully implement two of \nthe most significant requirements in HAVA: the voluntary voting system \nstandards and the statewide voter registration list. Taken as a whole, \nthese two requirements promote accurate, accessible, nondiscriminatory, \nuser-friendly and transparent elections. They serve as the mechanisms \nby which all eligible voters can cast their votes and have their votes \ncounted.\n  Ms. Davidson's qualifications will serve her well at the EAC and \nreflect years of experience as both a State and local election official \nas well as an active participant on numerous national and State \nprofessional organizations. She currently serves as the Secretary of \nState for Colorado and previously served as the Arapahoe Country Clerk \nand Recorder in Littleton, CO and as the Director of Elections at the \nColorado Department of State. In addition, she also currently serves as \nthe vice chair of the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n  Her background will bring to the EAC the election administration and \ntechnology skills and experience that will help facilitate the \nnationwide implementation of HAVA, in particular the voluntary voting \nsystem guidelines expected to be approved by the EAC this fall. Her \ninvolvement with the existing voluntary voting system standards, first \nissued by the Federal Election Commission, dates to the mid-\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\n1990s and her support for those standards contributed to their adoption \nin Colorado.\n  Most recently, Ms. Davidson served as one of the 15 experts on the \nTechnical Guidelines Development Committee TGDC established under HAVA \nto develop an initial set of recommendations for the voluntary voting \nsystem guidelines with technical support and expertise from the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology NIST. At the end of the \npublic comment and revision process, these recommendations are expected \nto form the bases of the new Federal voluntary voting system guidelines \nissued by the EAC.\n  Ms. Davidson's confirmation today ensures that the EAC has a full and \npermanent complement of commissioners as we move toward the full \nimplementation of HAVA and the November 2006 Federal elections. The EAC \nwill be well served by Ms. Davidson's expertise on election issues and \nher broad experience working with all stakeholders in Federal \nelections, including local election officials and their voters.\n  I congratulate Ms. Davidson on the honor of being nominated and \nconfirmed to the Election Assistance Commission. It is an awesome \nresponsibility and one that her background has prepared her well to \nmeet.\n  To ensure that our Federal partnership gives voice to all Americans \nand their very diverse experiences on election day, the Commission's \nwork must reflect more than just the perspectives of any single State \nor local election official. Commissioners must represent all 50 States, \nthe District of Columbia, and the territories--all of America and its \ndiversity. I am confident that Commissioner Davidson will meet that \ngoal.\n  While political races among candidates may be partisan, Federal \nelections cannot be. The Help America Vote Act is appropriately the \nfirst civil rights act of the 21st Century, and Congress must fulfill \nits commitment to the American people to provide the States sufficient \nresources to fund the mandated reforms.\n  In order for the EAC to meet its obligations under HAVA, it is \ncritically important that Congress fully fund the agency and its \nrequirements for fiscal year 2006. To support States in the nationwide \nimplementation of HAVA, the Act authorized nearly $4 billion to pay for \nthe requirements and tasked the EAC with several responsibilities. To \ndate, Congress has appropriated over $3 billion to the States and \nterritories.\n  For fiscal year 2006, the EAC submitted an appropriations request at \nthe funding level of $17,612,000, including four new staff positions \nto, among other duties, establish an Inspector General Office to \nmonitor the Federal payments. The House-passed version of the \nTransportation, Treasury, HUD, Judiciary, District of Columbia \nappropriations bill provides only $15,877,000 for the EAC, and no funds \nfor State requirements payments, with an earmark of $2.8 million for \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology. Complicating \nmatters more, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a slightly \nlower funding level for the EAC at $13,888,000, with $4 million \nearmarked for NIST. An average of both Senate-House bills will not \nproduce enough funding for the EAC to maintain its current level of \noperations.\n  Without appropriate funding, the EAC will be unable to fulfill its \nobligations to the States and the voters for the Federal elections in \n2006. To date, the EAC has been underfunded by over $822 million, \nincluding a funding gap of $600 million for requirements, $95 million \nfor disability access grants and $127 million for other HAVA programs \nsuch as research and development for voting systems. When we return \nfrom the August recess, the Senate will complete its work on the \nTransportation, Treasury appropriations bill. It is my hope that we \nwill be able to find the necessary resources to ensure the full \nimplementation of HAVA without creating an unfunded mandate on the \nStates.\n  In the meantime, I congratulate Commissioner Davidson on her \nappointment and look forward to working closely with her as she \noversees the implementation of the most critical requirements of HAVA \nfor the upcoming 2006 Federal elections and beyond in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9316-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now we will continue all of that work tomorrow with an Energy \nbill, a highway bill, a gun liability bill, a legislative conference \nreport, and the Interior conference report. So it has been a very \nproductive Congress and one that we will continue to work very \naggressively on as we come back after the recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/28/senate-section/article/S9319-6", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CONDITIONAL \n                  RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
