At this point we have to say, unfortunately, \nthat rollcall votes are still possible during today's session. As \nalways, we will alert Members as the voting schedule becomes more \nclear. Once we have adopted our committee resolutions and the electoral \nvote count is completed, it is my intention the Senate will adjourn \nuntil January 20, Inauguration Day.\n  I will have more to say on the schedule today before the Senate \ncloses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S35-7", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S35]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are very close to working something out \non committee funding. We have an agreement on the split. It is just a \nquestion of what we are splitting. I have a meeting today with the \nranking members. I spoke to virtually all of them last night and we \nwill be able to work something out here. It is important we do that. We \nhave Members on our side, new Senators, we want to appoint to \ncommittees. The majority has new Members they need to appoint to \ncommittees. There will be some new committee chairs, new ranking \nmembers. We want to expedite this. We hope to have it done, as I told \nthe distinguished Senator from Kentucky, by noon today. It is something \nwe need to do. I am confident we can do that.\n\n  On our side if, in fact, there is an objection filed to any of the \nStates that are going to report their electoral college findings, we \nwill not require a rollcall vote on our side, but that does not mean \nthere won't be one. So whether there is an objection filed, we will \nwait and see at 1 o'clock today. After that, there will be decisions \nmade by individual Senators as to whether there is a vote.\n  Procedurally, as I understand the rule, if there is an objection \nfiled, automatically the electoral college proceedings are put in \nrecess for 2 hours. During that 2 hours, Members in the House and \nSenate are allowed to speak for up to 5 minutes each on the objection. \nFollowing that, the electoral college reconvenes. If, in fact, there is \nan objection filed, I think everything would be completed by around 4 \no'clock today.\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I might say with regard to speaking \nrequests, I only have one or two. They will be very brief. It is my \nhope we might not take the entire 2 hours the Democratic leader has \noutlined, thereby allowing us to get that job finished earlier in the \nafternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the distinguished Senator is again \nabsolutely right. We have had a few requests on our side. At last \ncount, I had less than five. That is 25 minutes, at most. But we cannot \ndo anything until the House finishes. If they finish earlier, we would \nfinish earlier and be able to move forward.\n  We will see what the day brings us. But it should not be a long day, \nno matter what happens.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, I rise to share a few remarks involving \nthe overwhelming disaster that has hit Southeast Asia. I hope the \ndistinguished deputy leader would heed my remarks because I very much \nhope we can get this legislation passed this year--not only this year, \nbut passed today--which gives a charitable tax deduction, cash \ndeduction to Americans on their tax returns for 2004 who give a \ncharitable contribution to the tsunami disaster. Clearly that has to be \ndone immediately. Otherwise it will not have any real effect. It \naffects taxpayers who wish to give today but take the deduction on \ntheir 2004 tax returns, or 2005. This gives an opportunity to take the \ndeduction on the 2004 returns.\n  It is almost impossible to talk about the tsunami disaster. Words do \nnot begin to describe the extent of the disaster. We all feel it when \nwe watch television and see the photographs in the newspapers. We hear \nreports from those who have been there; Secretary Powell, for example. \nIt is so overwhelming. It is so large scale. One hundred fifty thousand \npeople perished. Just imagine.\n  September 11 was a disaster almost beyond belief, and that was 3,000 \ndeaths. We are talking now about 150,000 people who just had no \ndefense. Families were destroyed. In many cases there is very little \nhope because so many relatives are gone. Roads are gone. Houses are \ngone. Up to 2 million people who are displaced are homeless. It is \nstaggering. Some suggest this might be the worst disaster in modern \nhistory. It could well be. But whether it is the worst or second worst \nis not the point. The point is, it is a huge personal disaster, \npersonal tragedy for so many people over such a large scale.\n  I am encouraged and very thankful so many people around the world \nhave poured their hearts out to the victims. Many have flown over to \nvolunteer help. Many have sent contributions, sometimes in-kind \ncontributions, sometimes cash.\n  Last night, I was watching a television program to raise money for \nthe tsunami victims, and you could see it happen over a 45-minute \nperiod. First it went to $1 million, and then it went up to $6 million \nthat had been pledged within that 45 minutes. That is wonderful.\n  I think a lot of Americans want to give. Clearly, some Americans are \nstrapped, but they still want to give. It is the American spirit. It is \nwho we are as Americans.\n  I suggest, in cosponsoring a bill with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, that we pass legislation today which gives \nAmericans the opportunity to take the full deduction that is currently \navailable for deductions in 2005--after all, this is January--that \nAmericans can take that deduction today on their 2004 tax returns. I \nthink many Americans would like to do that. It would be an additional \nincentive, an additional encouragement for Americans to contribute to \nthe tsunami disaster.\n  It is very simple legislation but legislation that will be very \nhelpful, and it must pass right away. Clearly, it will not work if it \nis passed much later. It will cause a lot of administrative problems \nfor the IRS. After all, April 15 is the deadline for 2004 tax returns. \nIf we could pass this legislation today, the IRS has told us it can \nvery easily accommodate and deal with the changes that are necessary to \nallow Americans to take those deductions on their 2004 tax returns for \nthe contributions they make now.\n  I very much hope the minor questions people have about this \nlegislation are resolved very quickly because there is no reason not to \npass this legislation. It will not create a huge precedential problem. \nIt is not going to be terribly costly. But it is the right thing to do. \nIt is the right thing for Americans to do, to pass legislation to make \nit a little easier for Americans to contribute to the victims of the \ntsunami disaster.\n  I very much hope we can get it passed. I am going to stay on the \nfloor today as long as it takes to get it passed. There is no \nconceivable reason it should not pass. I am going to stay here until we \ndo get it passed because it is the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S36-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S36-S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOINT SESSION\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I would like to address a few subjects \nthis morning.\n  First, regarding the joint session of the House and the Senate that \nwill be meeting this afternoon, I have received a great number of calls \nand expressions of interest and concern about that historic event--\nwhere the two bodies meet in joint session to certify the tally of \nvotes from the electoral college.\n  Our role is a very limited one under both the Constitution and under \nFederal law which was passed and has stood since 1887. The role of the \nHouse and the Senate is not to adjudicate last November's Presidential \nelection. That should not be our role. Those who want us to insert \nourselves into that process are very well intentioned, but the role \nthey envision for us is, in my judgment, inappropriate and potentially \neven dangerous. Our role today in this joint session of the Senate and \nthe House is one of witnessing the tally of the electoral college vote. \nIf there is an objection, it is based on very limited circumstances.\n  In fact, only once in the entire history of this legislation since \n1886, only one time has there been a formal objection made, and that \nwas for one electoral vote cast by one elector who did not vote in the \nway in which they pledged--in this case, the District of Columbia; not \na State, a district. That objection was rejected by the House and the \nSenate in 1969.\n  There has never been in the history of the country an entire State \nslate of electoral votes objected to or rejected by actions of both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  If an objection is made today signed by at least one Member of the \nHouse and one Member of the Senate, under the law, under the \nConstitution, the Senate separates from the House and meets for 2 \nhours. Our debate is limited by law to 2 hours. We each can speak up to \n5 minutes and speak only once. Then on the basis of that debate we are \nsupposed to vote--each of us--on whether to accept that electoral slate \nand the tally certified by the election authorities of the respective \nStates or reject it.\n  We are a partisan body. We are well intentioned. We are all honorable \nmen and women, as are our colleagues in the House. But we are elected \nas Democrats or Republicans, and in one case an Independent. For us on \nthe basis of a 2-hour meeting and a 5-minute presentation by each of us \nto vote on\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\nwhether to accept or reject the will of the people of a particular \nState is an enormously dangerous precedent. In my judgment, the \nstandard and the bar under which any objection must qualify for our \nconsideration, much less for our rejection, needs to be a very high \none. That is what our Federal law envisions. It says:\n\n       No electoral vote or votes from any State which have been \n     regularly given by electors whose appointment has been \n     lawfully certified from which but one return has been \n     received shall be rejected.\n\n  In other words, if the procedure that was followed by the election \nauthorities of the State is a proper one and if it is certified as \nproper, if there is only one tally received from a State--in other \nwords, if there are not two different representations of that State's \nelectoral tally--then our function is to witness and acknowledge that \nthat function has been performed properly; it is not to say whether \nthat election was conducted properly. That review, if it is warranted, \nis the proper role of the Judiciary, which is supposed to be \nnonpartisan, which is supposed to be objective, impartial, fair, and \nultimately make the decision which, under the respective States and \nFederal laws and the facts of all sides presented and carefully \nconsidered over whatever necessary period of time and finally in that \nvery careful and sober deliberation, is determined to be the proper \njudgment.\n\n  That is not our capability. That is not our role. Under the \nrestrictions of 2 hours today, that would be a travesty of justice. It \nis a situation where it would be reversed if John Kerry had won this \nelection. If a Republican-controlled Senate and a Republican-controlled \nHouse had objected based on the information I have seen regarding the \nelectoral conditions in Ohio or any other State in the election, if \nthey had been rejected and those electoral college votes had thrown the \nelection into the House of Representatives where a partisan majority \nvoted on partisan lines to elect the other candidate as President of \nthe United States, there would be such a public outcry and loss of \nconfidence in the integrity of our electoral process that I fear we \nwould not recover as a nation--at least not for a long time. I would \nsay the same if the situation were reversed.\n  This is not about partisanship. This is about ensuring the integrity \nof the legislative process. That is in its broad sense the proper role \nand responsibility of Congress; that is, one where those who are \nobjecting to the conduct of this last election have solid ground and \nwhere we properly should insert ourselves once again as we did after \nthe 2000 election when on a bipartisan basis in this body and the House \nwe passed election reform legislation.\n  We provided funding for State and local governments to conduct these \nelections. And the intention was, I might add, under the Constitution \nthey can do so more effectively and more accurately. The principle is \neveryone should have the right to vote, and that vote should be counted \naccurately, which is fundamental to our democracy. If we fail at that, \nif we are not perfect in carrying that out, we are not carrying out our \nresponsibility to protect the sanctity of this great democracy.\n  I take that responsibility very seriously. As a member of the Senate \nRules Committee, which has jurisdiction over that, I will ask the \nchairman, Senator Lott, to convene hearings into the 2000 election. We \nneed to learn from that experience. A lot of focus and attention has \nbeen directed on Ohio, as it appropriately should. It was a State that \nultimately in the final development of events on election night \ndetermined the outcome. There were probably other States which had some \nperhaps even greater imperfections in their voting procedures. That \nshould be used as the basis for further legislation as necessary to \nsafeguard this process so that, in fact and in perception, the American \npeople know they had the right to vote, the chance to vote, and their \nvote was counted, and that the will of the majority, as reflected in \nthe Presidential election through the electoral college, was \nfaithfully, honestly, and accurately carried out by everyone \nresponsible for doing so.\n\n  How much time remains under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes to \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S37-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S37-S39]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Last week, Senator Lieberman and I traveled to Iraq, to \nBaghdad. When I visited Iraq a year and a half ago, our Senate \ndelegation in Baghdad and other cities, Basra and Tikrit, boarded armed \nHumvees and with military escort drove throughout those respective \ncities. Last week, we were confined for security reasons to the heavily \nfortified green zone, which is the command post of the United States \nmilitary, our Government representatives, and the Iraqi government.\n  The necessity for those restrictions was made apparent because one of \nthe opposition political leaders with whom we were supposed to meet and \nwhere we envisioned traveling for 5 minutes outside of the green zone \nwas the target of an assassination attempt the previous day. He was not \nharmed, but a suicide bomber killed himself and nine other Iraqis \noutside the location where the meeting was to occur, which underscores \nthe perilous nature of the environment and the impossibility of \nproviding the necessary and complete security for our own forces who \nare performing heroically and continue to risk their lives, and in some \ncases give up their lives, tragically, to protect the Iraqi people from \nthe insurgent forces which are brutal and sometimes lethally effective \nin what they are intending to do in that particular country.\n  Sunday, I had the occasion to meet with a few hundred Minnesotans, \nfamily members of loved ones who are presently serving in Iraq. They \nasked the same question over and over again: When are our husbands, \nwives, sons, fathers, mothers, coming home?\n  Although I opposed the Iraq war resolution in October of 2002 and \ncontinue to believe, unfortunately, we have on an overall basis \nweakened our national security, not strengthened it by our action, we \nare there, with 150,000 of our Armed Forces committed. It is imperative \nwe succeed. It is also imperative that we start to devise--we should \nhave already--a strategy to bring our troops home safely as soon as \npossible with the victory secure. The only way victory will be \nultimately secured is by the Iraqi people.\n  When Senator Lieberman and I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of \nIraq he said exactly that: The security of Iraq can only be gained by \nthe Iraqi people. The process from being subject to a brutal dictator, \ntyrannical oppression for over a quarter of a century, to self-\ndetermining democracy is an enormous social transformation, one that \nwill probably take several years.\n\n  When we justify, by those who are responsible for our continued \npresence in Iraq, what we are doing there, they need to be very clear \nabout the parameters. First, we were looking for weapons of mass \ndestruction which turned out not to exist there. Then it was an alleged \nlink between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida which has never been \ndemonstrated to exist. Then it was opposing an evil dictator, which \nSaddam Hussein certainly was, which was achieved in the first 3 weeks \nof magnificent effort by our military. For the last 21 months it has \nbeen protecting as much as possible the country and protecting the time \nnecessary for the Iraqi people to form a government, which they are in \nthe process of doing.\n  Holding the election on January 30 as scheduled is essential to doing \nthat. Training and equipping the Iraqi forces--police, military, \nnational guard--to be able to do what the people of any country have to \ndo to have a functional country under any form of government, which is \nto protect and defend their own country, has been regretfully a very \nslow process. I asked the United States military command and our \ncivilian leadership in Iraq as well as the Iraqi Government authorities \nhow far they thought we had progressed from a starting point to 100 \npercent Iraqi self-sufficiency regarding their own self-security and \nthe answer was variously between 40 and 50 percent. We have initiated \nand engaged in and this Congress has funded to the full extent \nrequested by the administration the Iraqi security training programs \nfor over a year, about 15 or 16 months.\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nIt is obviously a difficult assignment, given that the previous \nmilitary structure of the country was removed by the Provisional \nAuthority, but that decision has been made and now that process of \nretraining new forces has been underway for 15, 16 months and we are \ntold it is not even half way there.\n  The Iraqi people need to be responsible for their own country. They \nmust be responsible for their own country. They must decide to stand up \nfor themselves. Many are doing so and even giving their lives to \nconduct this upcoming election and engaging in various security \nactions.\n  But the brunt of that responsibility, the burden, the fighting, the \nbleeding, the dying, is still being incurred by our own forces. We need \nto know when that is going to be able to stop. We need to know how that \ntransition and when that transition is going to occur. We need to put \nthe Iraqi people and our allies on notice that we are not going to be \nthere indefinitely and that they need to be willing to step forward to \nprovide what I think everyone wants, most of the world wants: a stable, \nsecure, and successful Iraq.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have been \nincreasingly frustrated by our inability, either in the committee, \nwhether in public or secret briefings, whether as a body or through \nother discussions, to get what turns out to be accurate and reliable \ninformation from the civilian command, from the administration. \nYesterday afternoon we had an Armed Services Committee hearing, \na secret hearing, for 3 hours. I received information regarding the \nforce capabilities of the Iraqi police and military that was at \nsignificant variance from what I was told a week before in Baghdad, \nwhich itself was at considerable variance from what we were told 2 \nmonths before, which then was half of the force level we were told \nexisted a year before that.\n\n  What the numbers are, what the training capabilities are--I hesitate \nto use this word on the Senate floor, but it applies here--I don't like \nbeing lied to. I am elected to represent the people of Minnesota. I am \nelected to look out for their best interests. I met on Sunday with a \nfew hundred Minnesota family members who were depending upon me to look \nout for the interests of their sons and daughters, husbands and wives. \nI take that as a life-or-death responsibility, as it is to them and \ntheir loved ones and all the members of the U.S. Armed Forces, putting \ntheir lives on the line every day.\n  They deserve to know, we deserve to know, the American people deserve \nto know from this administration their plan, what is their timetable, \nand what kind of progress are we making. We deserve to know the facts. \nWe deserve to be told facts today that hold up as the truth tomorrow. I \nregret to say that is not occurring. It has not occurred, not only in \nthis instance yesterday but in other significant respects throughout \nthe last several months.\n  I appreciate enormously and admire tremendously the leadership of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee under its chairman, Senator Warner, and \nits ranking member, Senator Levin. Senator Warner has convened any \nnumber of hearings and briefings on the situation in Iraq and other \nplaces around the world, on the prison abuses at Abu Ghraib, on the \narmoring and rearmoring of the equipment and personnel for service in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  In the last month, we have found, according to the private \ncontractors, there was an unused capacity in their production \ncapabilities of 25 percent for armored Humvees and these rearmoring \nkits for those Humvees that are over there in Afghan and Iraq that are \nunarmored, a 25-percent unused capacity because of a lack of production \norders from our military, when we were told--and we asked, Republican \nand Democratic members of the Armed Services Committee alike, \nrepeatedly: What do you need? What money, laws, procedures? What do you \nneed to maximize production and immediate distribution to protect our \nmen and women serving in Iraq?\n  We were assured, again and again and again, there was 100-percent \nproduction, that everything was being done, and that they did not need \nanything. And then we find out there is significant variance to that, \nin fact, in the truth.\n  Chairman Warner convened several hearings in the last 6 months on the \nalleged prison abuses at Abu Ghraib. There were rumors of abuses \noccurring elsewhere in Iraq and elsewhere in the world. We were assured \nagain and again by the administration and the other authorities who \nspoke before us that it was limited to those isolated instances in Iraq \nand in the Abu Ghraib prison. Now it comes to light, in the last month, \nthere were documented reports through the chain of command, information \nthat people who testified before our committee had to be aware of when \nthey told us in committee hearings information that was at variance \nwith those reports.\n  Similarly, the status of the Iraqi security and military forces--\nbeing told by the Secretary of Defense, who I think believed what he \nwas telling us because that was the information he was given, a year \nago that force level was at 202,000; and then to find out last \nSeptember 15, in public remarks he made elsewhere, that number was \nabout half that level; and then to get published reports that the \nactual number is some 78,000; and then to get a report last week that \nthe number is somewhat above that; and then to get a report yesterday \nthat the number is some tens of thousands above that. Having that \nnumber not being able to be confirmed by those who are testifying \nbefore us is a great travesty of justice and legality, and their moral, \nethical responsibility to tell us the truth and give us the facts so we \ncan make those judgments that we are elected and held responsible to \nmake, along with them, so that hopefully the collective wisdom of all \nof us serves the best interests of this country, its foreign policy, \nand the lives of its men and women who are serving us overseas, and \nwho, for every day we keep them over there, are continuing to risk \ntheir lives, and some of them losing their lives or losing limbs, \nbodily functions.\n  This is life and death, and it is time we stop being lied to. I want \nthis administration, I want the Pentagon command, to tell us the facts, \ntell us the truth about the situation in Iraq--what is going right, but \nwhat is going wrong, to tell us the truth and the facts about the \ncapability of the Iraqi forces to replace ours, to take over \nresponsibility for the law and order of their own country, to tell us \nthe truth and the facts about the economic recovery projects, which \nones have started, which ones have not, how much money has been \nexpended, how much money has been wasted, how much money has been \nstolen.\n\n  It is shameful this body, which has the history of Harry Truman \nsetting up a special committee during World War II to investigate the \nproper contracting, the proper expenditure of taxpayer dollars for a \ndefense effort, where again American men and women were relying on that \nequipment, relying on getting it right away, and living or dying as a \nresult--Harry Truman said: I don't care whether they are Democratic \ncontractors or Republican, let the chips fall where they may and the \ntruth be known. He went on to become the Vice President and then the \nPresident of the United States because he had that kind of integrity \nand that kind of courage.\n  We ought to see that today on the other side of the aisle, to be \nwilling to investigate these matters. Whether it is a Republican \nadministration or a Democratic administration, I don't care; it is an \nAmerican administration. Those are American soldiers putting their \nlives on the line. We are all responsible, and we can't even get \nanybody to look into what is happening or not happening there, and we \ncan't get anybody to tell us the facts, the truth. It is deplorable. It \nis unconscionable. It is un-American. And it is intolerable.\n  I think this body collectively needs to stand up and demand that we \nget the facts and the truth so we can go back home and tell those sons \nand daughters and fathers and mothers and husbands and wives what is \nhappening to their loved ones over in Iraq, and when they are coming \nhome with the victory they worked for, lived for, bled for, and died \nfor secured, and how we are going to do that and when.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint).

Mr. President, I suggested to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, and he agreed, that it would be \nappropriate and, in fact, it would be a good idea, to pass legislation \ntoday which would allow Americans to give a full deduction that is \navailable under current law to the tsunami relief effort in 2004, if \nthey wish. Even though we are clearly now in 2005, the idea is and the \nlegislation would provide that, for Americans who want to give to the \ntsunami relief effort and take that contribution on their 2004 tax \nreturns, they may do so.\n  I am very encouraged the House took up that bill a few minutes ago. \nIt is unclear as to when that will actually pass, but it is my \nunderstanding it will pass today. I have spoken to a good number of \nSenators about this legislation, and I have with me a long list of \ncosponsors of this legislation. I think it would be good for us to do \nthis right away. I say quickly because the IRS has informed me that the \nsooner we pass this, the better. That is, the sooner we pass the \nlegislation, the more easily they can work with American taxpayers who \nwant to take this deduction--it is a cash deduction--in 2004.\n  It is framed as a cash deduction because that is what the relief \nagencies want. They want cash. First, cash can be transmitted much more \nquickly than in-kind contributions, as much as food and clothes is \nimportant. They can transmit the cash contribution with the speed of \nlight, frankly. Second, with cash it can be disbursed and sent to the \narea where it is needed the most. Maybe food is needed, maybe medical \nsupplies are needed in one area more than another, maybe clothing or \ntents or whatnot is needed. With the cash available, the relief \nagencies can decide what is the best use.\n  This is also the approach taken by our President when he nominated \nand encouraged former President Bush and former President Clinton to go \nnationwide to encourage Americans to contribute to the relief effort. \nThey, too, suggest cash contributions are best. They are much more \nefficient. It is what makes the most sense as being the most helpful to \nthe people in that part of the world who need it the most.\n  I have a special feeling, almost reverence, for Southeast Asia, \nbecause I have traveled in that part of the world many times. The \nSoutheast Asia ambassadors have been guests of mine in my home State of \nMontana just recently, this past year. I visited Southeast Asia quite \nrecently. My heart, all of our hearts, clearly, go out to the victims \nand their families. Words cannot describe the extent and depth of this \ntragedy, and I am not going to make the effort to do so. But certainly \nwhen we see the photographs and we read the reports and hear people \nsuch as Secretary Colin Powell comment on what they have seen and what \nhas happened or has not happened over there, it tugs very deeply at the \nhearts of all of us. That part of the world has our deepest prayers and \nour fondest hopes that we will do all we can to help out.\n  That is happening. The American public, the American people are the \nmost generous people in the world. I don't know what it is, there is \nsomething extra special about the American spirit. We dig down to help \npeople who need help. We are there. I think it is probably because we \nare a society that is much more open than most others. We are also a \ncountry with many immigrants. We feel for the goings on in other \ncountries in the world.\n  We are a young country by comparison. I wouldn't say that makes us \nnaive, but it certainly enables us to have much more hope about the \nfuture because we still are young. We are very hopeful. Many countries \nthat are much older do not have quite the same hope, it seems. There is \nmaybe a little cynicism--they have seen it all, or maybe not, but we \nare a country that is open and we want to help.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nresolution which would accelerate the income benefits for charitable \ncash contributions for the relief of victims in the Indian Ocean \ntsunami. Also, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlist of all the cosponsors of this Senate joint resolution. I am not \ngoing to read all the names.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Funding Levels\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished majority leader, in a colloquy regarding committee \nfunding. As the majority leader is aware, the current biennial funding \nauthorization for committee funding expires on February 28. Normally, \nby now the Rules Committee has advised the committees of the budget \nassumptions for the next biennial period, March 1, 2005 through \nFebruary 28, 2007, so that they may be preparing their committee \nauthorizing resolutions for the next biennial funding period. However, \nthe Rules committee is awaiting direction from the\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nleadership. Based on conversations between the majority leader and \nmyself, is the majority leader in a position to announce the funding \nand allocation assumptions for the next biennial committee funding \nperiod?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am pleased to respond to the inquiry of the Democratic \nleader. The budget assumptions for the next committee funding biennial \nperiod, subject to appropriations, will be an across-the-board freeze \nbudget, with salary baselines adjusted by COLAs of 3.71 percent in \n2005, as approved by the President pro tempore this week; and 3.3 \npercent assumed for 2006 and 3.5 percent assumed for 2007, although \nboth the 2006 and 2007 actual COLA amounts remain subject to the \napproval of the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. REID. Is it my understanding that such a freeze will result in \naggregate funding levels, subject to appropriations, as follows: March \n1, 2005-September 30, 2005: $53,243,918; October 1, 2005-September 30, \n2006; $93,467,365; and October 1, 2006-February 28, 2007: $39,782,891, \nand that such funding levels include, but do not separately allocate, \nthe additional 10 percent allocated to the committees in the 108th \nCongress?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. With regard to committee personnel salary \nallocations between the majority and minority staff, the Democratic \nleader and I have agreed to a 60-40 split of all personnel funds, after \nallocations for non-designated administrative and clerical staff are \nagreed to by the chairman and ranking member pursuant to Rule XXVII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate. However, the chairman and ranking \nmember of any committee may, by mutual agreement, modify the allocation \nof personnel funds. The division of committee office space shall be \ncommensurate with this allocation agreement.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the majority leader for his comments and assistance \nin reaching this agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, if the distinguished acting \nleader would allow me to say a word, what we have just done has been \nsomething that is important for the institution. We want to show \nbipartisanship, and this has been very difficult. Briefly, because I \nknow we have a joint session, let me say the chairmen and ranking \nmembers do yeoman's work around here. They work very hard.\n  What has just been completed is a compromise. I appreciate the \ncooperation of Senator Frist and Senator McConnell, Senator Lott and \nSenator Dodd. We have worked hard to arrive at this point, and we have \nshown some bipartisanship. We on the Democratic side, and I think I can \nspeak for some of my friends on the Republican side, hope that the \nmoney the committees are going to get to do their work is not all \nneeded. We didn't use it all last time. I hope we don't need it this \ntime. But at least we have a framework where we have divided the \nresponsibilities of the Senate on a 60-40 basis. I believe that is \nfair. I hope never in the future of this institution, no matter what \nparty is in control, will it ever change and be any lower.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Democratic \nleader, as well. I am glad we were able to work this out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S41-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S41]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 241\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Pursuant to S. Con.

Debate shall not exceed 2 hours, after which the \nChair will put the question: Shall the objection be sustained?\n  The clerk will report the objection made in the joint session.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Tubbs Jones, a Representative from Ohio, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, a Senator from California, object to the counting of \n     electoral votes of the State of Ohio on the ground that they \n     were not, under all of the known circumstances, regularly \n     given.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much.\n  For most of us in the House and in the Senate, we have spent our \nlives fighting for what we believe in, always fighting to make our \nNation better. We may not agree from time to time, but we are always \nfighting to make our Nation better. We have fought for social justice. \nWe have fought for economic justice. We have fought for environmental \njustice. We have fought for criminal justice. Now we must add a new \nfight: the fight for electoral justice.\n  Every citizen of this the greatest country in the world who is \nregistered to vote should be guaranteed that their vote matters, that \ntheir vote is counted, and that in the voting booth in their community \ntheir vote has as much weight as any Senator, any Congressperson, any \nPresident, any Cabinet member, or any CEO of any Fortune 500 \ncorporation. I am sure every one of my colleagues agrees with that \nstatement, that in the voting booth everyone is equal. So now it seems \nto me that under our great Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica, which we swear allegiance to uphold, which guarantees the \nright to vote, we must ask certain questions.\n  First, why did voters in Ohio wait hours in the rain to vote? Why \nwere voters at Kenyan College, for example, made to wait in line until \n4 a.m. to vote? It was because there were only 2 machines for 1,300 \nvoters when they needed 13.\n  Why did voters in poor and predominantly African- American \ncommunities have disproportionately long waits?\n  Why in Franklin County did election officials use only 2,798 machines \nwhen they needed 5,000? Why did they hold back 68 machines in \nwarehouses, 68 machines that were in working order? Why were 42 of \nthose machines in predominantly African-American communities?\n  Why in the Columbus area alone did an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 \nvoters leave polling places out of frustration without having voted? \nHow many more never bothered to vote after they heard this because they \nhad to take care of their families or they had a job or they were sick \nor their legs ached after waiting for hours?\n  Why is it when 638 people voted at a precinct in Franklin County, a \nvoting machine awarded 4,258 extra votes to George Bush? Thankfully, \nthey fixed it. Only 638 people had shown up, but George Bush got more \nthan 4,000 votes. How could that happen?\n  Why did Franklin County officials reduce the number of electronic \nvoting machines to downtown precincts while adding them in the suburbs? \nThis also led to long lines.\n  In Cleveland, why were there thousands of provisional ballots \ndisqualified when everyone knew that poll workers had given faulty \ninstructions to the voters?\n  Because of this and voting irregularities in so many other places, I \nam joining today with Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a 10-year \njudge, an 8-year prosecutor, a 6-year Member of Congress, a woman \ninducted into the Women's Hall of Fame. Folks, she has great \ncredibility, and she asked just one Senator to take a couple of\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\nhours. I hate inconveniencing my friends, but I believe it is worth a \ncouple of hours to shine some light on these issues.\n  We passed the Help America Vote Act, which was important to help \nAmerican voters, but then we did nothing.\n  Senators Graham, Clinton, and I introduced a bill to ensure that a \npaper trail go along with electronic voting. We couldn't even get a \nhearing in the last Congress. In the House, it is the same problem. We \nneed this kind of bill.\n  Let me simply say to my colleagues: I have great respect for all of \nyou. But I think it is key, whether it is Republicans or Democrats, \nthat we understand that the centerpiece of this country is democracy, \nand the centerpiece of democracy is ensuring the right to vote.\n  I ask you, my friends from both sides of the aisle, when we get busy \nworking within the next few weeks, let us not turn away from the things \nthat happened in Ohio. Our people are dying all over the world. A lot \nof them are from my State. For what reason? To bring democracy to the \nfar corners of the globe. Let us fix it here, and let us do it the \nfirst thing out.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I find it almost impossible to believe \nthat I am actually standing on the floor of the Senate today engaged in \na debate over whether George Bush won Ohio in the 2004 Presidential \nelection. Clearly he did and did so by 118,000 votes.\n  Because I am limited under the rules to 5 minutes, I will not have \ntime to address all of the wild, incoherent, and completely \nunsubstantiated charges that have been made about the 2004 Ohio \nPresidential election. What might be a better way for me to explain the \nabsurdity of the suggestion that Ohio did not go for President Bush is \nto quote from numerous editorials that have been written in Ohio \nnewspapers.\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer, a newspaper that did not endorse either \nPresident Bush or John Kerry, said in an editorial this past Tuesday \naddressing those in Ohio and those from out of State still contesting \nOhio's results:\n\n       The election horse is dead. You can stop beating it now. \n     Not one ounce of political flesh remains on that carcass. \n     Ohio has counted and recounted: President George W. Bush \n     received 118,775 more votes than your man Sen. John Kerry.\n       The senator had the good grace and sense to acknowledge the \n     abundantly obvious, go home, and resume his life. You might \n     consider emulating his excellent example, because what you \n     are doing now--redoubling your effort in the face of a \n     settled outcome--will only drive you further toward the \n     political fringe. And that long grass already is tickling \n     your knees.\n       The 176 Democrats who sit on Ohio's 88 county election \n     boards pondered their jurisdictions' results, accepted their \n     subordinates' good work, and are turning their energies \n     toward the future. Are they all dupes in some Machiavellian \n     Republican scheme? Or do they simply have a firmer grasp of \n     reality than that displayed by the two of you and a handful \n     of unrelenting zealots still ranting in the January rain, \n     eight weeks after the November voting?''\n\n  The headline for the Akron Beacon Journal's editorial from December \n24, 2004 was:\n\n       We wish John Kerry would have won Ohio. He didn't.\n\n  The piece went on to say:\n\n       The allegations being thrown around are of the flimsiest \n     nature . . . Not one shred of evidence has been presented to \n     show that Ohio's strictly bipartisan system of running \n     elections was manipulated.\n\n  The Columbus Dispatch, in an editorial dated December 12, 2004, said:\n\n       On Monday, the 20 Ohio members of the Electoral College \n     will cast their votes to elect the next president of the \n     United States. When those votes are added to those from \n     electors in the other 49 states, George W. Bush's re-election \n     will be official.\n       But that won't stop the conspiracy theorists who claim that \n     Bush stole his victory. Though they are small in number, \n     these naysayers are loud and repetitious. So the truth bears \n     repeating, too: Bush won because more Ohioans voted for him \n     than for Senator John Kerry.\n       Kerry understands that George Bush legitimately won the \n     election, which is why he conceded on November 3rd. Those who \n     claim that Ohio's vote was rigged have produced nothing that \n     approaches credible evidence, nor have they explained how a \n     conspiracy could be carried out successfully in a \n     decentralized system involving 88 separate, bipartisan county \n     election boards.\n       Such a conspiracy would have to involve scores, if not \n     hundreds, of Democratic election-board members actively \n     working against their own party and presidential candidate.\n\n  It is terribly unfortunate that this body is meeting under these \ncircumstances. I urge my colleagues to act unanimously in seating \nOhio's electors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the above-mentioned \narticles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            (From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jan. 4, 2005)\n\n  Please, let it go.

Jackson and Conyers are, for example, seeking exit \n     polling data to compare with the official voting results. To \n     what end? Is the election to be handed to Kerry based on a \n     sampling of voters' opinions on Election Day, or the actual \n     results?\n       Conyers based his request for an FBI investigation, in \n     part, on the fact that a vote-tabulating computer had \n     undergone routine maintenance before the recount in Hocking \n     County. A review of the procedure by the election board and \n     computer technicians showed the maintenance hadn't altered a \n     thing.\n       Not one shred of evidence has been presented to show that \n     Ohio's strictly bipartisan system of running elections was \n     manipulated.

John Kerry did no better \n     in Warren County than Al Gore did in 2000, even though Sen. \n     Kerry spent more money and Ralph Nader wasn't on the ballot \n     this time? Please. This is nothing. Republicans are leaving \n     central urban counties for places like Warren, making the \n     places they leave bluer and the new places redder.\n       Perhaps the most intriguing question is the one about the \n     race for chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court.\n       Democratic challenger C. Ellen Connally ran worse than Sen. \n     John Kerry statewide, by about 3 percentage points. But in \n     some counties in Southwest Ohio--Miami, Darke, Butler, \n     Claremont, Brown--she ran ahead of him. Why?\n       Is it possible, as has been charged, that some 60,000 Kerry \n     votes somehow disappeared in those counties?\n       Consider: Party labels do not appear on the ballots for \n     judicial candidates. So, in these very Republican counties, \n     one would not expect Judge Connally to have the kind of \n     problem that Sen. Kerry had.\n       But why did Judge Connally run behind Sen. Kerry statewide \n     if she ran ahead of him in these counties? Probably because \n     the Moyer campaign--the only well-funded one--focused its \n     commercials and mailings someplace other than small, \n     Republican counties.\n       To ask the secretary of state to explain these things is \n     absurd. Any response he offers will be treated by the \n     Democrats on the House committee as partisan. Nonpartisan \n     think tanks could do this work more credibly and with more \n     expertise.\n       The partisan Democrats know that. They're just playing \n     games.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Dec. 15, 2004]\n\n Move On Now; The Zealots Who Refuse To Accept Ohio's Vote Count Risk \n              Undermining Confidence in the System Itself\n\n       Most Americans, including the vast majority of those who \n     supported John Kerry for president, have grasped the most \n     basic reality of Election Day 2004:\n       George W. Bush was re-elected. He won roughly 60.7 million \n     votes and carried 31 states with 286 electoral votes. Ohio's \n     20 Electoral College members formally cast ballots for the \n     president Monday in the Statehouse.\n       Unfortunately, there is a small, but very vocal, group of \n     Americans who refuse to accept this reality. They argue that \n     what appear to be routine technical glitches and human errors \n     were in fact an elaborate conspiracy to skew the election \n     results. They claim that long lines at a few polling places, \n     the rather unsurprising result of high voter interest, were \n     evidence of a systematic campaign to discourage \n     participation. In short, having failed to get the outcome \n     they wanted at the polls, they have decided to mount an \n     irresponsible campaign aimed at undermining public confidence \n     in the electoral system itself.\n       Ohio, arguably the most intensive battleground for Bush and \n     Kerry, has been the No. 1 target of these diehards.\n       Since Election Day, they have seized on isolated problems \n     in a relative handful of this state's 11,366 precincts as \n     proof of greater ills or even criminal activity.\n       One speaker in Columbus over the weekend likened Ohio to \n     Ukraine. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has complained of widespread \n     ``fraud and stealing.''\n       The Green and Libertarian parties, whose presidential \n     candidates got a combined three-tenths of one percent of the \n     vote in Ohio on Nov. 2, have demanded a recount of the \n     state's 5.7 million ballots. That will cost taxpayers about \n     $1.4 million. A coalition of critics, led by a former Ohio \n     organizer for Ross Perot, has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to \n     overturn the presidential election, as well as the outcome in \n     the race for chief justice. The Kerry campaign, reflecting \n     its leader's maddening desire to have everything both ways, \n     has said it does not expect a recount to change anything--yet \n     has also issued a list of things it wants local elections \n     officials to double-check.\n       Obviously, there were problems on Election Day. There \n     always are. Elections are run by imperfect humans. Many \n     individual polling places are in the hands of civic-minded \n     neighbors with a few hours of training. Machines malfunction. \n     Voters mess up ballots.\n       But Ohio has already done its usual intensive post-election \n     audit and reconciliation, a process designed to spot \n     mistakes. That canvass resulted in Bush's unofficial 136,000-\n     vote margin being reduced to the 119,000-vote edge that \n     Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell certified last week.\n       Ohio's bipartisan elections system makes the kind of GOP \n     conspiracy that some allege all but impossible to execute. \n     Every county board of elections consists of two Democrats and \n     two Republicans. So when Jackson and other national Democrats \n     question Ohio's outcome, they demean their own allies. \n     William Anthony Jr., the African-American who chairs both the \n     Franklin County Democratic Party and its elections board, has \n     been personally stung by Jackson's slander: ``Why would I sit \n     there and disenfranchise my own community?'' he asks.\n       The recount will go forward because by law it must; history \n     suggests few votes will change. But it is time to focus on \n     how to make future elections more efficient.\n       Clearly it would help if groups that register new voters \n     did not deliver thousands of applications at the last minute. \n     Ohio also needs an early voting system to relieve at least \n     some of the pressure on Election Day. And rather than \n     retreating from electronic voting machines, the state needs \n     to find a secure system and back it up with a paper record.\n       Common-sense solutions can make a difference. Endless sour \n     grapes will not.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Columbus Dispatch, December 12, 2004]\n\n  Sound and Fury; Election-Conspiracy Theorists Do Nothing To Improve \n                                 Voting\n\n       On Monday, the 20 Ohio members of the Electoral College \n     will cast their votes to elect the next president of the \n     United States. When those votes are added to those from \n     electors in the other 49 states, George W. Bush's re election \n     will be official.\n       But that won't stop the conspiracy theorists who claim that \n     Bush stole his victory. Though they are small in number, \n     these naysayers are loud and repetitious. So the truth bears \n     repeating, too: Bush won because more Ohioans voted for him \n     than for Sen. John Kerry.\n       Kerry understands that Bush legitimately won the election, \n     which is why he conceded on Nov. 3. Those who claim that \n     Ohio's vote was rigged have produced nothing that approaches \n     credible evidence. Nor have they explained how a conspiracy \n     could be carried out successfully in a decentralized system \n     involving 88 separate, bipartisan county election boards.\n       Such a conspiracy would have to involve scores, if not \n     hundreds, of Democratic election-board members actively \n     working against their own party and presidential candidate.\n       The idea that Democratic election officials disenfranchised \n     voters in minority and Democratic precincts offends William \n     A. Anthony Jr., chairman of the Franklin County Democratic \n     Party and of the Franklin County Election Board, who was at \n     the center of planning for the Nov. 2 election.\n       He was particularly incensed after the Rev. Jesse Jackson \n     recently repeated the allegations and called for an \n     investigation of the Ohio election.\n       ``I am a black man,'' Anthony said. ``Why would I sit there \n     and disenfranchise voters in my own community? I feel like \n     they're accusing me of suppressing the black vote. I've \n     fought my whole life for people's right to vote.''\n       Anthony's indignation is justified.\n       The major problem with the Nov. 2 election was the long \n     lines at many polling places. But these were the result of \n     high turnout, not conspiracy. Republican and Democratic \n     voters alike were inconvenienced. In many precincts, the \n     problem was exacerbated by a long ballot containing many tax \n     and bond issues in addition to candidate choices.\n       Ohio is in the midst of an effort to replace election \n     machinery throughout the state. Secretary of State J. Kenneth \n     Blackwell made a good-faith effort to have the new equipment \n     in place in time for the Nov. 2 election, but he was stymied \n     by political disputes over the security and verifiability of \n     the machines. County election officials wisely are waiting \n     until this issue is sorted out before moving ahead with \n     purchases of new machines.\n       But before that, Ohio lawmakers can reduce lines by \n     rewriting election laws to allow voters to cast absentee \n     ballots instead of visiting polling places.\n       Much work remains to be done to improve the state's voting \n     system. The conspiracy theorists are contributing nothing to \n     the effort but useless noise.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I advise Members on the minority side if \nthey\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nwant to speak on this issue, I have been informed that when the \nspeeches end there will be a rollcall vote. If people are waiting to \ncome here an hour from now, they may not get the chance to speak. \nMembers who want to speak should come here now. I have been informed on \nthe majority side there may not be another speaker or, if so, maybe \nonly one other speaker.\n  For my side, I repeat, as I understand the rules, they should be here \nto speak for the 5 minutes when the time comes. That time is now.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect and personal \nregard for my friend from the State of California. It is not often I \nfind myself rising in disagreement, but I emphatically disagree and say \nrespectfully that I believe those involved, citizens from around the \ncountry, with all their good intentions, are seriously misguided and \nare leading us into a very unfortunate precedent that was not in any \nway contemplated by the Constitution, by the law, or by historical \nprecedent.\n  Obviously, the law, which was established in 1887, did not envision \nthat our role would be to adjudicate in any State the results of an \nelection for President. If it were the intent, it clearly would not \nhave designed this kind of forum where an objection is raised, we each \nexpress our opinion for up to 5 minutes, and then vote on a whole array \nof facts and allegations and statements and contradictions that we \ncould not possibly in this setting determine fairly and accurately.\n  If we were to do so, if we were to hypothetically object on an \ninevitably partisan basis to the actions taken by the electorate of a \ncertain State, certified by the election officers of that State and \nthen brought to us today, if we were to overturn that process and in \nthis instance throw the election into the House of Representatives, the \ndamage it would do to our democracy, to the integrity of our system, \nwould be incalculable. If it were to result hypothetically in an \nalteration of the publicly expressed electoral will in an election for \nPresident, the entire credibility of our system would possibly be \ndestroyed.\n  I am not the complete authority, but as I have read some of the \nassertions made about the conduct of the election in Ohio, I find \nserious imperfections. If we shed that spotlight on most States in this \ncountry, including my own State of Minnesota, we would find other \nimperfections.\n  Democracy is not a perfect process, but it is a process that we have \na responsibility, not in hindsight but with foresight, to try to \nstructure and to continue to perfect so it is as close to perfect as is \nhumanly possible. I share entirely the concerns expressed by my \ncolleague from California and others who said despite our best \nefforts--and I was part of that collaborative effort in this body and \nunder the Rules Committee in the last couple of years--we made some \nprogress but we still fell short.\n  I respectfully ask the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator Lott, \nwho is here today, if he would be willing to convene hearings in the \nvery near future and look not just at Ohio but at the experience from \nthis election and how it can instruct us to improve that process for \nthe future.\n  The Senator from California is absolutely right; every American \nshould know he or she has a right to vote, that they can vote \nexpeditiously, that their vote will be counted and it will be tabulated \naccurately, whether under Republican or Democratic election officials, \nwhether it is for President from one party or another.\n  Whether I agree or disagree with the judgment of the American people, \nI respect and agree more than anything else with that process and the \nintegrity of the process that produces whatever result they determine. \nIt is that which we must guard today. I regret we are in a position of \npossibly compromising it. It would be a fatal mistake to overturn it in \nthe way suggested.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say at the outset, this historic meeting \nin the Senate will end at some point in a vote. When the time comes to \nvote I would vote to certify the vote from the State of Ohio.\n  I do not have personal knowledge of what occurred in the election in \nOhio, but I have spoken to those who were present, who tell me that \ndespite irregularities, which I will note, they do not rise to a level \nwhere we would challenge the outcome of the election in Ohio.\n  In addition, the Democratic Party Kerry-Edwards campaign had more \nthan 2,000 lawyers on the ground in Ohio on election day. That was \nreplicated in many States across the Nation. I think what it says is \nthat the nature of this debate and the challenges which we are raising \ndo not go to the results of the election but rather go to our electoral \nsystem.\n  Some may criticize our colleague from California for bringing us here \nfor this brief debate. I thank her for doing that because it gives \nMembers an opportunity once again on a bipartisan basis to look at a \nchallenge that we face not just in the last election in one State but \nin many States. Because of different electoral practices in States \nacross America, voters who wish to cast a vote for President or Vice \nPresident cannot approach the polls with certainty that their vote will \nbe counted or that they can vote in a fair and convenient manner.\n  There are litanies of examples that could be cited. I do not \nchallenge the legitimacy of the 2004 election outcome. I do not believe \nthere is evidence of widespread fraud. I believe Senator Kerry was \ncorrect in announcing his concession, but let us concede on a \nbipartisan basis that we can and should do better.\n  In the case of Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates made it clear that we have a constitutional right to vote. Thank \nGod. That decision which was handed down in 1964 appears clear and \nunequivocal. But wait. Four years ago that same Supreme Court, in the \ncase of Bush v. Gore, reached a different conclusion and stated that \nthe individual citizen has no Federal constitutional right to vote for \nelectors for the President of the United States.\n  It appears that this statement by the highest court in the land is \ninconsistent with a decision reached 40 years ago.\n  So where do we stand today? There is great uncertainty. Congressman \nJesse Jackson of my home State of Illinois is proposing a \nconstitutional amendment to make it clear and unequivocal that we have \na constitutional right to vote in America. I am loathe to jump on the \nbandwagon for constitutional amendments. I have seen some things done \nhere that are not very proud moments in the history of the Senate when \nit comes to offering constitutional amendments, but I will take this \none seriously.\n  When you look at the results of the election in Ohio and in many \nother States, serious questions are raised. These have been documented \nby the House Judiciary Committee Democratic staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary of \nthis report, entitled ``Preserving Democracy: What Went Wrong in \nOhio,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        What Went Wrong in Ohio\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Representative John Conyers, Jr., the Ranking Democrat on \n     the House Judiciary Committee, asked the Democratic staff to \n     conduct an investigation into irregularities reported in the \n     Ohio presidential election and to prepare a Status Report \n     concerning the same prior to the Joint Meeting of Congress \n     scheduled for January 6, 2005, to receive and consider the \n     votes of the electoral college for president. The following \n     Report includes a brief chronology of the events; summarizes \n     the relevant background law; provides detailed findings \n     (including factual findings and legal analysis); and \n     describes various recommendations for acting on this Report \n     going forward.\n       We have found numerous, serious election irregularities in \n     the Ohio presidential election, which resulted in a \n     significant disenfranchisement of voters. Cumulatively, these \n     irregularities, which affected hundreds of thousand of votes \n     and voters in Ohio, raise grave doubts regarding whether it \n     can be said the Ohio electors selected on December 13, 2004, \n     were chosen in a manner that conforms to Ohio law, let alone \n     federal requirements and constitutional standards.\n       This report therefore, makes three recommendations: (1) \n     consistent with the requirements of the United States \n     Constitution concerning the counting of electoral votes by \n     Congress and Federal law implementing these requirements, \n     there are ample\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\n     grounds for challenging the electors from the State of Ohio; \n     (2) Congress should engage in further hearings into the \n     widespread irregularities reported in Ohio; we believe the \n     problems are serious enough to warrant the appointment of a \n     joint select Committee of the House and Senate to investigate \n     and report back to the Members, and (3) Congress needs to \n     enact election reform to restore our people's trust in our \n     democracy. These changes should include putting in place more \n     specific federal protections for federal elections, \n     particularly in the areas of audit capability for electronic \n     voting machines and casting and counting of provisional \n     ballots, as well as other needed changes to federal and state \n     election laws.\n       With regards to our factual finding, in brief, we find that \n     there were massive and unprecedented voter irregularities and \n     anomalies in Ohio. In many cases these irregularities were \n     caused by intentional misconduct and illegal behavior, much \n     of it involving Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, the \n     co-chair of the Bush-Cheney campaign in Ohio.\n       First, in the run up to election day, the following actions \n     by Mr. Blackwell, the Republican Party and election officials \n     disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Ohio citizens, \n     predominantly minority and Democratic voters:\n       The misallocation of voting machines led to unprecedented \n     long lines that disenfranchised scores, if not hundreds of \n     thousands, of predominantly minority and Democratic voters. \n     This was illustrated by the fact that the Washington Post \n     reported that in Franklin County, ``27 of the 30 wards with \n     the most machines per registered voter showed majorities for \n     Bush. At the other end of the spectrum, six of the seven \n     wards with the fewest machines delivered large margins for \n     Kerry.'' Among other things, the conscious failure to provide \n     sufficient voting machinery violates the Ohio Revised Code \n     which requires the Boards of Elections to ``provide adequate \n     facilities at each polling place for conducting the \n     election.''\n       Mr. Blackwell's decision to restrict provisional ballots \n     resulted in the disenfranchisement of tens, if not hundreds, \n     of thousands of voters, again predominantly minority and \n     Democratic voters. Mr. Blackwell's decision departed from \n     past Ohio law on provisional ballots, and there is no \n     evidence that a broader construction would have led to any \n     significant disruption at the polling places, and did not do \n     so in other states.\n       Mr. Blackwell's widely reviled decision to reject voter \n     registration applications based on paper weight may have \n     resulted in thousands of new voters not being registered in \n     time for the 2004 election.\n       The Ohio Republican Party's decision to engage in \n     preelection ``caging'' tactics, selectively targeting 35,000 \n     predominantly minority voters for intimidation had a negative \n     impact on voter turnout. The Third Circuit found these \n     activities to be illegal and in direct violation of consent \n     decrees barring the Republican Party from targeting minority \n     voters for poll challenges.\n       The Ohio Republican Party's decision to utilize thousands \n     of partisan challengers concentrated in minority and \n     Democratic areas likely disenfranchised tens of thousands of \n     legal voters, who were not only intimidated, but became \n     discouraged by the long lines. Shockingly, these disruptions \n     were publicly predicted and acknowledged by Republican \n     officials: Mark Weaver, a lawyer for the Ohio Republican \n     Party, admitted the challenges ``can't help but create chaos, \n     longer lines and frustration.''\n       Mr. Blackwell's decision to prevent voters who requested \n     absentee ballots but did not receive them on a timely basis \n     from being able to receive provisional ballots likely \n     disenfranchised thousands, if not tens of thousands, of \n     voters, particularly seniors. A federal court found Mr. \n     Blackwell's order to be illegal and in violation of HAVA.\n       Second, on election day, there were numerous unexplained \n     anomalies and irregularities involving hundreds of thousands \n     of votes that have yet to be accounted for:\n       There were widespread instances of intimidation and \n     misinformation in violation of the Voting Rights Act, the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1968. Equal Protection, Due Process and \n     the Ohio right to vote. Mr. Blackwell's apparent failure to \n     institute a single investigation into these many serious \n     allegations represents a violation of his statutory duty \n     under Ohio law to investigate election irregularities.\n       We learned of improper purging and other registration \n     errors by election officials that likely disenfranchised tens \n     of thousands of voters statewide. The Greater Cleveland Voter \n     Registration Coalition projects that in Cuyahoga County alone \n     over 10,000 Ohio citizens lost their right to vote as a \n     result of official registration errors.\n       There were 93,000 spoiled ballots where no vote was cast \n     for president, the vast majority of which have yet to be \n     inspected. The problem was particularly acute in two \n     precincts in Montgomery County which had an undervote rate of \n     over 25% each--accounting for nearly 6,000 voters who stood \n     in line to vote, but purportedly declined to vote for \n     president.\n       There were numerous, significant unexplained irregularities \n     in other counties throughout the state: (i) in Mahoning \n     county at least 25 electronic machines transferred an unknown \n     number of Kerry votes to the Bush column; (ii) Warren County \n     locked out public observers from vote counting citing an FBI \n     warning about a potential terrorist threat, yet the FBI \n     states that it issued no such warning; (iii) the voting \n     records of Perry county show significantly more votes than \n     voters in some precincts, significantly less ballots than \n     voters in other precincts, and voters casting more than one \n     ballot; (iv) in Butler county a down ballot and underfunded \n     Democratic State Supreme Court candidate implausibly received \n     more votes than the best funded Democratic Presidential \n     candidate in history; (v) in Cuyahoga county, poll worker \n     error may have led to little known third party candidates \n     receiving twenty times more votes than such candidates had \n     ever received in otherwise reliably Democratic leaning areas; \n     (vi) in Miami county, voter turnout was an improbable and \n     highly suspect 98.55 percent, and after 100 percent of the \n     precincts were reported, an additional 19,000 extra votes \n     were recorded for President Bush.\n       Third, in the post-election period we learned of numerous \n     irregularities in tallying provisional ballots and conducting \n     and completing the recount that disenfanchised thousands of \n     voters and call the entire recount procedure into question \n     (as of this date the recount is still not complete):\n       Mr. Blackwell's failure to articulate clear and consistent \n     standards for the counting of provisional ballots resulted in \n     the loss of thousands of predominantly minority votes. In \n     Cuyahoga County alone, the lack of guidance and the ultimate \n     narrow and arbitrary review standards significantly \n     contributed to the fact that 8,099 out of 24,472 provisional \n     ballots were ruled invalid, the highest proportion in the \n     state.\n       Mr. Blackwell's failure to issue specific standards for the \n     recount contributed to a lack of uniformity in violation of \n     both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clauses. \n     We found innumerable irregularities in the recount in \n     violation of Ohio law, including (i) counties which did not \n     randomly select the precinct samples; (ii) counties which did \n     not conduct a full hand count after the 3% hand and machine \n     counts did not match; (iii) counties which allowed for \n     irregular marking of ballots and failed to secure and store \n     ballots and machinery; and (iv) counties which prevented \n     witnesses for candidates from observing the various aspects \n     of the recount.\n       The voting computer company Triad has essentially admitted \n     that it engaged in a course of behavior during the recount in \n     numerous counties to provide ``cheat sheets'' to those \n     counting the ballots. The cheat sheets informed election \n     officials how many votes they should find for each candidate, \n     and how many over and under votes they should calculate to \n     match the machine count. In that way, they could avoid doing \n     a full county-wide hand recount mandated by state law.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the irregularities were not confined to \nthe State of Ohio. Let me give you an Illinois example. In DuPage \nCounty, IL, 26 percent of provisional ballots were counted, but in \nChicago, a few miles away, 61 percent were counted. That is more than \ntwice as many. That is largely because Chicago allows provisional \nballots to be cast by a voter who turns up in the wrong precinct on \nelection day. DuPage County does not, the county right next to Cook \nCounty.\n  How is it that the fundamental right of an American citizen to have \nhis or her vote counted can vary dramatically--not just from State to \nState but from county to county? We need to address this on a national \nbasis.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the most \nfundamental right in our democracy, the right to vote. Every election \nday, millions of people in America from different social, economic, and \nethnic backgrounds converge on polling stations to cast their ballots. \nAnd as they leave the polling booths, they emerge, one by one, as \nequals.\n  They are equals because the power of our Constitution resides with \nthe people who delegate power to the Government. Our Constitution \nguarantees the right of every American to be heard equally about whom \nthey want to lead their Government. We, as their elected leaders, have \na responsibility to ensure that those constitutional freedoms are \nhonored and protected.\n  We have heard from some voters in Ohio and across the country about \nthe election in November. They feel that their voices were not heard.\n  Thousands of voters waited in line for up to 10 hours to cast their \nballots. Some waited until 4 in the morning, and some waited for hours \nin the rain. Many voters with job, family, and other responsibilities \nsimply could not wait any longer, and they left without voting. It is \nunreasonable to expect voters to wait 10 hours to exercise their \nconstitutional right to vote.\n  Some soldiers and other Americans living overseas believe their \nballots\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nwere not counted. Without question, every legal ballot should count, \nwhether it is cast overseas or here in the United States.\n\n  Many precincts across the country continue to use outdated punch-card \nballots and decades-old voting machines that are more prone to error or \nsimply do not work properly. That is disturbing enough--machines from \nthe 1950s being used in 2004--but even more disturbing is that urban \nareas are disproportionately affected. More urban areas do not have the \nmodern voting machines and equipment that is available in other areas \nof the country. This disparity affects voting for a large number of \nminorities, and that is unacceptable.\n  Even those precincts with electronic voting machines had problems. \nSome machines malfunctioned, causing votes to be counted more than once \nor not at all. Anyone who has used a computer at home or at work knows \nthat even saved data can be lost. Yet most electronic voting machines \ndo not have a paper record to back up the system. It could be as simple \nas a paper receipt like the one you get when you withdraw money from an \nATM machine.\n  In Nevada, electronic voting machines have a paper trail, and we need \nit for all electronic voting machines. We must ensure the integrity of \nour voting process.\n  Many voters felt intimidated at the polls. When they went to vote, \nso-called election observers demanded that they provide more than the \nrequired form of identification. Others read flyers that directed them \nto the wrong polling places.\n  These are real people with real concerns, and we need to listen to \nthem. Our Constitution requires that we listen to them. As elected \nleaders of these people and all of those in our States who have \ndelegated to us the power to represent them, we have an obligation to \nlisten.\n  After voters experienced similar problems in the last election, we \naddressed many of those issues. Congress passed, and I supported, the \nHelp America Vote Act, which required the use of provisional ballots \nfor voters who went to the wrong location so ballots would be sealed \nand counted later in the proper precinct, and each State received \nfunding to update their voting systems.\n  But in Ohio, the provisional ballot was rendered virtually worthless \nin the November 2004 election. Ohio's Secretary of State ruled that \nprovisional ballots were valid only if they were cast in the proper \nprecinct.\n  So today we talk about the problem, but I think we also need to talk \nabout the solution. Voting is fundamental to our democracy. The process \nshould be fair, honest, and easy.\n  I do not support holding up the results of our November election to \naddress the concerns many voters have raised about the process because \nI believe we need to move on with the business of the country. But I do \nsupport the GAO investigation into these concerns. When we find out \nwhat the GAO has to say, we have an obligation to address the problems \nthey uncover.\n  I do support true election reform that will create a 21st century \nvoting system that we can all be proud of.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I commend and thank our friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for giving us this opportunity to address \nthe Senate on this issue.\n  On November 3, John Kerry conceded the 2004 Presidential election to \nGeorge Bush. While we do not question the outcome, many of us remain \ndeeply concerned that for the second time in a row, in a closely \ncontested election, there were so many complaints about the ability of \nvoters to cast their votes and have them counted fairly.\n  The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. Every Member \nof Congress has a duty to protect and uphold that right. When that \nright is threatened, Congress must act to protect it. Clearly, the \nlegislation we enacted to do so after the 2000 election was not \nadequate for the 2004 election.\n  Forty years ago this year, after the Selma-Montgomery march, many of \nus in the Senate and House worked hard to pass the landmark Voting \nRights Act of 1965, to guarantee that racism and its bitter legacy do \nnot close the polls to any citizen.\n  After the 2000 election, we passed the Help America Vote Act in an \neffort to correct the serious problems that undermined the right to \nvote in that election.\n  Unfortunately, last November, we learned that we still have work to \ndo. As in 2000, the votes of many who wanted to vote were not, in fact, \ncounted. The reasons are many and varied. Some voters gave up in the \nface of endless lines and waits of many hours at polling places unable \nto handle the large turnout of voters. In other cases, voting was \nfrustrated by broken or ancient voting machinery, by confusion over \napplicable rules for voting precincts, or because States decided that \ncertain votes did not comply with arbitrary and inflexible State or \nlocal procedures. We saw all those problems in Ohio. It is far from \nclear the extent to which these serious problems were the result of \nintended manipulation or widespread incompetence, but either way, the \nvoting process did not live up to the standards worthy of our \ndemocracy.\n  Today's debate is an opportunity for all of us to admit that the 2004 \nelection was flawed and to pledge action in this new Congress to fix \nthe festering problems once and for all.\n  Citizens must have faith that they will be able to cast their votes \nefficiently and with complete confidence that their votes will be \nfairly and accurately counted. We cannot go through another election \nwondering whether a patchwork of unequal and outdated procedures--\nwhether by accident or design--have yet again denied so many of our \nfellow citizens the right to vote.\n  I commend the many thousands of citizens in Massachusetts and other \nStates who insisted that treating today's electoral vote count in \nCongress as a meaningless ritual would be an insult to our democracy \nunless we register our own protest against the obviously flawed voting \nprocess that took place in so many of our States. We are hopeful that \nthis major issue that goes to the heart of our democracy is now firmly \nimplanted on the agenda for effective action by this Congress.\n  Few things are more important to the Nation and to each of us, both \nRepublican and Democrat, than a genuine guarantee that the people's \nwill is heard through the ballot. No democracy worth the name can allow \nsuch a flawed election process to take place again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, the Congress gathers to exercise the \nrole laid out by the Framers in the Constitution of the United States. \nThe past two national elections have been surrounded in controversy, \nnot just controversy over issues and ideas--which is important and \nhealthy in a democratic system of government--but also controversy over \nthe mechanics of the election and the counting of the votes.\n  The 2000 election left citizens across this country with a belief \nthat not every vote was fairly counted. In response, Congress passed a \nmuch-needed reform legislation. States worked to modernize their \nequipment and procedures. We had high hopes that the 2004 election--\nunder much closer scrutiny than the election of 2000--would provide the \npublic with confidence that everyone who registered would be able to \nvote, and that every vote cast would be counted accurately.\n  Yet, despite the legislation and the more than $2 billion dedicated \nto fixing the election problems, the election of 2004 was marred with \nreports of irregularities and, as a result, there is a significant \ngroup of our citizenry that seriously questions the results of the \nvote, and particularly the vote in Ohio.\n  There are several groups and organizations that are investigating the \nreported irregularities in the Ohio election. That is important work \nand it should and will continue. When the investigations conclude, \nshould there be solid evidence of criminal activity, those responsible \nshould be prosecuted, no matter how high that responsibility may reach. \nBut the Senate should not prejudge the results of those investigations.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and \nthe Congressional Black Caucus to defend the integrity of the electoral \nprocess. But the question before us today is\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nwhether we uphold the objection to the certification of Ohio's electors \nin the count of the electoral vote. The Senate must vote, based on the \ninformation available to us at this moment, and absent the clear \nconclusions of the ongoing investigations into reported irregularities \nin Ohio, I shall vote to allow the electoral count to proceed.\n  In this session of Congress, I hope that we can take the lessons \nlearned from November and continue to improve the integrity of \nelections and encourage greater faith in the results. The legitimacy of \nour government rests upon the confidence of the people. We, in \nCongress, must get serious about crafting legislation aimed at \nrestoring confidence in the most fundamental characteristic of a \nrepresentative democracy, the Constitutional right and duty to vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, although there were voting irregularities \nin Ohio, I will not vote in support of the objection. I do respect the \nresult of the recent Presidential election, but I do not respect the \nprocess. Several thousand voters believe they were discouraged or even \nprevented from voting, and several thousand who did vote believe that \ntheir votes were not correctly reported. The inequitable allocation of \nvoting machines, the lack of instruction for the review of provisional \nballots, and the questionable activities surrounding the recount of the \nelectronic ballots call into question the final results in Ohio. \nHowever, I am unconvinced that it would have made a difference in the \nfinal outcome of this Presidential election.\n  I had hoped that we would not have the electoral college votes called \ninto question again. After the 2000 Presidential election, we worked \ntogether to pass election reform legislation, the Help America Vote \nAct. That legislation set Federal requirements for provisional ballots \nand for voter information, registration, and identification. \nUnfortunately, that legislation has not yet been fully implemented and \ndoes not go far enough.\n  I would like to work with my colleagues craft legislation to ensure \nthat all of our citizens are encouraged to vote and participate in our \ndemocratic process. Our citizens must believe their vote will count. At \na time when we are risking lives of our service men and women to spread \ndemocracy throughout the world, we cannot ignore the threats to the \ndemocratic process here at home. I do not relish the vote I am forced \nto cast today, but I as I do, I look forward to being able to cast \nfuture votes on Federal election reform to ensure that we are not in \nthis position again.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, serious allegations have been raised about \nvoting irregularities in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election. I \nagree with many of my colleagues that these allegations must be \ninvestigated to the fullest extent possible because every eligible \ncitizen in this nation must have an equal opportunity to exercise the \nconstitutional right to cast a vote in Federal elections. That said, I \ndo not believe there is anything to be gained by sustaining the \nobjection to the ballot certification with regard to the state of Ohio. \nSenator John Kerry has already conceded the election and there are no \npending investigations that will result in sufficient votes being \nchanged so as to alter the outcome of this election.\n  However, the last two elections have revealed a glaring need for us \nto rethink how we conduct elections in our Nation. With more and more \nvoters needing to cast their ballots on Election Day, we need to build \non the movement which already exists to make it easier for Americans to \ncast their ballots by providing alternatives to voting on just one \nelection day. Twenty-six states, including my own state of Wisconsin, \nnow permit any registered voter to vote by absentee ballot. Twenty \nthree states permit in-person early voting at election offices or at \nother satellite locations. The state of Oregon now conducts statewide \nelections completely by mail. These innovations are critical if we are \nto conduct fair elections for it has become unreasonable to expect that \na nation of 294 million people can line up at the same time and cast \ntheir ballots at the same time. And if we continue to try to do so, we \nwill encounter even more reports of broken machines and long lines in \nthe rain and registration errors that create barriers to voting.\n  That is why I have been a long-time advocate of moving our federal \nelection day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November \nto the first weekend in November. Holding our federal elections on a \nweekend will create more opportunities for voters to cast their ballots \nand will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to \nundermine our elections. I look forward to introducing legislation to \nthis end in the 109th Congress and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we meet in historic session today. The \ntwelfth amendment to the Constitution sets forth the requirements for \ncasting electoral votes and counting those votes in Congress. The \nelectors are required to meet, cast and certify their ballots and \ntransmit them to the Vice President in his capacity as President of the \nSenate.\n  With the exception of objections to the electoral votes from the \nState of Florida in the 2000 election, objections to an entire slate of \nvotes from a State have been rare. But we have had one today, which \ngives us the opportunity to discuss and debate a very important issue \nfor our country and for the citizens of my State--the issue of whether \nwe have ensured that every vote is counted.\n  I will vote to uphold the outcome of this most recent election.\n  However, I think we have more work to do in the area of election \nreform, and I think the discussion we are having today is appropriate \nand overdue.\n  In 2001, I supported the passage of the Equal Protection of Voting \nRights Act. That law was designed to protect voting rights and ensure \nthe integrity of the electoral system in our nation. I did so because I \nfeel that making certain that each citizen's vote is counted and \npromoting public trust and confidence in our election process is \ncrucial.\n  The job is far from over. We may need to have additional hearings and \nwe may need to take additional legislative action. There have been \ntroubling reports from this most recent election.\n  Representative John Conyers and the minority staff of the House \nJudiciary Committee have conducted their own hearings and \ninvestigations of instances of voter disenfranchisement, flawed or \ncorrupted voting machinery, and inappropriate procedures for counting \nand recounting votes in Ohio. They have produced a compelling report \nitemizing and analyzing the irregularities.\n  A 2-hour debate on the matter, when people across the country waited \nin 4, 6 and 12-hour lines to vote all over this country in November, is \nthe least we can do.\n  The debate we are having focuses attention on legitimate concerns \nthat have been raised regarding the Ohio vote and count, and on broader \nconcerns about America's inconsistent and sometimes flawed election \nprocesses which vary so radically from State to State that genuine \nequal protection concerns arise.\n  I will certify the election results, because I don't think we should \nsacrifice the greater good of the continuity of Government at this \ntime. We need to govern. But, what we should be doing is using this \ndebate to get this Congress, and this country, talking about the steps \nthat must be taken to ensure that American elections provide a true \nrepresentation of the people's will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while I was pleased at the large number of \nAmericans who turned out to vote in last year's Presidential election, \nI am deeply concerned about the many credible allegations of voting \nirregularities that surfaced in the weeks following the election.\n  I cannot, however, support an objection to the certification of \nOhio's electoral votes. Although I believe this debate is worthwhile, I \nam not persuaded that the alleged fraud was sufficient to change the \noutcome of either the Electoral College or the popular vote. Senator \nKerry conceded the election more than 2 months ago, and he does not \nsupport a challenge. Moreover, the practical effect of discounting \nOhio's electoral votes would simply be to allow the election to be \ndecided by the House of Representatives.\n  In the months leading up to Election Day, I joined with Senator \nKennedy in\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nwriting with great frequency to Attorney General Ashcroft about our \nconcerns about voter suppression and possible partisan activity by the \nDepartment of Justice. It is with dismay, then, that I have learned \nabout the secret counting of votes in Warren County, OH, allegedly \nprompted by an FBI terrorism warning that the FBI denied making. I have \nread also of the nearly 4,000 votes President Bush was mistakenly \nawarded in a Franklin County precinct with only 800 voters. Although \nthis mistake was corrected, such a malfunction suggests the possibility \nthat other problems with the vote count may have been missed.\n\n  Finally, I would point to the shocking misdistribution of voting \nmachines in Ohio. Voters from minority and urban communities frequently \nwaited in line for four to five hours to cast their votes, while \nsuburban voters faced far more manageable waiting times.\n  We cannot know the effect this may have had on vote totals, but we \ncan and should work with State and local officials to prevent this from \nhappening in future Presidential and other Federal elections.\n  I commend Representative Conyers and many of his Democratic \ncolleagues on the House Judiciary Committee for their tireless pursuit \nof a goal that all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--should \ndesire: a free and fair election in which every vote counts.\n  I look forward to the results of the Government Accountability \nOffice's investigation of election irregularities called for by \nRepresentative Conyers.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I accept the decision voters made on \nNovember 2 to elect George W. Bush as the President of the United \nStates. I do not come to the floor today to challenge the outcome of \nthe election. However, I do have concerns about the process. I believe \nthere are some valid issues raised with the Ohio electoral votes \nregarding the legitimacy of our Nation's voting procedures, and I take \nthese issues very seriously. In this modern, computerized age and in \nour magnificent, democratic country, there is absolutely no excuse for \ndatabase errors, lack of polling-place education and training, \nequipment malfunctions, or voter disenfranchisement.\n  I supported the Help America Vote Act, HAVA, and have consistently \nsupported adequately funding this law so that States can achieve its \nrequirements and improve voting procedures to ensure every valid vote \nis counted. In addition, I helped introduce the Restore Elector \nConfidence in Our Representative Democracy, RECORD, Act, S. 2313, last \nyear. This act contains a provision to strengthen security measures for \nelectronic voting devices to prevent outside tampering and requires a \npaper printout of votes cast at electronic voting machines.\n  The right to vote freely and without intimidation is the foundation \nof democracy and we must do all we can to ensure every vote is counted \nand recorded accurately. I believe voters must have faith in the \nelectoral process for our democracy to succeed, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the coming year to ensure that our \nNation's election system is fair and effective.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are here today in this extraordinary \nsession to discuss a challenge to Ohio's electors.\n  It was gratifying to see the high level of interest in the election \ncreate such a large voter turnout. However, it was discouraging to hear \nof the problems that affected the election in many parts of the \ncountry, including Ohio.\n  Representative Conyers, other House Democrats, and individuals across \nthis country deserve our thanks for the important work they have done \nto document the issues that arose from the 2004 election.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Boxer and Representative Tubbs \nJones for their diligence in bringing this issue to the forefront.\n  All voters deserve to get answers, and corrective actions, to the \nreported irregularities and flaws of the 2004 election.\n  As my colleagues may know, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nis currently conducting a comprehensive investigation of many of the \nissues raised in the 2004 election.\n  I am very supportive of this investigation, and believe that through \na complete and full investigation by the GAO, answers to the questions \nraised regarding the 2004 election will be obtained.\n  The information the GAO obtains will allow the Congress to take \nappropriate action to address the problems uncovered.\n  At a minimum, there are two changes to our election system that \nshould be implemented by the Congress: requiring a paper trail for \nelectronic voting machines and creating a national standard for \nprovisional ballots.\n  I will work with my colleagues in the Congress to enact these \nimportant reforms. We must work to maintain, and indeed improve, the \nconfidence in and integrity of the election process.\n  I am under no illusion that the actions taken on this challenge will \nchange the outcome of the election. Senator Kerry has conceded the \nelection. The events of today will not change this result, and I fear \nthey will only further polarize our political landscape.\n  The solutions to the irregularities of the election will not be found \nor enacted in this 2-hour process today. They will come from a complete \ninvestigation, like the on-going GAO one.\n  Because I believe that contesting the slate of Ohio electors is not \nthe way to achieve the needed reforms of the election system, I will \nvote against this challenge today.\n  However, I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will be \nvigorously pursuing reforms of the election system to enact much needed \nimprovements in the system.\n  We have to make sure our elections are a solid reflection of the \nvoters' intent. Given the resources of our great Nation, there is no \nreason why we should not be able to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to comment \nbriefly on voting irregularities that occurred during our most recent \npresidential election. While some steps were taken after the 2000 \nelection to help rectify a number of problems with our voting process \nthat were identified across the country, the election in November \ndemonstrates that more needs to be done.\n  The outcome of the November election will not change because of the \ncurrent process underway in both the Senate and the House, but I \ncertainly understand the goal of those who have initiated this debate \nwith their written objections to certifying the election results. While \nI understand that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) has \nindicated that his campaign's legal team was unable to find evidence \nthat would change the outcome of the election, enough questions have \nbeen raised to justify a thorough examination by Congress and the \nadministration. Of course, the rules governing this debate are highly \nrestrictive, and do not afford any meaningful review of potential \nvoting irregularities, let alone the consideration of possible \nsolutions to any problems. That effort will have to be done outside the \nconfines of the specific work we have today, and to that end, I \nstrongly hope the Senate Rules Committee will make this the very \nhighest priority, and that the Senate's leadership will schedule any \nlegislation that comes from such a review for prompt floor action.\n  Since the election, I have heard both Democrats and Republicans \npledge to work together to tackle some of our most pressing issues. We \nare 3 days into the 109th Congress and it is time to put that promise \nto the test. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to \nhelp ensure that in future elections every eligible citizen who wishes \nto vote is able to do so and all votes are counted.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, as we prepare to commemorate the \n40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we are called on to \nlook back and reflect on whether we have fixed the systemic problems \nthat this historic legislation sought to address. Have we ensured that \nall citizens are provided equal access to the ballot, regardless of \nrace, ethnicity, or language-minority status? Have we created the \nproper safeguards and procedures that make certain that every vote is \ncounted? Have we done enough to protect our democracy's most sacred \nright--the right to vote?\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\n  The accounts from our most recent Presidential election suggest that \nwe have not yet met our goal of securing a free and fair election for \nall Americans. Driving this point home is yesterday's 102-page report \npublished by the House Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff. The \nreport goes into great detail describing the voting irregularities that \narose in Ohio last November. The allegations include accounts of voter \nregistration barriers, voter intimidation, voting machine shortages and \nfailures, and confusion over the counting of provisional ballots. These \naccounts raise serious doubts about whether Ohio electors selected on \nDecember 13, 2004, were chosen in a manner that conforms to Ohio law or \nFederal requirements and constitutional standards.\n  The most troubling revelation from the committee staff's report is \nthe seeming disproportionate impact these voting irregularities had on \nminority voters. And so I ask, 40 years later, have we done enough to \nmake sure the letter and spirit of the Voting Rights Act is being \nenforced?\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in pushing for congressional hearings \non the alleged voting irregularities witnessed in Ohio and elsewhere \nthis past election season. I also ask them to join me in examining \nwhether we need to reform our election laws to ensure that we have free \nand fair elections for all Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity. \nOnly then can we be sure that we have adequately protected the \nconstitutional right of all qualified citizens to participate in our \ndemocracy's most cherished right.\n  I am traveling overseas on a humanitarian mission to Southeast Asia \nto visit the areas most affected by the recent tsunami and regret that \nI will not be available to participate in this afternoon's debate. I \nnonetheless commend my colleagues who are raising these important \nissues, and applaud their efforts to give a voice to those who were \ndisenfranchised last November.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss an issue that \nCongress tried to address after the 2000 election nightmare. Frankly, I \nam stunned to be standing before you 4 years later to take up the same \nissues of voting irregularities and uncounted votes. And I thank my \ncolleague from California for bringing this important issue before the \nSenate for debate. Her opposition serves as a call upon the Congress to \ntake action this year to address the ongoing problems in our electoral \nsystem.\n  Today, I will vote to certify the result, but once again we see that \nthe election system in the United States does not work to provide \nabsolute confidence in the results. Today, I am voting to certify the \nresults because I do not believe that the voting problems changed the \noutcome of the election. Certification should not be delayed further \nunder such circumstances. I believe the majority of voters in Ohio have \nspoken and that result should be certified.\n  But while I do not question the result, I rise today to call \nattention to what went wrong, to the disenfranchised voters, the broken \nmachines and problems people had casting their ballots on election day.\n  This should not be happening in the United States of America. When we \nvote for President, we should all have total confidence that every vote \ncounts and that every vote is counted.\n  There simply should be no questions or problems when we vote for the \nPresident of the United States. But, here we are, again, talking about \nvoting problems and talking about lost or uncounted votes.\n  Like many Americans, I was shocked in 2000 to see how outdated the \nvoting systems in America were. I was also shocked to see how easy it \nwas to manipulate those voting systems and how easy it was for votes to \nbe lost or go uncounted.\n  It was literally unbelievable. I asked myself, how could such things \nhappen here in the United States? In 2000, we all learned that many \nballots, many people's votes, were thrown out, lost, misplaced, or \nmiscounted.\n  We saw election officials who did not know the rules and some who \nappeared to ignore the rules.\n  We witnessed innocent mistakes, machine mistakes, ballot mistakes and \nmistakes that were not so innocent.\n  The result was that many votes simply did not count.\n  The Presidential election of 2000 was an eyeopener. Our election \nsystems in this country, the World's oldest democracy, were broken and \nneeded to be fixed.\n  Republicans and Democrats agreed this had to be done. It was \nimportant. It was vital.\n  And we did something. We passed the Help America Vote Act. We set \nstandards. We authorized money for the states to help them get new \nmachines, new technology and fix their electoral systems. We provided \nfor provisional ballot systems so that if there was a question about a \nvoters registration they could still cast a ballot.\n  We thought that our voting systems were well on their way to being \nfixed. We thought that we would never have another election like 2000. \nWe thought that all votes were going to count and all votes were going \nto be counted.\n  We were wrong.\n  We now see, in 2004, 4 years after the 2000 election debacle, we have \npeople standing in lines for hours because polling places could not \nhandle the turnout, people being given the wrong information, machines \nbreaking down, too few machines in some precincts, ballots being lost \nor misplaced, and voters being told to go to the wrong place to vote. \nThat is simply not right.\n  It is not clear if these problems by accident or intended, but the \nresult was that again people were not able to cast their votes or their \nvotes simply were not counted. That's just wrong. That is not suppose \nto happen in the United States.\n  And where did much of this happen? In minority neighborhoods, in \ncities, in economically distressed areas, in primarily Democratic areas \nacross the Nation. I ask myself, is this just a coincidence? Those \ncommunities do not think so. And it is critical that we let them know \nthat we take their concerns seriously.\n  What happened in the last election is less important than making sure \nthat it never happens again. These communities need to know that the \nCongress is taking action to meet their concerns and will work to \ncorrect the abuses that were documented in many States in 2004.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Ensuring that every \nregistered voter who wants to vote can vote is not a partisan issue. It \nis an issue of what it means to be an American. In 2004, everyone \nshould agree that every vote should count and we have to do whatever is \nnecessary to make sure that happens.\n  I call on the Congress to renew its efforts to ensure that there is \ntrue electoral reform that every American who casts their ballot can be \nsure it is counted and that every American who wants to cast their \nballot has that opportunity. This Congress should take three steps:\n  We should fully fund the Help American Vote Act so that all States \nhave the resources that they need to truly reform their electoral \nsystems.\n  We need to pass legislation to ensure that there is a voter verified \npaper trail on electronic machines so voters can verify that they cast \ntheir ballot and who they cast it for.\n  We need to re-examine the issue of electoral reform to see what steps \nthe Congress needs to take to ensure that the voting rights of all \nAmericans are protected. So that we have uniform standards. So that \nprovisional ballots work, people do not have to wait in long lines, \nmachines are operative and voters can get to the polls on election day.\n  And, we must do it now, before this issue fades from view again. The \nmedia will move on to other issues. We will move on to other issues. \nThere are many important issues that this Congress will address this \nyear, but as we look forward, and this year celebrate the 40th \nAnniversary of the Voting Rights Act, we must make this a priority \nissue. We must act to protect those vital rights and protect our \ndemocracy. There is no better way to honor this historic Act than to \nensure that we fix the problems in our electoral system that continue \ndisenfranchise voters.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Boxer, from California for giving us \nthe opportunity to debate these important points and focusing the \nspotlight on the voting problems still facing our democracy. And while \nI vote today to\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\ncertify the election, I do not certify how our electoral system works \nin the United States and on that front we must now act.\n  I look forward to working on this with other members of the Senate. \nBut, we must not be here in 2006 or 2008 talking about how shocked we \nare to see yet again votes not counted, ballots missing, lost and \nmisplaced, and confused election officials. We must act this year, \nwhile the spotlight is still on, to do more to ensure that all voters \nwill have confidence in our electoral system.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will vote against objecting to counting Ohio's electoral \nvotes. Of course I am concerned by reports of irregularities across the \ncountry during the 2004 presidential election. The 109th Congress \nshould address these problems this year as part of election reform \nlegislation. But voting to throw out the electoral votes of a State in \nthe absence of clear evidence that voting fraud in that State changed \nthe outcome would set a dangerous precedent for future elections in \nwhich the majority party of Congress could overturn the outcome of a \npresidential election.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, free and fair elections are the \nfoundation of our democracy. Thanks to the efforts of tens of thousands \nof citizens, millions more Americans registered and went to the pools \nthis year. But despite this dramatic expansion in public participation, \nmany voters faced barriers to casting their ballot. Disenfranchisement \nand barriers to voting are fundamentally undemocratic and should be \nunacceptable in the freest nation in the world.\n  On November 3, I conceded the Presidential election to George Bush \nand also expressed my commitment to ensuring that every vote in this \nelection is counted. The questions being raised by my colleagues in \nCongress about the vote in Ohio are important. As evidenced by the \nmedia and Congressman John Conyers' report of the vote in Ohio, there \nwere many voting irregularities in the November election that led to \nthe disenfranchisement of voters. These included long lines at \npredominantly minority polling places resulting from the failure to \nprovide sufficient number of voting machines; voter intimidation and \nmisinformation; the restriction of provisional ballots in a fashion \nthat likely disenfranchised voters; and instances in which \nmalfunctioning voting machines transferred Kerry votes to Bush.\n  I strongly believe that we need to investigate this election and \nreform our system. However, while I am deeply concerned about the \nissues the questions and issues being raised by this objection and \nthink they are very important, I do not believe that there is \nsufficient evidence to support the objection and change the outcome of \nthe election and I am not joining their protest of the Ohio electors.\n  Despite widespread reports of irregularities, questionable practices \nby some election officials and instances of lawful voters being denied \nthe right to vote, our legal teams on the ground have found no evidence \nthat would change the outcome of the election.\n  It is critical that we investigate and understand any and every \nvoting irregularity anywhere in our country, not because it would \nchange the outcome of the election but because Americans have to \nbelieve that their votes are counted in our democracy.\n  We must take action this Congress to make sure that the problems \nvoters encountered in Ohio and elsewhere never happen again. We must \nmake sure there are no questions or doubts in future elections. It is \ncritical to our democracy that we investigate and act to prevent voting \nirregularities and voter intimidation across the country.\n  I strongly support the efforts of the civil rights and voting rights \ngroups across the country that continue to investigate what happened in \n2004 and how we can ensure it will never happen again. A Presidential \nelection is a national Federal election but we have different standards \nin different States for casting and counting votes. We must have a \nnational Federal standard to solve the problems that occurred in the \n2004 election.\n  I am calling on my Republican colleagues to put election reform on \nthe congressional agenda this year. The Republican leadership in the \nHouse and Senate must commit to make protecting voting rights a \npriority and commit to adding election reform legislation to the \nlegislative calendar this year. One goal must be to eliminate barriers \nto voting, to encourage the greatest level of civic participation \npossible, and to restore confidence in the notion that every eligible \nvoter will have the opportunity to vote and to have their vote counted.\n  I have spoken with Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid and my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate about my intention to introduce \nlegislation this year to ensure transparency and accountability in our \nvoting system and the need for the Democratic Caucus to make voting \nrights and electoral reform one of our top priority pieces of \nlegislation. Election reform will be one of my top agenda items.\n  I will be meeting in coming weeks with key leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle and from civil rights and voting rights groups across the \nNation. I plan to use the information gathered by Representative \nConyers in his report, and information from other investigations \nunderway, to guide my legislation.\n  We must invest resources in our country to help State and local \ncommunities purchase modern voting machines and do research and \ndevelopment on safe and secure forms of voting. We must ensure that our \nvoting machines enable voters to verify their vote.\n  No American citizen should wake up the morning after the election and \nworry their vote wasn't counted. No citizen should be denied at the \npolls if they are eligible to vote. As the greatest, wealthiest nation \non Earth, our citizens should not have to be forced to vote on old \nunaccountable voting machines. And, as the greatest, wealthiest Nation \non Earth, our citizens should never be forced to vote on old, \nunaccountable and nontransparent voting machines from companies \ncontrolled by partisan activists.\n  Together we can put the critical issue of electoral reform on the \nfront burner in Washington and across the country.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe it is extraordinarily important \nfor both sides to be gracious when an American election is over. But I \nalso believe it is extraordinarily important not to ignore urgently \nneeded election reform, such as requiring a paper trail for every \nsingle ballot that is cast in our country. Such a paper trial is \nrequired in my home State. In this last election, record numbers of \nOregonians voted. There were no allegations of fraud. The system \nworked, and it worked well. Unfortunately, that is not the case in too \nmany communities in our country.\n  When the Senate last debated the issue of election reform, this body \nspent weeks debating whether one dog in the Midwest was an illegal \nvoter. I worked with colleagues on a bipartisan basis. We made sure \nthat dog, Mitzi, would not be allowed to vote again. Now, in the name \nof justice, when hundreds of thousands of Americans feel they have been \ndisenfranchised, I don't think their concerns ought to be swept under \nthe rug.\n  Credible journalists have now documented voting irregularities across \nthe country, and that ought to trouble every Member of the body. \nIncredible reports come from the States of North Carolina, Indiana, \nWashington, Florida, and Ohio. In my view, while not proving to be of a \nvolume that would have changed the outcome of the Presidential \nelection, when you take these findings together, they raise very \nsignificant and troubling matters that this body should be tackling on \na bipartisan basis. I do believe there is critical work ahead of this \nbody with respect to election reform. So I did write in November to \nRepresentative Conyers to ask that he examine these voting \nirregularities. The problems with provisional ballots in the State of \nOhio particularly concerned me because I was one of the principal \nauthors of the section of the Help America Vote Act that involved \nprovisional ballots. The decision of the Ohio Secretary of State to \nrestrict the ability of voters to use provisional ballots, I thought, \nwas troubling. His decisions raised serious questions with respect to \nwhether they were consistent with what the Senate had in mind as we \nwrote that provision.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n  I was also concerned about the reports from Ohio, where in one county \nonly 800 citizens were registered to vote and more than 4,500 votes \nwere counted. This just defies common sense, and it is one of the \nreasons why I have come to the floor to make the case for a continued \nfocus on the issue of election reform.\n  The problems of election abuse are not ones that can be given short \nshrift if we are to keep faith with our citizens and ensure that their \nfundamental belief that our democratic system is sound is maintained. \nOtherwise, we will see a growing lack of confidence in the conduct of \nour elections, and that lack of confidence will come to overshadow some \nof our elections altogether. We will see many more Members of this body \ncome to the floor demanding to know what has happened.\n  I end my statement with the plea that, on a bipartisan basis, this \nbody return to the issue of election reform, correct the abuses that \nhave been credibly documented over the last few weeks, and that we do \nit in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the contention of \nthe junior Senator from California that we have to take a very hard \nlook at this. We are trying to demonstrate the virtues of democracy to \nIraqis and Ukrainians and other people around the world who are \nstruggling to be free. People must have confidence that our election \nresults are unassailable.\n  Unfortunately, questions have been raised in the Presidential \nelection of 2000 and in the Presidential election of 2004. At this \npoint, I want to be clear: I am not challenging President Bush's \nvictory in the State of Ohio. Neither has Senator Kerry. But there have \nbeen reports of systematic voter disenfranchisement and other problems \nin Ohio, such that we would be derelict in our duty if we failed to \ninvestigate it.\n  Yesterday, Congressman John Conyers, ranking Democrat on the House \nJudiciary Committee, issued a report of problems that occurred in Ohio. \nSome of the problems he reported include problems with voting machines \nin predominantly minority, Democratic-leaning wards, which caused \npeople to wait 10 hours or more in the rain. One precinct was forced to \nclose at 9:25 in the morning because its voting machines were not \nworking. The Ohio Republican Party suppressed the turnout of minority, \nDemocratic-leaning voters by engaging in preelection caging tactics, \ntactics which were declared illegal by a Federal court.\n  Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, a Republican, deviated from \nelection law by severely restricting voters' access to provisional \nballots. He went so far as to reject voter registration applications \nbased on paperweight and texture. Those actions and his complete \nunwillingness to cooperate with Congressman Conyers' investigation are \ndeeply troubling. His actions are troubling, particularly because he \ndidn't just serve as the chief election official of his State; he also \ncochaired the Bush-Cheney campaign in Ohio.\n  Allowing a State official to oversee a Federal election and \nsimultaneously serve as a partisan campaign official for a candidate in \nthat election is a blatant conflict of interest and we have to put a \nstop to it. That is why later this month I am going to introduce the \nFederal Election Integrity Act, a bill to prohibit State election \nofficials from overseeing Federal elections in which they play a \npartisan role on behalf of one of the candidates.\n  Secretary Blackwell is now running for Governor. He recently sent a \nfundraising letter to potential Republican donors. I think his letter \nunderscores the need for my bill. The first page of his letter tells \nthe story. In part, it says:\n\n       I have no doubt that the strong campaign we helped the \n     President run in Ohio . . . can easily be credited with \n     turning out record numbers of conservatives and evangelicals \n     on election day.\n\n  It is not surprising that many people have no doubt that Secretary \nBlackwell also ran a strong campaign against other voters, namely \nminorities and Democrats.\n  Americans need to believe their election officials are beyond \nreproach. Allowing such officials to serve simultaneously in a partisan \ncampaign capacity seriously undermines that confidence. That is why, \nregardless of what happens today, I will introduce the Federal Election \nIntegrity Act. It is a step we can and should take to restore \nconfidence that our elections are fair and the results are accurate.\n\n  I don't believe the objection the junior Senator from California has \nraised will be sustained this afternoon, but that doesn't mean we \nshould not discuss the problems that precipitated the objection and do \nsomething about them in the future to assure that when the votes are \ncounted, we know everybody has had a fair chance to cast their ballots \nand that there hasn't been any tinkering with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is obviously a difficult debate for \nmany reasons. I commend the Senator from California for joining with \nmembers of the House, most particularly Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs \nJones, in raising the objection, because it does permit us to air some \nof these issues--something I believe is necessary for the smooth \nfunctioning of our democracy and the integrity of the most precious \nright of any citizen, namely, the right to vote.\n  As we look at our election system, I think it is fair to say there \nare many legitimate questions about its accuracy and about its \nintegrity, and they are not confined to the State of Ohio. They are \nones that have arisen throughout our country and certainly because of \nthe election of 2000 have been given high relief in the last 4 years. \nThen questions were raised additionally with respect to this election \nwhich deepened the concern of many people about whether we can assure \nthe continuity of our democratic process by ensuring the consent of the \ngoverned and the acceptance of the results of elections.\n  Several weeks ago, we stood in great admiration as a nation behind \nthe people of Ukraine as they took to the streets to demand they be \ngiven the right to an election where every vote was counted.\n  In a few weeks, we are going to see an election in Iraq. We know \nthere are people literally dying in Iraq for the right to cast a free \nvote. I am very proud of our country, that we have stood with \nUkrainians, Iraqis, and others around the world, but increasingly, I \nworry that if this body, this Congress does not stand up on a \nbipartisan basis for the right to vote here at home, our moral \nauthority will be weakened.\n  I take that very seriously because freedom is our most precious \nvalue, and we have for 225-plus years worked to form a more perfect \nUnion. At first, not everybody was permitted to vote in our own \ncountry, but through constitutional changes, a civil war, and a civil \nrights movement, we expanded the franchise. This year we will celebrate \nthe anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, and it will be an opportunity \nfor us to take a look at this landmark legislation and determine how we \nare going to move it into the 21st century so it really stands for what \nit was intended to do when it was first passed.\n  I would be standing here saying this no matter what the outcome of \nthe election because I still think the best rule in politics is the \ngolden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I \nworry, whether it is a Democratic or Republican administration or a \nlocal county, State, or Federal election, that we are on a slippery \nslope as a nation.\n  My colleague, Senator Boxer, and I, along with former Senator Bob \nGraham of Florida, introduced legislation last year to try to assure a \nverifiable paper audit. We did not get anywhere with that. We did not \nget a hearing before the Rules Committee, and I hope the distinguished \nchair of the Rules Committee will hold such a hearing this year because \nif we can buy a lottery ticket or go to a bank and make an ATM deposit, \nthen we know we can use an electronic transfer mechanism that gives us \na record. That is just one of the many issues we can deal with \ntechnologically.\n  Last spring, India, the largest democracy--we are the oldest \ndemocracy, so in that way we are real partners in this great enterprise \nof democracy--had an election. Mr. President, 550 million or\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nso people voted, from the dot-com billionaire to the poor illiterate \npeasant. They all voted. They voted on electronic voting machines. They \nvoted in a way that guaranteed the safety, security, and accuracy of \ntheir vote. They had uniform standards. They had a nonpartisan board \nthat oversaw that election, and the result was shocking. They threw out \nthe existing government. Nobody had predicted that. Yet they did it \nwith integrity.\n  Surely, we should be setting the standards. I hope in this body, and \nthanks to the objection of my friend from California, this debate which \nstarted today will continue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke on a procedural matter earlier. I \nask unanimous consent that not be deemed to be my speech in regard to \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today great men and women of our Armed \nForces are working to bring the right of free and fair elections to \nIraq. In less than a month, there will be elections in Iraq. The \nsacrifice of our military demands that we work to ensure our own \nelections are fair. That is why today's debate is here, and I applaud \nmy friend from California for allowing us to talk a little bit about \nelections generally.\n  A constitutional right that can be said to help secure all other \nrights is the right to vote. History has shown us that the right to \nvote demands constant vigilance and attention. While secured by our \nConstitution, widespread disenfranchisement of African Americans and \nother Americans led to the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the \namendments in 1970, 1975, and 1982.\n  Constitutional protection was not enough. We needed tough new laws \nand took action. More recently, the abuses in Florida 4 years ago \ndemonstrated the need for change and led to reform--and it was reform--\nin the Help America Vote Act of 2002.\n  I spread on the Record today the good work of Senator McConnell, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Bond. There were others, but those are the \nthree who stand out in my mind.\n  While the literacy tests and poll taxes of the past are gone, a more \ninsidious form of disenfranchisement continues to taint our electoral \nsystem.\n  In this past election, in the State of Nevada, phone calls were made \nto heavily African-American parts of Las Vegas to try to trick those \nvoters into not voting. The same happened in the Hispanic areas of our \nState, especially in Clark County. These calls, which we were unable to \ntrace, told voters election day was November 3, not November 2.\n  Our registration process in Nevada is also tainted by the proven \ndestruction of Democratic voter registration forms. This is clear. It \nhappened. There was a company hired by the Republican National \nCommittee to register only Republicans. We had people come forward and \nsay they destroyed Democratic registration forms. That investigation is \nstill underway.\n  In some of my earliest elections in Nevada, private individuals \ndressed in uniforms meant to resemble police officers stood around \npolling places in minority voting spots to frighten people from coming \nto vote, and it worked. These officers were posted, as I indicated, at \nthe polls to intimidate these minority voters.\n  In this past election in Ohio, we heard a lot about what appeared to \nbe wrong there, and I hope there will be more done to determine what \nwent on in Ohio.\n  Legal challenges to restrict provisional voting, a provision of HAVA, \nwhich is the Help America Vote Act which I talked about earlier, meant \nto cure the widespread disenfranchisement of minorities in Florida and \naround the rest of the country.\n  These problems damage our system, deny our citizens equal protection, \nand undermine the right to vote. Rooting out this corruption requires \nnot only strong laws but I believe strong hearts. It relies upon the \nintegrity of our election officials in every State and each one of us \nto speak up when abuses occur.\n  It is my hope the debate today will once again lead to action to cure \nsome of the more glaring defects of the 2004 election. One of the most \nsignificant problems in Ohio and in many other States was the lack of \nmeasures to ensure the integrity of electronic voting machines. While \nwe have made improvements that are historic with HAVA, one important \nomission is in this area; that is, electronic voting, how to ensure the \nintegrity of it.\n  In the last election, of all 50 States, Nevada was the only State \nwhere we had total electronic voting with a paper trail. When you voted \nin Nevada, you did your electronic voting and you could look right \nthere to see for whom you voted. No mistakes. You did not take it with \nyou, of course, but it was in the machine, and if there was a recount, \nit could be determined easily.\n  This is the way it should happen all over America, an electronic \nmachine with a paper trail.\n  Last year, my colleague, the distinguished junior Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Ensign, and I introduced a measure to require paper trails \nfor electronic voting machines every place. We will introduce our \nbipartisan Voting Integrity and Verification Act in this Congress.\n  I hope that as we consider the 2004 election today--I ask unanimous \nconsent for one additional minute, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The statute allows no more than 5 minutes \nto any Senator, I regret.\n  Mr. REID. I will end by saying we look forward to enacting \ncommonsense measures such as the Voting Integrity and Verification Act \nwhich Senator Ensign and I will introduce in a few days to continue to \nimprove the integrity of our elections.\n  I do not view the need to consider these additional reforms as a sign \nthat our electoral system has failed. That we learn, investigate, and \nreform demonstrates its strength. The only failure following the 2004 \nelection would be to not acknowledge and act to strengthen the right to \nvote.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join with me \nin that effort.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from California is performing an important \nservice for American democracy today, along with her partner in this \neffort on the House of Representatives side, the Congresswoman from \nOhio. Their challenge allows a needed debate in the Senate, as well as \nin the House of Representatives. This debate is short today. We are \nlimited to 5 minutes. I hope this debate will continue in the future, \nat least this year, to try to reach some better conclusions as to how \nwe operate voting in America.\n  I want to be clear that I do not question the legitimacy or outcome \nof our 2004 Presidential election. Nor will I vote to overturn the \nresult of the vote in Ohio. The irregularities and the \ndisenfranchisement that took place in that State and elsewhere, which \nare real and deeply worrisome, do not appear to me to have determined \nthe outcome, either nationally or in Ohio.\n  But the right to vote and the need for citizens to have confidence \nthat their votes will be counted correctly are basic to our democracy. \nThat is why I believe there can be no more appropriate time to talk \nabout problems in our electoral system than today, the day on which we \nofficially confirm and proclaim the results of our recent election. So \nI thank Senator Boxer, as well as Representative Tubbs Jones, who is a \nformer judge in the State of Ohio, for this responsible action.\n  I say to my friend Mr. DeWine from Ohio, whom I listened to briefly a \nlittle bit ago, this is not about whether George Bush won the election. \nIt is about taking a hard look at the voting structure in America, \nasking how we can make it better. How can we make it better and more \nequitable for people?\n  Now we tried, through the Help America Vote, to fix some of the \nproblems, but there is evidence we did not do enough. We know that \nmassive lines at the polls in Ohio likely led to thousands of voters \ngiving up on voting. People had to wait 4, 5, 10 hours in line. \nStanding in line for 10 hours in America is like throwing acid in the \nface of democracy. It mars it. It scars it permanently.\n  Now, why the long lines? They did not have an adequate number of \nvoting\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nmachines. Where were the lines? Many of them were in urban areas and \nminority communities because there was an inequitable distribution of \nmachines between urban and suburban areas.\n  According to the New York Times, in Columbus, OH, there was an \naverage of 4.6 machines per voter in Bush's strongest precincts while \nthere were only 3.9 machines in the so-called Kerry precincts.\n  What we saw in Ohio was a concerted effort by an official, the \nSecretary of State, to try to minimize the ability of Ohioans to cast \ntheir vote. The Secretary of State was also the Chairman of the Ohio \nBush re-election campaign. For example, in the weeks leading up to the \nelection, the Secretary of State of Ohio tried to argue that thousands \nshould be denied the right to vote because the forms they used to \nregister were printed on the wrong weight of paper.\n  The Secretary of State also argued that absentee voters who had not \nreceived their ballots should not be allowed to vote, another concerted \neffort to suppress votes.\n  We also have reports of electronic voting machines not voting \nproperly. A system where software is kept secret has been allowed to be \nthe norm. This is an inappropriate practice that could result in \nserious fraud. Clearly, we need a Federal statute requiring independent \nreview of the software used in electronic voting machines, as well as \nproviding both sides access to the software in these machines.\n  What we saw in Ohio, what we likely would see in many States if they \ncame under this type of scrutiny, is continuing problems with the whole \nelection process that need to be fixed. We need to make changes in \nFederal law to make it clear that election officials are to work to \nmaximize the right of people to vote rather than finding technicalities \nto disenfranchise them.\n\n  It is curious to note that in the Constitution of the United States, \nthere is not a provision guaranteeing the right to vote. There are a \nnumber of amendments, the 14th, the 15th, 19th, 24th, 26th, that expand \nthe concept, say people cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis \nof poll taxes, race, color, gender, and age.\n  Perhaps what we need is a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the \nright of every citizen of the United States a secret ballot and to have \nthat ballot counted. I think it would come as a shock to most Americans \nto know that it is not in the Constitution of the United States that we \nhave that right to vote.\n  This debate is needed to fix a system that is broken.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any Senator who has not spoken \nwho wishes to speak on this matter?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I did not anticipate speaking today, but \nthe importance of this issue is enough for me to address this body.\n  During the election, I had the occasion of meeting a woman who had \nsupported me in my campaign. She decided to come to shake my hand and \ntake a photograph. She is a wonderful woman. She was not asking for \nanything. I was very grateful that she took time to come by. It was an \nunexceptional moment except for the fact that she was born in 1894. Her \nname is Marguerite Lewis, an African-American woman who had been born \nin Louisiana, born in the shadow of slavery, born at a time when \nlynchings were commonplace, born at a time when African Americans and \nwomen could not vote. Yet, over the course of decades she had \nparticipated in broadening our democracy and ensuring that, in fact, at \nsome point, if not herself, then her children, her grandchildren, and \nher great-grandchildren would be in a position in which they could, \ntoo, call themselves citizens of the United States and make certain \nthat this Government works not just on behalf of the mighty and the \npowerful but also on behalf of people like her.\n  So the fact that she voted and her vote was counted in this election \nwas of supreme importance to her and it is the memory of talking to her \nand shaking her hand that causes me to rise on this occasion.\n  I am absolutely convinced that the President of the United States, \nGeorge Bush, won this election. I also believe he got more votes in \nOhio. As has already been said by some of the speakers in this body, \nthis is not an issue in which we are challenging the outcome of the \nelection. It is important for us to separate the issue of the election \noutcome with the election process.\n  I was not in this body 4 years ago, but what I observed as a voter \nand as a citizen of Illinois 4 years ago was troubling evidence of the \nfact that not every vote was being counted. It is unfortunate that 4 \nyears later we continue to see circumstances in which people who \nbelieve they have the right to vote, who show up at the polls, still \ncontinue to confront the sort of problems that have been documented as \ntaking place not just in Ohio but places all across the country.\n  I strongly urge that this Chamber, as well as the House of \nRepresentatives, take it upon itself once and for all to reform this \nsystem.\n  There is no reason, at a time when we have enormous battles taking \nplace ideologically all across the globe, at a time when we try to make \ncertain we encourage democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places \nthroughout the world, that we have the legitimacy of our elections \nchallenged--rightly or wrongly--by people who are not certain as to \nwhether our processes are fair and just.\n  This is something we can fix. We have experts on both sides of the \naisle who know how to fix it. What we have lacked is the political \nwill.\n  I strongly urge that, in a circumstance in which too many voters have \nstood in long lines for hours, in which too many voters have cast votes \non machines that jam or malfunction or suck the votes without a trace, \nin which too many voters try to register to vote only to discover that \ntheir names don't appear on the roles or that partisan political \ninterests and those that serve them have worked hard to throw up every \nbarrier to recognize them as lawful, in which too many voters will know \nthat there are different elections for different parts of the country \nand that these differences turn shamefully on differences of wealth or \nof race, in which too many voters have to contend with State officials, \nservants of the public, who put partisan or personal political \ninterests ahead of the public in administering our elections--in such \ncircumstances, we have an obligation to fix the problem.\n  I have to add this is not a problem unique to this election, and it \nis not a partisan problem. Keep in mind, I come from Cook County, from \nChicago, in which there is a long record of these kinds of problems \ntaking place and disadvantaging Republicans as well as Democrats. So I \nask that all of us rise up and use this occasion to amend this problem.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend and thank our colleague from \nCalifornia who, as a result of her objection, has allowed us to have a \ncouple of hours here to debate and discuss the events that occurred on \nelection day this year. I thank her for doing that. Whatever occurred \nduring the day, I think it is important that this body take a moment \nnow and review what has occurred since election 2000 and this election \nas well. I recognize we are still operating under a very imperfect \nsystem when it comes to the Federal elections in this country. I thank \nthe distinguished minority leader, Senator Reid, for commending this \nbody for its support of the Help America Vote Act that we adopted \nalmost unanimously in this body a couple of years ago, through the work \nof Senators McConnell and Bond and others.\n  It was certainly not a perfect piece of legislation, but it was the \nfirst time in the history of this country, outside of the Voting Rights \nAct, that this body, the Congress of the United States, spoke \ncomprehensively about the conduct of Federal elections.\n  I point out to my colleagues that while certainly things need to be \ndone to improve even that effort, there were 119,000 provisional \nballots cast in the State of Ohio that never would have been counted \nhad we not adopted provisional ballot requirements.\n  There are certainly legitimate questions about what does and doesn't \nconstitute a ballot. I am drafting for my colleagues' approval a \ncomprehensive piece of legislation that deals with the shortcomings in \nthe HAVA bill itself.\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nThe fact is we are going to have access to statewide voter \nregistration. The fact is we are making it possible for 20 million \ndisabled Americans to cast a ballot independently and privately.\n  I know personally what this is like, having watched a sibling of mine \nhaving to cast a ballot with the help of someone else, despite two \nmaster's degrees and being a teacher for 40 years. We also put into \nHAVA the requirement that every voter have the right to see his or her \nballot before actually casting their ballot. HAVA required that all \nvoters who are challenged, for any reason, have the right to cast a \nprovisional ballot. The Federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \nof the United States affirmed the absolute right to receive a \nprovisional ballot, without any additional requirements.\n\n  We have made great progress here. More needs to be done, clearly, if \nwe are going to make a Federal election system exist where every vote \nwill be counted and every eligible person will have an equal \nopportunity to vote.\n  I appreciate the opportunity here to talk about this. My hope would \nbe that we would build bipartisan support, just as we did 2 years ago \nin adopting the Help America Vote Act, in both bodies, and get the kind \nof bipartisan support necessary so the conduct of elections, Federal \nelections, will have a system that has the confidence of the voters of \nthis country.\n  I think it was Thomas Paine who, more than 200 years ago, said the \nright to vote is the right upon which all other rights depend. If you \ndon't get this right, every other right is in jeopardy, and that is the \nbusiness we need to be about.\n  Obviously events in Ohio and elsewhere raise legitimate and serious \nconcerns. In this country we are still operating Federal elections on \nthe basis of a voluntary work, pretty much, of local people. It worked \npretty well for many years. It doesn't work any longer. It has to be \nchanged. We have to do a better job. It is important that this body, \nthe Congress of the United States, say to the American public we are \ngoing to do everything we can to see to it that you have an equal \nopportunity to vote and that your vote will be counted, and we are \ngoing to have the people, the technology, and the resources in place to \nmake that happen.\n  We have made great strides. More needs to be done. The Senator from \nCalifornia has given us an opportunity today to highlight the \nimportance of this. I regret that the Senate finds itself in this \nsituation today where we find that the American public still lacks \nconfidence in the legitimacy of the process and the results of our \npresidential elections.\n  But as painful as this debate today may be, this discourse is \nnecessary to ensuring the American public that we, here in Congress, \nhear their concerns and frustrations, and will continue to fight to see \nthat their most basic of all democratic rights--the right to vote--is \nsecure.\n  Sadly, the concerns we are hearing expressed today are all too \nfamiliar to those we heard exactly 4 years ago following the debacle of \nthe 2000 presidential election.\n  Following the 2000 presidential election, Congress responded to the \nproblems which arose in Florida and other states by enacting bipartisan \nlegislation, the Help America Vote Act, which I was pleased to \ncoauthor. The goal of that bill was to ensure that every eligible \nAmerican would have an equal opportunity to cast a vote and have that \nvote counted, regardless of race, gender, disability, language or party \nor precinct; and, that it would be easier to vote, but harder to \ndefraud the system.\n  The Help America Vote Act--or HAVA--had the support of countless \ncivil rights, disability, language minority and voting rights groups, \nand organizations representing state and local governments. HAVA has \nbeen hailed as the first civil rights law of the 21st century and I am \ncommitted to ensuring that it is fully implemented as such.\n  While the results of the 2004 presidential election may not have been \ncontested in the same manner as those of the 2000 election, the jury is \nstill out on whether HAVA successfully addressed all the problems that \narose in the 2000 election. While I believe there is still much work to \ndo to ensure the franchise for all Americans, I am confident \nthat without HAVA, thousands of eligible American voters would not have \nbeen able to cast a vote, nor have their vote counted, in the November \n2004 presidential election.\n\n  It is important to remember that HAVA is not yet fully implemented. \nIn some respects, the most important reforms have yet to be implemented \nby the States.\n  These reforms include:\n\n       mandatory uniform and nondiscriminatory requirements that \n     all voting systems provide second-chance voting for voters;\n       full accessibility for the disabled and language \n     minorities;\n       a permanent paper record for manual audits;\n       uniform standards for what constitutes a vote and how such \n     a vote will be counted for each type of voting system used by \n     a State; and\n       a computerized statewide voter registration list which must \n     contain the name and registration information for every \n     eligible voter in a State and be electronically available to \n     every State and local election official at the polling place \n     on election day.\n\n  Had these additional reforms been in place on election day this \nNovember, many of the Election Day problems that arose across the \ncountry could have been avoided or resolved at the polling place.\n  But one of the HAVA reforms that was in place this November did make \na difference: the requirement that all States provide a provisional \nballot to voters who are challenged at the polls, for any reason. This \nrequirement ensured the franchise for thousands of Americans on \nNovember 2 last year.\n  In Ohio alone, 155,000 voters cast provisional ballots, of which an \nestimated 77 percent were counted. That represents over 119,000 \nAmerican voters who otherwise might not have been able to cast a vote \nor have their vote counted, but for HAVA.\n  Some States, including Ohio, attempted to restrict the right to a \nprovisional ballot, but were ultimately unsuccessful. The Federal Court \nof Appeals for the 6th Circuit of the United States affirmed the \nabsolute right to receive a provisional ballot, without any additional \nrequirements, in the decision of Sandusky vs. Blackwell decided on \nOctober 26, just one week prior to the election.\n  More importantly, that decision upheld the right of an individual \nvoter to seek judicial redress of the rights conferred by HAVA and \nupheld HAVA as a civil rights law enforceable as such in the courts.\n  As with any comprehensive civil rights legislation, HAVA's reach and \neffectiveness will have to be hammered out by the courts. As that \nprocess plays out, coupled with the States' implementation of the \nremaining HAVA reforms, we will be in a better position to assess \nwhether this landmark legislation hit the mark or needs further reform.\n  But it is already clear, based on the November election, that it will \ntake further reform to ensure that all eligible Americans have an equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted. We already know \nthat States are implementing the provisional ballot requirements in \nsignificantly differing manners. It is simply unacceptable that a \nFederally-guaranteed provisional ballot, cast for President of the \nUnited States, may not be counted simply because of the local precinct \nthat the otherwise eligible voter was standing in at the time he or she \nvoted.\n  We know from the November elections that election officials did not \nprovide sufficient numbers of machines to ensure that all voters could \nvote in a timely manner. We also know that many voters, such as those \nin Ohio, were still forced to vote on antiquated equipment such as the \npunch card which disenfranchises minority voters at greater rates than \nother voters, or use ballots that are confusing. And we know that some \nstates still insist on purging voters based on inaccurate lists and \nrefuse to reinstate the voting rights of felons, even after they have \ncompleted their debt to society.\n\n  It is time to consider whether, for Federal elections, there is a \nnational responsibility to ensure that no matter where and how a ballot \nis cast for the office of the President of the United States, all \nAmericans will have confidence that their vote was cast and counted in \na uniform and nondiscriminatory way.\n  I will be introducing comprehensive election reform legislation when \nwe reconvene which will build on HAVA and address these and other \nissues. My proposal will:\n\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n\n       require states to provide enough machines, and ensure they \n     are geographically distributed;\n       ensure that the provisions of HAVA that require that voters \n     have a chance to verify their ballot before it is cast and \n     that an audit trail exists to establish that such ballot was \n     counted are implemented;\n       require states to offer extended voting times to ensure \n     that single parents, the disabled, and those who simply \n     cannot get to the polls on the one day can still cast their \n     vote;\n       ensure that only eligible voters can vote, but that no \n     voter who is eligible will be barred from the polls simply \n     because he or she did not check a box on a form; and\n       require the reinstatement of felons for the purpose of \n     casting a Federal ballot.\n\n  And my legislation will provide the Federal funds necessary to ensure \nthat the states can timely implement the reforms.\n  The Help America Vote Act is an historic landmark legislation that \ncomprehensively defines, for the first time in this Nation's history, \nthe role of the Federal government in the conduct of Federal elections. \nIt was an important first step, but our work is not done.\n  The real test, however, will be not so much on how we vote in the \nnext few minutes on some resolution here, but whether in the coming \ndays we are willing to pass legislation to fill in the gaps that are \nleft vacant as a result of our inability to get more done with the HAVA \nbill.\n  I believe we can do it. We did it in the last Congress. We ought to \ndo it in this one, so we never again have questions raised about the \nlegitimacy of the election process or results, in any State, of a \nFederal election.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, and the civil rights, \ndisability, language minority, and voting rights communities, as well \nas State and local election officials, to continue our work to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to the most fundamental right in a \nrepresentative democracy: the right to cast a vote and have that vote \ncounted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a Senator who has not spoken who \nwishes to speak on this matter?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today as a Member of the body \nwho recently was sworn in for his second term. In my first 6 years as a \nSenator of the United States in this institution, I faced challenges \nunprecedented in this country's history.\n  While we have made tremendous progress making our Nation more secure, \nincreasing America's competitiveness in the global marketplace, and \nupholding the Federal Government's promise to seniors by enacting a \nprescription drug benefit through Medicare, we still have serious \nproblems confronting our Nation.\n  On November 2, voters across this Nation chose their Government that \nwill face these forthcoming challenges. The voters of Ohio and our \nNation chose President George W. Bush. Even with a recount in Ohio, \nPresident Bush won my State by over 118,000 votes. As a Republican from \nCleveland who has been reelected as a Republican from Cleveland, \nelected to Federal, State, county, and municipal offices, I am living \nproof Ohioans know how to count ballots and, more importantly, we count \nfairly.\n\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors Gallery.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There will be order in the galleries, \nplease. The Sergeant at Arms will remove people from the gallery if \nthere is no order in the gallery.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. It is clear that those who persist in beating a dead \nhorse are attempting to create uncertainty where none exists. That is \nwhy I am so disappointed that this body is squandering its time playing \nMonday-morning quarterback when the result of Ohio's Presidential \nelection is clear. President George W. Bush won my home State and its \n20 electoral votes.\n  Frankly, I am proud of how the election went in Ohio. Hundreds of \nthousands of new voters took part in their democracy this past \nNovember, increasing Ohio's voter participation rate to 72 percent, up \nfrom 64 percent in 2000. Unfortunately, prior to November 2, \nunsubstantiated allegations were being made about the electoral process \nin Ohio. But, at the end, on election day, and at the end of the \nrecount, Ohio's Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell and the bipartisan \nelection boards across the State did a tremendous job to ensure that \nthe election was fair and the results were without question. I want to \npublicly applaud the good work of those dedicated public officials.\n  It is time to put this election to rest. Editorial boards from Ohio \nnewspapers, many of which endorsed Senator Kerry, agree as well. The \nso-called recount effort is a circus that needs to pack up and leave \ntown, is what one of them said.\n  The Akron Beacon Journal, a newspaper that endorsed Senator Kerry, \nstated on December 24:\n\n       The allegations being thrown around are of the flimsiest \n     nature. . . . Not one shred of evidence has been presented to \n     show that Ohio's strictly bipartisan system of running \n     elections was manipulated. There isn't any.\n\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer, on December 15:\n\n       Ohio's bipartisan elections system makes the kind of GOP \n     conspiracy that some allege all but impossible to execute. \n     Every county board of elections consists of two Democrats and \n     two Republicans. So, when (Jesse) Jackson and other national \n     Democrats question Ohio's outcome, they demean their own \n     allies.\n\n  William Anthony Jr., the African American who chairs both the \nFranklin County Democratic Party and its election board, has been \npersonally stung by Jackson's slander. ``Why would I sit there,'' Mr. \nAnthony said, ``and disenfranchise my own community?''\n  The Columbus Dispatch on December 12, 2004, states:\n\n       [John] Kerry understands that Bush legitimately won the \n     election, which was why he conceded on November 3rd. Those \n     who claim that Ohio's vote was rigged have produced nothing \n     that approaches credible evidence.\n\n  An editorial that appeared on Tuesday, January 4, just this week, in \nmy hometown newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, said:\n\n       The 176 Democrats who sit on Ohio's county election boards \n     pondered their jurisdictions' results, accepted their \n     subordinates' good work, and are turning their energies \n     toward the future.\n\n  Across the country, people are moving forward after nearly 2 years of \na continuous political campaign for the Presidency.\n  This country deserves to be able to put this undisputed election to \nrest. We need to stop wasting time and move on to the serious issues \nfacing our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any Senator who has not spoken \nwho wishes to speak?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, realizing that I have the 5-minute \nallocation, I make a parliamentary inquiry about where we are. If there \nare no further speakers, is the Chair going to be prepared to put the \nquestion so that there would be a recorded vote?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been ordered and \nthe question will be placed before the body.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think the case has been made. I think this \nwas an unfortunate procedure. This process which we have been through \nwas an inauspicious and unfortunate beginning of our session. I hope it \ndoes not have a lasting negative impact. But the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, made her case, others have responded, and I \ndon't think it merits any further response. I, therefore, think we \nshould be prepared to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 204 years ago, Thomas Jefferson took \nthe oath of office as President of the United States in this very \nCapitol. He was the first President ever to do so. As he walked from a \nboardinghouse on Pennsylvania Avenue toward this building on the \nmorning of his inauguration, he must have marveled at what was about to \ntake place.\n  For the first time in American history, power was changing hands from \none party--the Federalists--to the other, the Democratic-Republicans. \nJohn Adams willingly left office. No shots were fired, and no monarchs \nwere hanged. Unlike their brethren in Europe, Americans, under our \nglorious Constitution, had mastered the peaceful transfer of authority \nfrom one faction to another. Jefferson called his election the \n``revolution of 1800,'' brought about ``by the rational and peaceful \ninstruments of reform, the suffrage of the people.''\n  But America's tradition of this peaceful transfer of power is now \nbeing challenged.\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\n  The obstruction of the counting of the electoral vote undermines the \ntradition that Jefferson and Adams established. By blocking this vote \nwhen there is no possibility whatsoever of overturning the result, the \nlegitimacy of our republican form of government is questioned. I am \nsure that is not the intention of my colleagues who have forced us to \ndebate this. Yet it is undoubtedly the result.\n  I understand that a minority of a minority protests the presidential \nvote in the State of Ohio. But President Bush has indisputably won that \nState by over 118,000 votes, and the votes have been counted twice.\n  Some of my colleagues have claimed that, even though they agree that \nPresident Bush has won Ohio, they must take this opportunity to speak \nabout the need for electoral reform. I submit that hijacking a \npresidential election to use as a personal soapbox is shameful.\n  Electoral reform may very well be desirable--for as long as people \nadminister elections, elections will be imperfect. There will always be \nsome irregularities, most due to innocent mistake, some to outright \nfraud. We should absolutely do everything possible to combat this.\n  But if electoral reform is needed, Senators should introduce \nlegislation. They should not obstruct a legitimate count of the \nelectoral votes where there is an unequivocal victor. They should not \ntrample on the proud republican government our Founding Fathers \nbequeathed us. They should not mock the beautiful concept that \nsovereignty lies with the people, while our troops are fighting and \ndying to plant that concept in the soil of Iraq.\n  Even the junior senator from Massachusetts has not endorsed the \nradical scheme that a minority of a minority has unleashed on us today. \nIn an e-mail to supporters yesterday, Senator Kerry said that he would \nnot participate in this petulant protest but, rather, will propose \nlegislation to address perceived deficiencies in our electoral system. \nThis is the only proper route to take, and history will applaud Senator \nKerry for disavowing what is happening here today.\n  This is an ignominious beginning to the 109th Congress. Last month I \nspoke about the desire on this side of the aisle to work with our \ncolleagues in the other party to get things done for the American \npeople in a spirit of bipartisanship. I'm still holding onto that hope. \nI appeal to cooler heads on the other side of the aisle: Don't let a \nfraction of your number march you down a dead end.\n  The words that we say here today amount to little against the fact \nthat in 2004, the President won an overwhelming victory in Ohio and 30 \nother States, and received 286 electoral votes. Years from now, that \nfact will still be obvious. I hope that the damage done from this \nassault on our traditions is not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any Senator who has not spoken \nwho wishes to speak on this issue?\n  If not, the question is, Shall the objection submitted by the \ngentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. Tubbs Jones, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, be sustained?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe resolution submitted this week by Senator Frist and Senator Reid \nexpressing sympathy and support for the victims of the devastating \nearthquake and tsunami.\n  Words cannot begin to describe my emotions when I first learned of \nthe scope of the disaster and the loss of life. More than 140,000 \npeople from 12 nations have perished to date and the number could \ndouble or triple as a result of infectious diseases spread in the \ndisaster's aftermath.\n  The victims, their families, and all the affected countries are truly \nin my thoughts and prayers. When I visit the Indonesian Embassy this \nweek to sign the condolence book, I will do so with a heavy heart but \nalso a commitment to ensure that we do everything in our power to help \nin the rescue, recovery, and reconstruction efforts.\n  I welcome the President's commitment to provide $350 million in \nrelief and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I \nstand ready to do my part to designate a robust and comprehensive aid \npackage. Initially, we must provide emergency supplies such as water, \nsanitation, food, and shelter to prevent the spread of disease and give \npeople hope.\n  There is little time to lose.\n  Yet our work and our commitment must not end there. Together with our \nfriends and allies in the international community, the United Nations, \nand vital organizations such as the Red Cross we will develop a long \nterm relief\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nand reconstruction plan with substantial funding. Too often when a \ndisaster leaves the headlines and the top of the news broadcasts, we \nforget that the work has only just begun and the victims and their \nfamilies need to know that we are with them for the long haul.\n  Indeed, this is an important opportunity to show the world the best \nof America and the American people.\n  Americans have already donated more than $100 million through \nnongovernmental organizations to support relief efforts and thousands \nmore stand ready to volunteer their time, energy, and skills.\n  And I am confident that President George H.W. Bush and President Bill \nClinton will do an excellent job in leading a nationwide charitable \nfundraising effort to sustain awareness about the disaster and raise \nadditional assistance.\n  We are a generous, giving, and caring people and through our actions \nwe will earn the world's respect and admiration. We will show the \nvictims and their families that America is always ready to help a \nneighbor and a friend in need.\n  I am pleased the resolution was passed by Unanimous Consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S57-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S57]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. On Tuesday of this week, the majority leader came to the \nSenate floor and talked about judicial nominations. He said he was \nplanning to have a vote next month on one of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. He didn't say which nominee he had in mind, but he gave a \nclear signal that it would be someone controversial. He warned that if \nSenate Democrats prevent the nominee from receiving an ``up or down'' \nvote, then he would try and change the rules and traditions of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I am sorry to see that the majority leader chose to sound such a \npartisan note on a famously bipartisan day--the first day of the new \nCongress. On such a day, we swear in our new colleagues and strive for \na fresh start.\n  I do not believe this is the time or the place to engage on this \nissue. There are too many other, more urgent problems facing this world \nand this Nation.\n  But it is important to address a few statements made by the majority \nleader that I believe are in error.\n  First, he stated that ``the Senate failed to perform in an essential \nconstitutional duty'' last Congress when we blocked ten judicial \nnominees. He said that the Senate ``failed to offer advice and consent \nto the President'' and indicated this was an unconstitutional action on \nthe part of Senate Democrats.\n  I do not believe that the Senate acted unconstitutionally. The \nConstitution requires advice and consent--it does not require us to be \na rubberstamp. I could just as easily assert that President Bush acted \nunconstitutionally by not soliciting the advice of Senate Democrats \nbefore nominating most of his nominees. After all, Article II, Section \n2 of the Constitution requires the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  There is no constitutional right for any President to have 100 \npercent of his judicial nominees confirmed. During President Bush's \nfirst term, the Senate confirmed 204 judicial nominees. President Bush \nhad more judicial nominees confirmed in his first term than the \nprevious three presidents had in theirs.\n  A second error made by the majority leader was his statement that \n``these filibusters were unprecedented.'' Filibusters of judicial \nnominees are hardly unprecedented. The majority leader voted to \nfilibuster some of President Clinton's nominees in the 1990s.\n  But the facts show that President Bush's judicial nominees have \nreceived far better treatment than President Clinton's. At least 61 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees--representing 20 percent of his \nselections--were denied an ``up or down'' vote on the Senate floor. In \nfact, they were denied an ``up or down'' vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The majority leader did not mention this critical statistic \nwhen he spoke on Tuesday.\n  I also take issue with his statement that ``I seek cooperation not \nconfrontation.'' If he truly meant that, he would not threaten to \nchange the Senate rules and traditions next month. If he truly meant \nit, he would have urged the White House not to re-nominate those \nnominees who were rejected by the Senate last Congress. If he truly \nmeant it, he would have done what Senator Harry Reid did last month and \nsend a letter to the White House urging the President to engage in \nbipartisan collaboration in the selection of Federal judges.\n  Finally, I wish to note the majority leader's surprising rejection of \nthe longstanding tradition of the Senate as a continuous body. In his \nstatement, he said that ``I do not acquiesce to carrying over all the \nrules from the last Congress'' and he specifically named Rule 22 as the \nrule he objected to. This is the rule that permits 41 Members of the \nSenate to prevent a vote on any measure, motion, or other matter \npending before the Senate.\n  All of us who have served in the House and the Senate know that one \nof the most basic differences between our chamber and the House is that \nthe Senate is a continuing body and the House is not. In other words, \nthe Senate does not have to reorganize itself each new Congress by \nadopting new rules and electing new leaders. The House, on the other \nhand, must do so.\n  It is my hope that the 109th Congress can operate with more \nbipartisanship and less acrimony than the previous Congress on the \nissue of judicial nominations. But if my colleagues across the aisle \ntry and change generations of Senate rules and traditions, it will not \nbe good for this body, and it will not be good for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S57-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S57-S58]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN BOB T. MATSUI\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer a few words about the passing \nof Bob Matsui, one of California's great political leaders.\n  Bob was one of those people who you always thought would be there. \nHis death has come as a great shock and surprise to many.\n  I extend my deep sorrow to Doris, Brian, and the rest of the Matsui \nfamily. You are in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Throughout his career his wonderful wife Doris has been by his side. \nOne of the things I remember most about the two of them is the \nwonderful smile she always had whenever they walked into a room \ntogether. They truly were a fine couple.\n  I would also like to offer my sympathy to everyone in the Sacramento \narea--you were so well served by this wonderful man. He has done a \nfantastic job representing you in Washington for the last 26 years and \nbefore that on the Sacramento City Council.\n  I have known Bob Matsui for a long time. I will remember him as a \ngreat human being, as a trusted colleague, as a fine public servant, \nand someone in whom I was very proud to place friendship, respect, and \ncollegiality.\n  Bob was a superb public servant. He was a thoughtful, constructive \nleader who brought people together to find solutions for public policy \nissues. He was a reasoned voice; he was a dependable voice.\n  When we faced a problem related to the Folsom Dam, Bob was one of the \nmost constructive figures in getting that very divided issue settled.\n  Bob was also a good thinker and a strong thinker. People knew that \nwhen Bob Matsui said something that it was steeped in practicality. He \nwas well respected and influential among his colleagues.\n  If Bob told me something was true, I knew it was true and not some \nvariation of the facts. This is an important quality in someone who \nrepresents others because it gives them credibility among their \ncolleagues. Bob Matsui had that credibility.\n  We have all heard the story of Bob's family and their internment at \nthe Tule Lake Camp in 1942. I think this probably had a very sobering \nimpact on his life.\n  I think he knew what could happen in situations of stress and \nmilitary conflict. I think it presented a challenge to him as a young \nman growing up. He clearly overcame that challenge and I think it \nprobably had an impact in his knowing what he wanted to do with his \nlife, and that was public service.\n  One of Bob's most significant legacies will be the work he did to \nhelp the government make amends with the Japanese Americans who were \ninterned during World War II.\n  As a member of Congress, Bob was successful in passing legislation \nthat\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\noffered a formal apology from the government for the internment program \nand provided compensation to victims. This is a great legacy and it \nwill be well remembered.\n  Another of the areas in which Bob excelled is his knowledge and \nexpertise of Social Security as well as tax and trade policy. He had an \ninfluential place on the House Ways and Means Committee. His leadership \nthere will be missed.\n  Bob did what he did extraordinarily well. Throughout his career he \nshowed that he was a skilled politician as well as a great policymaker.\n  In addition to his duties as a House Member, he took on heading the \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee this past election cycle--a \nparticularly demanding and grueling position. Despite the enormous \nchallenges he faced, he did a superb job in guiding the committee \nthrough the elections.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career Bob Matsui proved to be \na dedicated public servant and his constituents considered themselves \nlucky to have his representation. I consider myself lucky to have known \nhim.\n  We will truly miss him.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing sympathies to the family of Representative Bob Matsui, who \npassed away over the weekend. I was shocked and saddened to hear the \nnews about our old friend.\n  While few Montanans may know Bob Matsui, he did embody one trait \nMontanans are familiar with. He was always willing to reach out to \nthose across the aisle to get the job done. He and I shared this work \nphilosophy on free trade especially. He was a tireless advocate in the \nCongress for America's trade agenda and was essential to the enactment \nof many historic international agreements.\n  We will surely miss his leadership on critical issues this next \nCongress, such as Social Security, one issue where the American people \nexpect and deserve a healthy, vigorous, and open debate. And for that \ntype of debate, you could certainly count on Bob Matsui to deliver.\n  Despite starting his life as a child unjustly interned by his own \nGovernment during World War II, Bob later rose to serve in that very \nGovernment at its highest echelons, as a Member of Congress. How proud \nhis family must have been to see this dynamic man elected to public \noffice, where he championed legislation to apologize for the internment \nof Japanese American families such as his. Overcoming obstacles and \ninjustices to rise to a level of public admiration, respect, and trust \nmay sound like a Hollywood story; to Bob, though, it was his life \nstory.\n  Wanda and I send our prayers and sympathies to his family; his wife \nDoris, son Brian, daughter-in-law Amy, and granddaughter Anna. He will \nbe greatly missed by us all.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I mark the \npassing of Representative Robert Matsui. In his quarter-century of \nservice representing California's Fifth District in the House of \nRepresentatives, Robert Matsui won the deep respect and affection of \neveryone who ever worked with him. When he first ran for Congress, in \n1978, he pledged to bring to the office ``a new form of \nstatesmanship.'' For more than 25 years, on a daily basis, he fulfilled \nthat promise, and his constituents honored him for it. This past \nNovember they returned him to the Congress for his fourteenth term, \nwith 71 percent of the vote.\n  Bob Matsui was a third-generation Japanese American. Like so many of \nus, he was part of a family that had come to the United States for the \ngreat opportunities this country offers, to build a better life for \ntheir children. Because Bob Matsui's family was Japanese-American, \nhowever, he and his parents were taken from their home in Sacramento in \n1942, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. They were interned \nfor more than three years at Tule Lake, in one of the ``relocation \ncenters'' specifically created for Japanese Americans. Bob Matsui \nhimself was very young at the time--barely 6 months old at the time of \ninternment, not yet 4 years old when the war ended but he felt deeply \nthe confusion and anguish of the adults around him. Yet he never lost \nfaith in his country and in himself. Inspired by the Kennedy \nadministration to enter public service, he dedicated his professional \nlife to serving and protecting the rights of all Americans, first as a \nlawyer and then as a public official. He served 8 years on the \nSacramento City Council before entering the Congress. But the \nexperience of his early childhood never left him, and in 1988 he was \ninstrumental in ensuring enactment of the Japanese American Redress \nAct, which offered recognition of the terrible, unconstitutional wrongs \ndone to Japanese Americans.\n  As a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bob Matsui \nworked unstintingly to assure the safety net for those most in need: \nchildren, seniors, the disabled, the poor and others who needed an \nadvocate. As the ranking minority member of the Social Security \nSubcommittee, he was one of the Social Security system's best-informed \nand most eloquent advocates in the Congress. No one understood better \nthan he the indispensable role that Social Security plays in assuring \nbasic standards of security and dignity to Americans when their working \nyears are over, and no one was more dedicated to keeping the system \nintact. Robert Matsui believed in the social insurance system that \nRockefeller created to care for retirees, but we as a society expanded \nto care for younger citizens in need, the disabled, widowed and \nsurvivors. He made politics personal, and because he cared so deeply \nfor others, he was able to be a real leader in this realm. His voice \nwill be sorely missed.\n  Congressman Matsui leaves a legacy of extraordinary integrity, \ncommitment and strength. It is fitting that in his memory Bob Matsui's \nfamily and friends have established The Matsui Foundation for Public \nService, which will carry forward the principles to which he dedicated \nhis life. I express my deepest sympathies to his wife, Doris Okada, his \nson Brian, daughter-in-law Amy, and granddaughter Anna, and thank them \nfor sharing him with us these many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S58-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S58-S59]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S. FOREST SERVICE PLANNING REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on December 22, 2004, The U.S. Department \nof Agriculture Forest Service published a final rule that will \nstreamline the process used by the Forest Service in revising forest \nmanagement plans.\n  I am pleased that the Department completed work on this important \nregulation. Ultimately, this rule will help local forest managers \nprovide future generations with healthier forests, cleaner air, cleaner \nwater and more abundant wildlife through more efficient management of \nour forests and grasslands. I am also pleased that this regulation \nbuilds upon one of the important lessons we learned during \nconsideration of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act in the 108th \nCongress: emphasis on actual forest management rather than \nadministrative paperwork. This will result in our forest managers being \nable to undertake important forest health projects rather than be \noverburdened with administrative processes.\n  Although the final planning rule is very comprehensive, I would like \nto point out several key components: It will for the first time \nincorporate implementation and outcome assessment into the forest \nplanning process, which will ensure that the forest planning process is \na dynamic one that can quickly adjust to changing conditions. As we \nlearned with the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, a dynamic management \nsystem allows the Forest Service to address the most time-sensitive \nforest health issues such as wildfire, invasive species, or disease. It \nincorporates meaningful public participation throughout the planning \nprocess, and ensures that the best available scientific information \nwill be used in decision making. It contains a process that will fairly \nand objectively allow us to see whether the Forest Service is getting \nthe job done. This reporting process will rely on independent reviews \nof Forest Service land management, will measure actual results against \nintended outcomes, and will incorporate an audit process to produce \npublicly available results. Finally, and most importantly, this rule \nwill streamline the planning process, which in turn will save the \nForest Service both time and money. The current forest plan takes \nbetween 5 and 7 years; under the new regulation the anticipated \ntimeframe is between 2 and 3 years. These\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\nsavings in both time and money will allow our land managers to more \nquickly complete on-the-ground projects to improve the health of our \nNation's forests.\n  For too long our Nation's forests have been imperiled because of a \nplanning process that is too cumbersome and takes too long, and usually \nresults in forest plans that are out-of-date by the time they are \nfinished. I applaud the efforts of the U.S. Forest Service to \nstreamline our Nation's forest planning process to reduce red tape and \npaperwork. I am hopeful that this final rule will provide further tools \nfor the U.S. Forest Service in appropriately managing our Nation's \nforests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S59-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S59]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAKING A COMMITMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we begin a new Congress, I am hopeful \nthat the Senate will consider and pass sensible gun safety legislation \nfor the benefit of our families, communities, and police officers. The \n109th Congress has the opportunity to act together on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass legislation that will make our streets safer for all \nAmericans.\n  In order to achieve a reduction in gun violence, we must commit \nourselves to enacting legislation that supports this goal. The 108th \nCongress missed numerous opportunities to have a positive impact on \nsafety in our communities across the nation. In the last Congress, we \ndid not close the gun show loophole, we did not reauthorize the 1994 \nassault weapons ban, and we failed to make needed improvements to the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System that would have made \nit more difficult for convicted criminals to gain access to guns.\n  Combating gun violence also requires a commitment to funding \neffective gun violence prevention and enforcement programs. \nUnfortunately, the Fiscal Year 2005 omnibus appropriations bill signed \nby the President in December eliminated much of the funding for one of \nthese programs, known as Project Safe Neighborhoods.\n  The Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative focuses on increased \nenforcement of existing gun laws, vigorous prosecution of crimes \ncommitted with handguns, and gun violence prevention education. The \nproject supports organizations working against gun violence and has \nprovided over $1 billion in funding to help prosecute gun crimes, hire \npersonnel, provide training, and assist with community outreach \nactivities. It is critical that we provide adequate resources to \nprograms like the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative in order to \nmore effectively address the gun violence epidemic in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to adequately fund \neffective gun violence reduction programs and enact sensible gun safety \nlegislation that will help to make our communities safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S59-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S59-S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      corporal jason scot clairday\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today, to honor a young man from \nArkansas who had a passion for life, a gift for bringing smiles to the \nfaces of those around him, and a sense of duty toward the country and \nthe people he would serve with honor. Jason Scot Clairday was a loving \nhusband, son, brother and friend. He was also a brave soldier who died \na hero, trying to bring freedom to a people he had never met in a \ncountry he had never known.\n  Cpl. Clairday was the type of person others were naturally drawn to. \nHe showed a genuine interest in their well-being and his gentle nature \nand infectious smile could brighten the darkest of moods. It was \napparent to everyone around him that he approached every day with a \nrare enthusiasm and love for life. The youngest of three boys was often \nfound playing sports or fishing and hunting along a nearby creek, \nenjoying the outdoors and the time spent with his friends and family. \nAfter moving to the small northern Arkansas town of Salem, he did what \nhe did best, made friends, and quickly distinguished himself by \nexcelling in high school athletics and becoming an active member of the \nFirst Baptist Church.\n  Cpl. Clairday enlisted in the United States Marine Corps shortly \nafter graduating from Salem High School in 2001. It was a decision he \nwas proud to make and members of the First Baptist Church remember the \npride with which he wore his Marine dress blues while attending \nservice. On July 30, just weeks prior to his deployment to Iraq, Cpl. \nClairday married the love of his life, Sarah. After his military \nservice, he looked forward to returning home to be with her, attending \nArkansas State University at Mountain Home, and building a family life. \nHe felt his experience in the Marine Corps was a way to better prepare \nhim for that future.\n  While in Iraq, Cpl. Clairday sometimes spoke with friends and loved \nones of liberating the war-torn country and making a better life for \nthe Iraqi people. While he never talked much about the war, he \npreferred instead to talk about the end of his enlistment in the \nspring, the future and coming home to be with his new wife and his \nfamily. Sarah last spoke with her husband on December 3rd, when he was \nscheduled to enter Fallujah for 10 days with his fellow marines in an \nattempt to bring greater stability to the city prior to the Iraqi \nnational elections slated for January. At the conclusion of the 10 \ndays, he was to be granted a 2-day leave. Tragically, he was killed by \nenemy fire on December 12th, a day before he was to leave the area.\n  At his memorial service in Camp, Arkansas, more than 600 people would \ncome to pay their respects to their fallen Arkansas soldier. At the \nconclusion of the service, Cpl. Clairday was buried with full military \nhonors. The flag that had draped his casket was presented to his young \nwidow with the Purple Heart that he had posthumously earned for his \ngallant service on behalf of a grateful nation.\n  When we think of Jason Clairday, we will remember that he gave \nhimself completely to every aspect of his life; his family, his \ncommunity, and his country. The legacy of his 21 years is a testament \nto who he was. The love, the humor, the selflessness, and the passion \nwith which he taught us to live our lives, will remain with us forever. \nMy thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Sarah, to his family, and \nto all those who knew and loved him.\n\n\n                       sergeant michael a. smith\n\n  Mr. President. Today, I humbly rise to pay tribute to the life of \nMichael A. Smith and to honor the sacrifice he made on behalf of a \ngrateful nation. Sergeant Smith was a friendly, easy-going young man \nwho had one of those rare personalities that allowed him to quickly \nmake friends with everyone he met. He was also a brave soldier, who \ndied a hero, fighting for the beliefs, the people and the country he \ncared for deeply.\n  Sgt. Smith was born and raised in the small, southern Arkansas town \nof Camden. There, he is remembered by those who knew him best as a good \nand gentle soul, who was always concerned about the welfare of others, \nand often went out of his way to help them whenever they were in need. \nUpon his 1999 graduation from Camden Fairview High School, Sgt. Smith \nset his sights on Southern Arkansas University Tech. Attending the \nuniversity would allow him to stay close to his family in Camden while \npursuing his interest in computers. To help pay his way through \ncollege, Sgt. Smith joined the Arkansas Army National Guard. Once he \ncompleted his military service, he had plans to return home and begin \nhis education.\n  Sgt. Smith became a member of the Guard's 39th Support Battalion. He \nwas later called up to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he was \nstationed at Camp Taji, about 16 miles northwest of downtown Baghdad. \nTo his comrades in the 39th, ``Smitty'' quickly became one of the guys; \na dedicated soldier who never complained, always did his duty, and \ncould be entrusted with the lives of those around him.\n  This November, family and friends of Sgt. Smith were excited with the \nnews that he would be taking his leave of service, and would possibly \nbe home before Thanksgiving. Tragically, 5 days before he was set to \nreturn to Arkansas, he was shot by a sniper while conducting patrols in \nBaghdad. As a result of the injury, he was flown to Landstuhl Army \nMedical Center in Germany and then to Walter Reed Medical Center in \nWashington, DC. His parents, Donald Ray and Deborah and his sister, \nLai, came to visit him in the hospital's intensive care unit. Although \nSgt. Smith never regained consciousness in his 2 weeks at Walter Reed, \nhis family was with him in his\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nfinal moments before he passed away on November 26.\n  At his memorial service in Camden, Sgt. Smith's coffin, surrounded by \nred, white, and blue flowers, was placed at the front of his high \nschool gymnasium. Throughout the service and in the aftermath of his \nson's passing, Donald Ray Smith described the outpouring of love from \nthe community as ``remarkable.'' It was a testament to the gratitude of \na community fully aware of the ultimate sacrifice paid by their fallen \nArkansas soldier in the name of freedom.\n  In the 24 years Michael Smith was with us, the impressions he made \nand the lives he touched will never be forgotten. Although he will be \ndeeply missed by us all, it is his selflessness, his courage, and his \nheart that we will remember when we think of him. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to Donald Ray, Deborah, Lai, and the rest of his family, \nfriends and loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S60-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SERGEANT JEREMY R. WRIGHT\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I speak today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude in honor of the life of a brave young man from \nShelbyville, IN. SGT Jeremy R. Wright, 31 years old, died on January 3 \nduring a patrol when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by a \nroadside bomb near Kabul. With his entire life before him, Jeremy \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 1992 graduate of Southwestern High School, Jeremy went on to attend \nWabash College where he won the NCAA Division III Great Lakes regional \ntitle in 1993 for distance running and graduated with honors as a \nchemistry major. Jeremy joined the Army in 2002, pursuing his long-time \nfascination with the military. Like most things Jeremy set his mind to, \nhe was successful in his military career, becoming a member of the \nelite Green Beret. Wabash spokesman Jim Amidon shared memories of the \nformer student with the Associated Press, saying his ``rare combination \nof intellect, courage, discipline and passion made him a naturally \nbrilliant distance runner . . . Those are the same qualities that made \nhim a fine soldier, too, the kind of officer our country needs in the \nmilitary.''\n  Jeremy was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Forces \nGroup, Fort Lewis, WA. This brave young soldier leaves behind his \nmother, Jackie Nickel and his father, Dale Wright.\n  Today, I join Jeremy's family, his friends and the entire Shelbyville \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJeremy, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Jeremy was known for his dedication to family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jeremy will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jeremy's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Jeremy's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jeremy R. Wright in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Jeremy's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jeremy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S60-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JERRY EHRENFREUND\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON.

In 1969, he \nbegan working for the Government Printing Office and worked on the \nstaff which compiled the Federal Register. Shortly thereafter he was \ndetailed to the Senate where he became the staff printer on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs and, later, the staff \nprinter for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. President, I recognize the fundraising efforts \nof the National Funeral Directors Association NFDA. The NFDA is the \nlargest funeral service organization in the world and is dedicated to \nfuneral service professionalism and quality.\n  The recent tsunami tragedy in South Asia has created a desperate need \nfor monetary donations to charitable organizations participating in the \nrelief effort. In a direct response to President Bush's nationwide \nappeal to assist tsunami victims, the NFDA has established the Funeral \nService Asian Relief Fund. The NFDA has asked its members, funeral \nservice suppliers, and domestic and international allied organizations \nto contribute to this endeavor. All contributions will be directed to \nan appropriate charitable organization.\n  The generosity and caring of the funeral service industry was \ndemonstrated during past humanitarian crises such as the September 11th \nterrorist attack and the Oklahoma City bombing. This new effort further \nproves the commitment of the NFDA to utilizing its resources for the \nbenefit of those experiencing great hardship. I commend the charity of \nthe members of the National Funeral Directors Association during this \ntime of need in South Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S60-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S60-S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HAYES CENTER AND VILLA HAYES\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, Hayes Center is in the \nsouthwestern part of my home state of Nebraska. Villa Hayes is in the \nsouthwestern part of the Republic of Paraguay. I rise today to \nhighlight the unusual connection between these two towns, named for the \nsame American President, which have forged strong ties despite the \ndistance between them. Thanks to a historian's efforts, these towns \nshare a bond that affirms the power of international friendship and the \nenduring legacy of President Rutherford B. Hayes.\n  In 1878, President Hayes arbitrated a boundary dispute between \nParaguay and Argentina, awarding new territory to Paraguay. The country \nnamed a department and a city, near the national capital of Asuncion, \nfor him. John Fatherley of Chicopee, MA, is a historian who studies \nPresident Hayes. During college studies in Paraguay, he learned about \nthe country's respect for our 19th President, whose decision in 1878 \nenlarged Paraguay by 30 percent.\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n  Mr. Fatherley has since sought to promote ties between Hayes Center \nand Villa Hayes. He has traveled to Nebraska to educate Hayes Center \nstudents about the President for whom their town is named. He has also \nbrought documents on President Hayes from the U.S. to Paraguay. In \nreturn, Villa Hayes presented Mr. Fatherley with its town seal, which \nhe donated to the Hayes Center Historical Society in Nebraska.\n  Nebraskans are fortunate to share this connection with our South \nAmerican friends and to have benefited over the years from Mr. \nFatherley's admirable efforts. He has promoted international \ncooperation between Nebraskans and Paraguayans and honored the memory \nof a president too often forgotten. In an age when the well-being of \nany nation depends on so many others, it is more important than ever to \nstrengthen the ties between Americans and our fellow human beings \naround the world.\n  I wish to express my admiration, therefore, for Mr. Fatherley and the \ntowns of Hayes Center, NE, and Villa Hayes, Paraguay. Mr. Fatherley's \nwork has revealed a small but important piece of common ground between \nthe United States and Paraguay. He has also taught students in a small \nNebraska community about the world beyond their walls. Both these \nthings are essential to continued American prosperity and leadership in \nthese challenging times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S61-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               150TH ANNIVERSARY OF WARRENSBURG, MISSOURI\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the citizens \nof Warrensburg, MO, in celebration of their 150th anniversary as an \nincorporated town.\n  The town of Warrensburg was incorporated in 1855 as a community proud \nof its heritage and loyal to the ideals, traditions and institutions \nthat have contributed to the success and growth of the city.\n  Warrensburg prides itself as being a self-contained city with a \nvibrant employment base, excellent education system, active cultural \nscene, and many civic events and activities for residents to enjoy.\n  Warrensburg serves as the county seat for Johnson County, and is \ncurrently home to 17,075 residents who are served by an excellent \nschool system which has been accredited with Distinction in Performance \nby the Missouri State Board of Education. The Warrensburg School System \nhas also been named a Gold Medal School, ranking them among the \nNation's top 18 percent of schools.\n  The community is also the proud home of Central Missouri State \nUniversity, which has provided quality postsecondary education for more \nthan 130 years. This comprehensive university annually serves nearly \n14,000 students from all over the State, Nation, and world, and offers \nmore than 150 areas of study at the undergraduate and graduate levels.\n  The city's heartland work ethic and community pride make it a great \nplace to do business, with several local companies which have grown \ninto national and international prominence aided by the exceptional \nworkforce and affordable business climate. Warrensburg is home of \nEnerSys, G.E. Transportation Systems, ThyssenKrupp Stahl Company, \nSwisher Mower, Bomag Paving Products, and the world headquarters of \nboth Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity and Carlyle Van Lines.\n  Warrensburg is also proud of its rich diversity, with over 35 \ndifferent languages spoken within the Warrensburg School District, and \nover 30 faith communities gathering for worship and service each week.\n  Warrensburg is also the boyhood home of John William ``Blind'' Boone, \nthe legendary ragtime composer and piano player; home of the first \ngasoline-powered, push lawn mower invented by Leonard Goodall; the \noriginal self-propelled mower and the zero-turning radius riding lawn \nmower both invented by Max Swisher, who remains a Warrensburg resident; \nand Errett Lobban Cord, inventor of Cord Automobiles.\n  Finally, Warrensburg is also the hometown of Old Drum, the hunting \ndog for which Senator George Graham Vest's ``Eulogy on the Dog'' was \ndelivered, coining the idea that ``man's best friend is his dog.''\n  I am honored to share Warrensburg's proud history and its \nsesquicentennial anniversary as a town with my colleagues, and I wish \nthe people of Warrensburg all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S61-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOHN SACKETT RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, after years of faithful service and \ndedication to his work at Argonne National Lab, a friend and respected \nIdahoan, John Sackett, is retiring to pursue a quieter life with his \nfamily. John served in a number of positions in the Lab over the past \n34 years, the most recent being director or Argonne National Lab West \nlocated at Idaho National Environment and Engineering Lab in southeast \nIdaho. He has earned international recognition and respect for his work \nin the areas of nuclear safety and advanced reactor design.\n  I have had the privilege of working with John the entire time I have \nserved in Congress. Over the past 12 years, I have witnessed his steady \nleadership, commitment to the goals of the Lab and DOE. John and I \nshare a fervent belief in the role of nuclear energy and research in \neconomic, technological, security and energy sectors.\n  Perhaps what is most remarkable is that despite the tremendous \ndemands of his work at Argonne, he finds the time to give back to his \ncommunity, serving on numerous medical and economic boards and councils \nin eastern Idaho as well as on the advisory boards of both the \nUniversity of Idaho and Idaho State University.\n  Argonne National Lab's loss is certainly John's family's gain, as \nwell as the gain of any organization in which he decides to invest his \nretirement energy. He has my best wishes in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S61-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S61-S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING DAVID L. DAY ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor David L. \nDay on his retirement from 35 years of public service as the Deputy \nEngineer for Programs and Project Management with the Nashville \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During his 35 years of Federal \nservice, 33 with the Corps of Engineers, from 1969 to present, Dave \nheld a clear vision and achieved a remarkable string of successes in \nfurthering the mission of the Nashville District and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. Dave has earned a reputation of being honest, fair, \nand professional with his coworkers. He began his career with the \nNashville District in October 1998 when he was selected as the Deputy \nDistrict Engineer for Programs and Project Management and is the senior \ncivilian for the district with more than 800 employees and a $140 \nmillion annual operating budget. The district provides Federal \nengineering, planning, construction, project management, real estate, \nand environmental services. His responsibilities included budgeting, \nplanning, and executing Civil Works and Interagency and International \nServices programs under the project management business process.\n  Dave Day has distinguished himself as a leader in many ways during \nhis tenure. He continuously has encouraged a culture of professional \nimprovement, fostering team leadership and activity to meet district \ngoals, while at the same time, taking care of the people with whom he \nworks. Dave had a strong, positive impact on the morale of the \ndistrict's Planning, Programs, and Project Management Division \nemployees as well as Project Delivery Team members. He always made time \nto recognize deserving individuals or discuss any problem that arose. \nHis genuine concern for every member of his team was reflected in his \nmany messages, letters, awards, and hallway greetings.\n  Dave oversaw the operation of the Account Executive Program, which \nthe Nashville District uses to establish and strengthen relationships \nwith customers and find ways to meet regional and national needs. He \nalso led the effort to partner, both formally and informally, with the \nStates of Tennessee and Kentucky, Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, \nSoutheastern Power Association, SEPA, Tennessee River Valley Authority, \nTRVA, Tenn-Tom Waterways, Metro Nashville, and other\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\ngovernmental and industry groups to maximize program and project \naccomplishments. Dave has been one of the strongest, most consistent \ndriving forces behind the plan for the new $320,000,000 lock on the \nTennessee River at Chickamauga Dam. By bringing a TVA environmental \nimpact statement up to Corps standards, he helped advance the \nauthorization of and funding for this new lock. He also worked hard \nwith TVA, SEPA, and SEPA's power customers to allow SEPA customers to \nfund rehabilitation of hydropower facilities in the Cumberland River \nbasin, a first in the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division.\n  I extend warm congratulations to Dave Day on his retirement. He will \nbe missed, but I know the citizens of Tennessee join me in wishing him \nall the best as he moves forward in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S62-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND GLORIA L. CHERRY'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \nReverend Gloria L. Cherry upon her retirement. Pastor Cherry has served \nthe state of Delaware for countless years and her leadership over that \nspan of time has won her the respect and gratitude of our entire state. \nShe has been, and remains, a trusted friend.\n  Pastor Cherry was born in New Church, VA, on July 3, 1935, to the \nlate Marvin and Bertha Trader. She came to Delaware at a young age and \nattended Phillip C. Showell Elementary in Selbyville, DE, and received \nher high school education from Howard High in Wilmington, DE.\n  Pastor Cherry is the wife of the late Christopher H. Cherry. The two \nmet and were married in Delaware on May 1, 1976. Gloria is the proud \nand beloved mother of five children, Larry Robinson, Garry Robinson, \nAddie Merchant, Bertha Hardman and Lorri Jamison; eight grandchildren, \nRyan, Rodney and David Robinson, Willie Hardman, III, Christopher and \nBobbie Merchant and Winston, Shavon and Dionna Jamison and one great \ngrandson, Ryan Robinson, Jr.\n  Pastor Cherry was ordained in Spain in 1978 where she received her \ncalling from God. She studied under Pastor Eliah Holland and became a \nlicensed minister in 1980. In 1983, she founded the First United Church \nof Gospel Ministries which in 2004 was renamed the Healing Wings \nChristian Center.\n  Pastor Cherry's service has extended far beyond the church and well \ninto the community. Through the First United Church of Gospel \nMinistries, she, along with a group of concerned citizens met to \ndiscuss the challenges facing young people such as teenage pregnancy, \nsubstance abuse and discipline issues. As a result, the Because We \nCare, Inc. community-based organization was formed. Through a grant \nfrom the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their \nFamilies, Pastor Cherry founded the Because We Care Alternative Middle \nSchool in Dover, DE. The Because We Care Alternative Middle School is a \nnonprofit agency that provides continuing education to Kent County \nmiddle school children who have been expelled or are on the verge of \nexpulsion. The Because We Care Alternative Middle School serves the \nfive school districts located within Kent County, DE. The program \nfocuses on learning skills, life skills, social competencies and \nsubstance abuse/resistance training. Her successes with young people \nare hailed by Superintendents, Principals and parents alike.\n  By soliciting volunteers to act as caseworkers, mentors and activity \naides, the youth are exposed to one-on-one relationships that routinely \ndevelop into long-time friendships. Pastor Cherry's philosophy is that \nchildren do not have discipline problems; they have `love' problems. \nToo many of them live in homes bereft of love. Pastor Cherry believes \nthat providing a stable learning atmosphere along with the love that \nevery child needs, children can make the turn to a more positive life \nwith their families.\n  In 1999, Pastor Cherry envisioned a homeless shelter for youths as a \nmeans of respite for parents and guardians who are struggling with \nemployment and housing for their families. Through additional grants, \ndonations, and blood, sweat and tears, her vision came to fruition \nthrough the building and leasing of `Glory Hall.' Glory Hall is a \ndormitory style living facility that houses 18 youths. The Hall is \nequipped with a classroom, full-service kitchen and cafeteria, activity \narea and bedrooms--all built through Pastor Cherry's devotion and love \nfor young people. This year, Glory Hall has been leased to an \norganization called South West Keys, a Texas based organization with \nagencies throughout the United States. This organization provides \nshelter for immigrant children until they are reunited with family \nmembers here in the United States.\n  Through Reverend Cherry's tireless efforts, she has made a profound \ndifference in the lives of thousands of Delawareans. Upon her \nretirement, she will leave behind a legacy of commitment to public \nservice for both her children and grandchildren and for the rest of us \nto follow. I thank her for the friendship that we share and for the \ninspiration that she provides through a lifetime of caring. Although \nPastor Cherry is ending this particular chapter of her life, she will \nopen the next chapter by continuing to crusade for those of us less \nfortunate. On behalf of all Delawareans, I congratulate her on a truly \nremarkable and distinguished career and extend to her my very best \nwishes for every success in the future. I wish her and her family only \nthe very best in all that lies ahead for each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S62-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S62-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/06/senate-section/article/S62-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND \n  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION EXTENDING THE AGREEMENT ON \n            MUTUAL FISHERIES RELATIONS OF MAY 31, 1999--PM 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non Foreign Relations; and Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an \nAgreement between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the Russian Federation extending the Agreement \nBetween the Government of the United States and the Government of the \nRussian Federation on Mutual Fisheries Relations of May 31, 1999, with \nannex, as extended (the ``Mutual Fisheries Agreement'').
