Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. President, shortly, we will resume consideration of John Roberts \nto be Chief Justice of the United States. Last night, we locked in a \nconsent which provides for the final vote on confirmation. That vote \nwill occur at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday.\n  Today, we have controlled time to allow Senators to come to the \nChamber to give their statements on this extremely important \nnomination. As usual, we will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the \nweekly policy luncheons.\n  As mentioned last night, the Appropriations Committee is expected to \nreport the Defense appropriations bill tomorrow. We expect the Senate \nto begin consideration of that bill on Thursday following the Roberts \nnomination.\n  I also remind my colleagues that we need to pass a continuing \nresolution by the close of business this week.\n  Finally, I once again alert all Members that we are working under a \nvery compressed schedule. Next week, we will need to accommodate the \nRosh Hashanah holiday, and therefore we will be stacking rollcall votes \nfor midweek. Given this schedule, it is extremely important that we use \nour time wisely, both this week and obviously next week as well. \nTherefore, Members should anticipate busy sessions Thursday and Friday \nof this week. Friday will be a working day as we make progress on the \nDefense appropriations bill. Senators should plan their schedules \naccordingly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Disaster Assistance\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is very clear from Hurricane Rita and \nHurricane Katrina that America is now learning how to be prepared for \ndisasters. Many more positive things happened as a result of the threat \nof Hurricane Rita than happened just a few weeks before in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. We now know that it is not a question of \npointing the finger of blame, but those of us in leadership in \nWashington need to get to the bottom of this--not so we can decide who \nwas wrong in days gone by but, frankly, to make sure this doesn't \nhappen again.\n  The American people do not want to know who wins the game of \n``gotcha'' here; they want to know if America is ready for the next \ndisaster. We were clearly not prepared for Hurricane Katrina. The \nscenes we all saw night and day on television of helpless victims in \nNew Orleans and other communities remind us over and over again that \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency was not prepared for this \nchallenge. We came to that realization when Mr. Brown was asked to \nleave FEMA. I believe that was the right decision.\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\n  But I was stunned to learn that he is still on the payroll. It is \nhard to imagine that this man who was at FEMA with such a thin resume \nand such limited experiences dealing with disasters was asked to leave \nand be replaced and then continues on as a consultant to FEMA. He is \ngoing to be scrutinized today by a panel in the House of \nRepresentatives that may ask him some questions about what he did. The \nfirst thing they should ask him is by what standard is he still on the \nFederal payroll. Why is this man still being paid by the Federal \nGovernment? The administration clearly cannot investigate itself when \nit comes to Hurricane Katrina, and this decision to keep Mr. Brown on \nthe payroll reflects on what he did in the past but, more importantly, \nwhat he might do in the future. He doesn't have the skill set needed \nfor the disasters that could come as soon as tomorrow. Why is he still \nthere? I don't believe this is the right way to approach a natural \ndisaster or a terrorist disaster. We need to put people in place who \nunderstand how to deal with it.\n  I believe the President was right in removing Mr. Brown and putting \nin his place Commander Allen from the Coast Guard. I have met with him \nin New Orleans. He is a man who apparently takes control of the \nsituation and does it very well, and I believe we should give him a \nchance to lead--to make certain that we handle that past disaster but \nalso that we are prepared for the next one.\n  But this is a recurring problem. It isn't just a question of Michael \nBrown being replaced by Commander Allen. It is a question of whether \nthere are people in other key spots in this Government who do not have \nthe qualifications to lead.\n  Make no mistake about it: Every President brings in people of their \nown political persuasion and friendship. This happened from time \nimmemorial. It is understandable that sometimes these people do an \nexcellent job. I can recall when President Clinton suggested that Jamie \nLee Witt from Arkansas, his emergency management director, was coming \nup to run FEMA in Washington. I want to tell you that when I heard \nthat, I thought: Here we go again, an old political friend is going to \ncome up here and run this important agency. This could be awful. I am \nhappy to report I was wrong. Jamie Lee Witt did an extraordinary job. I \nnever heard a word of criticism about the job he did for 8 years in \nWashington. He had skills, extraordinary skills, and brought them to \nthe job. But we need at this moment in time to ask critical questions \nas to whether there are men and women in this administration such as \nMichael Brown who are not prepared to deal with the next challenge to \nthe United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nTime magazine of this week entitled ``How Many More Mike Browns Are Out \nThere?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From TIME Magazine, Sep. 25, 2005]\n\n                How Many More Mike Browns Are Out There?\n\n           (By Mark Thompson, Karen Tumulty, and Mike Allen)\n\n       In presidential politics, the victor always gets the \n     spoils, and chief among them is the vast warren of offices \n     that make up the federal bureaucracy. Historically, the U.S. \n     public has never paid much attention to the people the \n     President chooses to sit behind those thousands of desks. A \n     benign cronyism is more or less presumed, with old friends \n     and big donors getting comfortable positions and impressive \n     titles, and with few real consequences for the nation.\n       But then came Michael Brown. When President Bush's former \n     point man on disasters was discovered to have more expertise \n     about the rules of Arabian horse competition than about the \n     management of a catastrophe, it was a reminder that the \n     competence of government officials who are not household \n     names can have a life or death impact. The Brown debacle has \n     raised pointed questions about whether political connections, \n     not qualifications, have helped an unusually high number of \n     Bush appointees land vitally important jobs in the Federal \n     Government.\n       The Bush Administration didn't invent cronyism; John F. \n     Kennedy turned the Justice Department over to his brother, \n     while Bill Clinton gave his most ambitious domestic policy \n     initiative to his wife. Jimmy Carter made his old friend Bert \n     Lance his budget director, only to see him hauled in front of \n     the Senate to answer questions on his past banking practices \n     in Georgia, and George H.W. Bush deposited so many friends at \n     the Commerce Department that the agency was known internally \n     as ``Bush Gardens.'' The difference is that this Bush \n     Administration had a plan from day one for remakmg the \n     bureaucracy, and has done so with greater success.\n       As far back as the Florida recount, soon-to-be Vice \n     President Dick Cheney was poring over organizational charts \n     of the government with an eye toward stocking it with people \n     sympathetic to the incoming Administration. Clay Johnson III, \n     Bush's former Yale roommate and the Administration's chief \n     architect of personnel, recalls preparing for the inner \n     circle's first trip from Austin, Texas, to Washington: ``We \n     were standing there getting ready to get on a plane, \n     looking at each other like: Can you believe what we're \n     getting ready to do?''\n       The Office of Personnel Management's Plum Book, published \n     at the start of each presidential Administration, shows that \n     there are more than 3,000 positions a President can fill \n     without consideration for civil service rules. And Bush has \n     gone further than most Presidents to put political stalwarts \n     in some of the most important government jobs you've never \n     heard of, and to give them genuine power over the \n     bureaucracy. ``These folks are really good at using the \n     instruments of government to promote the President's \n     political agenda,'' says Paul Light, a professor of public \n     service at New York University and a well-known expert on the \n     machinery of government. ``And I think that takes you well \n     into the gray zone where few Presidents have dared to go in \n     the past. It's the coordination and centralization that's \n     important here.''\n       The White House makes no apologies for organizing \n     government in a way that makes it easier to carry out Bush's \n     agenda. Johnson says the centralization is ``very \n     intentional, and it starts with the people you pick . . . \n     They're there to implement the President's priorities.'' \n     Johnson asserts that appointees are chosen on merit, with \n     political credentials used only as a tie breaker between \n     qualified people. ``Everybody knows somebody,'' he says. \n     ``Were they appointed because they knew somebody? No. What we \n     focused on is: Does the government work, and can it be caused \n     to work better and more responsibly? . . . We want the \n     programs to work.'' But across the government, some \n     experienced civil servants say they are being shut out of the \n     decision making at their agencies. ``It depresses people, \n     right down to the level of a clerk-typist,'' says Leo Bosner, \n     head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) \n     largest union. ``The senior to mid-level managers have really \n     been pushed into a corner career-wise.''\n       Some of the appointments are raising serious concerns in \n     the agencies themselves and on Capitol Hill about the \n     competence and independence of agencies that the country \n     relies on to keep us safe, healthy and secure. Internal e-\n     mail messages obtained by TIME show that scientists' drug-\n     safety decisions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     are being second-guessed by a 33-year-old doctor turned stock \n     picker. At the Office of Management and Budget, an ex-\n     lobbyist with minimal purchasing experience oversaw $300 \n     billion in spending, until his arrest last week. At the \n     Department of Homeland Security, an agency the Administration \n     initially resisted, a well-connected White House aide with \n     minimal experience is poised to take over what many consider \n     the single most crucial post in ensuring that terrorists do \n     not enter the country again. And who is acting as watchdog at \n     every federal agency? A corps of inspectors general who may \n     be increasingly chosen more for their political credentials \n     than their investigative ones.\n       Nowhere in the federal bureaucracy is it more important to \n     insulate government experts from the influences of politics \n     and special interests than at the Food and Drug \n     Administration, the agency charged with assuring the safety \n     of everything from new vaccines and dietary supplements to \n     animal feed and hair dye. That is why many within the \n     department, as well as in the broader scientific \n     community, were startled when, in July, Scott Gottlieb was \n     named deputy commissioner for medical and scientific \n     affairs, one of three deputies in the agency's second-\n     ranked post at FDA.\n       His official FDA biography notes that Gottlieb, 33, who got \n     his medical degree at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, did a \n     previous stint providing policy advice at the agency, as well \n     as at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and was \n     a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative \n     think tank. What the bio omits is that his most recent job \n     was as editor of a popular Wall Street newsletter, the \n     Forbes/Gottlieb Medical Technology Investor, in which he \n     offered such tips as ``Three Biotech Stocks to Buy Now.'' In \n     declaring Gottlieb a ``noted authority'' who had written more \n     than 300 policy and medical articles, the biography neglects \n     the fact that many of those articles criticized the FDA for \n     being too slow to approve new drugs and too quick to issue \n     warning letters when it suspects ones already on the market \n     might be unsafe. FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford, who \n     resigned suddenly and without explanation last Friday, wrote \n     in response to e-mailed questions that Gottlieb is ``talented \n     and smart, and I am delighted to have been able to recruit \n     him back to the agency to help me fulfill our public-health \n     goals.'' But others, including Jimmy Carter-era FDA \n     Commissioner Donald Kennedy, a former Stanford University \n     president and now executive editor-in-chief\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\n     of the journal Science, say Gottlieb breaks the mold of \n     appointees at that level who are generally career FDA \n     scientists or experts well known in their field. ``The \n     appointment comes out of nowhere. I've never seen anything \n     like that,'' says Kennedy.\n       Gottlieb's financial ties to the drug industry were at one \n     time quite extensive. Upon taking his new job, he recused \n     himself for up to a year from any deliberations involving \n     nine companies that are regulated by the FDA and ``where a \n     reasonable person would question my impartiality in the \n     matter.'' Among them are Eli Lilly, Roche and Proctor & \n     Gamble, according to his Aug. 5 ``Disqualification Statement \n     Regarding Former Clients,'' a copy of which was obtained by \n     TIME. Gottlieb, though, insists that his role at the agency \n     is limited to shaping broad policies, such as improving \n     communication between the FDA, doctors and patients, and \n     developing a strategy for dealing with pandemics of such \n     diseases as flu, West Nile virus and SARS.\n       Would he ever be involved in determining whether an \n     individual drug should be on the market? ``Of course not,'' \n     Gottlieb told TIME. ``Not only wouldn't I be involved in that \n     . . . But I would not be in a situation where I would be \n     adjudicating the scientific or medical expertise of the [FDA] \n     on a review matter. That's not my role. It's not my \n     expertise. We defer to the career staff to make scientific \n     and medical decisions.''\n       Behind the scenes, however, Gottlieb has shown an interest \n     in precisely those kinds of deliberations. One instance took \n     place on Sept. 15, when the FDA decided to stop the trial of \n     a drug for multiple sclerosis during which three people \n     had developed an unusual disorder in which their bodies \n     eliminated their blood platelets and one died of \n     intracerebral bleeding as a result. In an e-mail obtained \n     by TIME, Gottlieb speculated that the complication might \n     have been the result of the disease and not the drug. \n     ``Just seems like an overreaction to place a clinical \n     hold'' on the trial, he wrote. An FDA scientist rejected \n     his analysis and replied that the complication ``seems \n     very clearly a drug-related event.'' Two days prior, when \n     word broke that the FDA had sent a ``non-approvable'' \n     letter to Pfizer Inc., formally rejecting its Oporia drug \n     for osteoporosis, senior officials at the FDA's Center for \n     Drug Evaluation and Research received copies of an e-mail \n     from Gottlieb expressing his surprise that what he thought \n     would be a routine approval had been turned down. Gottlieb \n     asked for an explanation.\n       Gottlieb defends his e-mails, which were circulated widely \n     at the FDA. ``Part of my job is to ask questions both so I \n     understand how the agency works, and how it reaches its \n     decisions,'' he told TIME. However, a scientist at the agency \n     said they ``really confirmed people's worst fears that he was \n     only going to be happy if we were acting in a way that would \n     make the pharmaceutical industry happy.''\n       The Oporia decision gave Pfizer plenty of reason to be \n     unhappy: the drug had been expected to produce $1 billion a \n     year in sales for the company. Pfizer's stock fell 1.4% the \n     day the rejection was announced. The FDA has not revealed why \n     it rejected the drug, and Pfizer has said it is ``considering \n     various courses of action'' that might resuscitate its \n     application for approval.\n       Health experts note that Gottlieb's appointment comes at a \n     time of increased tension between the agency and drug \n     companies, which are concerned that new drugs will have a \n     more difficult time making it onto the market in the wake of \n     the type of safety problems that persuaded Merck to pull its \n     best-selling painkiller Vioxx from the market last year. The \n     agency's independence has also come under question, most \n     recently with its decision last month to prevent the \n     emergency contraceptive known as Plan B from being sold over \n     the counter, after an FDA advisory panel recommended it could \n     be. That Gottlieb sits at the second tier of the agency, \n     critics say, sends anything but a reassuring signal.\n       David Safavian didn't have much hands-on experience in \n     government contracting when the Bush Administration tapped \n     him in 2003 to be its chief procurement officer. A law-school \n     internship helping the Pentagon buy helicopters was about the \n     extent of it. Yet as administrator of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy, Safavian, 38, was placed in charge of the \n     $300 billion the government spends each year on everything \n     from paper clips to nuclear submarines, as well as the $62 \n     billion already earmarked for Hurricane Katrina recovery \n     efforts. It was his job to ensure that the government got the \n     most for its money and that competition for federal \n     contracts--among companies as well as between government \n     workers and private contractors--was fair. It was his job \n     until he resigned on Sept. 16 and was subsequently arrested \n     and charged with lying and obstructing a criminal \n     investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff's \n     dealings with the Federal Government.\n       Safavian spent the bulk of his pregovernment career as a \n     lobbyist, and his nomination to a top oversight position \n     stunned the tightly knit federal procurement community. A \n     dozen procurement experts interviewed by TIME said he was the \n     most unqualified person to hold the job since its creation in \n     1974. Most of those who held the post before Safavian were \n     well-versed in the arcane world of federal contracts. \n     ``Safavian is a good example of a person who had great party \n     credentials but no substantive credentials,'' says Danielle \n     Brian, executive director of the Project on Government \n     Oversight, a nonprofit Washington watchdog group. ``It's one \n     of the most powerful positions in terms of impacting what the \n     government does, and the kind of job--like FEMA director--\n     that needs to be filled by a professional.'' Nevertheless, \n     Safavian's April 2004 confirmation hearing before the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee (attended by only five of the \n     panel's 17 members) lasted just 67 minutes, and not a single \n     question was asked about his qualifications.\n       The committee did hold up Safavian's confirmation for a \n     year, in part because of concerns about work his lobbying \n     firm, Janus-Merritt Strategies, had done that he was required \n     to divulge to the panel but failed to. The firm's filings \n     showed that it represented two men suspected of links to \n     terrorism (Safavian said one of the men was ``erroneously \n     listed,'' and the other's omission was an ``inadvertent \n     error'') as well as two suspect African regimes. Ultimately, \n     the committee and the full Senate unanimously approved \n     Safavian for the post.\n       His political clout, federal procurement experts say \n     privately, came from his late-1990s lobbying partnership with \n     Grover Norquist, now head of Americans for Tax Reform and a \n     close ally of the Bush Administration. Norquist is an antitax \n     advocate who once famously declared that his goal was to \n     shrink the Federal Government so he could ``drag it into the \n     bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.'' As the U.S. \n     procurement czar, Safavian was pushing in that direction by \n     seeking to shift government work to private contractors, \n     contending it was cheaper. Federal procurement insiders say \n     his relationship with Norquist gave Safavian the edge in \n     snaring the procurement post. But Norquist has ``no memory'' \n     of urging the Administration to put Safavian in the post, \n     says an associate speaking on Norquist's behalf. A White \n     House official said Norquist ``didn't influence the \n     decision.'' Clay Johnson, who was designated by the White \n     House to answer all of TIME's questions about administration \n     staffing issues and who oversaw the procurement post, says \n     Safavian was ``by far the most qualified person'' for the \n     job. Perhaps it also didn't hurt that Safavian's wife \n     Jennifer works as a lawyer for the House Government Reform \n     Committee, which oversees federal contracting.\n       In addition, Safavian had worked at a law firm in the mid-\n     '90s with Jack Abramoff, one of the capital's highest-paid \n     lobbyists, a top G.O.P. fund raiser and a close friend of \n     House majority leader Tom DeLay. Abramoff was indicted last \n     month on unrelated fraud and conspiracy charges. In 2002, \n     Abramoff invited Safavian on a weeklong golf outing to \n     Scotland's famed St. Andrews course (as Abramoff had done \n     with DeLay in 2000). Seven months after the trip, an \n     anonymous call to a government hotline said lobbyists had \n     picked up the tab for the jaunt. That wasn't true; \n     Safavian paid $3,100 for the trip. But the government \n     alleges that he lied when he repeatedly told investigators \n     that Abramoff had no business dealings with the General \n     Services Administration, where Safavian worked at the \n     time. Prosecutors alleged last week, however, that \n     Safavian worked closely with Abramoff--identified only as \n     ``Lobbyist A'' in the criminal complaint against \n     Safavian--to give Abramoff an inside track in his efforts \n     to acquire control of two pieces of federal property in \n     the Washington area. Safavian, who is free without bail, \n     declined to be interviewed for this story. His attorney, \n     Barbara Van Gelder, said the government is trying to \n     pressure her client to help in its probe of Abramoff. \n     ``This is a creative use of the criminal code to secure \n     his cooperation,'' she said.\n       Three days after the Sept. 12 resignation of FEMA's Michael \n     Brown, Julie Myers, the Bush Administration's nominee to head \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came before the \n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \n     The session did not go well. ``I think we ought to have a \n     meeting with [Homeland Security Secretary] Mike Chertoff,'' \n     Ohio Republican George Voinovich told Myers. ``I'd really \n     like to have him spend some time with us, telling us \n     personally why he thinks you're qualified for the job. \n     Because based on the resume, I don't think you are.''\n       Immigration and Customs Enforcement is one of 22 agencies \n     operating under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland \n     Security, but its function goes to the heart of why the \n     department was created: to prevent terrorists from slipping \n     into the U.S. If that weren't enough, the head once must also \n     contend with money launderers, drug smugglers, illegal-arms \n     merchants and the vast responsibility that comes with \n     managing 20,000 government employees and a $4 billion budget. \n     Expectations were high that whoever was appointed to fill the \n     job would be, in the words of Michael Greenberger, head of \n     the University of Maryland's Center for Health and Homeland \n     Security, ``a very high-powered, well-recognized intelligence \n     manager. ``\n       Instead the Administration nominated Myers, 36, currently a \n     special assistant handling personnel issues for Bush. She has \n     experience in law enforcement management, including jobs in \n     the White House and the Commerce, Justice and Treasury \n     departments, but she barely meets the five-year minimum \n     required by law. Her most significant responsibility has been \n     as Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the Commerce \n     Department, where, she told Senators, she supervised 170 \n     employees and a $25 million budget.\n       Myers may appear short on qualifications, but she has \n     plenty of connections. She\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\n     worked briefly for Chertoff as his chief of staff at the \n     Justice Department's criminal division, and two days after \n     her hearing, she married Chertoff's current chief of staff, \n     John Wood. Her uncle is Air Force General Richard Myers, \n     the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Julie \n     Myers was on her honeymoon last week and was unavailable \n     to comment on the questions about her qualifications \n     raised by the Senate. A representative referred TIME to \n     people who had worked with her, one of whom was Stuart \n     Levey, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for \n     Terrorism and Financial Crime. ``She was great, and she \n     impressed everyone around her in all these jobs,'' he \n     said. ``She's very efficient, and she's assertive and \n     strong and smart, and I think she's wonderful.''\n       To critics, Myers' appointment is a symptom of deeper ills \n     in the Homeland Security Department, a huge new bureaucracy \n     that the Bush Administration resisted creating. Among those \n     problems, they say, is a tendency on the part of the \n     Administration's political appointees to discard in-house \n     expertise, particularly when it could lead to additional \n     government regulation of industry. For instance, when \n     Congress passed the intelligence reform bill last year, it \n     gave the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) a \n     deadline of April 1, 2005, to come up with plans to assess \n     the threat to various forms of shipping and transportation--\n     including rail, mass transit, highways and pipelines--and \n     make specific proposals for strengthening security. Two \n     former high-ranking Homeland Security officials tell TIME \n     that the plans were nearly complete and had been put into \n     thick binders in early April for final review when Deputy \n     Secretary Michael Jackson abruptly reassigned that \n     responsibility to the agency's policy shop. Jackson was \n     worried that presenting Congress with such detailed proposals \n     would only invite it to return later and demand to know why \n     Homeland Security had not carried them out. ``If we put this \n     out there, this is what we're going to be held to,'' says one \n     of the two officials, characterizing Jackson's stance. Nearly \n     six months after Congress's deadline, in the wake of the \n     summer's subway bombings in London, TSA spokeswoman Amy Von \n     Walter says the agency is in the process of declassifying the \n     document and expects to post a short summary on its website \n     soon.\n       In the meantime, Myers' nomination could be in trouble. \n     Voinovich says his concerns were satisfied after a 35-minute \n     call with Chertoff, in which the Homeland Security Secretary \n     argued forcefully on Myers' behalf. But other senators are \n     raising questions, and Democrats have seized on Myers' \n     appointment as an example of the Bush Administration's \n     preference for political allies over experience.\n       The Post-Watergate law creating the position of inspector \n     general (IG) states that the federal watchdogs must be hired \n     ``without regard to political affiliation,'' on the basis of \n     their ability in such disciplines as accounting, auditing and \n     investigating. It may not sound like the most exciting job, \n     but the 57 inspectors general in the Federal Government can \n     be the last line of defense against fraud and abuse. Because \n     their primary duty is to ask nosy questions, their \n     independence is crucial.\n       But critics say some of the Bush IGs have been too cozy \n     with the Administration. ``The IGs have become more political \n     over the years, and it seems to have accelerated,'' said A. \n     Ernest Fitzgerald, who has been battling the Defense \n     Department since his 1969 discovery of $2 billion in cost \n     overruns on a cargo plane, and who, at 79, still works as \n     a civilian Air Force manager. A study by Representative \n     Henry Waxman of California, the top Democrat on the House \n     Government Reform Committee, found that more than 60% of \n     the IGs nominated by the Bush Administration had political \n     experience and less than 20% had auditing experience--\n     almost the obverse of those measures during the Clinton \n     Administration. About half the current IGs are holdovers \n     from Clinton.\n       Johnson says political connections may be a thumb on the \n     scale between two candidates with equal credentials, but \n     rarely are they the overriding factor in a personnel \n     decision. Speaking of all such appointments, not just the \n     IGs, he said, ``I am aware of one or two situations where \n     politics carried the day and the person was not in the job a \n     year later.''\n       Still, several of the President's IGs fit comfortably into \n     the friends-and family category. Until recently, the most \n     famous Bush inspector general was Janet Rehnquist, a daughter \n     of the late Chief Justice. Rehnquist had been a lawyer for \n     the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and \n     worked in the counsel's office during George H.W. Bush's \n     presidency before becoming an IG at the Department of Health \n     and Human Services. In that sense, she was qualified for the \n     job. But a scathing report by the Government Accountability \n     Office asserted that she had ``created the perception that \n     she lacked appropriate independence in certain situations'' \n     and had ``compromised her ability to serve as an effective \n     leader.'' Rehnquist also faced questions about travel that \n     included sightseeing and free time, her decision to delay an \n     audit of the Florida pension system at the request of the \n     President's brother, Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, and the \n     unauthorized gun she kept in her office. She resigned in June \n     2003 ahead of the report.\n       Three weeks ago, however, Joseph Schmitz supplanted \n     Rehnquist as the most notorious Bush IG. Schmitz, who worked \n     as an aide to former Reagan Administration Attorney General \n     Ed Meese and whose father John was a Republican Congressman \n     from Orange County, Calif., quit his post at the Pentagon \n     following complaints from Senate Finance Committee chairman \n     Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. In particular, Grassley \n     questioned Schmitz's acceptance of a trip to South Korea, \n     paid for in part by a former lobbying client, according to \n     Senate staff members and public lobbying records, and \n     Schmitz's use of eight tickets to a Washington Nationals \n     baseball game. But those issues aren't the ones that led to \n     questions about his independence from the White House. Those \n     concerns came to light after Schmitz chose to show the White \n     House his department's final report on a multiyear \n     investigation into the Air Force's plan to lease air-\n     refueling tankers from Boeing for much more than it would \n     have cost to buy them. After two weeks of talks with the \n     Administration, Schmitz agreed to black out the names of \n     senior White House officials who appeared to have played a \n     role in pushing and approving what turned out to be a \n     controversial procurement arrangement. Schmitz ultimately \n     sent the report to Capitol Hill, but Senators are irked that \n     they have not yet received an original, unredacted copy.\n       Congressional aides said they are still scratching their \n     heads about how Schmitz got his job. He now works for the \n     parent company of Blackwater USA, a military contractor that, \n     in his old job, he might have been responsible for \n     investigating.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will tell you, when we hear about the \ncontracts that are being let for Hurricane Katrina and other natural \ndisasters, it raises similar questions. Just last week, the head of \nprocurement in the White House, Mr. Safavian, was arrested. He was the \ntop man in the White House when it came to procurement and contracts. \nBecause of some misrepresentations that he apparently made--it has been \nalleged that he made these misrepresentations--he has been asked to \nstep down from this spot in the White House.\n  But we have to ask about the contracts that are being let now for \nHurricane Katrina. The Senate and House approved some $60 billion for \nemergency aid. So far, 80 percent of the contracts that FEMA has let \nare no-bid contracts. They have just awarded them to companies without \nany competitive bidding whatsoever.\n  The New York Times on September 26 said as follows:\n\n       More than 80 percent of the $1.5 billion of contracts \n     signed by FEMA alone were awarded without bidding, or with \n     limited competition, government records show, provoking \n     concerns among auditors and government officials about the \n     potential for favoritism and abuse. Already questions have \n     been asked about the political connection of major contracts.\n\n  And the article goes on:\n\n       Questions are being raised as to whether this money is \n     actually going to the victims and is actually being well \n     spent. It raises a question of compensation, not just to make \n     certain these victims and communities get back on their feet \n     as quickly as possible but to make certain we are prepared \n     for the next disaster that may face the United States. We \n     have seen and read of serious problems which have occurred \n     with Hurricane Katrina. Some of the same occurred with \n     Hurricane Rita.\n\n  In Texas, in Express News on September 26, it is written that:\n\n       Jefferson County Texas Judge Carl Griffith said the county \n     has encountered problems gaining access to troops, equipment \n     and supplies needed to help rebuild the storm-battered \n     region. The judge said local authorities weren't able to use \n     about 50 generators the State had prepositioned at an \n     entertainment complex until late Sunday night because no \n     clearance had been given to release them. Mr. Johnson, \n     Jefferson County Administrator, said he had asked for \n     generators to supply power to St. Elizabeth's Hospital and \n     was told there were none available. Then he said, ``I had to \n     show the FEMA representatives the generators were sitting in \n     the parking lot.''\n\n  So there clearly is a need for us to increase the level of competency \nand performance when it comes to dealing with these disasters.\n  The bottom line is this: If we want to find out what went wrong and \nlearn how to avoid it in the future, there is one thing that we can do \nand do now as a Congress which will reach that goal--an independent, \nnonpartisan commission, not a commission created by Republicans or \nDemocrats in Congress of their own Members, nor an investigation \ninitiated by the administration to look at wrongdoing that it might \nhave committed itself, but an independent, nonpartisan commission. Some \nhave argued against it, saying we waited a year for the 9/11 \nCommission, why shouldn't we wait a year to look into the problems of \nKatrina? We waited a year because the White House opposed\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nthe creation of that Commission. Ultimately, it was created and did a \ngreat service to this country.\n  The force that kept the 9/11 Commission moving--this independent, \nnonpartisan commission--was the families who were victims of 9/11. That \nsame force needs to come forward here. The victims of Hurricane Katrina \nand Hurricane Rita should be the moving force for the creation of an \nindependent, nonpartisan commission.\n  The Republican leadership in Congress and the Democratic leadership \nin Congress should acknowledge the obvious: If we are going to get \nclear answers as to what went wrong so those mistakes will not be made \nagain, we need an independent, nonpartisan commission. We shouldn't be \nfearful of them. If they point a finger of blame at Congress, so be it. \nIf they point a finger of blame at State and local leaders, so be it. \nThe important thing is not who was wrong before, the important thing is \nlet us make certain that America is safe in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. is under \nthe control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise once again to speak in favor of the nomination \nof John Roberts. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to vote to \nmake John Roberts the next Chief Justice of the United States.\n  The central focus this week is properly on the nomination of Judge \nRoberts. In addition, the manner in which the Senate acts on this \nnomination also will be subject to public scrutiny. In this regard, I \njoin those who have commended Senator Specter and Senator Leahy and \nother members of the Judiciary Committee for working together to plan \nand carry out a fair series of hearings on the Roberts nomination.\n  This week, the full Senate faces the challenge of debating the merits \nof John Roberts to serve as our Nation's 17th Chief Justice. A widely \nrespected journalist, David Broder, observed about the Roberts \nnomination:\n\n       He is so obviously ridiculously well equipped to lead \n     government's third branch that it is hard to imagine how any \n     Democrat can justify a vote against his confirmation.\n\n  To put a fine point on it, if Democrats do not vote for John Roberts, \nis it fair to ask whether some Democrats will ever give a fair shake to \nany Republican Supreme Court nominee?\n  I recognize that many leftwing special interest groups are putting a \nlot of pressure on Democratic Senators to vote against this \nextraordinarily qualified nominee. For example, last Wednesday, \nSeptember 21, 2005, the newspaper Rollcall contained an article with \nthe headline ``Liberal Groups Lecture Democrats on Roberts.'' Let me \nread a portion of this article:\n\n      . . . Sens. Dick Durbin and Charles Schumer received a sharp \n     rebuke at a weekend meeting in Los Angeles from wealthy \n     activists such as television producer Norman Lear over \n     Roberts' glide path to confirmation.\n       At an event on behalf of People for the American Way, the \n     first of the major liberal groups to announce opposition to \n     Roberts, Lear lashed out at the Democrats for not mounting \n     more determined resistance to the nomination, according to \n     several sources familiar with the event.\n       Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee, confirmed that the event included a `frank \n     discussion' between activists and the Senators.\n\n  That says it all, the pressure on our colleagues on the other side: \nlectures, sharp rebukes, frank discussions. It sounds as if there may \nbe some dissension in ``All in the Family.'' One can only wonder if \n``the Meathead'' took part in this harangue against the Senators. I \nhave no doubt that pressure from some liberal groups was substantial.\n  There are compelling reasons why the health of both the Senate and \nJudiciary require that this vote should be about, and only about, John \nRoberts' qualification to serve as Chief Justice. Some leftwing special \ninterest groups seem to be urging a ``no'' vote on this highly \nqualified nominee in large part to somehow send a message to President \nBush, as he deliberates on how to fill the remaining vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. If that is the case, it is a garbled, misguided message.\n  I understand the political fact of life that some outside interest \ngroups normally affiliated with the Republican side of the aisle might \nhave preferred that Republican Senators would have voted against the \nSupreme Court nominees of President Clinton. But I also respect the \npolitical reality that he who wins the White House has the right under \nthe Constitution to nominate judicial nominees, including filling \nSupreme Court vacancies.\n  In undertaking our advice and consent role, the Senate, due to the \nConstitution, prudence, and tradition, owes a degree of deference to \nPresidential nominees. This helps explain why the two Supreme Court \nnominations made by President Clinton were given broad bipartisan \nsupport by the Senate once they were found to possess the intellect, \nintegrity, character, and mainstream judicial philosophy necessary to \nserve on the Court. When the votes were counted for these two Clinton \nnominees, both of whom were known as socially liberal, Justice Breyer \nwas confirmed by 87 to 9, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was approved \nby a 96-to-3 vote. Given the already stated opposition of both the \nminority leader and the assistant minority leader and many other \nDemocratic Senators, it does not appear likely that Judge Roberts will \nreceive the same level of support from Democrat Senators as Republican \nSenators provided for the last two Democrat nominees. This is \nunfortunate, unjustified, and unfair. Comity must be a two-way street.\n  At least during the debate of this extremely well-qualified nominee \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has not renewed his over-\nthe-top pledge ``to resist any Neanderthal that is nominated by this \nPresident of the United States.''\n  Frankly, I do not think that much of the opposition against the \nnominee can be wholly explained by anything that Judge Roberts said or \ndid or did not say over the course of his exemplary 25-year career as a \nlawyer.\n  I commend the growing number of Democrats, including the ranking \nDemocrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for \ntheir decisions to support Judge Roberts. I hope many others across the \naisle will join them.\n  I also commend President Bush for consulting closely with the Senate \nand for sending a truly outstanding nominee in John Roberts. By all \naccounts, the President is continuing his practice of consulting widely \nwith the Senate in filling the remaining vacancy on the Court.\n  Turning to the merits of this nomination, I take a few moments to \nbriefly discuss John Roberts' education and experience to help explain \nwhy so many think so highly of this nominee. Too often in this debate, \nJudge Roberts' opponents quickly acknowledged his brilliance and \nqualifications before launching into a series of speculative if's, \nand's, or but's that somehow justify a vote against the confirmation in \ntheir eyes.\n\n  The American public realizes John Roberts has the right stuff. John \nRoberts graduated from Harvard College summa cum laude in 3 years. He \nwent on to Harvard Law School where he graduated magna cum laude and \nwas managing editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  Judge Roberts began his career by clerking for two leading Federal \nappellate judges, Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist. \nJudge Roberts began his career in the executive branch by serving as a \nSpecial Assistant to Attorney General William French Smith. Next, he \nwas Associate Counsel in the White House Counsel's Office.\n  In the administration of President George H.W. Bush, John Roberts \nserved as Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the Department of \nJustice. Upon departing Government and moving back into private \npractice, he was justifiably recognized as one of the leading appellate \nlawyers in the country. He has argued an almost astounding number of 39 \ncases before the Supreme Court.\n  John Roberts has represented a diverse group of clients, including \nenvironmental, consumer, and civil rights interests and has taken \nseriously his obligation to provide voluntary legal services to the \npoor, including criminal defendants.\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n  Just 2 years ago, John Roberts was confirmed in the Senate without \nobjection; not one Senator raised an objection to his nomination for a \nseat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \nThe American Bar Association evaluated Judge Roberts four times in the \nlast 4 years, and each time he earned the highest ABA rating of ``well-\nqualified.'' And four times in a row this ``well-qualified'' rating was \nunanimous. This must be some kind of a record for ABA ratings.\n  John Roberts has the temperament, integrity, intelligence, judgment, \nand judicial philosophy to lead the Supreme Court and Federal Judiciary \nwell into the 21st century.\n  The Senate and the American public heard directly from John Roberts \nas he testified for over 20 hours before the Judiciary Committee. Most \nof us liked what we saw and heard. Judge Roberts told us he would bring \nback to the Supreme Court no agenda--political, personal, or otherwise. \nHe told us he would consider each case based solely on the merits of \nthe relevant facts and the applicable laws. With Judge Roberts, all \nlitigants will continue to receive the bedrock American right of equal \njustice under the law.\n  Here is what Judge Roberts said about the rule of law during his \nhearing:\n\n       Somebody asked me, ``Are you going to be on the side of the \n     little guy?'' And you want to give an immediate answer. But \n     if you reflect on it, if the Constitution says the little guy \n     should win, the little guy should win in court before me. But \n     if the Constitution says the big guy should win, well, the \n     big guy should win, because my obligation is to the \n     Constitution. . . .The oath that a judge takes is not that \n     ``I'll look out for special interests'' . . . the oath is to \n     uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States and \n     that's what I would do.\n\n  It seems to me that Judge Roberts got it exactly right. I cannot say \nthe same thing about those, including the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, who embraced results-oriented litmus tests when they repeatedly \nasked just whose side will Judge Roberts be on in deciding cases. As \nJudge Roberts explained, a judge has to hear the case and consider the \nlaw before he or she decides who should prevail under the law.\n  I also greatly appreciated Judge Roberts' comments on judicial \nactivism and judicial restraint. Judge Roberts believes that in our \nsystem of government, judges ``do not have a commission to solve \nsociety's problems, but simply to decide cases before them according to \nthe rule of law.''\n  I found enlightening Judge Roberts' description about how he decides \ncases through a careful process of reviewing briefs, participating in \noral arguments, conferring with other judges at conference, and, \nfinally, writing the decision. He noted that he often adjusts his view \nof the case throughout the course of the deliberative process.\n  Both in his opening testimony and in answering questions, Judge \nRoberts stressed the response of judges exercising institutional and \npersonal modesty and humility. I have no doubt that this view is \ngenuinely held by this nominee. I can say that an overwhelming majority \nof my fellow Utahans say they are fairly impressed with Judge Roberts' \nattitude toward the law and the role of judges.\n  Some, particularly many leftwing special interest groups, do not \nshare my enthusiasm for Judge Roberts. Despite the fact that Judge \nRoberts answered dozens of questions on many topics, some complain that \nJudge Roberts did not answer all the questions.\n  Let us be clear. Under the Cannons of Judicial Ethics, it would have \nbeen inappropriate for Judge Roberts to comment on matters that could \ncome before the Court. These liberal groups apparently have forgotten \nthat back in 1993 when Democrat nominee, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appeared \nbefore the Judiciary Committee in connection with her 96-to-3 \nconfirmation to the Supreme Court, she took a position of ``no hints, \nno forecasts, no previews,'' on many questions.\n  This was consistent with what the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, said back in 1967 with respect to the \nSupreme Court nomination of Thurgood Marshall. He said:\n\n       We have to respect that any nominee to the Supreme Court \n     would have to defer any comments on any matters which are \n     either before the court or very likely to appear before the \n     court.\n\n  Some critics argue that the administration should have turned over \nmemos that Judge Roberts wrote in his former capacity as Deputy \nSolicitor General, when the fact is that several years ago a bipartisan \ngroup of seven former Solicitors General, four of whom were Democrats, \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee to tell us that, generally, providing \nthese documents to the Senate and making them public was a bad idea \ngiven the unique role of the Solicitor General's Office.\n  Some critics assert that Judge Roberts is insufficiently sensitive to \ntheir views in some areas of the law, including civil rights, voting \nrights, women's rights, and abortion, Presidential power and the \ncommerce clause. A careful analysis of Judge Roberts' professional \nrecord over the last 25 years, coupled with the rigorous review of the \nhearing transcript, leads to the conclusion that Judge Roberts is well \nwithin the mainstream on his general perspectives on these issues and \nhas pledged to be fair and openmined on any future litigation involving \nthese and other areas. I take him at his word.\n  For example, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has \nattempted to suggest that Judge Roberts is somehow against voting \nrights and other civil rights. Yet in response to questions from \nSenator Kennedy, Judge Roberts clearly stated that he believed that \nvoting is the preservative of all other rights. It is this principle \nthat undergirds the leading case of Baker v. Carr that brought us into \nthe one man-one vote era that changed the political landscape of \nAmerica.\n  Moreover, Judge Roberts acknowledges the importance of the Voting \nRights Act, and he has supported its reauthorization and said he is \nunaware of any fundamental legal deficiency in the statute.\n  While in the Solicitor General's Office, John Roberts joined several \nbriefs urging the Supreme Court to adopt broad interpretations of the \nVoting Rights Act. For example, in the 1993 case of Voinovich v. \nQuilter, Roberts successfully argued in a brief on behalf of the United \nStates for a reading of the Ohio redistricting plan that made it easier \nto create minority legislative districts. The Supreme Court concurred.\n\n  To claim John Roberts is hostile to voting rights is simply not true. \nNor is he hostile to, or predisposed against, any other rights, \ninterests, or legal claims. John Roberts is committed to hearing every \ncase in a fair, unbiased manner.\n  Let me conclude by saying that some, including some members of the \nJudiciary Committee, having failed to make a substantial case against \nthis stellar nominee, have resorted to suggesting we are somehow \n``rolling the dice'' or ``betting the house'' with this nominee.\n  To me, supporting John Roberts is a sound investment and, I will say, \na sound investment in our Nation's future, not some long-shot bet.\n  John Roberts' long and distinguished record as an advocate and judge \nover the past 25 years, buttressed by his recent confirmation hearing \ntestimony, demonstrates he is a bright, careful, and thoughtful legal \nprofessional of the highest integrity and character. He is not an \nideologue inclined to, or bent on, high court mischief.\n  I think it likely one day historians will conclude that in making \nJohn Roberts our 17th Chief Justice, the President and Senate made a \nwise choice that helped maintain and advance the rule of law for all \npresent and future citizens of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I will vote aye to confirm Judge Roberts, and I hope \nthe vast majority of Senators will do likewise.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for a minute as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized to speak on \nbehalf of Judge Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as Senator Hatch indicated, I do not think \nwe are ``rolling the dice'' at all to vote for this uniquely qualified \nman. It is not about whether he gets confirmed. He will be confirmed in \nthe Senate by the close of business on Thursday, unless something major \nhappens that no one anticipates now. Judge Roberts will then become the \n17th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and his confirmation will \nreceive somewhere in the range of 70-plus votes probably. So his \nnomination is not in doubt.\n  But I think this whole process will be viewed by scholars of the \nCourt and those who follow the confirmation process, in the Senate \nparticularly, in a very serious way because the vote totals do matter. \nHe will get well over 50 votes, but the reasons being offered to vote \n``no'' I think suggest a change in standard from the historical point \nof view of how the Senate approaches a nominee.\n  One of the things I think they will look at in the Roberts \nconfirmation process is: What is the standard? If it is an objective \nstandard of qualifications, character, integrity, has the person lived \ntheir life in such a way as to be able to judge fairly, not to be \nideologically driven to a point where they cannot see the merits of the \ncase, then Judge Roberts should get 100 votes. The reason I say that \nis, not too long ago in the history of our country President Clinton \nhad two Supreme Court vacancies occur on his watch. One was Justice \nGinsburg, who sits on the Court now. I believe she received 96 votes. \nThe other was Justice Breyer, who sits on the Court now, who received \nwell over 90 votes. Shortly before that, under President Bush 1's \nwatch, Justice Scalia--a very well-known conservative--received 98 \nvotes.\n  What is the difference between then and now? I think that is a very \nimportant point for the country to spend some time talking about. If he \nreceives 70 or 75 votes, then, obviously, there has been a reduction in \nthe vote total for someone who I think is obviously qualified. But in \nterms of qualifications, I am going to read some excerpts from what \nsome Senators have said about Judge Roberts.\n  Senator Biden: Incredible. Probably one of the most schooled \nappellate lawyers . . . at least in his generation.\n  Senator Boxer: A brilliant lawyer. Well qualified. Well spoken. \nAffable. Unflappable.\n  Senator Corzine: Eloquen[t]. A great lawyer. A great litigator.\n  Senator Durbin: A judge [who] will be loyal and faithful to the \nprocess of law, to the rule of law. A great legal mind.\n  Senator Feinstein: Very full and forward-speaking. Eloquent. Very \nprecise.\n  Senator Kennedy: An outstanding lawyer. A highly intelligent nominee. \nWell-educated and serious. A very pleasant person. Intelligent.\n  Senator Kerry: Obviously qualified in his legal education and \nlitigation experience. Earnest. Friendly. Incredibly intelligent. A \nsuperb lawyer.\n  Senator Landrieu: Very well credentialed.\n  Senator Obama: Qualified to sit on the highest court in the land. \nHumble. Personally decent. Very able. Very intelligent. Unflappable.\n  Senator Reid: A very smart man. An excellent lawyer. A very affable \nperson. A thoughtful mainstream judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Senator Schumer: Brilliant. Accomplished. Clearly brilliant. A very \nbright and capable man. Very, very smart man. Outstanding lawyer. \nWithout question, an impressive, accomplished and brilliant lawyer. A \ndecent and honorable man.\n  There is more, and I will read those later. I would hope half that \ncould be said about me in any job I pursued. The reason those \ntestimonials were offered is, it is obvious to anyone who has been \nwatching the hearings and paid any attention to what has gone on here \nin the last week or so that we have in our midst one of the most well-\nqualified people in the history of our Nation to sit on the Supreme \nCourt--probably the greatest legal mind of his generation or maybe of \nany other generation. I think when history records President Bush's \nselection of Judge Roberts, it will be seen historically as one of the \nbest picks in the history of this country.\n  The man is a genius. I was there in his presence a whole week. He \nnever took a note. He never asked anybody how to say something or what \nto say, or get any advice from anyone as to how to answer a question. \nHe had almost complete total recall of memos from 20-some years in the \npast. Not only did he understand every case he was questioned upon \nwithout notes, he understood how the dissenting opinions did not \nreconcile themselves. I have been around a lot of smart people. I have \nnever been around anyone as capable as Judge Roberts.\n\n  Now, why would he not get 96 or 98 or 100 votes? Well, some people \nhave said all these glowing things but said that is not enough. There \ncomes the problem. If him being intelligent, brilliant, a superb \nlawyer, the greatest legal mind of our generation, and well qualified \nis not enough, what is? What are some of the reasons that have been \noffered in terms of why anyone could not support this eminently \nqualified man?\n  Most of the reasons I think have to do with a subjective analysis of \nthe nominee that apparently was not used before. Because if a \nconservative went down the road of something other than qualifications, \ncharacter, and integrity, I doubt if a conservative could have voted \nfor Justice Ginsburg or Justice Breyer, if you wanted to use some \nsubjective test as to how they might vote on a particular case or if \nyou had a philosophical test in place of a qualifications test. I will \ntalk about that a bit later.\n  One of the reasons people have offered for a ``no'' vote is that \nduring the questioning period he would not give complete answers to \nconstitutional issues facing the country. I think Senator Kerry said: \nHe is a superb, brilliant lawyer, but I can't vote for him because I \ndon't know how he will come out on the great constitutional issues of \nour time.\n  Well, I would say that is good. You are not supposed to know how he \nis going to decide the great constitutional questions of our time \nbecause that is done in a courtroom with litigants before the judge. It \nis not done in a confirmation process where you have to tell people \nbefore you go on the Court how you are going to rule.\n  At least one Senator has said: I can't vote for this man because he \nwon't tell me if he will buy into the right of privacy and uphold Roe \nv. Wade. If that becomes the standard, the hearing could be limited to \none question: Will you uphold Roe v. Wade, yes or no? And that is the \nend of the deal.\n  I would argue if we go down that road as a nation, using one case, an \nallegiance to one line of legal reasoning, or a particular case, \nwhether you uphold it or whether you will reverse it, then you have \ndone a great disservice to the judiciary because we are not looking for \njudges to validate our pet peeves as Senators in terms of law. We are \nlooking for judges to sit in judgment of our fellow citizens who will \nwait until the case is being litigated, listen to the arguments, read \nthe briefs, and then decide.\n  That is not unknown to the Senate. The idea that Court nominees in \nthe past would refuse to give specific answers to specific cases is not \nunknown at all.\n  Mr. President, I have excerpts from past nominees and questions that \nwere asked.\n  I will read some of these excerpts.\n  This is an abortion question by Senator Metzenbaum to Justice \nGinsburg: After the Casey decision, some have questioned whether the \nright to choose is still a fundamental right. In your view, does the \nCasey decision stand for the proposition that the right to choose is a \nfundamental constitutional right?\n  That is a very direct question: Do you buy into the precepts of Roe \nv. Wade?\n  Ginsburg: What regulations will be permitted is certainly a matter \nlikely to be before the Court. Answers depend in part, Senator, on the \nkind of record presented to the Court. It would not be appropriate for \nme to go beyond the Court's recent reaffirmation that abortion is a \nwoman's right guaranteed by\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nthe 14th amendment. It is part of the liberty guaranteed by the 14th \namendment.\n  She recited the current law and said: There will be lines of attack \non the right to privacy. I am going to wait until the record is \nestablished.\n  Good answer.\n  Voting rights. Senator Moseley-Braun: I guess my concern in Presley \nreally is a matter of your view of the language of the statute, the \nspecific language of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and given the \nfacts of that case whether or not the Court gave too narrow an \ninterpretation of the language in such a way that essentially \nfrustrated the meaning of the statute as a whole.\n  That is a topic before the Senate now.\n  Ginsburg: I avoided commenting on Supreme Court decisions when other \nSenators raised that question, so I must adhere to that position.\n  The death penalty. Senator Specter: Let me ask you a question \narticulated the way we ask jurors, whether you have any conscientious \nscruple against the imposition of the death penalty.\n  Ginsburg: My own view of the death penalty I think is not relevant to \nany question I would be asked to decide as a judge. I will be \nscrupulous in applying the law on the basis of the Constitution, \nlegislation, and precedent.\n  Who does that sound like?\n  Ginsburg: As I said in my opening remarks, my own views and what I \nwould do if I were sitting in the legislature are not relevant to the \njob for which you are considering me, which is the job of a judge.\n  A very good answer.\n  Ginsburg: So I would not like to answer that question any more than I \nwould like to answer the question of what choice I would make for \nmyself, what reproductive choice I would make for myself. It is not \nrelevant to what I will decide as a judge.\n  Now, within that answer she does two things that I think are \nimportant. She refuses to give a personal view of the death penalty \nbased on the idea that: My personal views are not going to decide how I \nwill judge a particular case. And for me to start commenting in that \nfashion will compromise my integrity as a judge. She also said: I am \nnot going to play the role of being a legislator because that is not \nwhat judges do.\n  So I would argue not only did she give the right answers, but that is \nall Judge Roberts has done. When he is advising the President of the \nUnited States about conservative policies initiated by the Reagan \nadministration, he is doing so as a lawyer, advising a client. He \nseveral times indicated that his personal views about matters are not \ngoing to dictate how he decides the case. What will dictate how he \ndecides the case are the facts presented, the law in question, and the \nrecord.\n  All right, more about the death penalty.\n  Senator Hatch: But do you agree with all the current sitting members \nthat it is constitutional, it is within the Constitution?\n  Again, talking about the death penalty. This is Senator Hatch trying \nto get Judge Ginsburg to comment on sitting members of the Court.\n  Ginsburg: I can tell you that I agree that what you have stated is \nthe precedent and clearly has been the precedent since 1976. I must \ndraw the line at that point and hope you will respect what I have tried \nto tell you, that I am aware of the precedent and equally aware of the \nprinciple of stare decisis.\n  Now, who does that sound like? That sounds like Roberts on Roe v. \nWade, but she is talking about the death penalty.\n  Hatch: It isn't a tough question. I mean I am not asking----\n  Ginsburg: You asked me what was in the fifth amendment. The fifth \namendment used the word ``capital.'' I responded when you asked me what \nis the state of current precedents. But if you want me to take a pledge \nthat there is one position I am not going to take, that is what you \nmust not ask a judge to do.\n  So Senator Hatch was trying to draw her out on the death penalty and \nfollow a particular line of reasoning. She says, no, I am not going to \npledge to get on the Court to tip my hand there.\n  Hatch: But that is not what I asked you. I asked you, is it in the \nConstitution, is it constitutional?\n  Again, he was talking about the death penalty.\n  Ginsburg: I can tell you the fifth amendment reads, no person shall \nbe held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless, and \nthe rest. But I am not going to say to this committee that I reject the \nposition out of hand in a case as to which I have never expressed an \nopinion. I have never ruled on a death penalty case. I have never \nwritten about it. I have never spoken about it in a classroom.\n  Specter, on women's rights: Would you think it is appropriate for the \ncourt to employ in general terms the original understanding of the 14th \namendment which you wrote about in the Washington University Law \nQuarterly as interpretive to women's rights?\n  Ginsburg: I have no comment on that, Senator Specter. I have said \nthat these issues will be coming before the Court. I will not say \nanything in the legislative Chamber that will hint or forecast how I \nwill vote in cases involving particular classifications.\n  It goes on and on. I have 30 pages here. I will put them in the \nRecord. The idea that Judge Roberts, during his time before the \ncommittee, was evasive or unresponsive, different than people who came \nbefore him, is not supported by the record. What we have in this \nconfirmation process is a frontal assault on the nominee in terms of \npledging allegiance to Roe v. Wade, something that didn't happen to \nGinsburg as directly.\n  There is at least one Senator who appears to be basing her vote on \nthe idea that he won't tell me whether he will uphold Roe v. Wade; \ntherefore, I can't vote for Judge Roberts. Again, I argue if that is \nthe standard for a yes or no vote, the standard has changed \ndramatically. It will be unhealthy for the country as a whole. It will \ndo great damage to the judiciary. It will be a standard Democrats would \nnot want to be applied in the future, I can assure my colleagues.\n  The other issue is about the idea of civil rights, that somehow Judge \nRoberts' position during the Reagan administration was unfriendly to \ncivil rights to the point that we can't vote for him. Bottom line is, \nof all the reasons given, that is the most distorted. That is a reason, \nthat is a cut-and-paste job we have seen too much of to try to cast \nsomeone in a bad light for doing what their job required of them. John \nRoberts was in his 20s, working for the Reagan administration. The idea \nthat he would be advising President Reagan about conservative policy \ninitiatives shouldn't surprise anyone. That was his job.\n  The issue of civil rights is important to all of us. One of the worst \nthings you can do is try to question someone's character, integrity, to \nthe point that it puts a shadow of who they are in terms of being \nsensitive to other people based on race or any other difference. The \nidea that John Roberts, when he was working for the Reagan \nadministration, showed a hard heart and insensitivity to people's \nability to fairly vote is a shameful attack, not supported by the \nrecord. It is a cut-and-paste job. It is a distortion of what he said \nthen, what he said now, and we ought to reject it.\n  The issue that was being discussed was whether Ronald Reagan's \nposition of reauthorizing the Civil Rights Voting Act as written was \nextreme. The Reagan administration said: We will reauthorize the Voting \nRights Act as written. The problem in the early 1980s was that you had \na Supreme Court decision, the Boulder case, where the Supreme Court \nsaid that when it comes to section 2, where you look at the effects of \nvoting patterns and whether there is discrimination being applied based \non race and voting and representation, the test to determine that would \nbe the intent test. Did the people who drew the lines setting up the \nvoting procedures and the voting districts, was it their intent to \nracially discriminate and undermine African-American voting rights in \nthe States in question. That was the test the Supreme Court applied.\n  Senator Kennedy and others wanted to change that test to the effects \ntest, where you would look at the effects of how the lines were drawn \nand how the districts were set up. It was an honest debate.\n  The third concept no one has talked much about is proportionality. \nThe Reagan administration was against\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\nproportional representation which is basically an electoral quota. You \nlook at a district based on race, and you come to the conclusion that \nthe elected officials within that district have to mirror the \npopulation. In other words, you will have a racial quota. If 40 percent \nof the district is of a particular race, then 40 percent of the people \nhave to be of that race. I don't think most Americans want that. What \nwe want is people to have a chance to run for office, be successful and \nvote their conscience, without anything interfering and without bad \nforces standing in the way. I don't think most Americans want to decide \nthe election based on race before you cast any ballot.\n\n  That was the debate in the 1980s. The Reagan administration was \nagainst proportionality. They were standing for the Civil Rights Act as \nwritten in the 1960s. Then you had the Supreme Court case that \ninterjected a new concept. What Judge Roberts, then a lawyer in the \nReagan administration, was advising was that the current law was the \nintent test. The Reagan administration was supporting the Supreme \nCourt's intent test. How that has been twisted and turned to show or to \nmake the argument that John Roberts is insensitive to people's ability \nto vote and has stood in the way of people having their fair day at the \nballot box, to me is a complete distortion of who he is and the \nposition he took.\n  At the end of the day, here is what happened. There was a legislative \ncompromise. The Supreme Court intent test was replaced by a totality of \nthe circumstances test which is somewhere between the effects and \nintent test. I know this is a bit hard to follow, but the bottom line \nis, there was a compromise legislatively dealing with a Supreme Court \ndecision. John Roberts' legal advice to the Reagan administration was \nvery much in the mainstream of where America is, very much in the \nmainstream of the Reagan position. To say his legal memos arguing that \nproportionality was inappropriate and the intent test was based on \nsound legal reasoning, to somehow go from that legal reasoning to the \nidea that the man, the person, is insensitive to people's voting \nrights, again, is quite shameful.\n  He said in the hearing, it is the right of which everything else \nrevolves around, the ability to go to the ballot box and express \nyourself.\n  This has happened to Judge Pickering, and it is going to happen to \nthe next nominee. I will put the Senate on record from my point of \nview, coming from the South, there have been plenty of sins where I \nlive in the South. The Voting Rights Act has cured a lot of those sins. \nBut one of the things we should not lay on John Roberts is the idea \nthat because he represented the Reagan administration, arguing that the \nSupreme Court was right, somehow he, as a person, is insensitive to \nminority rights.\n  The reason that is a bogus argument is because there is not one \nperson who came before the Senate Judiciary Committee or otherwise to \nsay John Roberts has ever lived his life in a way that would suggest he \nis insensitive to people's rights based on race. As a matter of fact, \none of the witnesses before the committee analyzed the cases Judge \nRoberts presented to the Supreme Court dealing with civil rights. They \nfound out he won 71 percent of his cases dealing with civil rights \nissues. That says not only does he understand civil rights law well, he \nis arguing mainstream concepts. When he looked at how Justices agreed \nor disagreed with him, apparently Thurgood Marshall agreed with John \nRoberts, the advocate, over 60 something percent of the time. So if you \nlook at the way he has lived his life, the way he has argued the law \nand who he has represented, there is not one ounce of evidence to \nsuggest John Roberts the man is in any way insensitive to people's \nability to vote based on race.\n  Tomorrow we will come back and we will look at the other reasons to \nsay no to this fine man. I think we are getting into a dicey area, if \nwe are going to play this game of voting no based on ``you won't tell \nme how you will vote on a particular case'' or that we take someone's \nlegal advice and use the client's position against that person, that \nyou are going to set a standard that will chill out a lot of people \nwanting to be members of the Court. There are other things being said \nabout this fine man that would be dangerous if the Senate adopted as \nthe test in the future. I will talk next time about how the sitting \nJustices would not fare so well. The bottom line is there is a reason \nthat Scalia, Ginsberg, and Breyer received well over 90 votes apiece. \nThey were well qualified. They were people of good character and good \nintegrity.\n  If this man, John Roberts, after all that has been said about him in \nterms of his qualifications, doesn't get 90-plus votes, the Senate \nneeds to do some self-evaluation because we have gone down the wrong \nroad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from South Carolina. He so clearly lays out the \nfoundational basis by which we ought to be reviewing nominees to our \nhighest Court. At the same time, he brings a lot of valid criticism to \nthose who would choose to be tremendously selective not by character \nbut by philosophy of those who are sent to us to consider.\n  Like many of our colleagues engaged in the confirmation process of \nJohn Roberts to the position of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nI have been here before. Maybe that is one way of saying it. The last \ntime John Roberts came before the Senate, he was confirmed for his \nposition by unanimous consent. He was placed on the District of \nColumbia's Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest in the land as \nit relates to our judicial system. However, unlike most of our \ncolleagues, I was a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary at \nthat time, and his was one of the first confirmations before the \ncommittee that session. That only increased my sense of duty to \nthoroughly review his fitness for a lifetime appointment to the court.\n  Undoubtedly, one of the most serious duties of a Senator is the \nconstitutional obligation and opportunity to confirm the President's \njudicial nominees. At that time I was satisfied that John Roberts was a \nsuperior candidate for the job. A review of his record for the past 20 \nmonths only proves that decision to have been the correct one. Not a \nsingle question has been raised as to his competence or his character \nduring that time serving on the DC Circuit. Furthermore, in his time on \nthe court, John Roberts has shown he does not bring an agenda to work \nwith him in the morning. Rather, he takes an intellectual approach to \neach case, basing his rulings on the facts and the law, not any \npersonal bias.\n  To the extent there has been a debate over the nomination, it has not \nbeen about Judge Roberts' qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court. \nRather, he has been subject to an ideological litmus test.\n  I submit that this is not the job of the Senate. We are not social \nengineers, even though some of my colleagues might like to be, and it \nis not our role to pack the courts with members of certain ideologies.\n  Judge Roberts points out that he is not standing for election, and \nappropriately so. I agree with this critical distinction. We are not \nhere to debate his politics or whether we agree with them. Our duty is \nto give advice and consent to our President's nominations.\n  To politicize this duty of supreme importance, I think is \nfundamentally wrong, but it is occurring with this nominee. For the \nlast 2 weeks, we have been subjected to some of that rhetoric coming \nout of the Judiciary Committee which is purely political and an attempt \nto politicize the process. Politicizing the confirmation hearings runs \ncontrary to the idea of an unbiased judiciary. As Judge Roberts himself \nhas suggested, it undermines the integrity of that judicial process.\n  That being the case, we must ask why anyone would want to bring \nissues of politics to the process. The simple answer is that opponents \nof Judge Roberts are not looking impartially. They want a nominee who \nwill agree with their beliefs. Judge Roberts has said, time and time \nagain, he would not engage in bargaining or state his beliefs on \nspecific issues.\n  Let me suggest that a Member who votes against this nominee because \nhe will not state his position on a specific case or ruling is voting \nagainst an unbiased judiciary. In other words, they want a bias in the \nCourt to fit their political beliefs instead of the unbiased\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\nCourt that our Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  While some seem bound and determined to inject politics into the \nCourt and have applied intense pressure to secure his assistance in \nthat effort, Judge Roberts has stood by his commitment to the rule of \nlaw, and that is what a judge should do.\n  This speaks highly of his integrity, but again his integrity is not \nin question. No one had brought forth any evidence to suggest that he \nis not a person of high moral character. In fact, many of the Members \nwho say they will vote against his confirmation say that he appears to \nbe a very fine fellow--smart, witty, thoughtful. So where are they \ngoing and what are they attempting to dredge up? His judicial demeanor \nis also not in question.\n  The overwhelming assessment of Judge Roberts' performance before the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary is that he did an outstanding job. He \nremained calm, thoughtful, impartial, and unshaken. In a word, he was \njudicial.\n  I said during my tenure on that committee and during confirmation \nprocesses, while I may agree or disagree, what I was looking for was \nthe character of the individual, the judicial demeanor: How would he or \nshe perform on the court? Would they bring integrity to the court in \nthose kinds of rulings to which they would be subjecting their mind and \ntheir talent?\n  Some believe that all documents related to Judge Roberts during his \nservice as Deputy Solicitor General should be disclosed even though \nthis would violate attorney-client and deliberate process privileges. \nHe will not infringe upon past employers' rights and privileges. He \nknows this would discourage consultation and new ideas and reduce the \neffectiveness of the Office of Solicitor General. This is a man who \ntruly exemplifies integrity. Although he is criticized for not \nreleasing some documents, it is his integrity that will not allow that \nto happen. If it were not unethical to disclose these documents, I am \nsure the judge would release them. In fact, those that would not \ninfringe upon his integrity have been released.\n  We have reviewed some 76,000 pages of documents, including documents \nfor more than 95 percent of the cases he worked on in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. Our access has been restricted to a mere 16 out of \n327 cases. Finding Judge Roberts unfit to be Chief Justice on the \ngrounds of undisclosed privileged internal deliberations is not only \nunfair, I believe it is illegal and, at any test, it is ludicrous.\n  Judge Roberts' competence is not being called into question, not in \nany sense by any Senator. It would be very difficult to find a better \ncandidate anywhere to serve as Chief Justice. He seems to have done \nextremely well in whatever he has undertaken. Graduating summa cum \nlaude says that this man is bright. Managing editor of the Harvard Law \nReview--that only comes to the top of the class. Later, he clerked for \nJudge Friendly of the U.S. court of appeals in Manhattan and for \nSupreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. He has tried 39 cases before \nthe Supreme Court, both as a private litigant and as a Government \nlitigant while serving as the Deputy Solicitor General. Judge Roberts \nnow serves, as I mentioned, on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit.\n  His credentials are impeccable. This man deserves a unanimous vote, \nas he received 20 months ago. But that will not be the case today \nbecause some have chosen to inject politics into this process. Thank \ngoodness Judge Roberts has stood unwaveringly not allowing that to \nhappen when it comes to himself. His integrity is not in question. That \nis why he was nominated by the President of the United States to serve \nas the Chief Justice of our highest Court.\n\n  He deserves my vote. He will get my vote. He deserves the vote of \nevery Senator serving in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Senator Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I first met Bill Frist 11 years ago \nwhen he was a world-renown heart transplant surgeon from the \nneighboring State of Tennessee. He was considering a career change to \npublic service in the Senate. Then, as now, I believe he was one of the \nmost gifted, hard-working, and honest people I had ever met. He is a \nbit of a rarity in this town. He has more talent and less ego than \nalmost anyone I can think of.\n  There has been this question raised about the sale of some stock. Of \ncourse, a bit lost in this dustup is the simple fact that the Senate \nEthics Committee preapproved the sale. However, this is Washington, and \nsometimes even honest actions are questioned.\n  I have absolutely no doubt that the facts will demonstrate that \nSenator Frist acted in the most professional and the most ethical \nmanner, as he has throughout his distinguished medical and Senate \ncareer.\n  Senator Frist has been clear that he welcomes the opportunity to meet \nwith the appropriate authorities and put this situation in its proper \ncontext as a completely--a completely--appropriate transaction.\n  Furthermore, Senator Frist has my full and unconditional support. He \nis a great majority leader. I find myself agreeing with my good friend \nfrom Nevada, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, who said he knew \nSenator Frist would not do anything wrong. Senator Reid has it right.\n  Finally, I think there are few settled facts in this contentious \ncapital of ours, but there is one fact of which I am completely \ncertain: Bill Frist is a decent, honest, hard-working man who puts \npublic service before private gain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had several people on the Senate \nfloor this morning speaking of the Roberts nomination. I understand \nthat we have several Senators on this side of the aisle who are going \nto speak in a few minutes, and I will yield the floor when they arrive.\n  I hope the American people will listen to this discussion. The \noutcome is sort of foreordained because we know the number of people \nwho are going to vote for Judge Roberts, as am I. The reason it is \nimportant to hear all the different voices is that we are a nation of \n280 million Americans. But for the Chief Justice of the United States, \nonly 101 people have a say in who is going to be there and, of course, \nthey are the President, first and foremost, with the nomination, and \nthe 100 men and women in this Senate.\n  We have to stand in the shoes of all 280 million Americans. Can we be \nabsolutely sure in our vote of exactly who the Chief Justice might be \nas a person, somebody who will probably serve long after most of us are \ngone, certainly long after the President is gone and actually long \nafter several Presidents will be gone? No. We have to make our best \njudgment. I have announced how I am going to vote. With me, it is a \nmatter of conscience.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I know he wishes to \nspeak, and I will be speaking later about this issue. I will yield the \nfloor to the distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my wonderful friend from Vermont \nfor his great leadership in the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with \nSenator Specter.\n  I rise today concerning the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I have interviewed and \nrecommended the appointment of many men and women who serve as State \nand Federal judges in my home State of Colorado. I am no stranger to \nanalyzing the record of a candidate for the judiciary. I am no stranger \nto evaluating the character and temperament of people to serve in these \npositions. Yet I know this confirmation vote is special. It is one of \nthe most significant votes that I will cast during my tenure as a \nSenator. I know this vote is likely to endure the rest of my life and \nthe lives of those who serve in this Chamber.\n  The decisions of the Supreme Court significantly affect the everyday \nlives of the people in my State and all the people who live throughout \nour great Nation. The Chief Justice is first\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\namong equals among the nine Justices who make these decisions. The \nChief Justice's ability to run the Court's conferences and to assign \nopinions gives the Chief Justice important influence on the directions \ntaken by the Court. The Chief Justice molds and defines the \ncohesiveness of the Court in the sense that he or she can lead efforts \nto reduce separate and complicated opinions and to make the opinions of \nthe Court clear and understandable to all. This is an especially \nimportant influence to reduce confusion in the law.\n  Finally, the Chief Justice sits at the very pinnacle of our Federal \njudicial branch. The Chief Justice leads the judges and the rest of the \n21,000 employees of the Federal court system. The Chief Justice is \nresponsible for making sure the Federal courts run effectively and \nefficiently. The administrative responsibilities of the Chief Justice \nare important for another reason. The Chief Justice can lead the \njudicial branch to become a place of inclusion, a place where women are \nas welcome as men, and where people work together who are black, brown, \nyellow, white, and every other color of human skin.\n  The Chief Justice can make the judicial branch a shining example of \ndiversity and inclusiveness. This is not an abstraction. When people of \nany background come to the Court they should be looking in the mirror. \nThe faces of the Court should be the same as the faces of those who \ncome before the Court. In my view, this is an essential aspect of \njustice.\n  I commend the Senate Judiciary Committee for its fair, serious, and \ndignified hearings on the Roberts nomination. Chairman Specter, Ranking \nMember Leahy, and all members of the committee have earned our \ngratitude. They have performed a very valuable service for our country. \nThese Senators gave us a wonderful example worthy of repetition in the \nSenate of how the Senate should operate in the interest of our Nation. \nThey did their work with courtesy, civility, and in the spirit of the \nparties working together in good faith to discuss their differing \nviews. Our Nation is better for their efforts.\n  I also want to take a minute to thank Democratic Leader Reid. I have \nbeen surprised and taken aback by the attacks on him from some people \nin this debate. To read the musings of Washington insiders, Senator \nReid is somehow guilty of not uniting Democrats, and at the same time \nnot being too beholden to Democratic interest groups. As is the usual \ncase in the debates in Washington, the truth can be found elsewhere.\n  Senator Reid made very clear to this Senator and to the entire caucus \nthat this is a vote of conscience. To suggest otherwise is unfair and \ndishonest. Our leader, a man of unshakable faith and conviction, helped \nensure that this Senate lived up to its constitutional obligation of \nadvice and consent.\n  I want to speak briefly about the history of America and our \nConstitution concerning equality under the law and the key role of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The history of equal protection is a reminder of \nthe most painful and at the same time the most promising moments of our \nSupreme Court and our Nation. We must not forget that history and its \nlessons, for to do so would undo our progress as a nation.\n  In retracing our history, the inevitable conclusion is that we have \nmade major progress over four centuries. That history includes 250 \nyears of slavery in this country, 100 years of legal segregation of the \nraces, and the struggle in the new and recent times to achieve another \nage and celebrate the age of diversity.\n  We must look back at that history so that we do not forget its \npainful lessons. We must never forget that for the first 250 years of \nthis country, after the European settlers reached the shores of Mexico \nand New England, the relationship between groups was characterized by \nslavery and the subjugation of one group for the benefit of another.\n  In Mexico and in the Southwest, the Spanish enslaved Native \nAmericans. In the East and the South, the Americans brought Blacks from \nAfrica and treated them as property. In the Dred Scott decision in \n1857, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a terrible moment for our Nation, \nreasoned that Blacks were inferior to Whites and therefore the system \nof slavery was somehow justified.\n  At that point, the U.S. Supreme Court was endorsing the untenable \nproposition that one person could own another person as property simply \nbecause of their race. But the march toward freedom and equality would \nnot be stopped by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision.\n  The Civil War ensued. Let us never forget that the Civil War became \nthe bloodiest war in American history, with over 500,000 Americans \nkilled in battle. In the end, the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution ended the system of slavery and ushered in a new era \nof equal protection under the laws. Yet even with the end of slavery \nand the civil rights amendments to the Constitution, equal protection \nunder the laws for the next 100 years would still require the \nsegregation of the races.\n  The law of the land in many States and cities required the separation \nof the races in schools, theaters, restaurants, and public \naccommodations. It was not until 1954 that the U.S. Supreme Court \nmarked the end of legal segregation by the Government in its historic \ndecision of Brown v. Topeka Board of Education.\n  In that decision, Chief Justice Warren, writing for a unanimous \nSupreme Court, stated that in the field of public education the \ndoctrine of separate but equal has no place. The Brown decision marked \nan historic milestone for the U.S. Supreme Court and our Nation about \nthe relationships between groups.\n  Over the next decade, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws that \nrequired segregation on golf courses, parks, theaters, swimming pools, \nand numerous other facilities. These changes were met with intense \ncontroversy, marked by marches, protests, riots, and assassinations. \nBecause of the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Presidents Kennedy \nand Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and thousands of civil rights activists, \nCongress ushered in the sweeping civil rights reforms of the 1960s.\n  We, as an American society, began to understand that the doctrine of \nseparate but equal truly had no place in America and that the age of \ndiversity truly was upon us. But the age of diversity has been marked \nby significant and continuing tension. A part of that debate was put to \nrest only recently with the majority opinion authored by Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor in the University of Michigan Law School case.\n  There, Justice O'Connor said:\n\n       Today, we hold that the Law School has a compelling \n     interest in attaining a diverse student body.\n\n  Justice O'Connor continued:\n\n       The Law School's claim of a compelling interest is further \n     bolstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits \n     that flow from student body diversity.\n\n  She explained further:\n\n       These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major \n     American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in \n     today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed \n     through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas \n     and viewpoints.\n\n  What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of \nthe U.S. military assert that, and she quotes:\n\n       [B]ased on [their] decades of experience, a highly \n     qualified, racially diverse officer corps . . . is essential \n     to the military's ability to fulfill its principal mission to \n     provide national security.\n\n  She continued:\n\n     . . . To fulfill its mission, the military must be selective \n     in admissions for training and education for the officer \n     corps, and it must train and educate a highly qualified, \n     racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse setting.\n       We agree that [i]t requires only a small step from this \n     analysis to conclude that our country's other most selective \n     institutions must remain both diverse and selective.\n\n  I believe Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a beacon of wisdom at this \nmoment in our Nation's history. We know we have had beacons of wisdom \nin our past to help guide us in our future. I am hopeful that Judge \nRoberts will be that kind of Chief Justice.\n  In 1896, Justice Harlan was a beacon of wisdom when he dissented in \nPlessy v. Ferguson against his colleagues on the U.S. Supreme Court \nwhen they decided to sanction the right to segregation under the law. \nThen Justice Harlan stated in his dissent:\n\n       The destinies of the races, in this country, are \n     indissolubly linked together and the interests of both \n     require that the common government law shall not permit the \n     seeds of\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\n     race hate to be planted under the sanction of law.\n  I do not know exactly how judge Roberts will provide us with that \nbeacon of wisdom for the 21st century, but the doctrine of inclusion is \nsomehow at the heart of the answer, and I expect and implore Judge \nRoberts to follow that doctrine.\n  That doctrine means that we should be inclusive of all, and that \ndoctrine means that there is something wrong when we look around and we \nsee no diversity in the people who surround us, and that doctrine means \nthat the motto on our American coins, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' can only be \nachieved if we include all those who make the many of us into one \nnation.\n  My criteria for the confirmation of judges remain the same as they \nhave been. I reviewed Judge Roberts' record for fairness, impartiality, \nand a proven record for upholding the law. I have given this difficult \ndecision the careful deliberation it deserves. I have reviewed his \nwritings. I have read his cases. I have reviewed his testimony to the \nJudiciary Committee. I have met twice with Judge Roberts, the second \ntime last Friday, asking him pointed and specific questions to gauge \nthe measure of the man.\n  I am grateful for his courtesy and appreciative of his time. I \nconcluded that a vote to confirm Judge Roberts as the next Chief \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court is the appropriate vote to cast. \nJudge Roberts' intellect is unquestioned. His technical legal skills \nare unquestioned. He is a lawyer that other lawyers respect, those who \nhave worked with him as well as those who have worked against him.\n  Judge Roberts has convinced me that he understands the constitutional \nneed for judicial independence. He believes in the bedrock principle \nthat decisions of the Supreme Court must be carefully based upon the \nfacts of the case and the law. He believes that all cases must be \ndecided on their specific merits by a judge with an open and fair mind. \nThese concepts lie at the heart of our judicial system. They \ndifferentiate the courts from other institutions of government. They \nare critical to our freedom.\n  I am favorably impressed by Judge Roberts' statement to do his best \nto heal the gaping fractures in the opinions of the Supreme Court in \nrecent years. When the Court issues three or five or nine opinions in a \nsingle case, it is a recipe for confusion and uncertainty for judges, \nlawyers, and litigants. This is bad for the law.\n  I believe Judge Roberts has a clear understanding of the jolts to the \nsystem that disrupt the country when the Court overturns settled law, \nand he is equally understanding and determined to avoid these jolts. I \nlived through that type of difficult and expensive disruption as \nColorado attorney general, when the Supreme Court changed long-settled \nexpectations about sentencing by judges in criminal cases. The criminal \njustice system in Colorado and across the Nation was thrown into \nturmoil. It still has not recovered.\n  I believe Judge Roberts has an understanding of the Supreme Court's \nrole to guide the lower courts, lawyers, and litigants, with clear and \nunderstandable direction. I have been particularly interested in Judge \nRoberts' views on diversity and inclusion of all people, women as well \nas men, in our country. I have lived my life by the bedrock principle \nthat people of all backgrounds and both genders should be included in \nall aspects of our society. This is very important to me. So I have \nasked Judge Roberts directly and personally about his commitment to \ndiversity and inclusiveness in our country. He has assured me of his \ncommitment to this principle.\n  Finally, Judge Roberts passes a simple test that I will apply to \njudicial candidates for as long as I am a Senator. I do not believe he \nis an ideologue. He is not the kind of judge--like some--for whom \nanyone can predict the outcome of a case before the case is briefed and \nargued. The ideologue's approach to the law makes a mockery of judicial \nindependence, and it is the opposite of being openminded and fair.\n  In conclusion, I have reached my decision to vote for Judge Roberts \nbased upon his word that, first, he will stand up and fight for an \nindependent judiciary and defend the judiciary from unwarranted attacks \non its independence; second, he will not roll back the clock of \nprogress for civil rights and recognizes that the equal protection \nprovided under the Constitution extends to all Americans, including \nwomen and racial and ethnic minorities; third, he will respect the rule \nof law and the precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the most \nimportant decisions of the last century; fourth, he understands the \nimportance of the freedom of religion and religious pluralism as a \ncornerstone of a free America; and five, he will work to create a \nFederal judicial system that embraces diversity and has a face that \nreflects the diverse population of America.\n  I will vote to confirm Judge Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. I wish Judge Roberts the very best as he assumes his new \nresponsibilities on behalf of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor to my wonderful and good friend from the State of \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado for his \nvery thoughtful and eloquent statement.\n  I rise to speak on the President's nomination of John Roberts of \nMaryland to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During my 17 \nyears as a Member of the Senate, I have had the opportunity on four \nprevious occasions to consider nominees to the Supreme Court--two from \nthe first President Bush and two from President Clinton. On three of \nthose occasions--Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer--I carried out my \nconstitutional responsibility by giving not only advice but consent. On \nthe fourth, Justice Thomas, I withheld my consent.\n  I must say that on each of those preceding four occasions, I was \nstruck, as I am again now in considering President Bush's nomination of \nJohn Roberts, by the wisdom of the Founders and Framers of our \nConstitution and by the perplexing position they put the Senate in when \nwe consider a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As we know, our Founders declared their independence and formed their \nnew government to secure the inalienable rights and freedoms which they \nbelieved are the endowment of our Creator to every person. But from \ntheir knowledge of history and humanity, and from their own experiences \nwith the English monarch, they saw that governments had a historic \ntendency to stifle, not secure, the rights and freedoms of their \ncitizens. So in constructing their new government, they allocated power \nand then they limited it, time and time again. Theirs was to be a \ngovernment of checks and balances, except for one institution which is, \ngenerally speaking, unchecked and unlimited, and that is the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I understand that Congress can reenact a statute that has been struck \ndown by the Court as inconsistent with the Constitution, but I also \nknow that the Court can then nullify the new statute. I understand, \ntoo, that the people may amend the Constitution to overturn a Supreme \nCourt decision with which they disagree, but that is difficult and \ncumbersome and therefore rare in American history. So the Supreme Court \nalmost always has the last word in our Government. It can be, and has \nbeen, a momentous last word, with great consequences for our national \nand personal lives.\n  Why then, in constituting the Supreme Court, did our Nation's \nFounders vary from their system of limited government, of checks and \nbalances? I believe one reason is that they were wise enough to know \nthat to be orderly, to function, a system must have a final credible \npoint where disputation and uncertainty end and from which the work of \nsociety and government proceeds. But there was a larger reason, I am \nconvinced, consistent with their highest value, and that was their \nunderstanding, again from their knowledge of history and humanity, that \nfreedom can just as easily be taken by a mob of citizens as it can by a \ntyrannical leader. So they created a Supreme Court that was to be \ninsulated from the political passions of the moment and that would base \nits decisions not only on transitory public opinion but on the eternal \nvalues of our founding documents--the Declaration, the Constitution, \nthe Bill of Rights--and the rule of law.\n  They did this, these Founders and Framers, not just by giving the \nCourt\n\n[[Page S10473]]\n\nsuch enormous power but also by giving its individual members life \ntenure. The President nominates Justices, the Senate advises and \ndecides whether to consent, and then the Justice who is confirmed \nserves for as long as he or she lives or chooses to serve, absent the \nunusual possibly of impeachment, of course; limited in that service \nonly by the Justice's own conscience, intellect, sense of right and \nwrong, understanding of what the Constitution and law demand, and by \nthe capacity of the litigants who appear before the Court and by the \nJustice's own colleagues on the Court to convince him or her.\n  This gets to why I have described the Senate's responsibility to act \non nominations to the Supreme Court as perplexing. It is our one and \nonly chance to evaluate and influence the nominees, and then they are \nuntouchable and politically unaccountable. But the Senate is a \npolitical body. We are elected by and accountable to the people. So \nnaturally during the confirmation process we try to extract from the \nnominees to this Court, on this last chance that we have, commitments, \npolitical commitments that they will uphold the decisions of the Court \nwith which we agree and overrule those with which we disagree; and they \nnaturally try to avoid making such commitments.\n  We are both right. Because the Supreme Court has such power over our \nlives and liberties, we Senators are right to ask such questions. But \nbecause the Court is intended to be the nonpolitical branch of our \nGovernment, the branch before which litigants must come with confidence \nthat the Justices' minds are open, not closed by rigid ideology or \npolitical declaration, the nominees to the Court are ultimately right \nto resist answering such questions in great detail. I understand that I \nam describing an ideal which has not always been reached by individual \nJustices on the Court. But on the other hand, the history of the \nSupreme Court is full of examples of Justices who have issued \nsurprisingly different opinions than expected, or even than expressed \nbefore they joined the Court; and also of Justices who have changed \ntheir opinions over the years of their service on the Court. That is \ntheir right, and I would add the responsibility the Constitution gives \nto Justices of our Supreme Court.\n  Our pending decision on President Bush's nomination of John Roberts \nto the Supreme Court is made more difficult because it comes at an \nexcessively partisan time in our political history. That makes it even \nmore important that we stretch to decide it correctly and without \npartisan calculations, whichever side we come down on. Judge Roberts, \nafter all, has been nominated to be Chief Justice of the highest Court \nof the greatest country in the world, and our decision on whether to \nconfirm him should be a decision made above partisanship.\n  Today in these partisan times, it is worth remembering that seven of \nthe nine sitting Justices were confirmed by overwhelmingly bipartisan \nvotes in the Senate. Justices O'Connor by 99, Stevens and Scalia by 98, \nKennedy by 97, Ginsburg by 96, Souter by 90, and Breyer 89. So it was \nnot always as it is now, and it is now hard to imagine a nominee who \nwould receive so much bipartisan support. That is wrong and it is \nregrettable.\n  One reason for this sad turn, is that our recent Presidential \ncampaigns have unfortunately made the Supreme Court into a partisan \npolitical issue, contrary to the intention of the Founders of our \ncountry as I have described it, with candidates in each party promising \nto nominate only Justices who would uphold or overrule particular \nprevailing Supreme Court decisions. I know that is not the first time \nin our history this has happened.\n  But it nonetheless today undercuts the credibility and independence \nof the Supreme Court, and I might add it complicates this confirmation \nprocess. Because President Bush promised in his campaign that he would \nnominate Supreme Court Justices in the mold of Justices Scalia and \nThomas, an extra burden of proof was placed on Judge Roberts to prove \nhis openness of mind and independence of judgment.\n  All of that is one reason why earlier this year I was proud to be one \nof the ``group of 14'' Senators. I view the agreement of that group of \n14 as an important step away from partisan politicizing of the Supreme \nCourt. By opposing the so-called nuclear option, we were saying--7 \nRepublicans and 7 Democrats--that a nominee for a lifetime appointment \nto the Supreme Court should be close enough to the bipartisan \nmainstream of judicial thinking to obtain the support of at least 60 of \nthe 100 Members of the Senate. That is not asking very much for this \nhigh office.\n  When I was asked during the deliberation of the group of 14 to \ndescribe the kind of Justice I thought would pass that kind of test, I \nremember saying it would be one who would not come to the Supreme Court \nwith a prefixed ideological agenda but would approach each case with an \nopen mind, committed to applying the Constitution and the rule of law \nto reach the most just result in a particular case. I remember also \nsaying the agreement of the group of 14 could be read as a bipartisan \nappeal to President Bush which might be phrased in these words:\n\n       Mr. President, you won the 2004 election and with it came \n     to the right to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court. We \n     assume you will nominate a conservative but we appeal to you \n     not to send us an extreme conservative who will confront the \n     court and the country with a disruptive, divisive, \n     predetermined ideological agenda. Send us an able, honorable \n     nominee, Mr. President, who will take each case as it comes, \n     listen fully to all sides, and try to do right thing.\n\n  Based on the hours of testimony Judge Roberts gave to the Judiciary \nCommittee under oath, the lengthy personal conversation I had with him, \na review of his extraordinary legal and judicial ability and \nexperience, and the off-the- record comments of people who have known \nor worked with Judge Roberts at different times of his life, and \nvolunteered them to me, and uniformly testified to his personal \nintegrity and decency, I conclude that John Roberts meets and passes \nthe tests I have described. I will, therefore, consent to his \nnomination.\n  In his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee on September 13, \nJudge Roberts said:\n\n       I have no platform.\n       Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain \n     things in exchange for votes. If I am confirmed, I will \n     confront every case with an open mind. I will fully and \n     fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented. I will \n     be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the \n     bench. And I will decide every case based on the record, \n     according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the \n     best of my ability.\n\n  I could not have asked for a more reassuring statement.\n  During the hearings, some of our colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee challenged Judge Roberts to reconcile that excellent pledge \nwith memos or briefs he wrote during the 1980s or early 1990s, or \nopinions he wrote on the Circuit Court in more recent years. They were \nright to do so. I thought Judge Roberts' answers brought reassurance, \nif not total peace of mind. But then again, I have no constitutional \nright to total peace of mind as a Senator advising and deciding whether \nto consent on a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  From his statements going back more than 20 years, I was troubled by, \nand in some cases strongly disagreed with, opinions or work he had been \ninvolved in on fundamental questions of racial and gender equality, the \nright of privacy, and the commerce clause. But in each of these areas \nof jurisprudence, his testimony was reassuring.\n  On questions of civil rights, Judge Roberts told the Judiciary \nCommittee of his respect for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights \nAct, as precedents of the Court, and he said they ``were not \nconstitutionally suspect.''\n  He added that he ``certainly agreed that the Voting Rights Act should \nbe extended.''\n  When asked by Senator Kennedy whether he agreed with Justice \nO'Connor's statement in upholding an affirmative action program that it \nwas important to give ``great weight to the real world impact of \naffirmative action policies in universities,'' Judge Roberts answered, \n``You do need to look at the real world impact in these areas and in \nother areas as well.'' He also told Senator Durbin that he believed the \nReagan administration had taken the ``incorrect position'' on Bob Jones \nUniversity.\n  I have said, and I say again, that I found those answers to be \nreassuring.\n\n[[Page S10474]]\n\n  With regard to the right of privacy, Judge Roberts gave a lengthy and \ninformed statement: ``The right of privacy is protected under the \nConstitution in various ways.''\n\n  He said:\n\n       It's protected by the Fourth Amendment which provides that \n     the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, \n     effects, and papers is protected.\n       It's protected under the First Amendment dealing with \n     prohibition on establishment of a religion and guarantee of \n     free exercise.\n       It protects privacy in matters of conscience.\n\n  These are all quotes from Judge Roberts, and I continue:\n\n       It was protected by the framers in areas that were of \n     particular concern to them--: The Third Amendment protecting \n     their homes against the quartering of troops.\n       And in addition the Court--has recognized that personal \n     privacy is a component of the liberty protected by the due \n     process clause.\n       The Court has explained that the liberty protected is not \n     limited to freedom from physical restraint and that it's \n     protected not simply procedurally, but as a substantive \n     matter as well.\n       And those decisions have sketched out, over a period of \n     years, certain aspects of privacy that are protected as part \n     of the liberty in the due process clause of the Constitution.\n\n  I thought that was a learned embrace of the constitutional right of \nprivacy, particularly when combined with Judge Roberts' consistent \nsupport of the principle of stare decisis, respect for the past \ndecisions and precedents of the Court in the interest of stability in \nour judicial system and in our society.\n  Regarding Roe v. Wade, Judge Roberts specifically said, ``That is a \nprecedent entitled to respect under the principles of stare decisis \nlike any other precedent of the Court.''\n  When asked by Senator Feinstein to explain further when, under stare \ndecisis, a Court precedent should be revisited, Judge Roberts said:\n\n       Well, I do think you do have to look at those criteria. And \n     the ones that I pull from these various cases are, first of \n     all, the basic principle that it's not enough that you think \n     that the decision was wrongly decided. That's not enough to \n     justify revisiting it. Otherwise there would be no role for \n     precedent, and no role for stare decisis. Second of all, one \n     basis for reconsidering the issue of workability (And) . . . \n     the issue of settled expectations, the Court has explained \n     you look at the extent to which people have conformed their \n     conduct to the rule and have developed settled expectations \n     in connection with it.\n\n  Again, specifically with regard to Roe v. Wade, I found those answers \nreassuring.\n  One of Judge Roberts' circuit court opinions on the commerce clause \ngave rise to fears that he would constrict Congress's authority to \nlegislate under that important clause. But in his consistent \nexpressions of deference to the work of Congress and his several \nreferences to the Supreme Court's recent decision in Gonzales v. Raich, \nJudge Roberts was once more reassuring.\n  So I will vote to confirm John Roberts and send him off to the \nnonpolitical world of the Supreme Court with high hopes, encouraged by \nthese words of promise he spoke to the Judiciary Committee at the end \nof his opening statement to that committee as follows:\n\n       If I am confirmed, I will be vigilant to protect the \n     independence and integrity of the Supreme Court, and I will \n     work to ensure that it upholds the rule of law and safeguards \n     those liberties that make this land one of endless \n     possibilities for all Americans.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, along with a vote to authorize war, the vote on the \nnomination of a Supreme Court Justice, especially a Chief Justice, is \none of the most important votes that Senators ever cast. Because the \nSupreme Court is the guardian of our most cherished rights and \nliberties, the vote on any Supreme Court nominee has enormous \nsignificance for the everyday lives of all Americans.\n  Supporting or opposing a Supreme Court nominee is not--and should not \nbe--a partisan issue. Indeed, in my time in the United States Senate, I \nhave voted to confirm nearly twice as many Republican nominees to the \nhigh Court as Democratic nominees. To be sure, there are also some \nnominees that I have opposed. But that opposition was not based on the \npolitical party of the President who nominated them, but on the \nrecord--or lack of record--of the testimony and writings of each \nindividual nominee. In hindsight, there are some votes--either for or \nagainst--that I wish I had cast differently, but each vote reflected my \nbest, considered judgment at the time, based on the information and \nrecord before me. That is what the Constitution calls us to do as \nSenators.\n  Yet some of our friends on the other side of the aisle have tried to \nportray a vote against John Roberts as a reflexive, partisan vote \nagainst any nominee by President Bush. Still others have made the \nsweeping statement that any Senator who can't vote for Roberts can't \nvote for any nominee of a Republican President. These broad statements \nare patently wrong and suggest partisan posturing that does serious \ninjustice to the most serious business of giving a lifetime appointment \nto a Justice on the highest Court in the land.\n  With full appreciation and awareness of the Senate's solemn \nobligation to give advice and consent to this all-important Supreme \nCourt nomination by President Bush, I have read the record, asked \nquestions, re-read the record, and asked even more questions. But after \nreviewing the record such as it is, I am unable to support the \nnomination of John Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  Our Founders proclaimed the bedrock principle that we are all created \nequal. But everyone knows that in the early days of our Republic, the \nreality was far different. For more than two centuries, we have \nstruggled, sometimes spilling precious blood, to fulfill that unique \nAmerican promise. The beliefs and sacrifices of millions of Americans \nthroughout the history of our Nation have breathed fuller life and \ngiven real world relevance to our constitutional ideals.\n  With genius and foresight, our founders gave us the tools--the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights--that have aided and encouraged our \nmarch towards progress. The guarantees in our founding documents, as \nenhanced in the wake of a divisive Civil War, have guided our Nation to \nlive up to the promise of liberty, equality and justice for all.\n  We have made much progress. But our work is not finished. We still \nlook to our elected representatives and our independent courts in each \nnew generation to uphold those guiding principles, to continue the \ngreat march of progress, and never to turn back or give up hard-won \ngains.\n  The commitment to this march of progress was the central issue in the \nJohn Roberts hearing. We asked whether he, as Chief Justice, would \nbring the values, ideals and vision to lead us on the path of continued \nequality, fairness, and opportunity for all. Or would he stand in the \nway of progress by viewing the issues that come before the Court in a \nnarrow and legalistic way, thereby slowly turning back the clock and \neroding the civil rights and equal rights gains of the past.\n  We examined the only written record before us and saw John Roberts, \naggressive activist in the Reagan Administration, eager to narrow hard-\nwon rights and liberties, especially voting rights, women's rights, \ncivil rights, and disability rights. As Congressman John Lewis \neloquently stated in our hearings, 25 years ago John Roberts was on the \nwrong side of the nation's struggle to achieve genuine equality of \nopportunity for all Americans. And, despite many invitations to do so, \nJudge Roberts never distanced himself from the aggressively narrow \nviews of that young lawyer in the Reagan administration.\n  Who is John Roberts today? Who will he be as the 17th Chief Justice \nof the United States?\n  John Roberts is a highly intelligent nominee. He has argued 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court, and won more than half of them. He is adept \nat turning questions on their head while giving seemingly appropriate \nanswers. These skills served him well as a Supreme Court advocate. \nThese same skills, however, did not contribute to a productive \nconfirmation process. At the end of the 4 days of hearings, we still \nknow very little more than we knew when we started.\n  John Roberts said that ``the responsibility of the judicial branch is \nto decide particular cases that are presented to them in this area \naccording to the rule of law.''\n  Of course, everyone agrees with that. Each of us took an oath of \noffice to\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nprotect and defend the Constitution, and we take that oath seriously. \nBut the rule of law does not exist in a vacuum. Constitutional values \nand ideals inform all legal decisions. But John Roberts never shared \nwith us his own constitutional values and ideals.\n  He said that a judge should be like an umpire, calling the balls and \nstrikes, but not making the rules.\n  But we all know that with any umpire, the call may depend on your \npoint of view. An instant replay from another angle can show a very \ndifferent result. Umpires follow the rules of the game. But in critical \ncases, it may well depend on where they are standing when they make the \ncall.\n  The same is true with judges.\n  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stated: The life of the law \nhas not been logic; it has been experience.'' He also said that legal \ndecisions are not like mathematics. If they were, we wouldn't need men \nand women of reason and intellect to sit on the bench--we would simply \ninput the facts and the law into some computer program and wait for a \nmechanical result.\n  We all believe in the rule of law. But that is just the beginning of \nthe conversation when it comes to the meaning of the Constitution. \nEveryone follows the same text. But the meaning of the text is often \nimprecise. You must examine the intent of the Framers, the history, and \nthe current reality. And this examination will lead to very different \noutcomes depending on each Justice's constitutional world view. Is it a \nfull and generous view of our rights and liberties and of government \npower to protect the people or a narrow and cramped view of those \nrights and liberties and the government's power to protect ordinary \nAmericans?\n  Based on the record available, there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Judge Roberts view of the rule of law would include as \nparamount the protection of basic rights. The values and perspectives \ndisplayed over and over again in his record cast doubt on his view of \nvoting rights, women's rights, civil rights, and disability rights.\n  In fact, for all the hoopla and razzle-dazzle in four days of \nhearings, there is precious little in the record to suggest that a \nChief Justice John Roberts would espouse anything less that the narrow \nand cramped view that staff attorney John Roberts so strongly advocated \nin the 1980s.\n  On the first day of the hearing, Senator Kohl asked, ``Which of those \npositions were you supportive of, or are you still supportive of, and \nwhich would you disavow?'' Judge Roberts never gave a clear response.\n  Other than his grudging concession during the hearing that he knows \nof no present challenge that would make section 2 of the Voting Rights \nAct ``constitutionally suspect''--a concession that took almost 20 \nminutes of my questioning to elicit--John Roberts has a demonstrated \nrecord of strong opposition to section 2, which is almost universally \nconsidered to be the most powerful and effective civil rights law ever \nenacted. Section 2 outlaws voting practices that deny or dilute the \nright to vote based on race, national origin, or language minority \nstatus--and is largely uncontroversial today.\n  But in 1981 and 1982, Judge Roberts urged the administration to \noppose a bi-partisan amendment to strengthen section 2, and to have, \ninstead, a provision that made it more difficult some say impossible to \nprove discriminatory voting practices and procedures. Although Judge \nRoberts sought to characterize his opposition to the so-called \n``effects test'' as simply following the policy of the Reagan \nadministration, the dozens of memos he wrote on this subject show that \nhe personally believed the administration was right to oppose the \n``effects test.''\n  When Roberts worried that the Senate might reject his position, he \nurged the Attorney General to send a letter to the Senate opposing the \namendment, stating, ``My own view is that something must be done to \neducate the Senators. . . .''\n  He also urged the Attorney General to assert his leadership against \nthe amendment strengthening section 2. He wrote that the Attorney \nGeneral should ``head off any retrenchment efforts'' by the White House \nstaff who were inclined to support the effects test. He consistently \nurged the administration to require voters to bear the heavy burden of \nproving discriminatory intent--even on laws passed a century earlier--\nin order to overturn practices that locked them out of the electoral \nprocess.\n  Judge Roberts wrote at the time that ``violations of section 2 should \nnot be made too easy to prove. . . .'' Remember, when he wrote those \nwords there had been no African-Americans elected to Congress since \nReconstruction from seven of the States with the largest black \npopulations.\n  The year after section 2 was signed into law, Judge Roberts wrote in \na memorandum to the White House Counsel that ``we were burned'' by the \nVoting Rights Act legislation.\n  Given his clear record of hostility to this key voting rights \nprotection, the public has a right to know if he still holds these \nviews. But Judge Roberts gave us hardly a clue.\n  Even when Senator Feingold asked whether Judge Roberts would \nacknowledge today that he had been wrong to oppose the effects test, he \nrefused to give a yes-or-no answer.\n  Judge Roberts responded: ``I'm certainly not an expert in the area \nand haven't followed and have no way of evaluating the relative \neffectiveness of the law as amended or the law as it was prior to \n1982.''\n  So we still don't know whether he supports the basic law against \nvoting practices that result in denying voting rights because of race, \nnational origin, or language minority status.\n  You don't need to be a voting rights expert to say we're better off \ntoday in an America where persons of color can be elected to Congress \nfrom any State in the country. You don't need to be a voting rights \nexpert to know there was a problem in 1982, when no African American \nhad been elected to Congress since Reconstruction from Mississippi, \nFlorida, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, or \nLouisiana--where African Americans were almost a third of the \npopulation--because restrictive election systems effectively denied \nAfrican Americans and other minorities the equal chance to elect \nrepresentatives of their choice.\n  You don't need to be a voting rights expert to say it's better that \nthe Voting Rights Act paved the way for over 9,000 African American \nelected officials and over 6,000 Latino elected officials who have been \nelected and appointed nationwide since the passage of that act.\n  And you don't need to be an expert to recognize that section 2 has \nbenefited Native Americans, Asians and others who historically \nencountered harsh barriers to full political participation.\n  Yet Judge Roberts refused in the hearings to say that his past \nopposition to section 2 doesn't represent his current views.\n  Judge Roberts also refused to disavow his past record of opposition \nto requiring non-discrimination by recipients of federal funds. These \nlaws were adopted because, as President Kennedy said in 1963, \n``[s]imple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers . \n. . contribute, not be spent in any fashion which . . . subsidizes, or \nresults in . . . discrimination.''\n  He supported a cramped and narrow view that would exempt many \nformerly covered institutions from following civil rights laws that \nprotect women, minorities and the disabled. Under that view, the \nenormous subsidies the Federal government gives colleges and \nuniversities in the form of Federal financial aid would not have been \nenough to require them to obey the laws against discrimination. That \nposition was so extreme that it was rejected by the Reagan \nadministration and later by the Supreme Court. Although Judge Roberts \nlater acknowledged that the Reagan administration rejected this view, \nhe would not tell the committee whether he still holds that view today.\n  He also never stated whether he personally agrees with the decision \nin Franklin v. Gwinnett, where the Supreme Court unanimously rejected \nhis argument that title IX, the landmark law against gender \ndiscrimination, provided no monetary relief to a schoolgirl who was \nsexually abused by her schoolteacher.\n  A careful reading of the transcript of his testimony makes clear that \nhe never embraced the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative \naction at the University of Michigan Law School, nor did he expressly \nagree with the Supreme Court decision that all\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\nchildren--including those who are undocumented--have a legal right to \npublic education. He emphasized his agreement with certain rationales \nused by the court in those cases, but he left himself a lot of wiggle \nroom for future reconsideration of those 5-4 decisions.\n  Finally, a number of my colleagues on the committee asked Judge \nRoberts about issues related to women's rights and a woman's right to \nprivacy. On these important matters, too, he never gave answers that \nshed light on his current views.\n  No one is entitled to become Chief Justice of the United States. The \nconfirmation of nominees to our courts--by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate--should not require a leap of faith. Nominees \nmust earn their confirmation by providing us and the American people \nwith full knowledge of the values and convictions they will bring to \ndecisions that may profoundly affect our progress as a nation toward \nthe ideal of equality.\n  Judge Roberts has not done so. His repeated reference to the rule of \nlaw reveals little about the values he would bring to the job of Chief \nJustice of the United States. The record we have puts at serious risk \nthe progress we have made toward our common American vision of equal \nopportunity for all of our citizens.\n  There is clear and convincing evidence that John Roberts is the wrong \nchoice for Chief Justice. I oppose the nomination. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, my constituents have been asking me, \n``Who will President Bush nominate for the second Supreme Court \nvacancy?'' The question reminds me of a story about a punter from \nCalifornia who went all the way to the University of Alabama to play \nfor Coach Bear Bryant. Day after day, this punter would kick it more \nthan 70 yards in practice. Day after day, Coach Bear Bryant watched the \npunter kick it 70 yards and said nothing. Finally the young kicker came \nover to the coach and said: Coach, I came all the way from California \nto Alabama to be coached by you. I have been out here kicking for a \nweek, and you haven't said a word to me.\n  Coach Bryant looked at him and said: Son, when you start kicking it \nless than 70 yards, I will come over there and remind you what you were \ndoing when you kicked it more than 70 yards.\n  That is the way I feel about President Bush and the next Supreme \nCourt nominee. My only suggestion for him would be respectfully to \nsuggest that he try to remember what he was thinking when he appointed \nJohn Roberts and to do it again. Especially for those of us who have \nbeen trained in and who have respect for the legal profession, it has \nbeen a pleasure to watch the Roberts nomination and confirmation \nprocess. It is difficult to overstate how good he seems to be. He has \nthe resume that most talented law students only dream of: editor of the \nHarvard Law Review and a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly.\n  I was a law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom in New Orleans, who \nregarded Henry Friendly as one of the two or three best Federal \nappellate judges of the last century. In fact, we law clerks used to \nsit around and think about ideal Federal panels on which three judges \nwould sit. Sometimes Judge Wisdom and Judge Friendly would sit on the \nsame panel, and we tried to think of a third judge. There was a judge \nnamed Allgood. We thought if we could get a panel of judges named \nWisdom, Friendly, and Allgood, we would have the ideal panel.\n  So Judge Roberts learned from Judge Friendly. Then he was law clerk \nto the Chief Justice of the United States. Add to that his time in the \nSolicitor General's Office, where only the best of the best lawyers are \ninvited to serve; then his success as an advocate before the Supreme \nCourt both in private and in public practice. Then what is especially \nappealing is his demeanor, his modesty both in philosophy and in \nperson, something that is not always so evident in a person of superior \nintelligence and such great accomplishment. Then there are the stories \nwe heard during the confirmation process of private kindnesses to \ncolleagues with whom he worked.\n  Judge Roberts' testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \ndemonstrated all those qualities, as well as qualities of good humor \nand intelligence, and an impressive command of the body of law that \nSupreme Court Justices must consider. Those televised episodes, which I \ntook time to watch a number of, could be the basis for many law school \nclasses or many civics classes. Judge Roberts brings, as he repeatedly \nassured Senators on the committee, no agenda to the Supreme Court. He \nunderstands that he did not write the Constitution but that he is to \ninterpret it, that he does not make laws--Congress does that--but that \nhe is to apply them. He demonstrates that he understands the Federal \nsystem. It is not too much to say that for a devotee of the law, \nwatching John Roberts in those hearings was like having the privilege \nof watching Michael Jordan play basketball at the University of North \nCarolina in the early 1980s or watching Chet Atkins as a sessions \nguitarist in the 1950s in Nashville.\n  One doesn't have to be a great student of the law to recognize there \nis unusual talent here.\n  If Judge Roberts' professional qualifications and temperament are so \nuniversally acclaimed, why do we now hear so much talk of changing the \nrules and voting only for those Justices who we can be assured are ``on \nour side''? That would be the wrong direction for the Senate to go. In \nthe first place, history teaches us that those who try to predict how \nSupreme Court nominees will decide cases are almost always wrong. Felix \nFrankfurter surprised Franklin Roosevelt. Hugo Black surprised the \nSouth. David Souter surprised almost everybody. In the second place, \ncourts were never intended to be set up as political bodies that could \nbe relied upon to be predictably on one side or the other of a \ncontroversy. That is what Congress is for. That is why we go through \nelections. That is why we are here. Courts are set up to do just the \nopposite, to hear the facts and apply the law and the Constitution in \ncontroversial matters. Who will have confidence in a system of justice \nthat is deliberately rigged to be on one side or the other despite what \nthe facts and the law are?\n  Finally, failing to give broad approval to an obviously well-\nqualified nominee such as Judge Roberts--just because he is ``not on \nyour side''--reduces the prestige of the Supreme Court. It jeopardizes \nits independence. It makes it less effective as it seeks to perform its \nindispensable role in our constitutional republic.\n  For these three reasons, Republican and Democratic Senators, after \nfull hearings and discussion, have traditionally given well-qualified \nnominees for Supreme Court Justice an overwhelming vote of approval. I \nam not talking about the ancient past. I am talking about the members \nof today's Supreme Court, none of whom are better qualified than Judge \nRoberts. For example, Justice Breyer was confirmed by a vote of 87 to 9 \nin a Congress composed of 57 Democrats and 43 Republicans. Justice \nGinsburg was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3 in the same Congress. \nJustice Souter was confirmed by a vote of 90 to 9 in a Congress \ncomposed of 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans. Justice Kennedy was \nconfirmed by a vote of 97 to 0 in a Congress composed of 55 Democrats, \n45 Republicans. Justice Scalia, no shrinking violet, was confirmed by a \nvote of 98 to 0 in a Congress composed of 47 Democrats as well as 53 \nRepublicans. Justice O'Connor was confirmed by a vote of 99 to 0 in a \nCongress composed of 46 Democrats and 53 Republicans. And Justice \nStevens was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0 in a Congress composed of 61 \nDemocrats and 37 Republicans. The only close vote, of those justices on \nthis Court, was for the nomination of Justice Thomas, following certain \nquestions of alleged misconduct by the nominee. Thomas was confirmed by \na vote of 52 to 48. However, even in that vote, 11 Democrats crossed \nthe aisle to support the nominee.\n\n  If almost all Republican Senators can vote for Justice Ginsburg, a \nformer counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, and a nominee \nwho also\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\ndeclined, as Judge Roberts occasionally did, to answer questions so as \nnot to jeopardize the independence of the Court on cases that might \ncome before her. If every single Democratic Senator could vote for \nJustice Scalia, then why cannot virtually every Senator in this Chamber \nvote to confirm John Roberts?\n  I was Governor for 8 years in Tennessee. I appointed about 50 judges. \nI looked for the qualities that Judge Roberts has so amply \ndemonstrated: intelligence, good character, respect for the law, \nrestraint, and respect for those who might come before the court. I did \nnot ask one of my nominees how he or she might vote on abortion or on \nimmigration or on taxation. I appointed the first woman circuit judge, \nas well as men. I appointed the first African-American chancellor and \nthe first African-American State supreme court justice. I appointed \nsome Democrats as well as Republicans. That process, looking back, has \nserved our State well. It helped to build respect for the independence \nand fairness of our judiciary.\n  I hope that we Senators will try to do the same as we consider this \nnomination for the Supreme Court of the United States. It is unlikely \nin our lifetime that we will see a nominee for the Supreme Court whose \nprofessional accomplishments, demeanor, and intelligence is superior to \nthat of John Roberts. If that is so, then I would hope that my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will do what they did for all but \none member of the current Supreme Court and most of the previous \nJustices in our history and vote to confirm him by an overwhelming \nmajority.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am going to vote for Judge \nRoberts as Chief Justice. I will be making a lengthy statement later on \nin the day as there is time allowed, since the time allocated right now \nunder the previous order is very limited.\n  However, I did want to take this opportunity to say, with the fresh \nmemories of Katrina and now Rita, I think it is incumbent upon us to \nfinally get our collective heads as Americans out of the sand and face \nup to the fact that we are dependent on foreign energy sources, and \nthat since we cannot drill our way out of the problem because the \ndevelopment of those resources of oil would take years and years to \ncomplete, one of the great natural resources of this country is coal.\n  Of course, that does not affect my State of Florida; we have 300 \nyears of reserves of coal, and we now have the technology to cook this \ncoal with highly intense heat in what is known as a coal gasification \nproject. It burns off the gas, and that is a clean-burning gas.\n  It would be my hope that this country will start getting serious \nabout weaning ourselves from dependence on foreign oil by using our \ntechnology to address this problem.\n  So that is what I wanted to share with my colleagues, since there \nwere a couple of minutes under the previous order, and then I will be \nmaking my statement about Judge Roberts later in the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the time be extended \nuntil the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJohn G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. By his \nnomination of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice, President Bush has not \nonly fulfilled his constitutional responsibility but he has \ndemonstrated sound judgment and great wisdom by this nomination.\n  In bipartisan fashion, our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have \nsimilarly demonstrated such judgment and wisdom in recommending that we \nconsent to that nomination. I urge my colleagues to follow the \ncommittee's recommendation.\n  Judge Roberts is an able jurist, a decent man, and he should be the \nnext Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Both by \nhis professional career and his answers to questions during the \ncommittee's consideration of his nomination, Judge Roberts has \ndemonstrated his unwavering fidelity to the Constitution and commitment \nto the rule of law.\n  ``The rule of law'' is a phrase often used in public discourse. It \ntrips easily off the tongue. Too often, it seems, we recite it with a \nbanality that comes with the assumption that it is self-evident and \nself-executing. It is neither.\n  Jefferson wisely taught that eternal vigilance is the price of \nliberty. So, too, the rule of law requires both vigilance and \ncontinuous oversight.\n  Far beyond fulfilling the constitutional responsibilities of this \nbody, the confirmation process involving Judge Roberts has served as an \nessential reminder of the constitutional role of judges and the \njudiciary under our Republican form of government. At a time when too \nmany of those in the judicial branch have sought to use their lifetime-\ntenured position to advance their own personal ideological or political \npreferences in deciding matters which come before them, at a time when \ntoo many within the legal, media, and political elites have sought to \nrecast the role of the judiciary into a superlegislature, approving of \nand even urging judges to supplant their views for those of the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, Judge Roberts has served to \nremind us that such actions and such views are anticonstitutional and \ncontrary to the rule of law itself.\n  The American people have listened to Judge Roberts in this regard. \nThey like what they have heard because it rings true with what we all \nlearned but some have forgotten, from high school civics class and what \nwe profess in doctrines of separation of powers among the branches of \nour Federal Government.\n  Let me repeat some of what Judge Roberts has said:\n\n       Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around.\n       Judges are not to legislate, they're not to execute the \n     laws.\n       Judges need to appreciate that the legitimacy of their \n     action is confined to interpreting the law and not making it.\n       Judges are not individuals promoting their own particular \n     views, but they are supposed to be doing their best to \n     interpret the law, to interpret the Constitution, according \n     to the rule of law, not their own preferences, not their own \n     personal beliefs.\n\n  These are simple but profound statements. They go to the heart of our \nconstitutional system and what we mean by the rule of law.\n\n  As Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts will not only \nserve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but he will also serve \nas the leader of the entire Federal judiciary, setting the standards, \nshowing the way, and speaking for an entire branch of our Federal \nGovernment. Every judge in our Federal system and every person who \naspires to join its ranks at some future date should hear and receive \nJudge Roberts' words and seek to follow them with fidelity. A lot is \nriding on their willingness to do so.\n  Judicial independence is another phrase bantered about of late by \njudges and others who feel threatened by legitimate congressional \noversight of the judiciary. Judicial independence does not exist to \nshield judges from congressional and public scrutiny from improper \njudicial actions. Judicial independence does not shield judges from the \ninquiry of impeachment and removal from office for lawless actions on \nthe bench. Federal judges, appointed for life, subject to removal only \nupon impeachment, are afforded this extraordinary power precisely to \npermit them to follow the law, even when following the law may be \npolitically unpopular.\n  Describing his own fidelity to the Constitution and to the rule of \nlaw, Judge Roberts told the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       As a judge I have no agenda. I have a guide in the \n     Constitution and the laws and the precedents of the Court, \n     and those are what I would apply with an open mind, after \n     fully and fairly considering the arguments and assessing the \n     considered views of my colleagues on the bench.\n\n  We should confirm Judge Roberts not merely because he said that; we \nshould\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\nconfirm him because he has lived it. We can ask no more of our judges \nbut we must ask no less. Let this be the standard we apply to this \nnominee and to future nominees, both to the Supreme Court and to lower \ncourts.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm the President's nomination of Judge \nJohn G. Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10478-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What has \nbeen going on for virtually the entire time I have been in the Senate, \ngoing on 8 years, and certainly in the last 5 years, has been a \nrigorous and vigorous debate over the role of courts in American life. \nThe American people have become very concerned that those we appoint \nand confirm to the Federal judiciary and have been given a lifetime \nappointment, as a result of that are unaccountable to the American \npeople; that they are not, therefore, any longer a part of the \ndemocratic process and can only be removed from office on causes \nrelating to an impeachment or their own resignation or death.\n  This has raised concerns because these lifetime-appointed, \nunaccountable officials of our Government have set about to carry out \npolitical agendas. There is no other way to say it. I hate to be \nnegative about our courts because I believe in our courts. The courts I \npracticed before, the Federal courts in Alabama, are faithful to the \nlaw. If a Democratic judge or Republican judge, a liberal or \nconservative, is faithful to the law, I do not see a problem. \nOverwhelmingly, in the courts of America today, justice is done.\n  But we have a growing tendency among the members of our Supreme \nCourt. Many of them have been there for many years. It strikes me that \nperhaps they have lost some discipline. They have forgotten they were \nappointed and not anointed. As my good friend said--a former judge, now \ndeceased, Judge Thomas, in the Southern District of Alabama: Remember, \nyou were appointed, not anointed.\n  I think they have forgotten that. I believe they have begun to think \nit is important for them and the courts to settle disputed social \nissues in the country; that they are somehow an elite group of \nguardians of the public health and that they should protect us from \nourselves on occasion.\n  We have seen that. We have seen a series of opinions that, as a \nlawyer, I believe cannot be justified as being consistent with the \nwords or any fair interpretation of the words of the Constitution of \nthe United States. That is what a judge is sworn to uphold.\n  These issues are important, as I said, because if this is true, and \nif judges are going beyond what they have been empowered to do, and \nthey are twisting or redefining or massaging the words of the \nConstitution to justify them in an unjustified act of imposing a \npersonal view on America, then that is a serious problem indeed, and I \nam afraid that is what we have.\n  They say it is good. The law schools, some of them, these professors, \nbelieve judges should be strong and vigorous and active and should \nexpand the law and that the Constitution is living. So, therefore \n``living'' means, I suppose, you can make it say what you want it to \nsay this very moment.\n  But Professor Van Alstyne at Duke once said to a judicial conference \nI attended many years ago: If you love this Constitution, if you really \nlove it, if you respect it, you will enforce it--``it''--as it is \nwritten. When judges don't do that they therefore do not respect the \nConstitution. In fact, they create a situation in which a future court \nmay be less bound by that great document. It can erode our great \nliberties in ways we cannot possibly imagine today.\n  The name of Justice Ginsburg sometimes came up at Judge Roberts \nhearings because of her liberal positions on a number of issues before \nshe went on the bench. Yet she was confirmed overwhelmingly. An \nargument was made therefore Judge Roberts, who has mainstream views, \nought to be confirmed. She just recently made a speech to the New York \nBar Association. She said she was not happy being the only female \nJustice on the Court but she stated:\n\n       Any woman will not do. There are some women who might be \n     appointed who would not advance human rights or women's \n     rights.\n\n  What about other groups' rights? Do you need to advance all those \nother rights, too? And what is a right?\n\n  Then she dealt with the question of foreign law being cited by the \nSupreme Court of the United States. We have had a spate of judges, \nsometimes in opinions and sometimes in speeches, making comments that \nsuggest their interpretation of the law was influenced by what foreign \npeople have done in other countries. She said:\n\n       I will take enlightenment wherever I can get it. I don't \n     want to stop at the national boundary.\n\n  Then she noted that she had a list of qualified female nominees, but \nthe President hadn't consulted with her--and I would hope not, frankly.\n  Why are we concerned about citing foreign law? We are concerned \nbecause this is an element of activism. Our historic liberties are \nthreatened when we turn to foreign law for answers.\n  This is a bad philosophy and a bad tendency because we are not bound \nby the European Union. We didn't adopt whatever constitution or laws or \ndocuments they have in the European Union. What does our Constitution \nsay?\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  Not some other one. Not one you would like, not the way you might \nlike to have had it written, but this one. That is the one that we \npassed. That is the one the people have ratified. That is the one the \npeople have amended. And that is the one a judge takes an oath to \nenforce whether he or she likes it or not.\n  You tell me how an opinion out of Europe or Canada or any other place \nin the world has any real ability to help interpret a Constitution, a \nprovision of which may have been adopted 200 years ago.\n  I submit not.\n  You see, we have to call on our judges to be faithful to that. I do \nnot want, I do not desire, and the President of the United States has \nsaid repeatedly that he does not want, he does not desire that a judge \npromote his political or social agenda. That is what we fight out in \nthis room right here, right amongst all of us. We battle it out, and I \nam answerable to the people in my State, the State of Alabama. That is \nwho I answer to, and each one of us answers to the people in our \nstates; and the President answers to all the people of the United \nStates. That is where the political decisions are made, and we leave \nlegal decisions in the court.\n  My time to speak is limited. I will close with this: We have never \nhad a judge come before this Senate, in my opinion, who has in any way \ncome close to expressing so beautifully and so richly and so \nintelligently the proper role of a court. Judge Roberts used a common \nphrase: You should be a neutral umpire. Certainly he should be that. \nAbsolutely that is a good phrase.\n  A judge should be modest. He should decide the facts and the law \nbefore the\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\ncourt, not using that in an expansive way to impose personal views \nbeyond the requirement of that court; that a court does not seek to set \nout to establish any result, it simply decides the dispute that is \nbefore a court.\n  That is why I think we have had a long political battle over this. \nFrankly, Senator after Senator has been elected after committing to \nsupport the kind of judges President Bush has said he would nominate \nand has, in fact, nominated. If we continue this process, we will \nreturn our courts to that wonderful station they need to always hold; \nthat is, they will be neutral, fair, objective arbiters, will not \nlegislate in any way based upon their personal views, their personal \nbiases, their political opinions, their social agendas to affect or \ninfect and corrupt their decisions as they go about their daily jobs. \nJohn Roberts understands that completely. He has articulated that \nprinciple far more eloquently than I could ever do, and he has won the \nsupport of the people. Everywhere I go, people tell me how magnificent \nthey thought he has been in explaining these issues.\n  It is what the American people want. The President has given us that. \nAnd I believe, in the long run, this could be a turning point in which \nwe take politics out of the courtroom, leave the politics to the \npoliticians, and put the courts back in the business of deciding the \nlegal cases.\n  I think my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise on the advice and consent question \nof Judge John Roberts.\n  Before I address my judgment on that, I would like to pay tribute for \na second to Sandra Day O'Connor and the late William Rehnquist.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor's announced retirement caused the nomination by \nthe President of John Roberts, and subsequently the untimely passing of \nChief Justice Rehnquist afforded the opportunity for that nomination to \nbe for Chief Justice as well. In the anticipated furor of this debate \nand confirmation, the credit never was given that should have been to \nJustice O'Connor or Justice Rehnquist.\n  Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. She served with honor and distinction. She wrote brilliantly, \nconcisely, and succinctly, and, most importantly of all, she had an \ninsight and wisdom second to none. In fact, I commend to everyone her \nfinal writing, her dissenting opinion on the eminent domain case, if \nyou want to see a Justice who was well grounded and interested in the \nAmerican people.\n  Judge Rehnquist was the 16th Justice of the United States, an \noutstanding individual of immense capacity, dedication, and commitment \nto the United States of America. His loss is a tragedy, and the \nretirement of Justice O'Connor is a loss to the Court.\n  But now we are confronted with our constitutional responsibility as \nMembers of the Senate to address the question of John Roberts, the \nnominee of President Bush.\n  I come to this debate somewhat differently than a lot who preceded \nme. I am not an attorney. Before my election to the Senate, I was a \nbusinessman, always had been, always will be when I leave. I come also \nas a new Member of the Senate. In fact, a year ago today, I was engaged \nin a debate in Columbus, GA, with my Democratic opponent for the Senate \nseat. The issue that night of that debate was clearly what was the role \nof the Senate in terms of the confirmation of a Justice to the Supreme \nCourt and the issue of the day, which was filibuster. It was only a \nyear ago when whether a judge could even get an up-or-down vote was a \nmajor question on the floor of the Senate.\n  I happen to have been elected, obviously, to that Senate seat, sworn \nin on January 4, and came to the Senate to find that advice and consent \nwas impossible because filibuster was the rule of the day. Then a \nunique thing happened. Fourteen Members of this body made a deal--and I \ncommend them for it. They broke a logjam, and very quickly we were able \nto confirm six appointments to the court, some who had languished as \nlong--as in the case of Judge Pryor--as 4 years.\n  No one knew Justice O'Connor would announce her retirement a few \nweeks later, nor that Chief Justice Rehnquist would die, but all of us \nknew that when an appointment came, the agreement that had been made \nmight be put in jeopardy because it set forth a standard that \nfilibuster might be necessary under extraordinary circumstances. There \nwere many who anticipated whomever the President appointed would be in \nand of itself an extraordinary circumstance.\n  Then along came John G. Roberts, who is an extraordinary man.\n  I will vote to confirm the President's nomination of John G. Roberts \nas Chief Justice of the United States. In large measure, I will do so \nbecause of who and what John G. Roberts is, has been, and will be--a \ndecent and humble man of immense intelligence and demonstrated \ncompassion.\n  We will hear and I have heard earlier today some in this Chamber who \nwill tell us that he never answered any questions; we don't know where \nhe stands. Well, to me, those are simply code words for them saying \nthey couldn't pin him down, tie him in knots, or prejudice him for \nfuture decisions. Personally, I don't want a Justice who any lawyer can \ntie in knots or predispose. I want a judge I can stand before and count \non the fact that he will call them like he sees them, that he won't be \nin one corner or the other, that he will do what is right, what is \ndictated by the law and the Constitution.\n  In my 33 years in business, I was in court from time to time--as few \ntimes as possible. But all of us have been. I served as a foreman of a \ngrand jury. I served on a petit jury. I have been, in the case as a \nbusinessman, in court myself. I don't want to go into a courtroom where \nI know I have a judge who has a bent, a predisposition, or an agenda. I \nwant to go before a judge who wants to treat me under the law as \nequally and as fairly as my opponent on the other side, who will rule \nbased on the facts, based on what is before him, based on the law, and \nbased on our Constitution. I want a Justice who will study the law, \nlisten to my side of the case, listen to the other side, and call it as \nhe sees it.\n  In his introduction, John Roberts said he was an umpire and he was a \nhumble man. That says a lot about John Roberts. If there is anything we \nneed on the bench today, it is those who see themselves umpires making \nthe right call, the right decision the right time in every single case, \nfor there is no instant replay on the Supreme Court of the United \nStates of America. As Judge Roberts said in his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, just as people do not go to a baseball \ngame to watch the umpires, they do not go to court to watch the judge. \nThey go to court to get a fair decision, unvarnished and untainted.\n  I was in Columbus, GA, during the break in August. I did an education \nlistening session. After it was over, I met with some 6th grade kids of \nthat school, some kids I gave the chance to ask me questions, some \nchildren I gave the chance to find out what they would like to know \nfrom a Senator.\n  A little girl by the name of Maleka said: Senator Isakson, I have one \nquestion for you. What is the hardest decision you are going to have to \nmake in the U.S. Senate? What is the most important decision you are \ngoing to have to make in the U.S. Senate?\n  That was about a month ago today.\n  The first answer I gave her was confirming Justices to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  It came to my mind instinctively because we all knew the nomination \nof Judge Roberts had been made and we would make that decision. All of \nus in here also know that the Constitution specifically says it is our \nadvice and our consent which makes that determination.\n  We also know that the third leg of the stool which is the great \ngenius of the United States of America is the judicial branch, which is \nequal and separate from the courts and the executive. But it is also in \nthese confirmations where the executive, the legislative, and the \njudicial come together. There is no more important decision made by a \nMember of the Senate than who the next Justice or Chief Justice of the \nUnited States will be.\n  I close my remarks by telling you this: John G. Roberts has made the \ntoughest decision I will have to make an easy one. He is a class act. \nHe is an\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nintellect. He is an honorable man. He is a man who, when the cases of \njustice in America are decided before our Supreme Court, will call it \nas he sees it, listen to both sides, rule on the law, and understand \nthe Constitution. You can ask no more of a man than John Roberts has \ndemonstrated time and again. That is precisely what he will deliver.\n  Thursday at 11:30 I will be honored to cast my vote on behalf of the \npeople of Georgia to confirm John G. Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice \nof the United States in the history of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10480-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

ROBERTS, JR., TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED \n                           STATES--Continued\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe the time will be allocated to my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, but he has agreed to allow me \nto use his time to speak. He will speak at a later time today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under the control of the \nDemocrats from 3:45 on, so the Senator can speak.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the outcome of this nomination is now all \nbut certain. In that regard, what I am about to say will have little \nimpact on the fate of this nominee.\n\n[[Page S10482]]\n\n  Nevertheless, it is exceedingly rare that the Senate is asked to \nconsider a nominee to fill a vacancy in the office of Chief Justice of \nthe United States. Indeed, there have only been 16 Chief Justices in \nour Nation's history. Further, it is difficult to overstate the \nimportance of the next Chief Justice on our Nation's future.\n  For these reasons, I feel compelled to come to the floor today to \nexplain how I will vote on the nomination of John Roberts to be our \ncountry's next Chief Justice.\n  Every vote we cast as Senators is important. But some votes are more \nimportant than others. In my view, the most important votes that we \ncast in this body are those giving the President authority to go to \nwar, those amending the United States Constitution, and those that fill \nvacancies in the judicial branch.\n  These votes, more than any others, can permanently affect the \nessential character of our Nation. They involve fundamental questions \nabout whether our Nation will spend blood and treasure in armed \nconflict; about whether the cornerstone document of our Republic will \nbe modified; and about the make-up of a third, separate, coequal branch \nof our Government--the principal duty of which is to make real for each \nAmerican the promise of equal justice under the law.\n  Of the votes that we cast regarding judicial nominees, a small \npercentage is cast for Supreme Court Justice. An even smaller number of \nvotes is cast for Chief Justice. In nearly a quarter of a century in \nthis body, I have had the privilege of casting 8,415 votes--more than \nall but 16 of our colleagues. This is only the 10th time in that period \nthat I have had the duty to consider a vote for Supreme Court Justice. \nAnd it is only the second time that I have considered a nominee for \nChief Justice.\n  In casting these votes--and in casting other votes for judicial \nnominees--I have supported the vast majority of candidates nominated by \nthis and prior presidents. That includes nominees to the Supreme Court. \nI have supported six of the last nine nominees to the High Court. Of \nthe current president's 219 judicial nominees, only five have failed to \nwin confirmation. I, like all of our colleagues, have supported the \noverwhelming majority of these nominees.\n  In reviewing a nomination for the judicial branch, I believe the \nSenate has a duty to undertake a higher degree of independent review \nthan might be appropriate for a nomination to the Executive branch. \nThere are two reasons for that heightened degree of scrutiny:\n  First, because we are considering nominees who will populate--and in \nthis case, lead--a separate, coequal branch of government; and\n  Second, because Article III nominees, when confirmed, are confirmed \nfor life. That makes them unique among all other Federal officials.\n  In reviewing judicial nominees, I have never imposed any litmus \ntests.\n  Indeed, I have supported nominees--including to the Supreme Court--\nwhose views and philosophy I did not necessarily share. I did so \nbecause they met what I consider to be the three crucial qualifications \nthat every judicial nominee must meet:\n  First, that they possess the legal and intellectual competence \nrequired to discharge the responsibilities of their office;\n  Second, that they possess the qualities of character required of a \njudge or justice--including reason, wisdom, and fairmindedness; and\n  Third, that they possess a commitment to equal justice for all under \nthe law, which is the legal principle that is the foundation for all of \nour laws.\n  With respect to the nomination now before the Senate, I have reviewed \nthe record. I have read the briefs, if you will, of both sides. I have \nheard the case both for and against Judge Roberts.\n  In so doing, I would be remiss not to thank the distinguished \nchairman Senator Specter, and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nPatrick Leahy of Vermont, for the extraordinary service they have \nrendered to the Senate and to the country. The hearings into this \nnomination were thorough, thoughtful, and deliberate, and I have \nwatched many over the years. They are to be congratulated for the \nmanner in which they led the committee in discharging its duties.\n  I approached Judge Roberts' nomination with an open mind. I harbored \nno hidden proclivity to oppose his nomination because of his \nconservative record. Nor did I carry a presumption to support it \nbecause he is ``the President's choice'', or because he was described \nby the President as a ``gentleman'', or because of his stellar legal \ncredentials.\n  The written and testimonial record with respect to this nominee is \nmixed. It does lead this Senator to unequivocally conclude that his \nnomination should be supported or opposed. For those of us concerned \nabout the right to privacy, about a woman's right to choose, about \nequal opportunity, about environmental protection, about ensuring that \nall are truly equal before the bar of justice--in short, for those of \nus concerned about keeping America strong and free and just--this is no \neasy matter.\n  The record in several respects provides cold comfort for those of us \nseeking to preserve and expand America's commitment to equal justice \nfor all. I was concerned about numerous written statements he made \nduring his previous stints in Federal service--about voting rights, \nabout the right to privacy, about Roe v. Wade, about equality between \nmen and women, about restricting the ability of courts to strike down \nracially discriminatory laws and practices, and about environmental \nprotection.\n  Nor did Judge Roberts' hearing testimony do much to dispel my \nconcerns about those earlier statements. On multiple occasions, he \nexplained that he was reflecting the views of his superiors, rather \nthan voicing his own personal opinions. Yet, when invited to explain \nhis personal views, he repeatedly demurred--explaining that to state \nhis own views would potentially telegraph his position on sensitive \nmatters that could come before the Court.\n  I can certainly understand the nominee's reluctance to prejudge a \nmatter. No responsible nominee would do that; it would be inherently \ninjudicious to do so. Yet, it is hard to escape the conclusion that \nthese were answers of convenience, as well as duty.\n  At the very least, his refusal to answer certain questions leaves us \nwanting. We certainly know less about this nominee than many of us \nwould like to know.\n  For that reason, I understand and respect the decision by those of \nour colleagues--including the Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Biden, Senator Feinstein, and others--who feel that \nthey cannot vote to confirm this nominee in large part because the \nSenate has been denied additional information about his background and \nviews.\n  Nevertheless, we are required to make a judgment based on the \ninformation we know, as well as in consideration of what we do not \nknow. The record is incomplete. But unfortunately it is all we have. It \ncannot and should not be read selectively. The question for this \nSenator is not whether the record is all I would like it to be, but \nwhether it provides sufficient information to determine whether the \nnominee meets the three qualifications I have just set forth--\ncompetence, character, and a commitment to equal justice.\n  On the question of competence, there is absolutely no doubt that John \nRoberts possesses the capabilities required to serve not only as a \nJustice on the Supreme Court, but as Chief Justice, as well. He has \nbeen described as one of finest lawyers of his generation--if not the \nfinest. His academic and legal qualifications are superior. Even those \nwho oppose his nomination readily agree that he has proven himself an \noutstanding advocate and jurist.\n  On the question of character, there is no real question that this \nnominee possesses the qualities of mind and temperament that make him \nwell-suited to serve as Chief Justice. He impressed me as someone who \nis personally decent, level-headed, and respectful of different points \nof view. In his answers to questions and in his demeanor, he convinced \nme that he will exercise judgment based on the law and the facts of a \nparticular matter.\n  Judge Roberts demonstrated that he understands the unsurpassing \nimportance of separating his personal views--including his religious \nviews--from his judicial reasoning in arriving at decisions. And I \nbelieve that his decisions as a Federal appellate judge demonstrate his \nability to do that.\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\n  I was particularly intrigued and impressed by Judge Roberts' \ndiscussion of former Justice Robert Jackson. Justice Jackson was known \nfor opinions protecting first amendment freedoms and placing principled \nchecks on the power of the President. These opinions--including Board \nof Education v. Barnette, the ``Steel Seizure Cases'', and the \nKorematsu case--were all the more remarkable for the fact that Jackson \nwent to the Court directly from his position as Attorney General under \nPresident Roosevelt. In the Youngstown case, Justice Jackson actually \ndisagreed with a position he had taken as Attorney General.\n  In these and other cases, Jackson demonstrated a remarkable capacity \nfor independent, progressive thought, and a deep commitment to uphold \nthe constitutional rights that belong to each and every American, \nregardless of their station in life. Judge Roberts cited Justice \nJackson with admiration. That provides some reassurance to those of us \nlooking for him to demonstrate an understanding that as a Justice of \nthe Supreme Court he will carry no brief for a particular party or \npresident, but rather for the Constitution and the people it governs.\n  On the question of competence, and on the question of character, this \nnominee clears the high bar required of a Supreme Court Justice. We are \nleft, then, to consider the question of his commitment to the \nfundamental principle of our law: that all men and women are entitled \nto equal justice.\n  In so doing, we do not have a crystal ball. We cannot say with \ncertainty how he will rule on the critical issues that the Court is \nlikely to face in months and years to come: on privacy, on choice, on \ncivil rights, on the death penalty, on presidential power, and many \nothers.\n  However, I believe that the record contains sufficient information to \nprovide a reasonable expectation of how Judge Roberts will go about \nmaking decisions if confirmed. His approach, in my view, is certainly \nwithin the mainstream of judicial thinking. Allow me to briefly discuss \ntwo critical aspects of that approach as I see it.\n  First, he demonstrated an appropriate respect for precedent. This \nrespect is the first and most important quality that a good judge must \npossess. If a judge is unwilling or unable to consider settled \nprecedent, then the law is unsettled--and our citizenry cannot know \nwith assurance that the rights, privileges, and duties that they \npossess today will continue to exist in the future.\n  This is a delicate area, for the obvious reason that some precedents \ndeserve to be overruled. Cases such as the Dred Scott decision and \nPlessy v. Ferguson come to mind. But in many other instances, precedent \nis of enormous importance in maintaining and strengthening our system \nof laws.\n  Judge Roberts acknowledged as much in his discussion of the right to \nprivacy. In vigorous questioning by the Judiciary Committee, he made \nclear that he respects Supreme Court precedents that recognize a \nconstitutional right to privacy. He stated further that this right is \nprotected by the liberty clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the \nConstitution, as well as by the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Amendments. Moreover, \nhe asserted that this right is a substantive one, and not merely \nprocedural. This view stands in stark contrast to that of Justice \nScalia, for instance, who believes that the right to privacy has no \nbasis in the Constitution.\n  In discussing the right to privacy, Judge Roberts favorably cited \nboth the Griswold and Eisenstadt cases, which recognize the right to \nprivacy with respect to birth control for married and unmarried \ncouples, respectively. Moreover, he stated that Roe v. Wade and Planned \nParenthood v. Casey are settled law and therefore deserving of respect \nunder principles of stare decisis.\n  The second aspect of his approach to judging that places him squarely \nin the mainstream is his view of the role of judges in our \nconstitutional system. He made clear that he rejects theories that view \nthe judicial function as one where the Constitution is considered as a \nstatic document. He rejects in my view, the notion that the job of the \njudge is to place himself into a time machine and decide cases as if he \nor she lived in the 19th century.\n  In his view, the Framers intended the Constitution, by its very \nlanguage, to live in and apply to changing times. A judge by that view \nis neither a mechanic nor a historian.\n  Words like ``liberty,'' ``equal protection'' and ``due process'' are \nnot sums to be solved, but vital principles that must be applied to the \nuntidiness of human circumstances--including those circumstances that \nthe Framers themselves could never have envisioned.\n  In that sense, the ``original intent'' of the Framers, if you will, \nwas that their marvelous handiwork be interpreted in light of modern \nconcepts of liberty and equal justice--not just those concepts as they \nwere understood 218 years ago.\n  At the same time, Judge Roberts rejects the notion that judges may \nact as superlegislators. His discussion of the 1905 Lochner case which \ncrippled the ability of Congress to pass laws protecting children and \nworkers--was pivotal in articulating the dangers of judges who \nsubstitute their policy preferences for those of the legislative \nbranch.\n  Here again, in my view, he reiterated his view that judges act on the \nbasis of the facts and the law, not their own personal preferences. In \nthis regard, it is worth noting that he indicated a willingness to \nexamine recent Supreme Court decisions that severely restrict \nCongressional authority under the Commerce Clause to protect the public \nwell-being.\n  Mr. President, in closing, today I am deciding not to vote on the \nbasis of my fears about this nominee and I have them Rather, I choose \nto vote on the basis of my hopes that he will fulfill his potential to \nbe a superb Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He is a person of \noutstanding ability and strong character who possesses in my view a \ndeep commitment to the law and the principle of equal justice for all.\n  As Chief Justice, John Roberts will have a great deal to do with what \nkind of country America will become in the 21st century. On the \npersonal note, he will have a lot to say about what kind of lives my \ntwo young daughters will lead.\n  His relative youth, his intellect, his decency, and his dedication to \njustice provide him with a unique opportunity to shape the destiny of \nour Nation. For the sake of children like my daughters who will grow up \nin a world with opportunities and challenges we can barely imagine--and \nfor the sake of the country we all love--I will support his nomination \nfor Chief Justice of the United States and do so with my highest hopes \nfor his success.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know many will provide us with their \nviews on this nominee for the Supreme Court, and I will make a couple \npoints today as I describe the process by which I arrived at my \ndecision.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution of this country establishes three \nbranches of Government. When you look at this Constitution and read it, \nit is quite a remarkable document in all of the history of governments \naround the world. It was 1787 when in Philadelphia, in a hot room \ncalled the Assembly Room, 55 white men went into that room, pulled the \nshades because it was warm in Philadelphia that summer and they had no \nair-conditioning, and they wrote the Constitution; the Constitution \nthat begins with the words, ``We the people.'' What a remarkable \ndocument. And that Constitution creates a kind of framework for our \nGovernment that is extraordinary and that has worked in the most \nsuccessful way of any democracy in the history of mankind. In that \nConstitution they provided for what is called separation of powers, and \nfor three branches of Government. One of those branches is the \njudiciary, and the Supreme Court is the top of the judiciary structure \nwhich interprets the Constitution in our country. Further, it is the \nonly area in which there are lifetime appointments.\n  When we decide on a nominee for the Federal bench to become a Federal \njudge, as is the case with respect to the\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\nSupreme Court, we decide yes or no on a nominee sent to us by the \nPresident. That person will be allowed to serve for a lifetime--not for \n10 years or 20 years but for a lifetime. So it is a critically \nimportant judgment that the Senate brings to bear on these nominations.\n  The President sends us a nomination and then the Senate gives its \nadvice and consent; America approves or disapproves. Even George \nWashington was unable to get one of his Supreme Court nominees approved \nby the Senate. He was pretty frustrated by that. But even George \nWashington failed on one of his nominees.\n  The role of the Senate is equal to the role of the President. There \nis the submission of a nominee by the President, and the yes or no by \nthe Senate. Regrettably, in recent years, these issues have become \nalmost like political campaigns with groups forming on all sides and \nall kinds of campaigning going on for and against nominees. It did not \nused to be that way, but it is in today's political climate.\n  I want to talk just a little about the nominee who is before us now, \nJudge John Roberts, for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The \nposition of Chief Justice is critically important. He will preside over \nthe Supreme Court. And, it is a lifetime appointment proposed for a \nrelatively young Federal judge. John Roberts, I believe, is 50 years \nold. He is likely to serve on the Supreme Court as Chief Justice for \ndecades and likely, in that position, to have a significant impact on \nthe lives of every American.\n  I asked yesterday to meet once again with Judge Roberts. I had met \nwith him previously in my office. He came to my office again yesterday \nand we spent, I guess, 40 or 45 minutes talking. I wanted to meet with \nhim just to discuss his views about a range of issues. There were a \nnumber of things that happened in the Judiciary Committee that \ntriggered my interest--civil rights issues, women's rights, the right \nof privacy, court striping, and many others. Some of his writings in \nhis early years, incidentally, back in the early 1980s also gave me \nsome real pause.\n  So I asked to meet with him yesterday morning, and at 9:30 we had a \nlengthy discussion about a lot of those issues. But I confess that \nJudge Roberts did not give me specific responses that went much beyond \nthat which he described publicly in the Judiciary Committee hearings. \nNonetheless, by having met with Judge Roberts twice and having had some \nlengthy discussions about these many issues, he is clearly qualified \nfor this job. That has never been in question. He has an impressive set \nof credentials, probably as impressive a set of credentials as any \nnominee who has been sent here in some decades. He clearly is smart, he \nis articulate, he is intense.\n  The question that I and many others have had is, Who is this man, \nreally? What does he believe? What does he think? Will he interpret the \nConstitution of this country in a way that will expand or diminish the \nrights of the American people? For example, there are some, some who \nhave previously been nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, who take \nthe position there is no right to privacy in this country; that the \nConstitution provides no right to privacy for the American people. I \nfeel very strongly that is an error in interpretation of the \nConstitution, and the nominees who have suggested that sort of thing \nwould not get my support in the Senate. Those who read the Constitution \nin that manner, who say there is no right to privacy in the U.S. \nConstitution, I think, misread the Constitution.\n  I think at the conclusion of his hearings, it is interesting that \nadvocates from both the left and the right had some concerns as a \nresult of those hearings. I believe the conservatives worried at the \nend of his hearings that he wasn't conservative enough. I think \nliberals and progressives worried that he was too conservative.\n  Well, Judge Roberts clearly is a conservative. I would expect a \nRepublican President to nominate a conservative. But from the \ndiscussions I have had with him, I also believe that Judge John Roberts \nwill be a Chief Justice who will honor precedent and who will view his \nhigh calling to an impartial interpretation of the laws of this \ncountry.\n  Having now spent two occasions visiting with him about a number of \nissues, I believe he has the ability to serve this Nation well as Chief \nJustice, and I have decided, as a result, to vote for the confirmation \nof the nomination of Judge John Roberts. Some of my colleagues have \nannounced they will vote for him, and they are voting their hopes \nrather than their fears. I would not characterize my vote that way. I \nthink he is qualified, and I don't think he is an ideologue off to the \nfar right--who believes there is no right to privacy and who wants to \ntake us back in time in ways that would diminish the rights of the \nAmerican people. As a result of that feeling, I intend to vote for this \nnominee. I recognize there is plenty of room for disagreement, that \nthere is much that we don't know, not only about this nominee, but \nabout everyone who comes before this Senate. And I fully respect the \nopinions of those who come to a different conclusion and who have \nreached a different point on this issue. But for me, this nominee, in \nmy judgment, is well qualified to be a good Chief Justice for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are at a moment of great importance in our Nation's \nhistory: the chance to choose a new Chief Justice for a lifetime \nappointment on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Constitution makes the Senate an equal partner in the appointment \nand confirmation of Federal judges. Article II, section 2, clause 2, of \nthe Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \nof the Supreme Court.''\n  Neither this clause itself, nor any other text in the Constitution, \nspecifies or restricts the factors that Senators should consider in \nevaluating a nominee. It is in upholding our constitutional duty to \ngive the President advice and consent on his nominations to Federal \ncourts that I believe we have our greatest opportunity and \nresponsibility to support and defend the Constitution.\n  This is the first nominee to the Supreme Court that this body has had \nthe opportunity to vote upon in 11 years. Like Members of this Chamber, \nthis is my first opportunity to review and vote on a candidate for the \nSupreme Court.\n  My test for a nominee is simple, and it is drawn from the text, the \nhistory, and the principles of the Constitution.\n  A nominee's intellectual gifts, experience, judgment, maturity, and \ntemperament are all important, but these alone are not enough. In this \nregard, I want to say something about the difference between a \nnomination to a lower court, including a court of appeals, and to the \nSupreme Court. The past decisions of the Supreme Court are binding on \nall lower courts. Therefore, even if a judge on a circuit court \ndisagrees with well-established precedent about the rule of law, he or \nshe is bound to apply that law in any case. However, the Supreme Court \nalone can overturn established legal precedent. As a result, I need to \nbe convinced that a nominee for Supreme Court Justice will live up to \nthe spirit of the Constitution.\n  The nominee needs to be committed not just to enforcing laws, but to \ndoing justice. The nominee needs to be able to make the principles of \nthe Constitution come alive--equality before the law, due process, full \nand equal participation in the civic and social life of America for all \nAmericans, freedom of conscience, individual responsibility, and the \nexpansion of opportunity. The nominee also needs to see the unique role \nthe Court plays in helping balance the often conflicting forces in a \ndemocracy between individual autonomy and the obligations of community, \nbetween the will of the majority and the rights of the minority. A \nnominee for Supreme Court Justice needs to be able to look forward to \nthe future, not just backward. The nominee needs to make the \nConstitution resonate in a world that is changing with great rapidity.\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\n  Judge Roberts' testimony before the Judiciary Committee and the legal \ndocuments he has produced throughout his career have not convinced me \nthat he will meet this last test, that he will protect the spirit as \nwell as the letter of the Constitution. In Judge Roberts' work as a \nprivate lawyer, and in two Republican administrations, he has created a \nlong trail of documents revealing his judicial philosophy to be narrow \nand restrictive on issue after issue.\n  He has attempted to distance himself from some of his record by \nsaying he was merely representing his clients and stating his clients' \nview. I cannot fully accept this argument. With a degree from Harvard \nLaw School and a Supreme Court clerkship, this man could have chosen \nany legal role he wanted, but he chose to become a political activist \nin the Reagan and Bush I administrations, to advocate for the ideas he \nbelieved in. He knew what he believed then, and he chose his clients to \npursue his own constitutional agenda.\n  We only have insight into this nominee's political activism because \nof papers obtained from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. I will \npoint out, as others have, that our deliberations have been handicapped \nbecause this administration has refused to turn over documents that \nwould be illustrative of his views, his ideas, his principles, and his \npassions. We only received the documents we have on his early career in \nthe Government because they were in the custody of the Ronald Reagan \nPresidential Library. That, to me, has hobbled his nomination. I hope \nin the future, when a nominee is sent to us by the White House, they \nwill be willing to release pertinent documents that will illustrate \nmore clearly the positions of that nominee.\n  The Bush administration, though, repeatedly refused requests to give \nSenators records from Judge Roberts' time in the U.S. Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. If Judge Roberts did wish to disassociate himself \nfrom the agenda he has advocated throughout his legal career, he had \nthat opportunity during his hearings before the Judiciary Committee. \nEach of my colleagues on that committee asked him extensive questions \nabout his judicial philosophy, his understanding of important legal \nissues, and his opinion of major Supreme Court precedents. Judge \nRoberts had the burden to convince this body that he would be a \njudicious and balanced member of the Supreme Court that would uphold \nthe spirit of the Constitution. He had numerous opportunities to do so \nby releasing legal documents he had written and by candidly discussing \nhis views on previously decided cases and broad areas of the law.\n  However, Judge Roberts failed to pass this test. He failed, in my \nview, to inform this body of his views on important constitutional \nissues. He stonewalled the release of important documents. He evaded \nfair and important questions, instead of offering honest and insightful \nanswers, and he failed to demonstrate that he would uphold not just the \nletter of the law but also the spirit. As a result, I cannot support \nhis lifetime nomination to the highest Court in America.\n  Now I would like to turn to some of the areas I have the most concern \nabout regarding this nominee. The Constitution relies on a careful \nsystem of checks and balances between the judiciary, the legislature, \nand the executive. If the judiciary becomes a blank check for executive \ndesires, this careful balance will break down. As a political appointee \nin the Reagan White House and Justice Department, however, Judge \nRoberts advocated expansive Presidential powers. For example, in a July \n15, 1983, memorandum to White House counsel Fred Fielding, Roberts \nsupported reconsidering the role of independent regulatory agencies \nlike the FCC and the FTC, bringing them within the control of the \nexecutive branch. We lack sufficient information about his advocacy \nwithin the Reagan and Bush I administrations. But from his short tenure \non the court of appeals, we already have two examples of cases where \nJudge Roberts has deferred to the administration. Judge Roberts has not \nhad the chance to hear that many cases in his brief stint on the DC \nCircuit. However, these two are troubling, and they both give the \nPresident sweeping and unprecedented powers.\n  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Roberts joined an opinion that upheld the \nmilitary commissions this administration has created to try foreign \nnationals at Guantanamo Bay and agreed with the Bush administration \nthat the Geneva Conventions did not apply to Hamdan. Judge Roberts' \nmajority opinion argued that under the Constitution, the President \n``has a degree of independent authority to act'' in foreign affairs \nand, for this reason and others, his construction and application of \ntreaty provisions is entitled to ``great weight.''\n\n  But part of this decision was rejected by concurring senior judge \nStephen Williams, a distinguished jurist and Republican appointee. He \nwrote that the United States, as a signatory to the Geneva Convention, \nwas bound by its ``modest requirements of `humane treatment' and `the \njudicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized \npeoples.'''\n  That was not the only case. In another case, Acree v. Republic of \nIraq in 2004, Judge Roberts, alone among three judges, supported the \nBush administration's position that a Presidential order validly \ndivested the Federal courts of jurisdiction to hear suits against Iraqi \nofficials brought by American prisoners of war for torture they \nsuffered during the first Gulf War. For a man who has so little \njudicial experience, opinions in support of the administration's \nexpansive powers in two different cases presents a troubling pattern to \nme.\n  Finally, if I may add, Judge Roberts' refusal to cooperate in turning \nover documents from his service in two presidential administrations to \nthis body indicates his support for and compliance in this \nadministration's unprecedented secrecy of executive branch operations. \nIndeed, memos he wrote in the 1980s show that he agreed with the \nadministration's overly expansive claims of executive privilege to \nshield documents from the Congress and the public.\n  A number of cases on Presidential authority are likely to come before \nthe Court in the near future. Although I am reassured that during the \nhearings Judge Roberts declared his support for the analytical \nframework established in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, \nwhich some in the current administration have not done, I am still \nconcerned about his respect for the balance of power required by the \nConstitution.\n  At the same time that Judge Roberts' record suggests he has been \nexcessively deferential to the actions and whims of the executive \nbranch, he has shown a troublesome activism in overruling the sovereign \nacts of this Congress. In recent years, a narrow majority on the \nSupreme Court and some lower court judges and right-wing academics and \nadvocates have launched a Federalism revolution, cutting back on the \nauthority of this Congress to enact and enforce critical laws important \nto Americans' rights and interests. These judges have overturned \nsettled precedent by narrowly construing the commerce clause and \nsection 5 of the 14th amendment, while broadly interpreting the 11th \namendment and reading State sovereignty immunity into the text. Judge \nRoberts' short record raises troubling signs that he may subscribe to \nthis new Federalism revolution.\n  In one case, Rancho Viejo v. Norton, Judge Roberts issued a dissent \nfrom the decision by the full DC Circuit not to reconsider upholding \nthe constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act in this case. In \nother words, Judge Roberts viewed part of the Endangered Species Act as \nunconstitutional because he believed its application was an \nunconstitutional exercise of Federal authority under the commerce \nclause. This narrow reading of Congress's constitutional authority \ncould undermine the ability of Congress to protect not just the \nenvironment but other rights and interests of the American people.\n  Judge Roberts' reasoning suggests he may subscribe to an extremely \nconstricted interpretation of the commerce clause recently rejected by \nthe Supreme Court in the medical marijuana case, Gonzales v. Raich. \nThere the Court followed longstanding precedent, dating back to the \n1940s, to hold that Congress commerce clause authority includes the \npower to regulate some purely local activities.\n  And this is not just about endangered species. Congress uses its \nconstitutional authority under the commerce clause for all sorts of \npurposes in representing the American people. Other\n\n[[Page S10486]]\n\nenvironmental protections of clean air and clean water come from the \ncommerce clause. So, too, the commerce clause provides civil rights \nsafeguards, minimum wage, and maximum hour laws, and workplace safety \nprotections.\n  Although Judge Roberts affirmed that the Constitution does contain a \nright to privacy, this declaration did not tell me much at all. As we \nknow, at least three Justices on the current Supreme Court believe in a \nright to privacy but don't believe it extends to a woman's right to \nchoose. Furthermore, Judge Roberts' written record shows that he did \nnot believe there was, in his words, a ``so-called right to privacy'' \nin the Constitution. This places a higher burden on him to answer \nquestions regarding this constitutional line of cases. Not only did \nJudge Roberts fail to answer any direct questions on this issue, he \nalso failed to answer questions about whether he would uphold this line \nof cases as precedents that a generation of Americans have come to rely \nupon. Senator Specter repeatedly asked questions about how his view on \nprecedent might inform his decisions regarding the constitutional right \nto privacy. Senator Specter pointed out that Chief Justice Rehnquist \nhad ultimately agreed to uphold the Miranda rule, even though he \ndisagreed with the original Miranda case, because he believed the \nwarnings to criminal subjects had become part of our national culture. \nJudge Roberts refused to agree that the right to certain types of \nprivacy were equally embedded in our national culture.\n  In fact, Judge Roberts pointedly refused to answer questions about \nwhether the right to privacy applies to either the beginning or end of \nlife. The only decided case in this area he was willing to talk about \nwas in response to a question from Senator Kohl regarding Griswold v. \nConnecticut, the case that says the Constitution's right to privacy \nextends to a married couple's right to use contraception. However, in \nresponse to a followup question from Senator Feinstein, Judge Roberts \ndid not make it clear if he agreed with the Supreme Court's opinion in \nEisenstadt v. Baird, which upheld the right of single people to use \ncontraception, saying only that ``I don't have any quarrel with that \nconclusion.'' I found it hard to tell whether he was embracing the \nright to privacy in this context or just restating what the Supreme \nCourt has said.\n  So what might this all mean? For me, it is again a question of \nwhether Judge Roberts will uphold not just the letter but the spirit of \nthe Constitution. Since he has a written record demonstrating his lack \nof support for the so-called right of privacy, I believe Judge Roberts \nowed us more candid responses to questions regarding these issues. \nThere are a number of cases coming before the Supreme Court this term \non these issues, and there will be many more in the future. These cases \nare not just about parental notification or the relationship between \ndoctors and their patients, they go to core constitutional protections \nfor all members of our society, particularly women.\n  I am also concerned that as a young lawyer in the Reagan \nadministration, Judge Roberts appears to have joined in its efforts to \ndismantle the civil rights gains of the 1960s and 1970s. For example, \nJudge Roberts wrote vigorous defenses of a proposal to narrow the reach \nof the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That act is now up for reauthorization, \nand I am proud to see that this Congress and the country as a whole \nhave come to see how important and successful it has been in giving all \nAmericans the ability to participate in our democracy. And we should \nnot have a Justice who would wish for anything less.\n\n  In other civil rights cases, Judge Roberts' record suggests that he \nwished to limit the Congress's authority to protect and enforce civil \nrights. Recently released documents show that Judge Roberts, when \nworking in the Reagan Justice Department, disagreed with Ted Olsen, \nhimself a strong conservative, on this issue, with Roberts arguing that \nOlsen's position wasn't conservative enough. In other documents, he \nchallenged arguments by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in favor of \nbusing and affirmative action. He described a Supreme Court decision \nbroadening the rights of individuals to sue States for civil rights \nviolations as causing ``damage'' to administration policies, and he \nurged that legislation be drafted to reverse it. In the context of the \n1984 case of Grove City College v. Bell, he wished to limit the use of \ntitle 9, endorsing a narrow reading of that statute that Congress would \nlater overrule in 1988.\n  Perhaps the issue I am most bothered about in the civil rights area \nis Judge Roberts' apparent support for court stripping. In the 1980s, \nthere were a number of bills introduced in Congress to effectively gut \nBrown v. Board of Education. There were other bills proposed to strip \ncourts of the ability to hear cases involving school prayer or \nreproductive rights, essentially stripping away the right of a citizen \nto go before a court and claim that they have been aggrieved.\n  Judge Roberts was supportive of these court stripping bills and wrote \nseveral memos trying to influence the administration to support them as \nwell. Although he ultimately appears to have lost the debate in the \nadministration on this issue, I believe these bills would have stripped \nthe Federal courts of the ability to be the final arbiter of what the \nConstitution means, as well as an assault on the separation of powers.\n  Perhaps these memos are especially troubling to me since this \nCongress just passed legislation to strip the courts of the power to \nhear cases involving the negligence of gun dealers and manufacturers. \nThis legislation is likely to end up before the Supreme Court in the \nnear future and effectively strips ordinary citizens who have been \ninjured from being able to take their grievances to court. Again, this \nmakes me question Judge Roberts' desire to uphold the spirit of the \nConstitution.\n  From what we know about Judge Roberts, I am also concerned about his \ncommitment to upholding the constitutional separation of church and \nstate. As is true with many areas of constitutional law, he has not \nexpressed his personal views on these topics in articles or speeches. \nBut the briefs he wrote while in the Solicitor General's Office, if \nindicative of his views, suggest Judge Roberts would move the Court in \na more conservative direction, allowing far more governmental \ninvolvement with religion.\n  One of the geniuses of our Constitution is its separation of church \nand state. The first amendment has allowed a multitude of religions to \nflourish in our country. Indeed, I find it ironic, as we try to create \na constitution in Iraq that allows a number of religions to flourish, \nwe are not more aware of the importance of our own Constitution in \nmaking that possible in America. As well-funded religious movements \nattempt to inject religion into Government, the Supreme Court remains \nan important bulwark against going down such a path.\n  For example, while at the Solicitor General's Office, Judge Roberts \nauthored a brief arguing that school officials and local clergy should \nbe allowed to deliver prayers at public school graduation ceremonies. \nThe Government brief, written by Roberts, contended that religious \nceremonies should be permitted in all aspects of ``our public life'' in \nrecognition of our Nation's religious heritage. The brief argued for no \nlimits on the content of prayers, allowing even overtly proselytizing \nmessages. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 opinion written by Justice \nKennedy, rejected Judge Roberts' argument on behalf of the Government, \nfinding that it ``turns conventional first amendment analysis on its \nhead.''\n  The Supreme Court in Lee v. Weisman, and elsewhere, has stated it \nwould not reconsider the longstanding Lemon v. Kurtzman test, which is \nthe benchmark for evaluating issues of church and state relations. The \nLemon test forbids Government officials from acting with a religious \nagenda, endorsing religion, or excessively entangling Government and \nreligion. Roberts has advocated that the Lemon test be scrapped and \nreplaced by a far more permissive standard, the coercion test. Under \nthis view, the Government would violate the first amendment only if it \nliterally established a church or coerced religious behavior. Critics \nof the Lemon test believe Government should be able to give money to \nreligious schools for religious instruction. They believe it is proper \nfor the Government to display profoundly religious symbols in a way \nthat clearly and unambiguously endorses religion.\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\n  I worry that a Court with Judge Roberts has the potential to \ndramatically change the law with regard to the establishment clause. \nThese changes could lead to many activities which today, wisely, are \nbeyond the endorsement of Government and in the province of religion, \nas they should be.\n  As a judge, private lawyer, and Government attorney, Judge Roberts \nalso has repeatedly argued to narrow the protections of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. He argued in one case before the Supreme Court \nthat a woman who developed severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and \ntendinitis from working on an auto manufacturing assembly line was not \na person with a disability because she was not sufficiently limited in \nmajor life activities outside of her job.\n\n  Judge Roberts has long held these views. In 1982, Judge Roberts wrote \na memo while at the Reagan Justice Department criticizing a trial court \nand appeals court decision that a Federal law required a deaf student \nto have a sign language interpreter to assist her in school. Even the \nconservative Justice Department of that administration disagreed with \nthis view and supported the student. This is just one more area where, \nbased on what we know, it appears Judge Roberts would roll back \nfreedoms and rights this Congress and the American people have long \nfought for.\n  Some on the Supreme Court, to judge by their dissenting and \nconcurring opinions, would use the bench to impose a dramatic change in \nthe meaning of the Constitution on the American people. With one or two \nmore votes, they could overturn dozens, even hundreds, of important \nprecedents going back decades. They could dismantle rights and freedoms \nAmericans have fought for and come to rely on: the right to privacy, \ncivil rights, the ability of Congress to fight discrimination, to \nprotect consumers, workers, and the environment.\n  The next Justice appointed will likely sit on the Court for 25, maybe \neven 35 years. He or she will be in a position to decide important \nconstitutional questions, not only for our generation, but for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. The precedents he or she helps to \ncreate will bind our country for the 21st century and beyond. They will \nbe the definitive interpretation of our founding document, not just in \nthe Supreme Court, but in all the Federal appellate courts and all the \ndistrict courts in the land. They will affect every American, from the \nearliest days of their childhood through the closing days of their \nlife.\n  The Supreme Court will cast rulings on every issue of importance to \nthe American people. The list is familiar: right to privacy, civil \nrights, freedom of speech and religious liberty, environmental, labor, \nand consumer protections. But these are only the issues we are aware of \nnow. The Court will also confront future issues beyond our foresight or \nimagination. From cloning and bioethics to control of intellectual \nproperty and access to information in a global economy, the Supreme \nCourt in the years to come will face challenging issues we cannot yet \neven conceive.\n  A lifetime nomination to the Supreme Court presents an awesome power \nand responsibility, one that transcends our time. The Supreme Court has \nbeen a pillar of America's constitutional democracy, and its \nresponsibility for upholding and protecting the Constitution has proven \na model for emerging constitutional democracies around the world. \nAlexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78, in defending the \nConstitution's creation of an independent judiciary with lifetime \nappointments to judges:\n\n       This independence of the judges is equally requisite to \n     guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the \n     effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, \n     or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes \n     disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though \n     they speedily give place to better information, and more \n     deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to \n     occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious \n     oppressions of the minor party in the community.\n\n  I intend to vote against the nomination of Judge Roberts to be the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court because I am not convinced he \nwill discharge this great responsibility in the way he should. He has \nnot convinced me that he will protect minority communities in our \ncountry, that he will halt dangerous innovations from the executive \nbranch, or that he will guard the Constitution and the rights of all \nindividuals. Judge Roberts has not convinced me he will uphold not just \nthe letter of the Constitution, but the spirit of the Constitution as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Judge \nJohn Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the United States and I am \ndelighted to indicate my support for his confirmation.\n  First, I would like to make a couple of preliminary comments about \nthings that others have spoken to, one of which is the question of \nwhether additional documents from the Solicitor General's Office, the \nDepartment of Justice, should have been provided as part of a record to \nconsider Judge Roberts.\n  There were something like 80,000 pages of documents produced. That \ndoes not count the scores of pages of opinions he had written as a \njudge, speeches, law review articles, notes for courses he taught, and \na whole variety of other documents he had written--probably more \ndocuments than had ever been produced for any other nominee in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  I think it is inappropriate for Members to suggest that Judge Roberts \nsomehow withheld documents. He withheld nothing. He had no documents in \nhis possession that were relevant that were not turned over to the \ncommittee. In fact, as I recall, his answers to the committee's \nquestionnaire were some 80 pages, voluntarily provided by him. He did \nnot withhold any documents.\n  The only documents the administration did not produce were those \nprivate memoranda between lawyers in the Solicitor General's Office, of \nwhom he was one, and the other officials of the Solicitor General's \nOffice, including the Solicitor General himself. Those are private \nattorney/client work product kind of memoranda that should not be \nproduced and, of course, were not produced by the administration.\n  Judge Roberts is not in possession of those. He did not refuse to \nturn those documents over and it is proper we retain the precedent that \nthose private communications between attorney and client not be \nproduced.\n  There was a great hullabaloo, correctly so, in this Chamber when it \nwas discovered that a staffer had broken into the computers of some \nDemocratic members of the Judiciary Committee and found private \ncommunication between members of their staff and the Senators. This was \nrightly condemned as having a chilling effect. If the public is \nbecoming aware now of the communication between staff and a Senator, \nthat would chill the communication between the staff and Senator. It \nmight cause them not to fully and candidly express their views. That is \ncorrect. That is why that was wrong and why the people responsible were \npunished.\n  The same thing applies here. One cannot get into the private \ncommunications between an attorney and a client any more than one would \nwant to in the Solicitor General's Office.\n  Secondly, there has been some suggestion that the administration did \nnot produce these documents because it had something to hide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Department of Justice \ndated September 9, 2005 to Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy:  I write in response to your letter \n     dated September 7, 2005, regarding your request that the \n     Department disclose confidential legal memoranda from Judge \n     John Roberts' tenure in the Office of the Solicitor General. \n     As you know, we have been working closely with the Committee \n     on the Judiciary to facilitate the Committee's consideration \n     of Judge Roberts' nomination,\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\n     and we look forward to continuing to do so. The Department \n     recently produced to the Committee another 1,300 pages of \n     documents relating to Judge Roberts' government service, \n     bringing to approximately 76,000 the number of pages the \n     White House and the Department have provided. That number \n     does not include the voluminous production made by Judge \n     Roberts himself.\n       With regard to your request, we remain unable to provide \n     memoranda disclosing the internal deliberations of the \n     Solicitor General's office. The privileged nature of those \n     documents is widely recognized, and the Department has \n     traditionally declined to breach that privilege. We have \n     considered carefully the legal arguments you make in support \n     of disclosure. As discussed below, the authorities your \n     letter cites relate to contexts very different from this one \n     and have no relevance here.\n       Your letter cites an opinion by Attorney General Robert H. \n     Jackson and argues that this opinion supports disclosure to \n     the Committee of internal Solicitor General documents. We \n     believe this is an inaccurate characterization of that memo. \n     To be sure, Attorney General Jackson stated that in the \n     context of executive nominations, certain otherwise-\n     confidential documents would be provided to the Senate. But \n     the documents in question were FBI reports of criminal \n     investigations. The Attorney General's opinion that the \n     Senate should be informed of a nominee's criminal activities \n     does not support your request that we disclose privileged and \n     deliberative attorney communications. In fact, the opinion \n     lists several examples of Attorneys General faithfully \n     discharging the ``unpleasant duty'' of declining to produce \n     to Congress information that should remain confidential. 40 \n     U.S. Op. Atty. Gen. 45, 48.\n       Your letter also includes a charge that the Department's \n     unwillingness to breach the traditional confidentiality of \n     internal deliberations raises an inference adverse to Judge \n     Roberts. We disagree with this argument on both legal and \n     factual bases.\n       First, it is a matter of well-settled law that no inference \n     of any kind may be drawn from a decision not to release \n     privileged documents. Notably, none of the judicial decisions \n     you cite dealt with privileged documents. With regard to \n     claims of privilege, the law is clear. As one federal court \n     of appeals recently recognized, ``the courts have declined to \n     impose adverse inferences on invocation of the attorney-\n     client privilege.'' Knorr-Bresme Systeme Fuer Nutzfahrzeuge \n     GMBH v. Dana Corp., 383 F.3d 1337, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \n     Another court of appeals explained the justification for this \n     firmly established rule: ``This privilege is designed to \n     encourage persons to seek legal advice, and lawyers to give \n     candid advice, all without adverse effect. If refusal to \n     produce an attorney's opinion letter based on claim of the \n     privilege supported an adverse inference, persons would be \n     discouraged from seeking opinions, or lawyers would be \n     discouraged from giving honest opinions. Such a penalty for \n     invocation of the privilege would have seriously harmful \n     consequences.'' Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., 191 F.3d \n     208, 226 (1999), overruled on other grounds, Moseley v. V \n     Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418 (2003); see also Parker \n     v. Prudential Ins. Co., 900 F.2d 772, 775 (4th Cir. 1990).\n       Second, the implication that the Department's decision is \n     motivated by an attempt to hide something assumes that the \n     decision-makers have some knowledge of the documents' \n     contents. That assumption is factually wrong. No one involved \n     with the Administration's Supreme Court nomination process \n     has reviewed the documents you request. The decision not to \n     disclose the internal deliberations of the Solicitor \n     General's office is made by the Department as a matter of \n     principled regard for preservation of the Solicitor General's \n     ability to represent the United States effectively.\n       In summary, for the reasons stated above and in my letters \n     of August 5, 2005, and August 18, 2005, we cannot agree to \n     your request to produce the internal, privileged \n     communications of the Office of the Solicitor General. We \n     nonetheless remain committed to providing the Committee full \n     and prompt assistance in its consideration of Judge Roberts' \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will read part of one paragraph:\n\n       No one involved with the Administration's Supreme Court \n     nomination process has reviewed the documents you request. \n     The decision not to disclose the internal deliberations of \n     the Solicitor General's office is made by the Department as a \n     matter of principled regard for preservation of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to represent the United States effectively.\n\n  So for anybody to suggest that somebody had something to hide is to \nignore the facts. This letter was widely distributed. Every Senator \nshould know that the administration had not even looked at the \nmaterial, so they obviously could not be hiding something.\n  There has been some reference--I would almost even refer to it as \nguilt by association--that John Roberts worked in the Reagan \nadministration. I remind my colleagues that this is the Reagan \nadministration which was reelected with, as I recall, 59 percent of the \nvote and 49 of our 50 States. I would be pleased to debate any of my \ncolleagues in this Chamber about the record of the Reagan \nadministration, and I can say in advance that I will take the \naffirmative side of that debate that it should be defended. John \nRoberts has nothing to apologize for because he worked for President \nRonald Reagan.\n  I want to express in a more formal way my support for Judge Roberts. \nSo much has already been said about his intellect, his character, his \nqualifications, his experience, his eloquently expressed commitment to \nthe rule of law, and I certainly agree with all of those who have been \nimpressed with those qualities. I believe these are the qualities that \nshould govern this body's advise and consent role. In other words, that \nintelligence, character, experience, and commitment to the rule of law \nare the qualities we should be looking for in a nomination for the U.S. \nSupreme Court and other courts as well. We should not be looking to how \nthis particular nominee might rule in a future case. We certainly \nshould not play a bargaining process with the nominee, in effect \nsaying, if you will tell me how you will rule on these future cases and \nif I agree with that, then I will support your confirmation. That \nwould, of course, undermine the impartiality and the independence of \nour courts, and it is improper.\n  I noted recently that fellow Arizonian Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nspoke in Arizona and she said judicial independence is hard to create \nand easier than most people imagine to destroy.\n  Well, I think she is exactly right on that. Judge Roberts made a \nsimilar comment during his opening statement. He said:\n\n       President Ronald Reagan used to speak of the Soviet \n     constitution, and he noted that it purported to grant \n     wonderful rights of all sorts to people. But those rights \n     were empty promises, because that system did not have an \n     independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law and enforce \n     those rights. We do, because of the wisdom of our Founders \n     and the sacrifices of our heroes over the generations to make \n     their vision a reality.\n\n  In other words, that rule of law is what lies at the foundation of \nthe American system of ordered liberty. Judges owe their loyalty to the \nlaw, not to political parties, not to interest groups, and they must \nhave the courage to make tough decisions, however unpopular. Consider, \nfor example, how Judge Roberts answered a question of whether he would \nstand up for the little guy. He said:\n\n       If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, \n     the little guy is going to win. . . . But if the Constitution \n     says that the big guy should win, well, then the big guy is \n     going to win, because my obligation is to the Constitution.\n\n  That is the essence of the rule of law as enforced by independent \njudges, doing what the Constitution and the law demand, regardless of \nthe political or economic power of the parties. Indeed, that is the \nbest way to ensure that the voice of the little guys will, in fact, be \nheard.\n  Judge Roberts often spoke of the rule of law during his hearing. \nConsidering this additional excerpt, he explained that he used to \nrepresent the U.S. Government before the Supreme Court when he was the \nDeputy Solicitor General, and then he stated:\n\n       But it was after I left the Department and began arguing \n     cases against the United States that I fully appreciated the \n     importance of the Supreme Court and our constitutional \n     system.\n       Here was the United States, the most powerful entity in the \n     world, aligned against my client. And yet, all I had to do \n     was convince the Court that I was right on the law and the \n     government was wrong and all that power and might would \n     recede in deference to the rule of law. That is a remarkable \n     thing.\n       It is what we mean when we say that we are a government of \n     laws and not of men. It is that rule of law that protects the \n     rights and liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of the \n     world--because without the rule of law, rights are \n     meaningless.\n\n  I was struck by this comment when I heard Judge Roberts make it, \nbecause it reminded me of my earlier career as a private attorney \npracticing before the State and Federal courts, including the Supreme \nCourt. Parties, be they corporations or civil plaintiffs or governments \nor criminals, all put their faith in judges to adhere to legal \nprinciples and make decisions based on the rule of law, not based on \nwhat they personally believe to be right. Parties\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\nhave disputes that require a neutral arbiter who is beholden to nobody, \nand who will not be dissuaded from doing his duty, no matter what the \ncost. As Judge Roberts later emphasized, ``This is the oath.'' This is \nwhat the Constitution and an independent judiciary demand.\n  Of course, it is equally important to understand what judicial \nindependence is not. Judicial independence does not mean the judge has \nthe right to disregard the Constitution or the statutes passed by \nlegislatures. Judicial independence does not mean that because of a \nlifetime appointment, the judicial role is unconstrained by precedent \nand by principle, and judicial independence is not an invitation to \nremake the Constitution or the laws if it does not lead to the result \nthe judge prefers. Nor is judicial independence an invitation to the \njudge to legislate and resolve questions that properly belong to the \ndemocratic branches of our Government, no matter how wise a particular \njudge might be.\n  Judicial independence gives judges tremendous freedom, but it is a \nfreedom to do their duty to the law, not a freedom from or independence \nfrom the constraints of the law. When judges confuse the freedom to \nfollow the law with the freedom to depart from it, we see the unhinged \njudicial activism that has infuriated so many Americans throughout my \nlifetime.\n  Consider what Justice Antonin Scalia wrote while dissenting from one \nof the Ten Commandments cases the Supreme Court decided this past \nspring, McCreary v. ACLU. He said:\n\n       What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship of \n     a shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely \n     indispensable requirement that judicial opinions be grounded \n     in consistently applied principle. That is what prevents \n     judges from ruling now this way, now that, thumbs up or \n     thumbs down, as their personal preferences dictate.\n\n  I focus on the need for judicial independence and respect for the \nrule of law because I am very concerned about threats to judicial \nindependence that have infected the confirmation process. During Judge \nRoberts' hearings, we saw efforts to demand political promises in \nexchange for confirmation support. Specifically, some Senators demanded \nto know how Judge Roberts will vote on issues that will come before the \nSupreme Court. In doing this, Senators risk turning the confirmation \nprocess into little more than a political bargaining session in which \nthe Senators refuse to consent to a fully qualified nominee unless the \nnominee promises under oath to vote a certain way in future cases.\n  Yet during this confirmation process, some Senators said they would \nnot support Judge Roberts unless they knew where he stood on important \nissues of the day. In fact, the only reason they asked the question is \nbecause they thought the issue might be before the Court; otherwise, \nthere would be no reason to find out how he might rule.\n  When the Judiciary Committee voted last week, more than one Senator \nexplained that while Judge Roberts was a brilliant man who would be a \nthoughtful Chief Justice, they were not going to support him because \nthey could not learn enough about his views on issues that they thought \nwould come before the Court.\n  The Senate must reject this improper politicization of our judiciary. \nA judicial nominations process that required nominees to make a series \nof specific commitments in order to navigate the maze of Senate \nconfirmation would bring into disrepute the entire enterprise of an \nindependent judiciary.\n  In July, I asked the Senate Republican Policy Committee, which I \nchair, to examine the canons of judicial ethics and the views of the \nsitting Supreme Court Justices on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resulting report entitled ``The \nProper Scope of Questioning for Judicial Nominees'' be printed after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Judge Roberts confronted this challenge repeatedly during \nthe hearing. Senators would ask him, sometimes directly, sometimes \nobliquely, how he felt about certain issues. To his credit, he resisted \nanswering those questions that could have jeopardized his judicial \nindependence. As he explained, the independence and integrity of the \nSupreme Court requires that nominees before the committee for a \nposition on that Court give no forecast, predictions, nor give hints \nabout how they might rule in cases that might come before the Court.\n  Judge Roberts' formulation is exactly right. If judges were forced to \nmake promises to Senators in order to be confirmed, constitutional law \nwould become a mere extension of politics. If we allow this radical \nnotion to take hold, and if Senators can demand such promises, then \nwhat would become of litigants' expectations of impartiality and \nfairness in the courtroom? The genius of our system of justice is that \npeople are willing to put their rights, their property, and even their \nlives before a judge, to be dealt with as he or she sees fit. People do \nthis because of the expectation that they will be treated fairly by a \njudge, with no preconceived notion of how their case should be decided.\n\n  That is a pretty remarkable thing, to have that much confidence in \nthe system that we would literally place our lives, our rights, our \nproperty in the hands of one person. Yet we do that every day all over \nthis country because we have confidence in the system. And that system \nsays the judge will decide your case free of any preconceived notion, \nso we as Senators should not be seeking to find out in advance how that \njudge might rule.\n  Let me be clear. I share my colleagues' curiosity about how Judge \nRoberts and the next nominee will rule on the hot-button issues of the \nday. For example, I hope he will join most Americans in recognizing \nthat partial-birth abortion does not deserve constitutional protection. \nSimilarly, it is my personal wish that the Supreme Court will allow \nStates to pass laws requiring minor girls to gain the consent of--or at \nleast to notify--their parents before getting an abortion. We remain a \nNation at war, and I believe it is crucial to our national security \nthat the Supreme Court support commonsense rules governing the war on \nterror without requiring that foreign terrorists be treated the same as \nAmerican criminals with the same constitutional rights as citizens. I \nwould like him to resist the siren songs of those judges who would \ncraft a constitutional right to same sex marriage. I would strongly \nprefer he uphold legislative efforts to guarantee that crime victims \nhave a substantial role in the prosecution and sentencing of \nperpetrators. And I hope he will help clean up the Supreme Court's \nhabeas corpus jurisprudence so we do not have to wait 20 years for \njustice to be done.\n  On these and many other matters I have a deep interest and strong \nopinions about what the Supreme Court ought to do. But I did not ask \nJohn Roberts for commitments on these matters. Of course, I am curious \nbut I didn't ask him how he would rule because, had I done so, I would \nhave been encouraging him to violate his judicial ethics as a sitting \njudge as well as to jeopardize the independence of the Supreme Court \nitself.\n  Should a nominee fully answer questions? Absolutely. But should a \nnominee engage in political bargaining by prejudging an issue or a \ncase? Absolutely not. Nobody disputes that John Roberts will be \nconfirmed later this week. I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan \nsupport for John Roberts, and I am cautiously optimistic that the size \nof this vote represents a repudiation of the politicization of the \njudiciary, but I am concerned that others will see the number of votes \nagainst Judge Roberts as justification for the proposition that one \nshould not support a nominee who refuses to indicate how he will rule \nin future cases.\n  This vote should represent a fresh start. The President sent us a \nbrilliant and distinguished nominee who had the character and \ncommitment to the rule of law to deserve the Senate's support. The \nnominee is a Republican who clerked for one of the great conservative \njudges of the 20th century. He served in the executive branch for \nRepublican Presidents. He advocated conservative policies on those \nPresidents' behalves. Yet that political background will not be a bar \nto Judge Roberts' confirmation. Equally important, Judge Roberts' \nrefusal throughout his hearings to make promises to Senators in \nexchange for their support is being affirmed as an appropriate \nadherence to judicial ethics. The courage that\n\n[[Page S10490]]\n\nJohn Roberts has shown in upholding his ethical standards should not be \npunished.\n  Justice O'Connor stated earlier this month:\n\n       We must be ever vigilant against those who would strong-arm \n     the judiciary into adopting their preferred policies.\n\n  Once again, my fellow Arizonan was right. The Senate will exercise \nthat vigilance later this week by confirming Judge Roberts and by \nrejecting the politicization of the confirmation process. In the coming \nweeks, the Senate will consider the nominee to replace Justice \nO'Connor. It is my hope that Senators will exercise that same \nvigilance. The rule of law demands it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         The Proper Scope of Questioning for Judicial Nominees\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Some Senate Democrats are demanding that Supreme Court \n     nominee John G. Roberts announce his positions on \n     constitutional questions that the Supreme Court will be \n     deciding after he is confirmed. [FN1: For example, Senator \n     Charles Schumer has said, ``Every question is a legitimate \n     question, period.'' New York Post, July 6, 2005. Senator \n     Schumer has also said that he will ask how Mr. Roberts will \n     rule on issues that the Supreme Court certainly will \n     consider, including free speech, religious liberty, campaign \n     finance, environmental law, and other political and legal \n     questions. Foxnews.com, July 19, 2005. Likewise, Senator Ted \n     Kennedy has demanded to know ``whose side'' Judge Roberts \n     will favor, and ``where he stands'' on legal questions before \n     the Supreme Court. Congressional Record, July 20, 2005. Just \n     yesterday, Senator Evan Bayh picked up this theme: ``You \n     wouldn't run for the Senate or for Governor or for anything \n     else without answering people's questions about what you \n     believe. And I think the Supreme Court is no different.'' CNN \n     ``Inside Politics,'' July 25, 2005.] Although these Senators \n     are quick to say that they do not seek pre-commitments on \n     particular cases, the ethical rules governing judicial \n     confirmations are not limited to preventing prejudgment of \n     particular cases. As nominees in the past have recognized, it \n     is inappropriate for any nominee to give any signal as to how \n     he or she might rule on any issue that could come before the \n     court, even if the issue is not presented in a currently \n     pending case.\n       If these novel ``prejudgment demands'' were tolerated, the \n     judicial confirmation process would be radically transformed. \n     While questions about judicial philosophy in general have \n     always been appropriate, any effort to learn how particular \n     constitutional questions will be resolved has always been out \n     of bounds. It was for this reason that all sitting Supreme \n     Court Justices declined to answer some questions on \n     constitutional issues or past cases of the Supreme Court. For \n     example:\n       Justice Sandra Day O'Connor expressly refused to answer \n     questions about past cases that she believed would later come \n     before the Supreme Court. [FN2: Confirmation Hearing, July \n     1994, at p. 199.]\n       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg testified during her hearing: \n     ``I must avoid giving any forecast or hint about how I might \n     decide a question I have not yet addressed.'' [FN3: \n     Confirmation Hearing, July 1993, at p. 265.]\n       Then-Chairman Joseph Biden advised Justice Ginsburg during \n     her hearing: ``You not only have a right to choose what you \n     will answer and not answer, but in my view you should not \n     answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that \n     clearly is going to come before the Court in 50 different \n     forms . . . over your tenure on the Court.'' [FN4: \n     Confirmation Hearing, July 1993, at p. 275.]\n       There is a reason for this longstanding precedent: to \n     demand that a judicial nominee ``prejudge'' cases and issues \n     threatens the independence of the federal judiciary and \n     jeopardizes Americans' expectation that the nation's judges \n     will be fair and impartial. That is why the canons of \n     judicial ethics prohibit any judicial nominee from prejudging \n     any case or issue. [FN5: ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, \n     Canon 5A(3)(d)(ii) (2003).] Judges should only reach \n     conclusions after listening to all the evidence and arguments \n     in every case. Americans expect judges to keep an open mind \n     when they walk into the courtroom--not to make decisions in \n     the abstract and then commit to one side before the case \n     begins. No judge can be fair and impartial if burdened by \n     political commitments that Senators try to extract during \n     confirmation hearings. Otherwise, judicial nominees will be \n     forced to sacrifice ethics and impartiality to be confirmed.\n       Senators naturally want to know how future cases will be \n     decided, but curiosity must yield to the greater value--the \n     preservation of an independent judiciary and the guarantee of \n     equal justice. The following materials provide detailed \n     support for why the traditional norms should be upheld, and \n     why the Senate would tread into very murky waters if it were \n     to upset these settled practices.\n\n\n                      The Canon of Judicial Ethics\n\n       ``[A] judge or a candidate for election or appointment to \n     judicial office shall not . . . with respect to cases, \n     controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the \n     court, make pledges, promises or commitments that are \n     inconsistent with the impartial performance of the \n     adjudicative duties of the office. . . .''--ABA Model Code of \n     Judicial Conduct, Canon 5A(3)(d)(ii) (2003).\n\n\n  All Nine Supreme Court Justices Disagree With Requiring Nominees to \n                       Prejudge Issues and Cases\n\n     Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n       ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no \n     forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard \n     for the specifics of the particular case, it would display \n     disdain for the entire judicial process. Similarly, because \n     you are considering my capacity for independent judging, my \n     personal views on how I would vote on a publicly debated \n     issue, were I in your shoes, were I a legislator, are not \n     what you will be closely examining.''--Confirmation Hearing, \n     July 1993, at p. 52.\n       ``Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would \n     be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative \n     chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme \n     Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here \n     what I would say and how I would reason on such questions, I \n     would act injudiciously.''--Confirmation Hearing, July \n     1993, at p. 52. Justice Ginsburg was a judge on the D.C. \n     Circuit when nominated to the Supreme Court.\n       ``I sense that I am in the position of a skier at the top \n     of that hill, because you are asking me how I would have \n     voted in Rust v. Sullivan (1991). Another member of this \n     committee would like to know how I might vote in that case or \n     another one. I have resisted descending that slope, because \n     once you ask me about this case, then you will ask me about \n     another case that is over and done, and another case. . . . \n     If I address the question here, if I tell this legislative \n     chamber what my vote will be, then my position as a judge \n     could be compromised.

The other reason, which is equally important, \n     is . . . it is so important that the clients and the lawyers \n     understand the judges are really open-minded.''--Confirmation \n     Hearing, July 1994, at p. 114.\n       ``The questions that you are putting to me are matters of \n     how that basic right applies, where it applies, under what \n     circumstances.

The Senate \n     should not allow short-term curiosity about particular issues \n     to override the settled procedures that have governed this \n     process for so long.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I am pleased to speak on the matter of the nomination of \nJohn Roberts to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. The authors of our Constitution were at the same time profound \nidealists about the human spirit and cold-blooded realists about the \nevil people are capable of. They had witnessed how even heroism can \nturn into tyranny, so they wrote a document that struck a balance \nbetween power and accountability that has remained level through a \nCivil War, World War, depressions, booms, and many social upheavals.\n  We are part that have process in this debate. Our job is not to add \nvalue to the Constitution but to conserve as much of its value as we \ncan. We are a government of laws and not men and women. But men and \nwomen make and interpret and apply those rules. The voters choose us. \nThe President that the people chose makes the choice of Justices of the \nSupreme Court, with our advice and consent. It is a solemn and \nmomentous transition in our history when we put a new Justice on the \nCourt to sit for the next generation.\n  First of all, I commend the President for the quality of his \nappointment. John Roberts is a person of brilliant mental capacity. We \nall know Lord Acton's statement about how absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely. But in this case, I also want us to invoke Barbara \nTuchman's reply that weakness, which must depend on compromises and \ndeals to maintain its position, corrupts even more.\n  Judge Roberts is as mentally strong as a person can be. He has the \nkind of mental strength that does not rely on intimidation, \nmanipulation or style points to carry his argument. It was wonderful to \nwatch his mind work during the nominee confirmation process. Whether \nyou are for or against this nomination, the strength of his intellect \nhas never been in doubt.\n  The President's choice is also a person of integrity. The word \n``integrity'' has the same root as the mathematical term ``integer,'' \nwhich is a whole number. Integrity means that all the pieces fit \ntogether to make a consistent whole. Judge Roberts has been in many \nsituations which sorely tested his integrity, and he has held together \nand held consistent in a remarkable way. Through his writings and \ntestimony, Judge Roberts has demonstrated he knows his historical \nplace. Judge Roberts is not a person driven by ego or ambition. He \nknows we all have a part to play in this constitutional design and to \nstep out of the role would be to step into the place of others. \nRespectful humility in the wielding of power is an indispensable \nattribute that Judge Roberts has shown.\n  In his own words, Judge Roberts testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and said:\n\n       My obligation is to the Constitution--that's the Oath.\n\n  My colleague from Arizona told about that wonderful exchange between \nJudge Roberts and members of the committee when he was asked about the \nbig guy and the little guy, how he would decide a case.\n  There are some in this body who, with past nominees, have looked at \nthe status of the person before the Court as somehow that should be \ndeterminative of whether they win. So if they were the little guy or \nthey were a woman or this or that, that somehow that was more \nimportant; if they didn't win, that somehow that was a negative to the \nperson who made the decision.\n  Judge Roberts responded: If the Constitution says that the little guy \nshould win, the little guy is going to win. But if the Constitution \ndictates that the big guy wins, then the big guy will win.\n  Little guys need the Constitution because in other places and at \nother points in times in other countries it is your status that \ndetermines whether you win. Typically, it is a person with wealth and \npower that would use that status to win. So the little guy needs the \nConstitution. John Roberts is respectful of the Constitution.\n  Judge Roberts believes in a judicial philosophy that defers to \nlegislative judgments and refuses to insert judges into disputes in \nwhich the Constitution gives the judiciary no role.\n  Judge Roberts told us:\n\n       I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that \n     are presented. I will be open to the considered views of my \n     colleagues on the bench, and I will decide every case based \n     on the record, according to the rule of law, without fear or \n     favor to the best of my ability.\n\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\n\n  Judge Roberts' approach to the law is one of restraint. He is not an \nideologue, intent on imposing his views on the law. Those who know him \nsay Judge Roberts possesses an ideal judicial temperament. He has a \nbalanced view of the power of the Federal Government that is respectful \nof Supreme Court precedent.\n  During his hearings, Judge Roberts described his understanding of the \nSupreme Court's commerce clause jurisprudence and explained that he had \nno agenda to overrule established cases. Judge Roberts also \ndemonstrated his respect for the authority of Congress to make factual \nfindings that form the basis for legislation under the commerce clause.\n\n  As Judge Roberts explained at the hearings:\n\n       One of the warning flags that suggest to you as a judge \n     that you may be beginning to transgress into the area of \n     making a law is when you are in a position of reevaluating \n     legislative findings, because that does not look like a \n     judicial function. It is not an application of analysis under \n     the Constitution. It is just another look at findings.\n\n  Both in private practice and on the bench, Judge Roberts has \nestablished, beyond any doubt, that he is a fair judge within the \njudicial mainstream. Judge Roberts' judicial decisions reflect a fair \napproach and a scrupulous unwillingness to impose his own policy \npreferences on law. I commend Chairman Specter and the members of his \ncommittee for the way they have brought this nomination to the floor. \nWe are a political people, and there were some politics at play. In \npast times, a nominee of Judge Roberts' intellect and integrity and \ncaliber would receive 96, 97, 98 votes in confirmation. I believe \nJustice Ginsburg received 86 votes. I also believe Justice Scalia \nreceived 98 votes. I suspect that will not happen on Thursday. Special \ninterests and single interests have driven a wedge into this Senate \nbody, and that is lamentable. At times, I wondered if committee members \nwere using the hearing to assess Judge Roberts or to lobby him about \nfuture cases. Standards that some Democratic members of the committee \nhave applied to Judge Roberts were the opposite of those applied when \nappointees of their party's President sent up Justices Ginsburg and \nBreyer.\n  Earlier, they counseled judges not to answer specific questions, and \nnow they fault Judge Roberts for being insufficiently specific. But I \nwould say, on a whole, the hearing was fair and dignified. I hope we \nare making progress toward a consistent standard to apply to judicial \nnominees, Supreme Court nominees.\n  A Supreme Court confirmation is not a rehashing of the last \nPresidential campaign or a preview of the next one. The people chose a \nPresident, and that person has a right to appoint a judge who they \nbelieve is consistent with their view of the role and the direction the \nCourt should take. This is a conservative approach. They chose us in \nthe Senate not to substitute our judgment for the President's, but to \nprovide a check against a Justice who was deficient in some clear way. \nThat is why I have stated that whether a Republican or Democrat is \nPresident, my standard will be: Is the person qualified? Do they have \nthe requisite integrity? Do they have the temperament and commitment to \nbe stewards of the rule of law?\n  Judge Roberts meets that test with flying colors. He not only will be \na strong Chief Justice, he will be a role model for the rest of the \nNation. His predecessor and mentor, William Rehnquist, was a \nmidwesterner, as is Judge Roberts. Those of us who call the Midwest \nhome have the utmost respect for those who have the humility to keep \ntheir brilliance a secret. My own remarkable State of Minnesota has \nbeen compared to a dog that is too shy to wag its own tail. Our license \nplates say: The Land Of 10,000 Lakes. I actually think we have closer \nto 15,000, but humility, I think, is a Minnesota way. It certainly is \nthe style of Judge Roberts. We admire Judge Roberts for his grace and \nhumility as he takes on the awesome power of his position. We admire \nhis commitment to equal justice under the law. These are turbulent \ntimes in America. The people need a confidence builder. The President \nhas given them one with this nomination, and we can and should add to \nit with a strong bipartisan vote to confirm Judge Roberts to be Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court. On Thursday, the Senate will exercise its \nsolemn advice-and-consent responsibility on the nomination of John \nRoberts to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \nI will vote to give my consent to the Roberts nomination. I will vote \nin favor of John Roberts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nnomination of John Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  The Chief Justice is commonly referred to as the ``first among \nequals,'' a title reflecting the significance of this position in terms \nof shaping the Court, and serving as the head of the Judicial branch. \nAssuming he is confirmed, Judge Roberts will be only the 17th person in \nour Nation's history to serve as Chief Justice.\n  In confirming a Chief Justice, we entrust this individual with \nconsiderable power--the power to interpret the Constitution, to say \nwhat the law is, to guard one branch against the encroachments of \nanother, and to defend our most sacred rights and liberties. Along with \nthese powers, this individual also bears a responsibility to act with \nan understanding of the limited role of judicial review and the need \nfor judicial restraint.\n  The cases that come before the Supreme Court each year present legal \nissues of tremendous complexity and import. Given the difficulty of the \nquestions presented, it is not surprising that most good Justices do \nnot know how they will rule before a case comes before them. Their \ndecisions are rendered only after extensive briefing, argument, \nresearch, and discussion with the other Justices. Indeed, when any \nperson goes before the Court, he or she has a right to expect that the \nJustices will approach the case with an open mind and a willingness to \nfully consider all of the arguments presented.\n  Some of our colleagues have called on nominees to announce beforehand \nhow they would rule in cases that have yet to come before them. Yet, a \ngood judge will not know, and would not try to say--even hazarding a \nguess could raise questions about judicial impartiality and integrity.\n  Similarly, our ability to question nominees about future cases is \nlimited by the difficulty of predicting the issues that will come \nbefore the Court over the next several decades. Twenty years ago, few \nwould have expected that the Court would hear issues related to a \npresidential election challenge, would try to make sense of copyright \nlaws in an electronic age, or would confront questions on how to \nprotect our cherished civil liberties in light of a new domestic \nterrorism threat.\n  And even if nominees were to indicate how they would rule, the \nreality is that we are not in a position to hold them to their word. \nAppointments to the Court are, of course, lifetime appointments.\n  While we can not know with certainty how a nominee will rule on the \nmany questions that may come before him or her, we can and must strive \nto take the measure of the person: carefully assessing the excellence \nof the nominee's qualifications, integrity, and judicial temperament, \nas well as the principles that will guide the nominee's decisionmaking.\n\n  Does the nominee have the intellect and learning necessary to be a \nsuperb jurist? Is he or she open-minded and pragmatic? Does he or she \nhave a sense of restraint and humility concerning the role of a judge? \nDoes the nominee take seriously the role of our courts in protecting \nour basic liberties and rights from the passions and fads of the \nmoment? And for Judge Roberts, the answer to these questions is yes.\n  The excellence of his legal qualifications is beyond doubt. He is a \nsuperb attorney and one of the finest legal minds of his generation. \nPrior to his appointment to the D.C. Circuit in 2003, Judge Roberts had \nargued an impressive 39 cases before the Supreme Court, and more often \nthan not, his arguments were accepted by a majority of the Court. The \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Judiciary has \nreviewed his qualifications\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\nfor his nominations to the Court of Appeals and the United States \nSupreme Court on three separate occasions. In every instance, it has \ngiven Judge Roberts its highest possible rating.\n  Earlier this month, I met with Judge Roberts to discuss his judicial \nphilosophy, his views on the importance of precedent, and the role of \nthe judiciary. I was extremely impressed by his answers to my \nquestions, which reassured me that he will be a justice dedicated to \nthe rule of law--not someone who bends the rules to suit personal \npreferences or to advance a particular agenda.\n  At our meeting, I asked Judge Roberts about his views regarding the \nimportance of stare decisis--the principle that courts should adhere to \nthe law set forth in previously decided cases. I asked Judge Roberts \nwhether a judge should follow precedent, even if he believed that the \noriginal case was incorrectly decided in the first instance. He told me \nthat overruling a case is a ``jolt to the legal system'' and said that \nit is not enough that a judge may think the prior case was wrongly \ndecided. He emphasized the importance that adherence to precedent plays \nin promoting evenhandedness, fairness, stability, and predictability in \nthe law.\n  Following my personal meeting with Judge Roberts, I felt confident \nthat Judge Roberts was eminently qualified to serve as Chief Justice. \nThe Judiciary Committee hearings have only further confirmed my view \nthat he is the right person for this weighty position.\n  Without question, these hearings demonstrated Judge Roberts' keen \nlegal intellect and commanding knowledge of the law and the precedents \nof the Supreme Court. He demonstrated a winning and collegial style \nwhile under fire, and his testimony has been justifiably praised. Most \nimportant, he demonstrated an understanding of the limited role of the \njudiciary and a deep and abiding commitment to the rule of law.\n\n  During the confirmation process, I was impressed by Judge Roberts' \nstatement that he wants to be known, he said, ``as a modest judge.'' \nThis simple phrase is one that speaks volumes about the approach he \nbrings to the Court. It tells us that he knows a judge must be \nrestrained by the law, and by the principles, the practices, and the \ncommon understandings that make up our legal tradition.\n  It tells us that he has an abiding respect for our Constitution, for \nthe separation of Federal powers it describes, and for the powers it \nreserves for the States and for the people. Perhaps most important, it \ntells us that his rulings will not be influenced by his own political \nviews and personal values, whatever they may be.\n  Given the increasing concerns about judicial activism and the desire \nby some to use the courts to achieve the political ends that have \neluded them, I believe that Judge Roberts' modest and disciplined \napproach to the law will serve our Nation well.\n  The President, in consultation with the Senate, has selected an \noutstanding nominee. We have fulfilled our advice and consent \nresponsibility through extensive interviews, investigations and \nhearings. Judge Roberts has emerged from this process remaining true to \nhis ideals of the proper role of a judge, and demonstrating beyond a \ndoubt his fitness for the office.\n  Based on my personal discussions with Judge Roberts, my review of his \nrecord, and his testimony before Judiciary Committee, I am confident \nthat Judge Roberts will be a Justice committed to the rule of law and \none who will protect the liberties and rights guaranteed by our \nConstitution. I believe he will exercise his judicial duties with an \nunderstanding of the limited role of the judiciary to review and decide \nthe specific cases before them based on the law--not to make policy \nthrough case law. He will be guided not by his own personal view of \nwhat the law should be, but by a disciplined review and analysis of \nwhat the law is. He understands that the very integrity of our judicial \nsystem depends on judges exercising this restraint.\n  For these reasons, I look forward to voting to confirm Judge Roberts, \nand I applaud the President for making an outstanding choice.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  We have had a lot of debate on the Senate floor. We certainly had \nJudiciary Committee hearings talking about our view of this nominee, \nexercising our right of advice and consent for the President's \nnomination, and each of us comes to this role of advice and consent \nwith our own set of criteria.\n  What do I look for in the Chief Justice of the United States? First, \nand most importantly, are academic qualifications. Certainly John \nRoberts started his academic career looking toward a future of academic \nexcellence. He has the background and the intelligence, which he \nexhibited in his hearings and in the meetings we had one-on-one with \nhim. He also has proven his academic qualifications by excelling at \nHarvard in every discipline he studied.\n  Experience: You look for someone who has been tested by life. Someone \nwho is in his 20s probably is not yet ready for cases and laws that \nwill be interpreted for our country because he has not had all of \nlife's experiences to mold him into the person he is going to be--\nknowing life's difficulties and what the laws are like to live with in \nthe private sector. Looking for experience is very important to me.\n  Judge Roberts is 50 years old. I think that is exactly the right age \nto have the requisite experience and is, at the same time, young enough \nto help shape the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Judge Roberts would be \none of the younger Justices in the history of our country.\n  I believe he will make a very important mark on the Court, and \ncertainly as Chief Justice. From the beginning, he will have the \nopportunity to weigh in and do what he thinks is right in interpreting \nour Constitution and keeping the Supreme Court as an equal--not better, \nnot lower--branch of our government.\n  Of course, the balance of powers in the three branches of Government \nis what has kept our democracy, our Republic, and our Constitution so \nrelevant for the entire history of our country. The checks and balances \nin the three branches of Government have been what has allowed the \nConstitution to stay true to the democracy that it has supported for \nmore than 200 years.\n  With regard to knowledge of the law and the key rulings of the \nSupreme Court, I do not think any of us have ever seen a nominee, for \nany level of the judiciary, sit before the Judiciary Committee without \nnotes and talk about all of the key rulings of the Supreme Court--not \nonly talking about the majority opinions and who wrote them, but also \nciting from the minority opinions and dissecting what those opinions \nmeant in the context of the question. It was awesome to hear his \nknowledge of the law and of the key rulings of the Supreme Court.\n  Humility. A lot has been said about Judge Roberts' humility. It is \ngood that he is a humble man and that he has talked about modesty. \nHowever, it was not a factor in my decision-making that he is modest. \nTo me, he could have been an arrogant, smart man with experience, and I \nstill would have supported him. The fact that he is modest is one added \nadvantage that is worth noting, although it was not the prime factor in \nmy decision.\n  Humility does relate to one other point that is important and worth \nmentioning; that is, the role of a judge with a lifetime appointment. \nWhen we have a lifetime appointment, it is, in my opinion, almost a \nleap of faith by those who are consenting to him, and certainly by the \nPresident who is nominating him, about what kind of accountability that \njudge will enforce on him or herself. It is a self-enforced \naccountability on which we must depend. As a matter of fact, when there \nis a lifetime appointment, unless something patently illegal is done, \none will be in that position for an indefinite period of time, maybe \neven beyond the years of productivity. Having a judge who starts out \nhumble is an advantage though not a deciding factor.\n  The role of a judge, as Judge Roberts has said on many occasions, is \none of being a referee, an umpire; not the batter, not the pitcher. \nThat is a good analogy. A judge with a lifetime appointment certainly \nis not accountable to an electorate and is no longer accountable to the \npeople who appointed him or her and the people who consented to the \nnomination. You have to\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\nappoint someone who has a pretty good feel for his role in society and \nin the government. You hope that person is going to remain in the role \nof a judge, interpreting the law and being faithful to the \nConstitution, and not step out of that role to become a lawmaker or a \ndecision-maker of the law.\n  Judge Roberts said during all of his hearings, in response to the \nquestions that were asked of him, the rule of law was so important to \nhim it was the central point that made him want to be a lawyer. I \nbelieve the rule of law protects the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans against the tyranny of the majority and against the tyranny \nof the minority. It is the rule of law, as Theodore Roosevelt once \nsaid, that was very simply stated: ``No person beneath the law; no \nperson above the law.''\n  Judge Roberts testified he became a lawyer, or at least developed as \na lawyer, because he believes in the rule of law. He put it best when \nhe said, if ``you believe in civil rights, you believe in environmental \nprotection, whatever the area might be, believe in rights for the \ndisabled, you're not going to be able or effectively to vindicate those \nrights if you don't have a place that you can go where you know you're \ngoing to get a decision based on the rule of law. . . .So that's why I \nbecame a lawyer, to promote and vindicate the rule of law.''\n  It is this commitment to the rule of law we must expect in our \njudiciary. I remember in particular during the hearings the answer to a \nquestion I appreciated very much. One of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee was trying so hard to find out how Judge Roberts would rule--\neven lean--in a case, so he gave an example. And he said: ``Now, what I \nam trying to find out is, will you vote for the little guy?''\n  Judge Roberts said:\n\n       If the law is on the side of the little guy, I will vote \n     for the little guy. If the law is on the side of the big guy, \n     I will vote for the big guy.\n\n  That is what the rule of law is. As one senior justice on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals remarked, the Honorable Tom Reavley:\n\n       The social order and well-being of our country depends upon \n     the preservation of and allegiance to the rule of law.\n\n  You can tell a lot about a person by whom he admires and why. I \nthought one part of Judge Roberts' testimony told us a lot about him. \nIt was about Judge Henry Friendly. Judge Friendly is one of the great \njustices in the history of our judiciary. He said Judge Friendly had a \ntotal devotion to the rule of law and the confidence that if you just \nworked hard enough at it, you would come up with the right answers. He \nespecially pointed out that Judge Friendly kept at every stage of \ndeciding a case, including reversing his opinion when he found, while \nwriting an opinion, that his original decision--the one he had already \nwritten a majority decision on--no longer seemed to be the right one. \nThen he would take the best majority opinion he could to the other \njudges and explain that he had changed his mind, and he was going to \nvote the other way.\n  Finally, you could see Judge Roberts' admiration for Judge Friendly \nwhen he described his humility. He remarked that Judge Friendly was a \ngenius and that most people would agree he would have made a better \ndecision on most matters than the legislature or a Federal agency. \nStill, Judge Roberts explained that Judge Friendly insisted on \ndeferring to them, the other branches of Government, because those \ndecisions were supposed to be made by the other branches rather then a \njudge who was supposed to simply consider whether their decisions \nconformed to the law.\n  In these remarks Judge Roberts made about his mentor, as well as his \nown reflections on the rule of law, we clearly see the kind of Chief \nJustice that Judge Roberts will be. He is the sort of Chief Justice our \nNation should have, that our Nation needs. I will support Judge John \nRoberts to be elevated to Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I am very pleased this process has gone as smoothly as it has. The \nPresident nominated Judge Roberts after direct consultation with almost \nevery Member of the Senate--certainly every Member who had an opinion \nto give. The hearing process and the time devoted to looking into the \nbackground of the nominee was certainly sufficient. The Judiciary \nCommittee had ample time to ask its questions, and we were enlightened \nby his answers. I believe the Senate will overwhelmingly confirm Judge \nRoberts. I think he will be one of the great Chief Justices in the \nhistory of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJohn Roberts to be Chief Justice to the Supreme Court.\n  I note, as did the Senator from Texas, this has been a relatively \nsmooth process. We should all be glad for that. It has been one that \nmaybe has taken a little bit longer than some would have hoped. \nEverything seems to take longer in the Senate. Maybe that is part of \nthe process. It is a process that is straightforward and clear. This is \na life appointment, and for that reason alone it should be a process \nthat is very deliberate and thorough.\n  It is unfortunate that some people have used the deliberate nature of \nthe process to accentuate the dramatic. There has probably been an \nexcess of hyperbole and an excess of rhetoric probably on both sides of \nthe aisle as we consider this nomination. This is something that has \nbeen done before; it will be done again for decades to come. The Senate \napproves nominations for the judiciary all the time. It should be \nsomething we are accustomed to and feel comfortable in doing and do in \nthe natural course of things rather than deal with the rhetoric and the \nhyperbole and sometimes the partisan tactics we have seen, even in this \nnomination, albeit it has been relatively smooth.\n  The hearings are a case in point. One would expect the bulk of \nnomination hearings to be taken up by testimony from the nominee to be \na Justice, to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the bulk of \nthe hearings to be taken up by that nominee answering questions or \nresponding to queries. For those who did watch the hearings, they would \nagree the bulk of the hearings seemed to be taken up by very lengthy, \nand at times self-indulgent speeches by members of the committee. I \ndon't think that serves the institution particularly well when we view \nthe nomination process or these hearings as an opportunity to talk \nabout ourselves, to talk about our view of the world, to talk about \nwhat we want, rather than to talk about what the country or the \njudiciary needs.\n  We seek--and I think opponents and supporters of Judge Roberts would \nagree with this statement--individuals who are well-qualified to serve \non the bench. I argue, to the chagrin of ideologues on both sides, we \nhave found just that in John Roberts. I say to the chagrin of people on \nboth sides because in the past the smallest perceived or argued concern \nabout an individual's qualification would be used as a screen or as a \njustification for voting against a nominee. In the absence of that \ndecoy, the truth is laid bare that the only reason to object to such a \nqualified nominee is on partisan or ideological grounds.\n  Judge Roberts is eminently qualified. I don't need to describe his \nunbelievably strong record not just as a judge but as an individual \nbringing cases before the court. He has very distinguished experience \nin the private sector, as well as Harvard Law School. In recognizing \nthis individual is among the most qualified ever to come before the \nSenate, his opponents are forced to recognize that their vote against \nhim is simply because he fails their litmus test of partisan ideology \nbecause he refuses to tell legislators how he is going to vote on cases \nthat are yet to come before the court because he believes that Justices \nshould decide cases and not write the law.\n  There are some Members who have already stated their decision to vote \nagainst him for just these reasons. But those are the very reasons, or \nthe very principles, that should be the foundation of an independent \nand impartial judiciary. So when John Roberts' opponents, when those \nSenators who are going to vote no, say: He is well respected, well \nqualified, has a great record on the bench, a great academic record and \ngreat experience, but I am going to vote against him anyway, they are \nsaying, I am going to vote against him because he does not fit my view \nof ideology because he has not committed to vote a particular way on\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\na particular case. That is to say, I am voting against John Roberts \nbecause I do not want an impartial or independent judiciary.\n  That is a wrong and, in fact, dangerous view of what the judiciary \nshould be.\n  They are opposing a capable, accomplished, well-qualified individual, \nand in doing so they are casting a vote against an independent and \nimpartial judiciary. Those who will vote would take to this floor and \nsay: No, that is not the case at all; we are for an independent and \nimpartial judiciary. But I cite for them the very example, the very \ntestimony that was cited earlier by the Senator from Texas. She spoke \nabout a question that concluded in the Judiciary Committee: Will you \nvote for the little guys? That very question indicates that someone had \nalready presupposed what the best vote was for that case, hypothetical \nor not. And if you are looking for a judge who agrees with your \npresupposed verdict in a case, or your presupposed vote in a case, then \nyou have no interest in an impartial or independent judiciary. I think \nit is very difficult to argue the contrary.\n  This is not just a slippery slope, this is a dangerous precedent to \nset--left or right, liberal or conservative. To ask any judge, whether \nit is for the Supreme Court or for the Federal judiciary or the appeals \ncourt, to sit in front of a room of elected legislators and ask them \nabout the position that they would take in cases that they are yet to \nhear is to stand up in front of your constituents, to stand up in \npublic and say: I don't want an independent judiciary. I do not want an \nimpartial judiciary. I just want someone who will commit to me to vote \na specific way.\n  That is not what any judiciary should do. That is not how judges \nshould comport or handle themselves, and that means that I will not \nalways agree with cases and decisions rendered by the Supreme Court or \nmy judge or Justice, but it means that as an elected official or as an \nAmerican feeling confident that instead of looking for a biased \njudiciary, a judiciary that handles its job like a politician selling \nvotes to get where they are, I can sleep at night knowing that I have \ncast votes consistently for an independent, impartial, well-qualified \njudiciary.\n  I think if you talk to the Republicans who are in the Senate who \nvoted nearly unanimously for Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they will argue \nthat is exactly what they had in their minds--not casting a vote for a \njudge that would vote a particular way but voting for someone who at \nthe end of the day they recognized was capable, was well qualified, and \ntherefore would bring those skills and that capability to the judiciary \nin a direct and impartial way. Judge Roberts, in his testimony, \nsummarized the importance of this approach quite well. He said the role \nof a judge is limited. The judges are to decide the cases before them; \nthey are not to legislate. They are not to decide cases.\n  I think it was Justice White who first used those two words to \ndescribe the role of a judge as a Supreme Court Justice--decide cases, \nand decide those cases based on the text of the Constitution as it is \nwritten, not as any one of us wishes that it might have been written. I \nthink in Judge Roberts we find just such an individual who is \nqualified, who is capable, who will, I hope, sit on the bench for a \nlong time supporting, verifying, and validating this very concept of an \nindependent and impartial judiciary. And those who vote against him set \na bad precedent in striking a blow and casting a vote against that \nindependence and impartiality that the Framers so hoped for our country \nfor years to come.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 4:45 \nto 5:45 p.m. will be under the control of the Democratic side.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that the Record show that the \nremarks of the members of the majority caucus have exceeded their \nallotted time by 5 minutes, and that the hour allotted under the \nprevious order to the Democratic caucus be extended by those 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., \nto be the next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The available \nrecord of Judge Roberts' writings during his public career in the \nadministrations of President Reagan and the first President Bush and \nhis very brief 2\\1/2\\ years as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals reveal his persistent opposition to laws enforcing \ndesegregation, protecting minority voting rights, guaranteeing public \neducation to a student with disabilities, and providing damages to a \nstudent who had been sexually abused by a teacher.\n  He, regrettably, declined repeated invitations by Senators during the \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearings to recant or modify some of his \nmost extreme and disturbing statements and positions. For example, in \nthe 1981 memo to White House Counsel Fred Fielding, Judge Roberts \nreferred to Mexican immigrants as ``illegal amigos.'' Before the \nJudiciary Committee he claimed ``it was a play on the standard practice \nof many politicians, including President Reagan, when he was talking to \na Hispanic audience, he would throw in some language in Spanish.''\n  Pressed again, he replied:\n\n       The tone was, I think, generally appropriate for a memo \n     from me to Mr. Fielding.\n\n  I strongly disagree.\n  Also, during the Reagan administration, Judge Roberts was one of the \nlawyers in the Justice Department fighting against any improvements to \nthe Voting Rights Act, according to William L. Taylor in the New York \nReview of Books.\n  Mr. President, I highly commend this article to my colleagues.\n  Judge Roberts reportedly drafted a letter sent to Senator Strom \nThurmond urging him to oppose the bill extending the Voting Rights Act, \nwhich the House had passed by a vote of 389 to 24. Despite Judge \nRoberts' opposition and the opposition of President Reagan, the Senate \npassed the bill 85 to 8, with Senator Thurmond voting with the \nmajority. President Reagan signed it into law 10 days later.\n  In the recent judiciary hearings Judge Roberts claimed his respect \nfor precedent, but he clearly showed no respect for the 1965 Voting \nRights Act when he opposed it 16 years later.\n  In 1982, Judge Roberts opposed the claims of a deaf student that she \nshould have the classroom services of a sign language interpreter under \nthe Federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act. He went so far \nas to write the Attorney General disagreeing with the Solicitor \nGeneral's support for the student when her case went before the Supreme \nCourt. In Judge Roberts' letter to the Attorney General, he reportedly \nreferred to Supreme Court Justices William Brennan and Thurgood \nMarshall as ``the activist duo'' who used the Solicitor General to \nsupport ``an activist role for the courts.''\n  That he would write the Attorney General criticizing the Solicitor \nGeneral does not support his claim that he was then merely a staff \nattorney reflecting the views of his superiors.\n  Judge Roberts did not fair so well 10 years later when, as Deputy \nSolicitor General, he argued that another student, a 10th-grade girl, \nhad no right to damages after having been sexually harassed by a \nteacher. This time the Rehnquist Supreme Court, which included Justices \nScalia and Thomas, rejected Judge Roberts' position and ruled in the \ngirl's favor.\n  Given these and other indications of Judge Roberts' legal views and \njudicial philosophy, it is especially troubling that he and President \nBush refused Senators' requests for other documents he wrote while he \nwas the Deputy Solicitor General. And given his unwillingness before \nthe Senate Judiciary committee to disavow any of his earlier known \nwritings, I can only assume that later hidden documents contained views \nas bad or worse.\n  What Judge Roberts' available writings do show is a man born into \nwealth and privilege and thereby given all of the advantages to assure \nhis success in life, who consistently opposed even lesser opportunities \nfor Americans born into less fortunate circumstances. He called school \ndesegregation ``a failed experiment.'' He claimed that Federal law \nentitled the deaf student only to a ``free, appropriate education,'' \nand denounced the ``effort by activist lower court judges''\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\nto give her more. He opposed compensatory damages for the student \nsexually harassed by her teacher even though the Federal Government was \nnot a party in the case, writing that it had ``an investment in \nassuring that private remedies do not interfere with programs funded by \ntitle IX.''\n  My principal concerns are not about Judge Roberts' mind but about his \nheart.\n  Of even greater concern, because it was so recent, was Judge Roberts' \nfailure to recuse himself from a case before the court of appeals which \ninvolved President Bush as a principal defendant while he was being \nconsidered for nomination to the Supreme Court. Reportedly, Judge \nRoberts' first interview with the U.S. Attorney General regarding his \npossible nomination to the Supreme Court occurred last April 1, before \nthe case was argued before the appeals court panel on which Judge \nRoberts was one of the three judges. On May 3, Judge Roberts evidently \nmet with Vice President Cheney, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, \nAttorney General Gonzales, and senior White House adviser Karl Rove \nregarding his possible nomination. On May 23, White House Counsel \nHarriet Miers interviewed Judge Roberts again.\n\n  On July 15, Judge Roberts and another judge on the appeals court \npanel ruled entirely in President Bush's favor and against the \nplaintiff. Four days later, the President nominated him to the Supreme \nCourt. The plaintiff and his attorney were reportedly unaware of Judge \nRoberts' job interviews with the President's legal counsel and closest \nassociates until his August response to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's questionnaire.\n  Holding those job interviews, not disclosing them to the plaintiff's \ncounsel, and not recusing himself from the case after the interviews \nbegan all violated Federal law under disqualification of judges \naccording to a Slate magazine article, which continued:\n\n       Federal law deems public trust in the courts so critical \n     that it requires judges to step aside if their impartiality \n     might be reasonably questioned even if the judge is \n     completely impartial as a matter of fact.\n\n  As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a 1988 Supreme Court opinion:\n\n       The very purpose of this law is to promote confidence in \n     the judiciary by avoiding the appearance of partiality \n     whenever possible.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Slate magazine \narticle entitled ``Improper Advances: Talking Dream Jobs with the Judge \nOut of Court'' be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. It seems clear to this Senator that the only way to avoid \nthe appearance of impropriety deciding a case directly involving the \nPresident of the United States while being considered by him for \nnomination to the Supreme Court was for Judge Roberts to remove himself \nfrom the appeals court panel. At a minimum he should have disclosed \nthose interviews to the plaintiff and his attorney.\n  When asked about this case during the Judiciary Committee's hearings, \nJudge Roberts declined to acknowledge any regret for his actions even \nwith the benefit of hindsight. I find his lack of self-awareness to be \nshocking. Can an impartial observer not wonder whether Judge Roberts \nwould have been nominated by the President to the Supreme Court if he \nruled against the President 4 days earlier?\n  Obviously, the instances I have cited do not comprise the complete \npublic record of Judge Roberts. Regrettably, as I said earlier, we will \nnot have the complete record because important documents from his \ntenure as Deputy Solicitor General in the first Bush administration are \nbeing withheld from us. These and other similar incidents do, however, \nraise sufficient doubts and concerns so that I cannot vote to confirm \nJudge Roberts as the next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. My \ndoubts and concerns are magnified by the enormity of his influence over \nthe Court and the country during, given his age and life expectancy, \nprobably the next 30 to 40 years.\n  I disagree with my colleagues and fellow citizens who view the \ncurrent Supreme Court as some liberal bastion.\n  In fact, seven of the nine Justices were nominated by Republican \nPresidents. During the past decade, the Rehnquist Court rejected \ncongressional actions on affirmative action, violence against women, \nAmericans with disabilities, age discrimination in employment, and \nenforcement of environmental laws. Many crucial cases were decided by \n5-to-4 votes. I view the current Supreme Court as closely divided \nbetween this country's conservative center and its far-right extreme. I \nfear this nominee and the President's next nominee will shift the Court \ndrastically and destructively toward that far-right extreme. That may \nform the President's political base, but it does not constitute the \ncountry's citizen base.\n  The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just a politically \nfavored minority. Its Justices should be exactly what many right-wing \nactivists don't want--men and women of moderate, independent views who \nwill decide cases from mainstream judicial and social perspectives \nrather than extreme ideological prisms. How much do the Court's \nopinions matter to the lives of all Americans? Enormously, more than we \nrealize and much more than we take for granted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Harper's magazine by \nUniversity of Chicago law professor Cass R. Sunstein be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. He pointed out that in 1920, minimum wage and maximum \nhour laws were unconstitutional in this country. In 1945, he wrote, the \nSupreme Court permitted racial segregation, did not protect the right \nto vote, and gave little protection to political dissent. Fortunately, \nsubsequent Supreme Courts reversed those decisions. Unfortunately, \nsubsequent Supreme Courts can reverse them again.\n  Millions and millions of Americans depend upon the rights and \nprotections secured by those and other longstanding laws, and they \nassume those rights and protections are guaranteed, not provisional, \nand not contingent upon who is sitting on the Supreme Court. Those \nmillions of Americans, most of whom do not share the extreme views of \nthe Republican Party's radical right wing, deserve to continue their \nlives with the rights and protections established by previous Supreme \nCourts. Those citizens and this Senate are entitled to know whether a \nChief Justice Roberts and a Roberts Supreme Court would respect and \nuphold those long-established precedents and principles or reject them. \nInstead, we are being asked to wonder now and wait to find out later. \nThat is too risky a gamble with the future of America and why I will \nvote against Judge Roberts' nomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n   Improper Advances--Talking dream jobs with the judge out of court\n\n         (By Stephen Gillers, David J. Luban, and Steven Lubet)\n\n       Four days before President Bush nominated John G. Roberts \n     to the Supreme Court on July 19, an appeals court panel of \n     three judges, including Judge Roberts, handed the Bush \n     administration a big victory in a hotly, contested challenge \n     to the president's military commissions. The challenge was \n     brought by Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Guantanamo detainee. \n     President Bush was a defendant in the case because he had \n     personally, in writing, found ``reason to believe'' that \n     Hamdan was a terrorist subject to military tribunals. The \n     appeals court upheld the rules the president had authorized \n     for these military commissions, and it rejected Hamdan's \n     human rights claims--including claims for protection under \n     the Geneva Conventions.\n       At the time, the close proximity of the court's decision \n     and the Roberts nomination suggested no appearance of \n     impropriety. Roberts had been assigned to hear the appeal \n     back in December, and it was argued on April 7. Surely he had \n     decided the case long before the administration first \n     approached him about replacing Supreme Court Justice Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, who had announced her retirement on July 1. As \n     it turns out, however, the timing was not so simple.\n       The nominee's Aug. 2 answers to a Senate questionnaire \n     reveal that Roberts had several interviews with \n     administration officials contemporaneous with the progress of \n     the Hamdan appeal. One occurred even before the appeal was \n     argued. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales interviewed the \n     judge on April 1. Back then, it was an ailing Chief Justice \n     William H. Rehnquist, not Justice O'Connor, who was expected \n     to retire. The attorney general, of course, heads the Justice \n     Department, which represents the defendants in Hamdan's case. \n     And as White House counsel, Gonzales had advised the\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\n     president on the requirements of the Geneva Conventions, \n     which were an issue in the case.\n       The April interview must have gone quite well because \n     Roberts next enjoyed what can only be labeled callback \n     heaven. On May 3, he met with Vice President Dick Cheney; \n     Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff; Karl \n     Rove, Bush's chief political strategist; Harriet Miers, the \n     White House legal counsel; Gonzales; and I. Lewis Libby, the \n     vice president's chief of staff. On May 23, Miers interviewed \n     Judge Roberts again.\n       Hamdan's lawyer was completely in the dark about these \n     interviews until Roberts revealed them to the Senate. (Full \n     disclosure: Professor Luban is a faculty colleague of \n     Hamdan's principal lawyer.) Did administration officials or \n     Roberts ask whether it was proper to conduct interviews for a \n     possible Supreme Court nomination while the judge was \n     adjudicating the government's much-disputed claims of \n     expansive presidential powers? Did they ask whether it was \n     appropriate to do so without informing opposing counsel?\n       If they had asked, they would have discovered that the \n     interviews violated federal law on the disqualification of \n     judges. Federal law deems public trust in the courts so \n     critical that it requires judges to step aside if their \n     ``impartiality might reasonably be questioned,'' even if the \n     judge is completely impartial as a matter of fact. As Justice \n     John Paul Stevens wrote in a 1988 Supreme Court opinion, \n     ``the very purpose of [this law] is to promote confidence in \n     the judiciary by avoiding even the appearance of impropriety \n     whenever possible.'' The requirement of an appearance of \n     impartiality has been cited in situations like the one here, \n     leading to the disqualification of a judge or the reversal of \n     a verdict.\n       In 1985, a federal appeals court in Chicago cited the \n     requirement of the appearance of impartiality when it ordered \n     the recusal of a federal judge who, planning to leave the \n     bench, had hired a ``headhunter'' to approach law firms in \n     the city. By mistake--and, in fact, contrary to the judge's \n     instructions--the headhunter contacted two opposing firms in \n     a case then pending before the judge. One firm rejected the \n     overture outright. The other was negative but not quite as \n     definitive. Writing for the Court of Appeals, Judge Richard \n     A. Posner emphasized that the trial judge ``is a judge of \n     unblemished honor and sterling character,'' and that he ``is \n     accused of, and has committed, no impropriety.'' \n     Nevertheless, the court ordered the judge to recuse himself \n     because of the appearance of partiality. ``The dignity and \n     independence of the judiciary are diminished when the judge \n     comes before lawyers in the case in the role of a suppliant \n     for employment. The public cannot be confident that a case \n     tried under such conditions will be decided in accordance \n     with the highest traditions of the judiciary.'' Although both \n     law firms had refused to offer him employment, the court held \n     that ``an objective observer might wonder whether [the judge] \n     might not at some unconscious level favor the firm . . . that \n     had not as definitively rejected him.''\n       In the fall and winter of 1984, a criminal-trial judge in \n     the District of Columbia was discussing a managerial position \n     with the Department of Justice while the local U.S. \n     attorney's office--which is part of the department--was \n     prosecuting an intent-to-kill case before him.\n       Following the conviction and sentence, the judge was \n     offered the department job and accepted. On appeal, the \n     United States conceded that the judge had acted improperly by \n     presiding at the trial during the employment negotiations. It \n     argued, however, that the conviction should not be \n     overturned. The appeals court disagreed. Relying on Judge \n     Posner's opinion in the Chicago case, as well as the rules of \n     judicial ethics, the court vacated the conviction even though \n     the defendant did not ``claim that his trial was unfair or \n     that the [the judge] was actually biased against him.'' The \n     court was ``persuaded that an objective observer might have \n     difficulty understanding that [the judge] did not . . . \n     realize . . . that others might question his impartiality.''\n       So, the problem in Hamdan is not that Roberts may have cast \n     his vote to improve his chances of promotion. We believe he \n     is a man of integrity who voted as he thought the law \n     required. The problem is that if one side that very much \n     wants to win a certain case can secretly approach the judge \n     about a dream job while the case is still under active \n     consideration, and especially if the judge shows interest in \n     the job, the public's trust in the judiciary (not to mention \n     the opposing party's) suffers because the public can never \n     know how the approach may have affected the judge's thinking. \n     Perhaps, as Judge Posner wrote, the judge may have been \n     influenced even in ways that he may not consciously \n     recognize.\n       A further complication here is that Roberts' vote was not a \n     mere add on. His vote was decisive on a key question of \n     presidential power that now confronts the nation. Although \n     all three judges reached the same bottom line in the case, \n     they were divided on whether the Geneva Conventions grant \n     basic human rights to prisoners like Hamdan who don't qualify \n     for other Geneva protections. The lower court had held that \n     some provisions do. Judge Roberts and a second judge rejected \n     that view. The third judge said Geneva did apply, but found \n     it premature to resolve the issues it raised. Hamdan has \n     since asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n       Roberts did not have to sit out every case involving the \n     government, no matter how routine, while he was being \n     interviewed for the Supreme Court position. The government \n     litigates too many cases for that to make any sense. But \n     Hamdan was not merely suing the government. He was suing the \n     president, who had authorized the military commissions and \n     who had personally designated Hamdan for a commission trial, \n     explaining that ``there is reason to believe that [Hamdan] \n     was ... involved in terrorism.''\n       Moreover, the Hamdan appeal is the polar opposite of \n     routine for at least two reasons. First, its issues are \n     central to the much-disputed claims of broad presidential \n     power in the war on terror. Second, the court's decision on \n     the Geneva Conventions has a spillover effect on the legality \n     of controversial interrogation techniques used by the \n     government at Guantanamo and elsewhere. That is because the \n     same provision of the Geneva Conventions that would protect \n     Hamdan from unfair trials also protects detainees from cruel, \n     humiliating, or degrading treatment. The D.C. Circuit's \n     decision rejecting the Geneva Conventions' trial \n     protections--a decision that hinged on Roberts' vote--also \n     strips away an important legal safeguard against cruel and \n     humiliating treatment that may fall just short of torture.\n       Given the case's importance, then, when Gonzales \n     interviewed Roberts for a possible Supreme Court seat on \n     April 1, the judge should have withdrawn from the Hamdan \n     appeal. Or he and Gonzales, as the opposing lawyer, should \n     have revealed the interview to Hamdan's lawyer, who could \n     then have decided whether to make a formal recusal motion. \n     The need to do one or the other became acute--indeed \n     incontrovertible--when arrangements were made for the May 3 \n     interview with six high government officials. (We don't know \n     how long before May 3 the arrangements were made.)\n       We do not cite these events to raise questions about \n     Roberts' fitness for the Supreme Court. In the rush of \n     business, his oversight may be understandable. What is \n     immediately at stake, however, is the appearance of justice \n     in the Hamdan and the proper resolution of an important legal \n     question about the limits on presidential power. Although the \n     procedural rules are murky, it may yet be possible for Judge \n     Roberts to withdraw his vote retroactively. That would at \n     least eliminate the precedential effect of the opinion on \n     whether the Geneva Conventions grant minimum human rights to \n     Hamdan and others in his position. Better yet, the Supreme \n     Court can remove the opinion's precedential effect by taking \n     the Hamdan case and reversing it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE SUPREME COURT--How right-wing judges are transforming \n                            the Constitution\n\n                         (By Cass R. Sunstein)\n\n       In current political theater surrounding George W. Bush's \n     judicial nominations, and the anxiety over the nomination of \n     John G. Roberts as swing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's \n     successor, there is surprisingly little discussion of what is \n     actually at stake. For, in truth, the battle over the \n     judiciary is part of a much larger political campaign to \n     determine not only the constitutionality of abortion and the \n     role of religion in public life but also the very character \n     of our Constitution, and thus our national government. Many \n     people assume (no doubt because this is what they are told) \n     that the meaning of the Constitution is set in stone, and \n     that the disputes raging in the Senate and on the Sunday talk \n     shows are between liberal judicial activists and conservative \n     ``strict constructionists'' who adhere to the letter of the \n     text. In fact, the contest is much more complicated and \n     interesting--and, in most important respects, this \n     conventional view of the subject is badly wrong.\n       Historically, our political disagreements have produced \n     fundamental changes in our founding document. When one \n     president succeeds another, for example, and the makeup of \n     the federal judiciary and the Supreme Court changes, the \n     Constitution's meaning often shifts dramatically. As a \n     result, our most basic rights and institutions can be \n     altered. Participants in the current battle over the \n     judiciary are entirely aware of this point; they know that \n     the meaning of the Constitution will be determined by the \n     battle's outcome, and that significant rights that Americans \n     now take for granted--such as the right to privacy and the \n     power of ordinary citizens to have access to the federal \n     courts--are very much at stake.\n       In 1920 minimum-wage and maximum-hour laws were \n     unconstitutional. As the Supreme Court interpreted the \n     Constitution at that time, it could not possibly have \n     permitted a Social Security Act or a National Labor \n     Relations Act. In the 1930s, President Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt sought to legitimate the New Deal, whose \n     centerpieces included minimum-wage and maximum hour laws, \n     the Social Security Act, and the National Labor Relations \n     Act. Roosevelt didn't try to change a word of the \n     Constitution, but by 1937 a reconstituted Supreme Court \n     upheld nearly everything that Roosevelt wanted. In 1945 \n     the Constitution permitted racial segregation, did not \n     protect the right to vote, permitted official prayers in \n     the public schools, and gave little protection to \n     political dissent. By 1970 the same Constitution \n     prohibited racial segregation, safeguarded the right to \n     vote, banned official prayers in the public schools, and \n     offered broad protection not only to political dissent but \n     also to speech of all kinds. If American citizens in 1945 \n     were placed in a time machine, they would have a hard time \n     recognizing their Constitution merely twenty-five years \n     later.\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\n       In recent years a new form of judicial activism has emerged \n     from private organizations, law schools, and the nation's \n     courtrooms. Purporting to revere history, the new activists \n     claim that they are returning to the original Constitution--\n     which they sometimes call the Lost Constitution or the \n     Constitution in Exile. The reformers include a number of \n     federal judges, such as Supreme Court Justices Clarence \n     Thomas and Antonin Scalia (though Scalia is more \n     circumspect). Appointed by Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, \n     or George W. Bush, these judges do not hesitate to depart \n     radically from longstanding understandings of constitutional \n     meaning. They would like to interpret the Constitution to \n     strike down affirmative-action programs, gun-control \n     legislation, and restrictions on commercial advertising; they \n     also seek to impose severe restrictions on Congress's powers \n     and to invalidate campaign-finance regulations, environmental \n     regulations, and much else. Justice Thomas would allow states \n     to establish official religions. The logic of the new \n     approach would even permit the federal government to \n     discriminate on the basis of race and sex.\n       It is tempting to think that what we are seeing today is \n     merely a periodic swing of some hypothetical judicial \n     pendulum, that the courts are returning to a period of \n     restraint after the liberal activism of the past sixty years. \n     And, in fact, some principled conservatives have favored \n     exactly that. But they increasingly find themselves on the \n     defensive. Today, many people are seeking a kind of \n     constitutional revolution--one that involves activism rather \n     than restraint. Many right-wing activists are willing to undo \n     what they readily acknowledge to be the will of the people. \n     Their intentions are no secret; they are publicly proclaimed \n     in articles, judicial opinions, and speeches. There is no \n     question, moreover, that some of these extremists seek to \n     curtail or abolish rights that most citizens regard as \n     essential parts of our national identity. Indeed, it is \n     difficult to escape the conclusion that it is precisely \n     because their ideological goals are politically unachievable \n     that they have turned to the courts.\n       This ambitious program is the culmination of a significant \n     shift in conservative thought. In the 1960s and 1970s, many \n     conservatives were committed to a restrained and cautious \n     federal judiciary. Their major targets included Roe v. Wade, \n     which protected the right to abortion, and Miranda v. \n     Arizona, which protected accused criminals; conservatives saw \n     these rulings as unsupportable judicial interference with \n     political choices. Democracy was their watchword; they wanted \n     the courts to back off. They asked judges to respect the \n     decisions of Congress, the president, and state \n     legislatures; they spoke insistently of the people's right \n     to rule themselves. This is no longer true. Increasingly, \n     the goal has been to promote ``movement judges,'' judges \n     with no interest in judicial restraint and with a \n     demonstrated willingness to strike down the acts of \n     Congress and state government. Movement judges have an \n     agenda, which overlaps, as it happens, with that of the \n     most extreme wing of the Republican Party.\n       In many areas, the new activists have enjoyed important \n     victories. Consider the fact that the Rehnquist Court has \n     overturned more than three dozen federal enactments since \n     1995, a record of aggression against the national legislature \n     that is unequaled in the nation's history. In terms of sheer \n     numbers of invalidations of acts of Congress, the Rehnquist \n     Court qualifies as the all-time champion. A few \n     illustrations:\n       The Rehnquist Court has thrown most affirmative-action \n     programs into extremely serious doubt, suggesting that public \n     employers will rarely be able to operate such programs and \n     that affirmative action will be acceptable only in narrow \n     circumstances.\n       The Rehnquist Court has used the First Amendment to \n     invalidate many forms of campaign-finance legislation, with \n     Justices Scalia and Thomas suggesting that they would strike \n     down almost all legislation limiting campaign contributions \n     and expenditures.\n       For the first time since the New Deal, the Rehnquist Court \n     has struck down congressional enactments under the Commerce \n     Clause. As a result of the Court's invalidation of the \n     Violence Against Women Act, a large number of federal laws \n     have been thrown into constitutional doubt. Several \n     environmental statutes, including the Endangered Species Act, \n     are in trouble.\n       Departing from its own precedents, the Rehnquist Court has \n     sharply limited congressional authority to enforce the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. In the process, the Court has struck \n     down key provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n     the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Violence \n     Against Women Act--all of which received overwhelming \n     bipartisan support in Congress.\n       The Rehnquist Court has used the idea of state sovereign \n     immunity to strike down a number of congressional enactments, \n     including parts of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n       For the first time in the nation's history, the Rehnquist \n     Court has ruled that Congress lacks the power to give \n     citizens and taxpayers the right to sue to ensure enforcement \n     of environmental laws.\n       Even so, the Rehnquist Court has not been a truly radical \n     court, in large part because Justice O'Connor resisted large-\n     scale change. The Court has hardly returned to the 1920s. It \n     has not overruled Roe v. Wade. It has rejected President \n     Bush's boldest claims of authority to detain suspected \n     terrorists. It has struck down laws that criminalize same-\n     sex relationships. It has not entirely eliminated \n     affirmative-action programs. In especially controversial \n     decisions, it has invalidated the death penalty for \n     mentally retarded people and for juveniles. But even if \n     those who seek to reorient the Supreme Court have not \n     received all that they wanted, they have succeeded in \n     producing a body of constitutional law that is \n     fundamentally different from what it was twenty years ago. \n     To a degree that has been insufficiently appreciated, the \n     contemporary federal courts are fundamentally different \n     from the federal courts of two decades ago. The center has \n     become the left. The right is now the center. The left no \n     longer exists.\n       Consider a few examples. Justices William Brennan and \n     Thurgood Marshall were the prominent liberals on the Court in \n     1980; they did not hesitate to use the Constitution to \n     protect the most disadvantaged members of society, including \n     criminal defendants, African Americans, and the poor. Brennan \n     and Marshall have no successors on the current Court; their \n     approach to the Constitution has entirely disappeared from \n     the bench. For many years, William Rehnquist was the most \n     conservative member of the Court. He was far to the right of \n     Chief Justice Warren Burger, also a prominent conservative. \n     But Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are far to \n     Rehnquist's right, converting him into a relative moderate.\n       In 1980 the Scalia/Thomas brand of conservative had no \n     defenders within the federal judiciary; their distinctive \n     approach was restricted to a few professors at a few law \n     schools. But it is extremely prominent on the federal bench \n     today. Justice John Paul Stevens is a Republican moderate, \n     appointed to the Court by President Gerald Ford. For a long \n     period, Justice Stevens was well known as a maverick and a \n     centrist--independent-minded; hardly liberal, and someone \n     whose views could not be put into any predictable category. \n     He is now considered part of the Court's ``liberal wing.'' In \n     most areas, Justice Stevens has changed little if at all; \n     what has changed is the Court's center of gravity.\n       Of the more cautious decisions in recent years, almost all \n     were issued by a bare majority of 5-4 or a close vote of 6-3. \n     With looming changes in the Court's composition, the moderate \n     decisions might well shift in immoderate directions. We can \n     easily foresee a situation in which federal judges move far \n     more abruptly in the directions they have been heading. They \n     might not only invalidate all affirmative-action programs but \n     also elevate commercial advertising to the same status as \n     political speech, thus preventing controls on commercials by \n     tobacco companies (among others). They might strike down \n     almost all campaign-finance reform; reduce the power of \n     Congress and the states to enact gun-control legislation; \n     and significantly extend the reach of the Fifth \n     Amendment's Takings Clause, thus limiting environmental \n     and other regulatory legislation.\n       I have said that the new activists believe the Constitution \n     should be understood to mean what it originally meant. \n     Because of their commitment to following the original \n     understanding, we may call them judicial fundamentalists. \n     When President Bush speaks of ``strict construction,'' he is \n     widely understood to be endorsing fundamentalism in \n     constitutional law. Fundamentalists insist that \n     constitutional interpretation requires an act of rediscovery. \n     Their goal is to return to what they see as the essential \n     source of constitutional meaning: the views of those who \n     ratified the document. The key constitutional questions thus \n     become historical ones. Suppose that the Constitution was not \n     originally understood to ban sex discrimination, protect \n     privacy, outlaw racial segregation, or forbid censorship of \n     blasphemy. If so, that's that. Judges have no authority to \n     depart from the understanding of 1789, when the original \n     Constitution was ratified, or 1791, when the Bill of Rights \n     was ratified, or 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was \n     ratified.\n       Fundamentalists are entirely aware that current \n     constitutional law does not reflect their own approach. They \n     know that for many decades, the Court has not been willing to \n     freeze the Constitution in the mold of the eighteenth and \n     nineteenth centuries. For this reason fundamentalists have \n     radical inclinations; they seek to make large-scale changes \n     in constitutional law. Some fundamentalists, like Justice \n     Scalia, believe in respecting precedent and hence do not want \n     to make these changes all at once; but they hope to make them \n     sooner rather than later. Other fundamentalists, including \n     Justice Clarence Thomas, are entirely willing to abandon \n     precedent in order to return to the original understanding. \n     Many conservative activists agree with Thomas rather than \n     Scalia.\n       Suppose the Supreme Court of the United States suddenly \n     adopted fundamentalism and began to understand the \n     Constitution in accordance with the specific views of those \n     who ratified its provisions. What would happen? The \n     consequences would be extremely dramatic. For example:\n       Discrimination on the basis of sex would be entirely \n     acceptable. If a state chose to forbid women to be lawyers or \n     doctors or engineers, the Constitution would not stand in the \n     way. The national government could certainly discriminate \n     against women. If it wanted to ban women from the U.S. Civil \n     Service, or to restrict them to clerical positions, the \n     Constitution would not be offended.\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\n       The national government would be permitted to discriminate \n     on the basis of race. The Equal Protection Clause of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment is the Constitution's prohibition on \n     racial discrimination--and by its clear language, it applies \n     only to state governments, not to the national one. Honest \n     fundamentalists have to admit that according to their method, \n     the national government can segregate the armed forces, the \n     Washington, D.C., public schools, or anything it chooses. In \n     fact, the national government could exclude African \n     Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, whenever it liked.\n       State governments would probably be permitted to impose \n     racial segregation. As a matter of history, the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was not understood to ban segregation on the \n     basis of race. Of course, the Supreme Court struck down \n     racial segregation in its 1954 decision in Brown v. Board \n     of Education. But this decision was probably wrong on \n     fundamentalist grounds.\n       State governments would be permitted to impose poll taxes \n     on state and local elections; they could also violate the \n     one-person, one-vote principle. On fundamentalist grounds, \n     these interferences with the right to vote, and many more, \n     would be entirely acceptable. In fact, state governments \n     could do a great deal to give some people more political \n     power than others. According to most fundamentalists, there \n     simply is no ``right to vote.''\n       The entire Bill of Rights might apply only to the national \n     government, not to the states. Very possibly, states could \n     censor speech of which they disapproved, impose cruel and \n     unusual punishment, or search people's homes without a \n     warrant. There is a reasonable argument that on \n     fundamentalist grounds, the Court has been wrong to read the \n     Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to state \n     governments.\n       States might well be permitted to establish official \n     churches. Justice Clarence Thomas has specifically argued \n     that they can.\n       The Constitution would provide much less protection to free \n     speech than it now does. Some historians have suggested that \n     on the original understanding, the federal government could \n     punish speech that it deemed dangerous or unacceptable, so \n     long as it did not ban such speech in advance.\n       Compulsory sterilization of criminals would not offend the \n     Constitution. The government could ban contraceptives or \n     sodomy. There would be no right of privacy.\n       This is an extraordinary agenda for constitutional law, and \n     it provides only a glimpse of what fundamentalism, taken \n     seriously; would seem to require. Should we really adopt it? \n     During the controversy over the 1987 nomination of Judge \n     Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, Judge Richard Posner, a \n     Reagan appointee, produced an ingenious little paper called \n     ``Bork and Beethoven.'' Posner noticed that Commentary \n     magazine had published an essay celebrating Bork's \n     fundamentalism in the same issue in which another essay \n     sharply criticized the ``authentic-performance movement'' in \n     music, in which musicians play the works of great composers \n     on the original instruments. Posner observes that the two \n     articles ``take opposite positions on the issue of \n     `originalism'--that is, interpretive fidelity to a text's \n     understanding by its authors.'' While one essay endorses \n     Bork's fidelity to the views of people in 1787, the other \n     despises the authentic-performance movement on the grounds \n     that the music sounds awful. If originalism makes bad music \n     (or bad law), Posner asks, ``why should the people listen to \n     it?''\n       Fundamentalists get a lot of rhetorical mileage out of \n     insisting that their approach is neutral while other \n     approaches are simply a matter of ``politics.'' But there is \n     nothing neutral in fundamentalism. It is a political choice, \n     which must be defended on political grounds. The Constitution \n     doesn't set out a theory of interpretation; it doesn't \n     announce that judges must follow the original understanding. \n     Liberals and conservatives disagree on many things, but most \n     would agree that the Constitution forbids racial segregation \n     by the federal government and protects a robust free-speech \n     principle. If fundamentalism produces a far worse system of \n     constitutional law, one that abandons safeguards that are \n     important to the fabric of American life, that must count as \n     a strong point against it.\n       Fundamentalists often defend their approach through the \n     claim that it is highly democratic--far more so than allowing \n     unelected judges to give meaning to the constitutional text. \n     But there is a big gap in their argument. Why should living \n     people be governed by the particular views of those who died \n     many generations ago? Most of the relevant understandings \n     come from 1789, when the Constitution was ratified, or 1791, \n     when the Bill of Rights was ratified. If democracy is our \n     lodestar, it is hardly clear that we should be controlled by \n     those eighteenth-century judgments today. Why should we be \n     governed by people long dead? In any case, the group that \n     ratified the Constitution included just a small subset of \n     the society; it excluded all women, most African \n     Americans, many of those without property, and numerous \n     others who were not permitted to vote. Does the ideal of \n     democracy really mean that current generations must follow \n     the understandings of a small portion of the population \n     from centuries ago? Yet fundamentalists want to strike \n     down many laws enacted by the people's representatives. \n     What's democratic about that?\n       I am not arguing that the Constitution itself should not be \n     taken as binding. Of course it should be. The Constitution is \n     binding because it is an exceedingly good constitution, all \n     things considered, and because many bad things, including \n     relative chaos, would ensue if we abandoned it. We're much \n     better off with it than without it. But no abstract concept, \n     like ``democracy,'' is enough to explain why we must follow \n     the Constitution; and invoking that concept is a hopelessly \n     inadequate way to justify fundamentalism.\n       Fundamentalists have other problems. It is a disputed \n     historical question whether those who ratified the \n     Constitution wanted judges to be bound by the original \n     understanding. The Constitution uses broad phrases, such as \n     ``freedom of speech'' and ``equal protection of the laws'' \n     and ``due process of law''; it does not include the \n     particular views of those who ratified it. Maybe the original \n     understanding was that the original understanding was not \n     binding. Maybe the ratifiers believed that the Constitution \n     set out general principles that might change over time. If \n     so, fundamentalism turns out to be self-defeating.\n       In any case, it isn't so easy to make sense of the idea of \n     ``following'' specific understandings when facts and \n     circumstances have radically changed. Does the free-speech \n     principle apply to the Internet? Does the ban on unreasonable \n     searches and seizures apply to wiretapping? To answer such \n     questions, we cannot simply imagine that we have gone into a \n     time machine and posed these questions to James Madison and \n     Alexander Hamilton. For one thing, Madison and Hamilton would \n     have no idea what we were talking about; for another, they \n     probably wouldn't believe us if we explained it to them. \n     Changed circumstances are pervasive in constitutional \n     interpretation. To say the least, they complicate the \n     fundamentalist project; they might even make it incoherent.\n       Many fundamentalists appeal to the idea of consent as a \n     basis for legitimacy. In their view, we are bound by the \n     Constitution because we agreed to it; we are not bound by the \n     constitution of France or any model constitution that might \n     be drafted by today's best and brightest. Although it's true \n     that we're not bound by those constitutions, it is false to \n     say that we're bound by the Constitution because ``we'' \n     agreed to it. None of us did. Of course we benefit greatly \n     from its existence, and most of us do not try to change it; \n     but it is fanciful to say that we've agreed to it. The \n     legitimacy of the Constitution does not lie in consent. It \n     is legitimate because it provides an excellent framework \n     for freedom and democratic self-government and promotes \n     many other goals as well, including economic prosperity. \n     The fundamentalists' arguments about legitimacy beg all \n     the important questions. Ancient ratification is not \n     enough to make the Constitution legitimate. We follow the \n     Constitution because it is good for us to follow the \n     Constitution. Is it good for us to follow the original \n     understanding? Actually, it would be terrible.\n       Justice Antonin Scalia emphasizes the stability that comes \n     from fundantalism, which, in his view, can produce a ``rock-\n     hard'' Constitution. True, fundamentalism might lead to \n     greater stability in our constitutional understandings than \n     we have now. Unless readings of history change, the \n     Constitution would mean the same thing fifty years from now \n     as it means today. But fundamentalism would produce stability \n     only by radically destabilizing the system of rights that we \n     have come to know. At least as bad, fundamentalism would \n     destabilize not only our rights but our institutions as well; \n     many fundamentalists would like to throw the Federal Reserve \n     Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the \n     Federal Communications Commission into constitutional doubt. \n     In a way, fundamentalism would promote the rule of law--but \n     only after defeating established expectations and upsetting \n     longstanding practices on which Americans have come to rely.\n       Stability is only one value, and for good societies it is \n     not the most import one. If an approach to the Constitution \n     would lead to a little less stability but a lot more \n     democracy, there is good reason to adopt it. Since 1950 our \n     constitutional system has not been entirely stable; the \n     document has been reinterpreted to ban racial segregation, to \n     protect the right to vote, to forbid sex discrimination, and \n     to contain a robust principle of free speech. Should we \n     really have sought more stability?\n       Unfortunately, many fundamentalists are not faithful to \n     their own creed. When their political commitments are \n     intense, their interest in history often falters. Here's a \n     leading example: Fundamentalists on the bench, including \n     Justices Scalia and Thomas, enthusiastically vote to strike \n     down affirmative-action programs. In their view, the Equal \n     Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires color \n     blindness. History strongly suggests otherwise. In the \n     aftermath of the Civil War, Congress enacted several programs \n     that provided particular assistance to African Americans. The \n     Reconstruction Congress that approved the Fourteenth \n     Amendment simultaneously enacted a number of race-specific \n     programs for African Americans. The most important examples \n     involve the Freedmen's Bureau, created in 1865 as a means of \n     providing special benefits and assistance for African \n     Americans. The opponents of the Freedmen's Bureau Acts \n     attacked the bureau on, the ground that it would apply to \n     members of only one race. The response was that \n     discrimination was justified in the interest of equality: \n     ``We\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\n     need a freedmen's bureau,'' said one supporter, ``not because \n     these people are negroes, but because they are men who have \n     been for generations despoiled their rights.''\n       Curiously, fundamentalists don't investigate the pertinent \n     history, but one of the explicit goals of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was to provide secure constitutional grounding for \n     the Freedmen's Bureau Acts. It is peculiar at best to think \n     that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the very types of \n     legislation it was designed to legitimate. Voting to strike \n     down affirmative-action programs, fundamentalists haven't \n     offered a hint of a reason to think that such programs are \n     inconsistent with the original understanding.\n       And this is just the beginning. Fundamentalists would very \n     much like to strengthen the constitutional protection of \n     property, especially by striking down ``regulatory \n     takings''--reductions in the value of property that occur as \n     a result of regulation, including environmental protection. \n     But the historical evidence, which fundamentalists ignore, \n     shows that as originally understood, the Constitution did not \n     protect against regulatory takings. The most careful survey, \n     by legal historian John Hart, concludes that ``the Takings \n     Clause was originally intended and understood to refer \n     only to the appropriation of property''-and that it did \n     not apply to regulation.\n       Hart demonstrates that regulation was extensive in the \n     founding period and that it was not thought to raise a \n     constitutional question. Buildings were regulated on purely \n     aesthetic grounds, and no one argued that compensation was \n     required. States asked farmers who owned wetlands to drain \n     their lands and to contribute to the costs of drainage--all \n     without any complaints about ``taking.'' Some landowners were \n     forbidden to sell their interests in land, and compensation \n     was not required. In numerous cases, the public interest took \n     precedence over property rights. Of course, government was \n     not permitted literally to ``take'' land. But regulation was \n     pervasive, and it was not considered troublesome from the \n     constitutional point of view.\n       Fundamentalists usually don't even try to muster historical \n     support for their view that the Constitution protects \n     commercial advertising and bans campaign-finance legislation. \n     Fundamentalists, including Justices Scalia and Thomas, vote \n     to ban Congress from authorizing taxpayers to bring suit in \n     federal court to enforce environmental laws. But they don't \n     even investigate the historical evidence, which strongly \n     suggests that they're wrong. In England and in early America, \n     it was perfectly conventional for government to-give \n     taxpayers the right to sue to enforce the law. No one \n     suggested that such suits were unconstitutional.\n       In the same vein, many fundamentalists, including Justice \n     Thomas, believe that the Constitution grants broad ``war \n     power,'' or authority ``to protect the national security,'' \n     to the president. But the text and history of the \n     Constitution strongly suggest a careful effort to divide \n     power between Congress and the president. If we favor \n     ``strict construction,'' we will not believe that the \n     president has a general ``war power.'' Perhaps most notably, \n     Congress, not the president, has the power to ``declare \n     War.'' The Constitution also grants Congress, not the \n     president, the power to ``raise and support Armies.'' It \n     authorizes Congress to ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' The \n     founding document permits Congress to ``make Rules for the \n     Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'' It \n     is Congress that is authorized to raise funds to ``provide \n     for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United \n     States.'' Congress, not the president, is empowered to \n     ``regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.'' Congress is also \n     authorized to ``define and punish Piracies and Felonies \n     committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of \n     Nations,'' as well as to ``make Rules concerning Captures on \n     Land and Water.''\n       In this light the Constitution does not repose in the \n     president anything like a general authority ``to protect the \n     national security.'' Fundamentalists neglect the most natural \n     reading of the document, which is that protection of national \n     security is divided between Congress and the president-and \n     that if either has the dominant role, it is the national \n     lawmaker. To be sure, the Commander in Chief Clause does give \n     the president direction of the armed forces, an expansive \n     authority; but even that authority is subject to legislative \n     constraints, because Congress controls the budget and because \n     Congress can choose not to declare war. And if Congress \n     refuses either to authorize the use of force or to declare \n     war, the president is usually not entitled to commence \n     hostilities on his own. In arguing that the Constitution \n     gives the president ``the war power,'' fundamentalists ignore \n     the document itself.\n       Much of the time, the emphasis on ``original \n     understanding'' turns out to be a sham--a rhetorical smoke \n     screen for an aggressive political agenda that would never \n     survive the scrutiny of the political process. Writing in the \n     midst of World War II, Learned Hand, the great court of \n     appeals judge, wrote that the ``spirit of liberty is the \n     spirit which is not too sure that it is right.'' Claiming \n     their own neutrality, fundamentalists are all too willing to \n     engage in partisan politics under the guise of constitutional \n     law; in so doing, they defy liberty's spirit.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to announce that I will \nvote to confirm Judge Roberts to serve as Chief Justice of the United \nStates. As I see it, we must ensure that a nominee will serve the \ninterests of the people and interpret the Constitution without any \npreconceived notions or agendas. On the highest Court in our Nation, \nthe nominee will decide cases with the potential to move our country \nforward and to strengthen our democracy. This Court, under the \nleadership of Judge Roberts, if he is confirmed as the next chief \njustice, likely will hear cases addressing important issues, such as \nthe right to privacy and the role of religion in public life; decisions \nthat will impact all of our lives, as well as the direction of our \ncountry, for years to come. We must therefore be deliberative in our \ndecision and, to the extent possible, make sure the President's nominee \nwill not allow any personal bias or political beliefs to color the \nadministration of justice or the interpretation of the Constitution.\n  On August 10, I met with Judge Roberts in my office. I came back to \nWashington during the August recess, where I was conducting town hall \nmeetings in Florida, so that I could look Judge Roberts in the eye and \nget his response to questions that were important to Floridians, and \nwould allow me to assess his fitness to serve. Following that meeting, \nand in the weeks leading up to today, I have listened to the testimony \nduring his confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee. I have \nreviewed the decisions he wrote as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and I have looked at his writings from the time when he was an \nattorney in the Reagan administration. I also considered the views of \nmy constituents who have called my office and written letters.\n  In our meeting last August, I could clearly see that he is a man who \npossesses a certain amount of humility. I found this very attractive. \nDespite his impressive academic and professional record and legal \ncredentials, he did not appear arrogant, nor did he appear to be \ninflexible. I specifically talked to him about one of the things that \nis missing today in America. As we get so divided, we get increasingly \nhighly partisan and ideologically rigid. It makes it difficult to \ngovern a nation as large and as broad and as diverse and as complicated \nas this Nation is unless we can be tolerant toward one another, unless \nwe can reach out and bring people together. As the Good Book says: \nCome, let us reason together.\n  Judge Roberts expressed to me reverence for both the Court and the \nrule of law. He said he was honored to be a nominee to serve on the \nsame Court on which he used to work as a clerk. And, I told him what a \ngreat honor it was for me as a Senator to participate in this \nconstitutional process. His responses to several of the questions I \nposed to him during our meeting form the basis for my decision to \nsupport his nomination. I wish to share some of those responses now.\n  I asked Judge Roberts whether he believed he could put aside his \npersonal beliefs and be fair. He assured me that any personal beliefs \nhe has, be they based on religion or other issues, personal beliefs \nthat all of us carry, would not factor into any of his decisions. He \nsaid that they had not while he served on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and they would not if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  The oath of a judge, he noted, is to faithfully follow the rule of \nlaw and set aside personal beliefs. To ensure the fair and objective \napplication of the law so that each litigant appearing before the court \nreceives a fair chance with the same rules applied to each regardless \nof personal views, with justice meted out to both poor and rich, black \nand white, equally and based on the law.\n  Decisions of the Court must be reached with sound explanations, and \nthe facts and the law alone determining the outcome.\n  I take Judge Roberts at his word.\n  I also asked Judge Roberts about two issues important to the citizens \nof\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\nFlorida: the right to privacy and the Court's respect for congressional \nauthority, the separation of powers doctrine. When I asked Judge \nRoberts whether he recognized a right to privacy, either express or \nimplied in the U.S. Constitution, he informed me that he does. He noted \nseveral amendments to the U.S. Constitution in which he believed this \nright was recognized. This response to me on August 10 was consistent \nwith his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. It was during his \ntestimony before that committee that he stated that he believed a right \nto privacy exists in the 14th amendment, the 4th amendment, the 3rd \namendment, and the 1st amendment. This recognition was vital in \nreassuring me that he would not interpret the Constitution to limit \nindividual freedoms and allow the Government broad powers to intrude \ninto the lives of its citizens--something that makes our society unique \ncompared to other societies in the world. The rule of law protects our \ncitizens from the intrusion of the Government.\n  Then we had a discussion of Kelo v. New London, CT. It is the Court's \nrecent ruling regarding eminent domain. Judge Roberts refused to relay \nhis own personal opinion as to whether he believed the opinion reached \nby the Court was correct, the split 5-to-4 decision, of which Justice \nO'Connor was one of the vigorous dissenting Justices.\n  In our discussion of the opinion he used the words ``a person's home \nis their castle.'' He noted that the majority decision in Kelo provided \nthat it was not for the Court to draw the line between what is \npermissible public use in the taking of private property, and that it \nwas up to the legislative branch of Government to establish limits and \nto set constraints.\n  I appreciated that answer.\n  Now it is important for me to also address the concerns raised by \nsome Floridians who urged me to vote against Judge Roberts' \nconfirmation. They are worried that we are taking a big gamble with \nJudge Roberts, as we know very little about what he believes, and I \nshare some of those same concerns, particularly with the administration \nnot willing to come forth with some of the documentation that was asked \nfor.\n  And, if not for his strong legal credentials and his repeated public \nand private statements and assurances that he would act independently \non the bench, not allowing any personal beliefs to color his decisions, \nthen I am not certain that I would have reached the decision to support \nhis confirmation.\n  It is impossible to predict how Judge Roberts, if confirmed, will \nvote on any particular case that comes before the Supreme Court. All we \ncan do, as Senators, is look at the nominee's judicial philosophy to \ndetermine whether the nominee will be faithful to the rule of law and \nto the U.S. Constitution and set aside personal or political beliefs \nand ideologies to ensure that the law and the facts govern judicial \ndecisions; that all citizens of this country can go before the courts \nof this land and be treated equally and fairly under the law. Judge \nRoberts has pledged to be that type of Chief Justice, and that is why I \nhave concluded that I will vote for the confirmation of his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this will be the 10th Supreme Court \nnomination on which I will have voted. With every nomination, I have \nused the same basic test. If the nominee satisfies fundamental \nrequirements of qualification and temperament, there are two traits \nthat I believe should still disqualify a nominee: If a nominee \npossesses a rigid ideology that distorts his or her judgment and brings \ninto question his or her fairness and openmindedness; or if any of the \nnominee's policy values are inconsistent with fundamental principles of \nAmerican law.\n  Judge Roberts possesses extraordinary credentials suitable for this \nrevered position. That he is highly qualified is not in doubt, and to \nsay that he is highly capable is an understatement. Judge Roberts has \nan unusually fine legal mind. His ability to cite and to synthesize \ncase law has impressed us all. He has great respect for the law and \nextensive experience arguing cases before the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts is articulate and unflappable, with both a judicial \ntemperament and a personal demeanor worthy of our highest Court. It is \neasy to understand why he is so liked and respected by those who know \nhim.\n  While nearly everyone agrees he is qualified, concerns have been \nraised about Judge Roberts' earlier writings, and I share some of those \nconcerns. More important, though, are the views he holds today. Is he \nan ideologue or is he capable of revising his views as he receives new \nevidence or hears new arguments?\n  During the confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts was pressed on many \nsignificant issues raised by his prior writings. He did not answer as \nan ideologue would. For the most part, he gave reassuring responses \nshowing welcomed shifts--some subtle and some not so subtle--away from \nideology and toward moderation. Here are a few examples.\n  As a young White House lawyer, Judge Roberts wrote several times on \nthe question of Executive power, and he was supportive of broadly \nexpanding the power of the President. Yet, relative to the power of the \nExecutive to act in violation of an act of Congress, he said in his \nconfirmation hearing:\n\n       If it's an area in which Congress has legitimate authority \n     to act, that would restrict the executive authority.\n\n  In 1981, while working in the Attorney General's Office, Judge \nRoberts wrote:\n\n       Affirmative action program(s) required the recruiting of \n     inadequately prepared candidates.\n\n  During his confirmation hearings, however, Judge Roberts told the \nJudiciary Committee something that sounded quite different with respect \nto affirmative action. He stated:\n\n       The court permits consideration of race or ethnic \n     background, so long as it's not sort of a make-or-break test.\n\n  He also stated:\n\n       If a measured effort that can withstand scrutiny is \n     affirmative action of that sort, I think it's a very positive \n     approach.\n\n  In 1991, during his work as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General, \nMr. Roberts was a signatory to a Government brief that stated in part:\n\n       We continue to believe that Roe v. Wade was wrongfully \n     decided and should be overruled.\n\n  However, Judge Roberts was asked during the recent hearings:\n\n       Do you think there's a liberty right of privacy that \n     extends to women in the Constitution?\n\n  He replied:\n\n       Certainly.\n\n  Judge Roberts also stated regarding Roe v. Wade that ``it's settled \nas a precedent of the court, entitled to respect under the principles \nof stare decisis.''\n  There have also been questions about positions he took while in \nprivate practice. As a private lawyer, Judge Roberts argued a number of \ntimes against the power of Congress to legislate in several areas--\nattempting to limit the scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nthe Clean Water Act, and against the ability of Congress to withhold \nFederal funds from States with a drinking age lower than 21.\n  While I disagree with the positions he took, he was advocating the \nposition of his clients, not necessarily his own positions. And during \nhis confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts said with respect to \ncongressional power under the commerce clause:\n\n       It would seem to me that Congress can make a determination \n     that this is an activity, if allowed to be pursued, that is \n     going to have effects on interstate commerce.\n\n  There were times in the past when it appears he went beyond the \nposition of his client to advocate for his own more restrictive views. \nFor example--although I do not believe it was the position of the \nReagan administration regarding Federal habeas corpus--Judge Roberts \nsuggested that the Supreme Court could lessen its workload if habeas \ncorpus petitions were taken off its docket.\n  On this issue, too, though, his thinking appears to have evolved. \nJudge Roberts said to the Judiciary Committee and reiterated to me his \nbelief that habeas corpus is an important and legitimate tool in the \nsearch for due process and justice. Judge Roberts said that in those \nearly memos he was opposing the repetitious habeas corpus petitions \nthat appeared to be gaming the system, not the core right of access to \nFederal courts for a habeas corpus petition.\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\n  An observer of the legal scene for whom I have great respect, Cass \nSunstein, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said the \nfollowing recently about the Federal judiciary and this nomination:\n\n       At this point in our history, the most serious danger lies \n     in the rise of conservative judicial activism, by which the \n     interpretation of the Constitution by some Federal judges has \n     come to overlap with the ideology of right wing politicians. \n     For those who are concerned about that kind of activism on \n     the Supreme Court, opposition to the apparently cautious \n     Judge Roberts seems especially odd at this stage.\n\n  Professor Sunstein also wrote:\n\n       In [Judge Roberts'] two years on the Federal bench, he has \n     shown none of the bravado and ambition that characterize the \n     fundamentalists. His opinions are meticulous and circumspect. \n     He avoids sweeping pronouncements and bold strokes, and \n     instead pays close attention to the legal material at hand.\n\n  That is not what I consider to be the description of an ideologue.\n  One troubling aspect of the confirmation hearings was Judge Roberts' \nexcessive reluctance at times to share his own views. While caution is \nunderstandable from a nominee, I wish Judge Roberts had been more \nwilling to answer appropriate questions from Senators on a number of \nissues.\n  The administration has also made this process more difficult than it \nshould be. Reasonable requests for relevant requests were denied. \nAlthough we have memos from his early service as a young lawyer in the \nReagan administration, we still do not have his writings from the \nperiod when he was Deputy Solicitor General during the first Bush \nadministration. The papers that were sought and denied were perhaps \nmore significant than the ones that we received. The administration's \nrefusal to provide those documents inevitably raises questions about \nwhat they might contain.\n  Frankly, I believe the administration has too often treated the \nconfirmation process as something to escape from rather than an \nopportunity to assure the American people that a nominee shares their \nbasic values. The nominations of John Bolton and Alice Fisher are \nrecent examples of where relevant documents and information were denied \nthe Senate. This is not helpful to the confirmation process nor to the \nSenate's ability to make an informed decision.\n  In an attempt to glean more information about the views of Judge \nRoberts, I asked him to meet with me, and he agreed to do so, although \nmy request came late. Judge Roberts' responses gave me further \nconfidence that he has an open mind and is not driven by ideology.\n  At our meeting, I reviewed his approach to the interpretation of the \nConstitution. I asked him whether he agreed with the Chief Justice in \nthe Dred Scott case who wrote that the Constitution ``must be construed \nnow as it was understood at the time of its adoption, [and] it speaks \nnot only in the same words, but with the same meaning and intent with \nwhich it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers.''\n\n  Judge Roberts assured me that he meant what he said to the Judiciary \nCommittee relative to interpreting the Constitution. In response to a \nquestion at his hearing about constitutional intent, Judge Roberts had \nanswered:\n\n       Just to take the example that you gave of the equal \n     protection clause, the framers chose broad terms, a broad \n     applicability, and they state a broad principle. And the fact \n     that it may have been inconsistent with their practice may \n     have meant that . . . their practices would have to change--\n     as they did--with respect to segregation in the Senate \n     galleries, with respect to segregation in other areas. But \n     when they adopted broad terms and broad principles, we should \n     hold them to their word and [apply] them consistent with \n     those terms and those principles.\n\n  Judge Roberts continued, and this was to the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       And that means, when they've adopted principles like \n     liberty, that doesn't get a crabbed or narrow construction. \n     It is a broad principle that should be applied consistent \n     with their intent, which was to adopt a broad principle.\n\n  And then he said the following:\n\n       I depart from some views of original intent in the sense \n     that those folks, some people view it as meaning just the \n     conditions at that time, just the particular problem. I think \n     you need to look at the words they use, and if the words \n     adopt a broader principle, it applies more broadly.\n\n  I also asked Judge Roberts about his 1982 memo which argued that \n``Congress has the constitutional authority to divest the Supreme Court \nof appellate jurisdiction in school prayer cases.''\n  He assured me he was assigned to argue that position internally for \ndiscussion purposes in the Attorney General's office as a young lawyer \nand that, as he said at the Judiciary Committee hearing:\n\n       If I were to look at the question today, to be honest with \n     you, I don't know where I would come out.\n\n  At our meeting, I told Judge Roberts his answer to the question I had \nsubmitted for the Judiciary Committee's record as part of his \nconfirmation hearing was counterintuitive and difficult to accept. This \nwas my question to him, whether between January 2005 and the \nPresident's announcement of his nomination:\n\n       Did you discuss with [Vice President Cheney, Andrew Card, \n     Karl Rove, Alberto Gonzales, Scooter Libby, and Harriet \n     Miers] or others your views on the following: a, whether or \n     not abortion related rights are covered by the right of \n     privacy in the Constitution; b, powers of the President; c, \n     constitutionality of allowing prayer in public places; d, the \n     scope of the right of habeas corpus for prisoners; e, the \n     extent of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause \n     of the Constitution; f, affirmative action; and g, the \n     constitutionality of court stripping legislation aimed at \n     denying Federal courts the power to rule on the \n     constitutionality of specific activities or subject matter.\n\n  Judge Roberts' answer to the Judiciary Committee was:\n\n       I do not recall discussing my views on any of these issues \n     with anyone during the relevant period of time in connection \n     with my nomination.\n\n  When I met with Judge Roberts, I asked him:\n\n       Wouldn't you surely remember if discussions on these \n     subjects had taken place?\n\n  He looked me square in the eye and said they did not take place, nor \ndid such discussions occur when the White House was considering him for \nhis present job on the Court of Appeals.\n  I must take Judge Roberts at his word. The Senate is being asked to \nconfirm John Roberts to the highest position on the highest Court of \nthe land. I believe he is qualified to assume that awesome \nresponsibility. To vote against Judge Roberts, I would need to believe \neither that he was an ideolog whose ideology distorts his judgment and \nbrings into question his fairness and openmindedness or that his policy \nvalues are inconsistent with fundamental principles of American law. I \ndo not believe either to be the case.\n  Judge Roberts has modified some of his views over time, which I take \nas evidence that he is not an ideolog and has not only a keen mind but \na mind open to argument and consideration of our Nation's experience. I \nwill vote to confirm John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since \nwe are in executive session, to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Energy Independence\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am going to continue to speak \nout on the vulnerable position our country finds itself in with regard \nto our dependence on foreign oil. Somewhere between 58 percent and 60 \npercent of our daily consumption of oil comes from foreign shores. If \nthat in and of itself is not enough to alarm us--and I think the \ncollective Nation has put its head in the sand to ignore the \nramifications of that fact--certainly the two hurricanes, Katrina and \nRita, hitting the gulf coast at a very vulnerable position of our oil \nsupply as well as our oil refining capacity has reminded us.\n  So now with several of the refineries shut down first from Katrina in \nthe New Orleans region and the gulf coast region of Mississippi, but \nnow with some additional refineries that will be shut down in the Lake \nCharles, LA, region as a result of Hurricane Rita, it\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\nall the more underscores how vulnerable we are on this thin thread of \noil supply and oil distribution.\n  I think we need an Apollo project or a Manhattan project for energy \nindependence. I do not think we ought to make decisions for the \ngoverning of our country and the comfort and protection of our people \nbased on a system of supply and distribution of energy that makes us so \nsubject to the whims of things that can happen beyond our control. I \nthink we are likely to see this play out in the concern that we are not \ngoing to have enough home heating fuel for this winter because of the \ndisruption that has already occurred. We clearly know what the \ndisruption has done already to the prices, but I want to remind the \nSenate that the prices were very high before Hurricane Katrina \nhappened.\n  In the townhall meetings I was conducting throughout the month of \nAugust in Florida, continuously people were telling me: Senator Bill, \nwe cannot afford to drive to work or, Senator, we cannot afford to \ndrive to the doctor.\n  That is when the price was at $2.70. After Katrina, of course, it \nwent to $3. Who knows what the effect is going to be now as a result of \nRita. We are living on a thin little margin of error in our supply, in \nour distribution of oil products.\n  Is this not enough to wake us up to the fact that this Nation \ncollectively ought to come together and say we are going to reduce and \nultimately eliminate our dependence on foreign oil? We can do that in \nso many different ways.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about the coal gasification process for which we \nhave put incentives in the energy bill that was signed into law, a \nprocess that cooks coal, emitting the gas that is a clean-burning gas. \nBut that is just one process. Remember, we have 300 years of reserves \nof coal in this country. We do not have to worry about going elsewhere \nin the world to get oil if we are able, through technology development, \nto convert that coal so that it is a clean-burning fuel. That is what I \nspoke about yesterday.\n  Today, I tell my colleagues about a process that was actually \ndeveloped back in the first part of the last century by the Germans, \nthat is the making of synthetic fuel from coal that is clean burning. \nThe South Africans did it, and a lot of the transportation vehicles in \nSouth Africa run on this synthetic fuel--I think it is a kind of \ndiesel--that powers almost all of their vehicles and some of their \nairplanes. Well, we certainly have the resource. We have the coal. Do \nwe have the will? The technology is certainly here. It has been here \nsince the early part of the last century and one country has already \nemployed it and employed it very successfully.\n  Tomorrow I am going to come to the Senate floor again and I am going \nto talk about another technology that will help us move toward energy \nindependence and to stop this dependence that has put us in such a \nvulnerable position with regard to the defense interests of our country \nand certainly our economic interests. Look what has happened to Delta \nAirlines already. They were in trouble economically long before the \nprice of fuel started shooting up, but that is just one \nconsequence. Look at the ripple effects of the thousands of people who \nare going to be laid off. Look at the ripple effects of what this \nCongress is going to have to do as we consider the protection of those \nemployees' pensions.\n\n  So here it goes. It all comes back to one thing, and that is our \ndependence on an economy that runs on oil when we have known for years \nthat we were going to reach the crisis point. It happened with Katrina, \nbut it happened back in the early 1970s when there was an oil embargo \nout of the Middle East. It happened again in the late 1970s when there \nwas another embargo. When is America going to wake up?\n  Each of us has our own ideas, but whenever we try one little thing, \nwe cannot get a consensus in the Senate. For the last 4 years, we have \nbrought an amendment to the floor, a simple little amendment on doing \nnothing more than raising miles-per-gallon on SUVs, phased in over a \n10-year period so it would not hurt anybody, and we cannot get the \nvotes on this floor to pass that.\n  Are we beginning to wake up because of what we are facing with \nKatrina? I hope so. This Senator is going to continue to speak out. My \nState, Florida, is in a vulnerable position because we are a peninsula \nthat sticks down into these wonderful seas that surround us. But that \nenergy has to be brought in. We are a State that does not have a \nnatural resource such as oil or coal. We are a State that has to import \nthat, and we have to bring it usually from long distances.\n  I will continue my dialog with the Senate of the United States \ntomorrow, bringing forth another technology that we can develop if we \nbut have the will to change our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 5:45 \nto 6:45 p.m. will be under the control of the majority.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join many of \nmy colleagues speaking in strong support of the nomination of Judge \nJohn Roberts to the position of Chief Justice to the United States. It \nis unquestionable that Judge Roberts is eminently qualified to take on \nthe position of Chief Justice. He has an impeccable resume. You can \nlook at that and say: There is a person who has given his life to the \nlaw. An encyclopedic recitation of the law and a solid record as both a \nlawyer and a judge void of an ideological agenda indicate that he will \nbe a thoughtful and impartial Justice.\n  I had an opportunity to speak with Judge Roberts. There are some \nindividuals whose knowledge of the law is so overwhelming and so \nimpressive that, quite honestly, they are leaps and bounds above the \nrest of us and it is difficult to follow the conversation. The \nconversation I had with John Roberts was one where you are carrying on \na conversation, he is able to bring in and impart his legal knowledge \nand continue a conversation that both flows and is comfortable. That is \na unique talent.\n  Of interest to me and my State of Alaska is that John Roberts has \nlitigated on behalf of Alaskan clients. When the Mayor of Juneau, who \nwas Bruce Botelho, testified on behalf of Judge Roberts before the \nJudiciary Committee, he did so as a former attorney general for the \nState of Alaska and as a Democrat. He had this to say in his testimony \nabout Judge John Roberts. He said:\n\n       Working with Judge Roberts, I was fortunate to get to know \n     the most remarkable and inspiring lawyer I have ever met. He \n     will lead the Court in a way that will instill public \n     confidence in the fairness, justice and wisdom of the \n     judiciary.\n\n  When he was attorney general, Mayor Botelho retained John Roberts to \nrepresent Alaska in cases, to defend Alaska's sex offender registry, \nAlaska's right to submerged lands, and most notably a case involving \nIndian country, an Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n  While he was retained by the State of Alaska, John Roberts, I think \nvery eagerly, traveled up to the State to learn firsthand those things \nthat he was going to be speaking to. He toured the waters of Glacier \nBay in a Fish and Game boat, went out on a little riverboat, a skiff by \nmost people's standards, in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta for a couple of \ndays just traveling around. He traveled around and not only talked with \nthe other lawyers who might be with the group, but he spoke with the \npeople. He talked to the crews on the fishing boats. He engaged the \npeople where they were. He talked with them about their local concerns. \nHe practiced the pronunciation of the native village names. He was \nengaged. He was a real person to those Alaskans he met.\n  So often when we have kind of your east coast lawyers coming back to \nvisit us up North, they are viewed with a little bit of suspicion. But \nI think it is fair to say that John Roberts made a very serious and a \nvery genuine effort to know and appreciate firsthand the facts that \nwere going to be presented to him, the facts he was going to be \narguing. He was not just going to read some brief in the comfort of his \nstudy, he was going to come and learn for himself.\n\n  As Alaskans, we are fortunate to have a nominee who understands \nAlaska's unique landscape, our people, and its laws. We have some \nFederal laws and acts that are unique to where we\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nare and our people and our land up there, so much so that it is very \ndifficult to become well versed in the law. Sometimes I think it is \nfair to say we think those on the outside, those in the lower 48, just \ndon't get what happens up North and how it applies with us. But I think \nwe have learned with Judge John Roberts that he will take the time to \nknow and understand not only Alaska's people but the facts and \ncircumstances all over.\n  As Americans, we have yet to imagine some of the legal questions John \nRoberts will consider in his tenure. But with his breadth of experience \nand his desire to wholly understand the legal matters before him, I \nbelieve Judge John Roberts will serve the court with integrity, \nthoughtfulness, and dedication to the law.\n  John Roberts has made it clear as a judge that it is not his place to \nuse the law to further politics or to seek to question settled law. The \nrole of justice is one of great restraint, of strict application of the \nlaw and not judicial activism. I believe John Roberts when he \nunequivocally pledged to uphold impartiality in the law.\n  Judge Roberts has explicitly assured us that his respect for the law \nand legal principle vastly outweigh his personal values, his views, or \nloyalty to anyone or anything other than the rule of law. This is the \nbasis, the fundamental standard from which we should consider Judge \nRoberts' nomination. In my mind, there is simply no clear cause for \nopposing his nomination.\n  If in his testimony Judge Roberts did not communicate his views on \nlegal matters which may come before the Court during his tenure, he was \nentirely forthcoming on his judicial philosophy. Judge Roberts stated \nrepeatedly that he would bring no agenda to his work as Chief Justice. \nHe stated he would judge each issue on its merits and approach each \ncase with an open mind, that legal precedent and not his personal views \nwould be his guide.\n  Perhaps more so than any other recent nominee, Judge Roberts has \ndemonstrated a sound understanding and appreciation of the role of a \nJustice and the necessary constraints within which the third branch of \ngovernment should operate. So today, I call on my Senate colleagues to \ntake a step back from our politically charged setting to consider \nfairly a man who is incredibly qualified to become our Chief Justice.\n  I will quote from Roberts' testimony as I end here. He said:\n\n       The rule of law--that's the only client I have as a judge. \n     The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge. The \n     notion I would compromise my commitment to that principle . . \n     . because of views toward a particular administration is one \n     that I reject entirely. That would be inconsistent with the \n     judicial oath.\n\n  John Roberts has what it takes to be the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, which is complete love for the law, an erudite legal mind, and \njudicial modesty. I lend my support to the nominee and look forward to \nthis body confirming him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Roberts to be \nthe next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. That probably comes \nas no great surprise to anyone who has followed my career, but I think \nmy reasoning hopefully will illuminate a little bit as to the \ndifference between my passions as a Member of the Senate and as a \nlegislator and my duty as a Senator to confirm nominees to the courts \nof this country because I do see them as different.\n  My job as a Senator is to be a passionate advocate for the things I \nbelieve are best for my State, for the constituents I represent, and \nbest for the country and ultimately the world. I come here, as my \ncolleagues have noted on occasions, with a fair degree of energy and \npassion and commitment to those causes.\n  When I approach the issue of nominations, particularly to a position \nof this import, judicial nominations, I come with a different agenda. A \ncourt is not a place for zealous advocates to impose their will upon \nthe American public. It is not a place for people who believe their \nviews as judges are superior to the views of the democratically elected \nofficials in this country--better put, that their views are better than \nthe people's views because we are, in fact, accountable to the people \nwe represent. When I look at the confirmation process for judges, I try \nto step back and use a different criteria--not whether I agree with the \njudge's points of view on a variety of different issues but whether I \nbelieve the judge can carry out the role of a judge.\n  It is interesting in this debate that we have heard here in the \nChamber and we have been hearing across this country now for the better \npart of 3 or 4 years since we have been locked up in the judicial \nconfirmation battle that it has been a battle about ideology. It has \nbeen a battle about interpretations of the Constitution and rights \nderived from that Constitution and whether they will be upheld or \nwhether they will be struck down or whether they will be modified. I \nbelieve that is an unfortunate debate. It is unfortunate that those who \nare applying or have been nominated for judicial positions are put in \nthe positions of now being questioned as if they are running for \npolitical office, under the scrutiny of someone who is running for \npolitical office and make judgments about public policy as opposed to \nwhat the traditional role of the Court has been up until the last 40 or \n50 years, just to decide the case before them in a narrowly tailored \nfashion, to do justice to the parties, in concert with the Constitution \nof this country--applying the law in this narrowly tailored fashion to \ncome up with a just result for the parties in the case.\n\n  In the last 40 or 50 years, that type of justice has been rarer and \nrarer to find in our decisions, particularly on the Supreme Court.\n  As I come here, I again don't come here as a conservative. A lot of \nmy supporters have said I am not sure Judge Roberts is a conservative. \nMy response is, I am not sure either. Further, I am not sure it \nmatters. What I am sure of is Judge Roberts will be a good judge, will \nbe someone who sits and judges the case on the merits of the arguments \nas they apply to the Constitution of this country, and will do so in a \nway that comports with the great tradition in the last 40 or 50 years \nof the American judiciary. I am confident of that.\n  I think if there is anything that those on both sides of the aisle \nwould say it is that Judge Roberts understands the limited role of the \ncourts.\n  When Judge Roberts came into my office shortly after he was \nnominated, he stunned me. I have met with a lot of nominees who wanted \nto be judges from Pennsylvania, from the circuit courts as well as \ndistrict courts. This was my first opportunity to meet a nominee for \nthe Supreme Court. I have been here 11 years, and this is the first \nnomination for the Supreme Court in my 11 years here in the Senate. But \nhaving met many people who wanted to aspire to be judge, he was the \nfirst nominee I met with who used terms such as ``humility'' and \n``modesty'' when describing the role of a judge in his role in the \njudicial process. Words such as ``judicial restraint'' again are not \nhallmarks of this judicial debate we have been engaged in now for the \nlast few years. That may give some pause to conservatives who would \nlike to see an activist conservative reversing lots of decisions \nconservatives are concerned about which the Court has passed down in \nthe last few decades.\n  But to me, it gives me comfort to know this is a judge who will apply \nthe law, who will not seek to replace the role of the legislature, or \nthe President, State legislatures, and the Governors, township \nsupervisors, county councils, but that he will do justice with the \nfacts before him in the case in solving the dispute that has been \npresented to him.\n  As I said, we have had far too little of that kind of justice over \nthe last few years.\n  As a result, I have written and spoken about the concern I have in \nthis country that the judiciary is taking an ever increasing and \ndominant role in our society and in our Government. We are supposed to \nbe a government that has checks and balances. When you talk about \nchecks and balances, most people think about Republicans and Democrats. \nOf course, checks and balances were written long before there were such \nthings as Republicans and Democrats. Checks and balances are the \nremainder of power between the branches of Government, one to check the \nother to make sure this finely\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\ntuned and crafted document, the Constitution, that establishes these \nthree branches would stay in equilibrium.\n  There were concerns at the time about a strong President running \nroughshod over the Congress and the judiciary and a strong Congress \ndoing the same. Very few had concerns about the judiciary, particularly \nHamilton in the Federalist Papers. He showed very little concern about \na judiciary getting out of control. One exception to that was Thomas \nJefferson. It was not at the time of the writing of the Constitution \nbut years later, after a few court decisions had been handed down which \ngave power to the courts, which I am not sure many of the writers of \nthe Constitution envisioned.\n  But having given them power as a result of earlier court decisions, \nJefferson wrote in 1821, ``The germ of destruction of our Nation is in \nthe power of the judiciary, an irresponsible body working like gravity \nby night, and by day gaining a little today and a little tomorrow and \nadvancing its noiseless step like a thief over the field of \njurisdiction until all shall render powerless the checks over one \nbranch over the other, and will become as venal and oppressive as the \ngovernment from which we were separated.''\n  That was Jefferson's concern about our judiciary, this \n``irresponsible'' body, in his terms--irresponsible in the sense that \nit owes no responsibility or duty, has no real ability over the \nexecutive or legislative branches to be checked.\n  Why do I go off on this discussion about the courts? It is because of \nthis penchant of the judiciary to grab more authority, to act as a \nsuperlegislature and lord itself over the rest of society that we need \nmen such as John Roberts on this Court who understand as Chief Justice \nthe danger a judiciary of this kind is to the United States of America \nand to our democracy.\n  While I am not sure John Roberts is a conservative, I am not sure he \nwill overturn cases which I believe should be overturned, I am sure he \nwill do justice. He will execute his duties with restraint, modesty, \nand humility as the Founders who had no concern about the judiciary \nbelieved those in positions on the Court would do. He is someone whom \nour Founders would be proud of to serve in that position. He is someone \nwe desperately need to speak in the Court, to speak to the Court, and \nlead the Court in a direction that usurps less the powers reserved for \nthe people in our Constitution.\n  I strongly support John Roberts. I hope the President in his next \nnomination will nominate someone very much in the vein of John Roberts. \nThis Court and this country need people such as John Roberts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise for the first time as a \nU.S. Senator to exercise my constitutional obligation to provide advice \nand consent to a presidential nominee for Chief Justice to the United \nStates Supreme Court. It is a high privilege that carries with it great \nresponsibility. The responsibility to ensure, in so much as is \npossible, that the nominee is not only of the highest intellect, \nintegrity and character, but that he or she comes to the process with \nno personal ideological agenda. That the nominee recognizes there is no \nroom in the business of judging for the personal policy ideals of \nindividual judges and that the symbolism of the judge's black robe to \nshield both the litigants and the country from the personal \nidiosyncrasy must be carried out in the discharge of the heavy \nresponsibilities of the Court.\n  Today I add my voice to that of my colleagues speaking in support of \nthe nomination of John Roberts to become the 17th Chief Justice of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Before the confirmation hearings began, we knew that John Roberts had \nimpeccable academic qualifications to serve as the chief judicial and \nadministrative officer of the highest court in the land.\n  Before the hearings began we knew that John Roberts had the \nwholehearted support of prior Solicitors General, in both Democrat and \nRepublican administrations.\n  We knew that he had the overwhelming support of a majority of members \nof the District of Columbia bar where he practiced and we knew that he \nreceived the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association.\n  In short, we knew that his qualifications to serve were impeccable \nand unassailable.\n  And what we now know after the confirmation hearings, after extensive \ninteraction with Members of the Senate, 20 hours of testimony and the \ngive and take of responding to over 500 questions, is that Judge \nRoberts is possessed of: a quiet humility; a deep understanding and \nmodest view of his own significance; a healthy appreciation of the role \nof the Court in the governance of our nation; respect for the \nlimitation of precedent; an awareness of the dangers of looking to \nforeign jurisdictions for guidance in shaping the laws of our land; and \na commitment to respecting the proper role of the courts in \ninterpretation of the law.\n  I am persuaded that Judge Roberts will look to established precedent, \nbe respectful of the doctrine of stare decisis and will use the \nconstitution and the law as his guideposts as opposed to any personal \nwhim or political agenda.\n  In my private meeting with Judge Roberts we discussed his view of the \nrole of the Chief Justice. From his thoughtful response, it was clear \nthat he had well considered ideas about providing effective and \nconstructive leadership to his colleagues on the Court. In every \ninstitution or endeavor, great leadership finds a way to unite rather \nthan to divide. I am confident that Judge Roberts will provide that \nleadership.\n  I want to mention that while a nominee's views issues such as the \n``right to privacy'' are unquestionably significant and have occupied a \ngreat deal of the time dedicated to the confirmation process, our \nentire judiciary looks to the Supreme Court for guidance on many other \nissues other than the ``great constitutional questions of our day.''\n  I'm hopeful that as we go forward with our next nominee, we can find \nsome time to also discuss issues that are vital to the day-to-day \nadministration of justice.\n  What are the nominee's views on the cost of litigation in our country \nor the length of time required for litigants to have their claims \nadjudicated? Is there a fair mechanism to address legitimate concerns \nabout nonmeritorious cases?\n  What has the effect of the speedy trial rule been on the ability of \nlitigants in civil case to have a fair and prompt resolution of their \nclaims?\n  What are the nominee's views on the argument that complex cases \ninvolving scientific evidence are beyond the ken of average jurors?\n  Where does the nominee stand on the difficult issue of sentencing \nguidelines and the current tension existing between the Congress and \nthe Courts on the appropriateness of giving federal judges discretion \nin the imposition of sentences?\n  Where does the nominee stand on the problems of electronic discovery \nin civil and criminal cases?\n  What are the nominee's views on the importance of 12 member juries in \ncivil cases? Could juries of 6 serve justice just as well? Why are \nunanimous verdicts required in civil cases could another method lead to \na better quality of justice?\n  These questions may not make for good headlines, but they surround \nissues that are vital to the administration of justice in our great \ncountry.\n  It is my hope we will take the time to discuss them in the coming \nweeks as we go forward with the confirmation process of a nominee to \nreplace Sandra Day O'Connor. These are the questions we should consider \nas we depoliticize the confirmation process and return our attention to \nworking together to advance the cause of justice in our Nation.\n  My colleagues should take note that the American Bar Association gave \nJudge Roberts the rating of ``Well Qualified'' for Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  To earn that rating, the ABA which is viewed as the solo standard, \nsays, ``the nominee must be at the top of the\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\nlegal profession, have outstanding legal ability and exceptional \nbreadth of experience and meet the highest standards of integrity, \nprofessional competence and judicial temperament.\n  The evaluation of ``Well Qualified'' is reserved for only those found \nto merit the Standing Committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.'' \nIn conducting its investigation, the ABA reached out to a wide spectrum \nof people across political, racial and gender lines, including lawyers, \njudges and community leaders--people with personal knowledge of Judge \nRoberts.\n  The ABA interviewed Federal and state court judges, including all \nmembers of the Supreme Court of the United States, members of the \nUnited States Courts of Appeals, members of the United States District \nCourts, United States Magistrate Judges, United States Bankruptcy \nJudges, and numerous state judges. The results were as follows:\n  On integrity: ``He is probably the most honorable guy I know and he \nis a man of his word.'' ``I would be amazed if anyone had any greater \nintegrity on either a personal or professional level.'' ``He's a man of \nextraordinary integrity and character.''\n  On judicial temperament: ``He has the kind of temperament and \ndemeanor you would want in a judge.'' ``He was extremely even-tempered \nand was so good that he could give classes on it.'' ``John Roberts is \nrespectful, polite and understated. He has no bluster and is a fabulous \nlawyer. He has no need to impress anyone.\n  On professional competence: ``He is brilliant and he understands the \nimportance of the independence of the judiciary and the role of the \nrule of law.'' ``His opinions are clear, succinct and very well-\nwritten.'' ``His opinions are in the mainstream of American \njurisprudence.''\n  In my own meeting with Judge Roberts, I was particularly impressed \nwith his discussion of the dangers associated with looking beyond the \nborders for guidance or the support of precedent.\n  His response reflected a deep and comprehensive understanding not \nonly of the importance of judicial precedent in setting boundaries for \nthe Court, but also the role of the people, the legislative process and \nour representational form of government. Judge Roberts noted in our \nmeeting and again in his testimony before the committee that our judges \nare appointed by our elected President and their appointment requires \nthe consent of the duly elected members of the Senate.\n  This provides a measure of accountability consistent with the \nintention of the Founding Fathers.\n  Looking to a foreign source for legal principles deprives the \nAmerican people of that accountability. To use Judge Roberts words, and \nI paraphrase, it's a bit like looking out over a large crowd to \nidentify your friends. If you look hard enough, you can find something \nyou like.\n  To my colleagues who are poised to cast a vote in opposition to the \nnominee, I would ask them to take a close look at Judge Robert's \ntestimony at the commencement of the hearing:\n\n       I have no agenda, but I do have a commitment. If I am \n     confirmed, I will confront every case with an open mind.\n       I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that \n     are presented.\n       I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on \n     the bench, and I will decide every case based on the record, \n     according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the \n     best of my ability, and I will remember it's my job to call \n     balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\n\n  I must ultimately arrive at my decision based on a considered \njudgment as to whether this nominee has the qualifications, temperament \nand experience required of such high appointment. Does he have the \nrequisite personal ethics and moral code to serve as our nation's \nhighest judicial officer?\n  I have measured this nominee against this high bar for confirmation \nand find him qualified in every respect.\n  I accept Judge Roberts' word as his bond, consistent with his history \nas a man of unquestioned integrity and commitment to the highest ideals \ndemanded of our judicial officers. I look forward to casting a historic \nvote in support of this most highly qualified nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I have the distinct privilege of \nbeing on the Judiciary Committee. I also have the distinct privilege of \nserving with three other members on that committee who are nonlawyers \nso I bring to that committee not a legal background but a citizen \nbackground. One of the things I found very refreshing during the \nhearings was the fact that we have a person in the name of John Roberts \nwho recognizes the role of the judiciary as outlined by our Founders. I \nwill go into that in a minute.\n  I will address, first, some issues that are important.\n  We heard today some criticisms of Judge Roberts in sitting and \nhearing the Hamdan case while he was under consideration for this \nposition. For the record, I show that Justice Ginsburg, during her \nconsideration, decided 24 cases. Justice Breyer decided 15 cases during \nthe period of time he was under consideration. I have the attestation \nof ethicists who have made statements in support of the fact that Judge \nRoberts violated no ethical creed and did nothing but his job as an \nappellate justice while hearing this, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 George Washington\n\n\n                                        University Law School,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: A recent story in the Washington Post \n     suggested that it might have been improper for Judge John \n     Roberts to participate on the D.C. Circuit panel that decided \n     the recent case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. The Post story relied \n     heavily on a short article written by three professors, \n     Stephen Gillers, David Luban and Steven Lubet, and published \n     on the internet in slate.com.\n       I write to provide perspective on the issues raised by \n     these articles and to make clear that Judge Roberts' \n     participation on the panel was proper. To briefly suggest my \n     background to draw such a conclusion, I have taught and \n     written in the field of legal and judicial ethics for over \n     thirty years. The law school text that I co-author has long \n     been the most widely used in the country, and it covers \n     judicial ethics in considerable detail.\n       There are several points on which all observers would \n     agree. First, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455 requires Judge Roberts or \n     any other federal judge to disqualify himself ``in any \n     proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be \n     questioned.'' The key term, of course, is ``reasonably.'' \n     Anyone could assert that a given judge was not impartial. \n     Indeed, a litigant might be expected to do so whenever he or \n     she preferred to have someone else hear their case. Thus, the \n     statute does not allow litigants (or reporters or professors) \n     to draw a personal conclusion about the judge's impartiality; \n     the conclusion must be ``reasonable'' to a hypothetical \n     outside observer.\n       Second, saying as some cases do, that judges must avoid \n     even ``the appearance of impropriety'' adds nothing to the \n     analysis. Unless the ``appearance'' is required to be found \n     reasonable by the same hypothetical outside observer, the \n     system would become one of peremptory challenges of judges. \n     That is not the system we have, nor would it be one that \n     guarantees the judicial authority and independence on which \n     justice ultimately depends.\n       Third, there is no dispute that judges may not hear cases \n     in which they would receive a personal financial benefit if \n     they were to decide for one party over another. The first \n     case cited (albeit not by name) by Professors Gillers, Luban \n     & Lubet was Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., \n     486 U.S. 847 (1988). It simply decided that a judge had a \n     personal interest conflict and could not decide a case that \n     would financially benefit a university on whose Board of \n     Trustees the judge sat. In short, the case says nothing \n     relevant to Judge Roberts' conduct.\n       Fourth, a judge may not hear a case argued by a private \n     firm or government office with which the judge is negotiating \n     for employment. The reason again is obvious. That was the \n     fact situation in the remaining two cases cited by Professors \n     Gillers, Luban & Lubet in their slate.com article. The cases \n     break no new ground and provide no new insights relevant to \n     this discussion.\n       Critics of Judge Roberts suggest, however, that his \n     ``interviews'' with the Attorney General and with members of \n     the White House staff were analogous to private job \n     interviews. That is simply not the case. A judge's promotion \n     within the federal system has not been--and should not be--\n     seen as analogous to exploration of job prospects outside of \n     the judiciary.\n       Except for the Chief Justice, every federal judge is at \n     least in principle a potential candidate for promotion to a \n     higher status in the judiciary. One might argue that no \n     district judge should ever be promoted to a\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\n     court of appeals, and no court of appeals judge should be \n     elevated to the Supreme Court, but long ago, we recognized \n     that such an approach would deny the nation's highest courts \n     the talents of some of our most experienced and able judges. \n     One need only imagine the chaos it would cause if we were to \n     say that no federal judge could hear a case involving the \n     federal government because he or she might be tempted to try \n     to please the people thinking about the judge's next role in \n     the federal judiciary. Nothing in Sec. 455 requires us to say \n     that it would be ``reasonable'' to assume such temptation. We \n     properly assume that judges decide cases on their merits and \n     see their reputation for so doing as their basis for \n     promotion, if any.\n       To be fair to the critics, they argue that a judge's \n     situation might be different once actual ``interviews'' begin \n     for the new position. The problem with that, of course, is \n     that interviews are only a step beyond reading the judge's \n     decisions in a file, interviewing observers of the judge's \n     work, and the like. That kind of thing goes on all the time, \n     including in the media. Further, all accounts suggest that \n     several judges were being ``interviewed'' and that for most \n     of the period of the interviews, there was not even a Supreme \n     Court opening to fill. Assuming, as even Professors Gillers, \n     Luban & Lubet do, that no improper pressure or discussion \n     took place in the interviews themselves, it is hard to see \n     that physically meeting with White House staff transforms \n     what is inevitable and proper in the judicial selection \n     process into something more suspect.\n       Again, even Professors Gillers, Luban & Lubet ultimately \n     concede that Judge Roberts should not have had to withdraw \n     from all cases brought by the government as the logic of \n     their criticism would seem to suggest. They argue instead \n     that the Hamdan was special. It was ``important'' to the \n     Administration and therefore required special caution.\n       I respectfully suggest that an ``importance'' standard for \n     disqualification could not provide sufficient guidance for \n     the administration of the federal courts. Every case is \n     important, at least to the parties. Furthermore, while some \n     cases have greater media interest than others, and some are \n     watched more closely by one interest group or another, every \n     case before the D.C. Circuit that involves the federal \n     government is there because high level Justice Department \n     officials have concluded that the appeal is worth filing or \n     resisting.\n       Saying that some cases are important and others are not \n     ultimately reveals more about the speaker's priorities than \n     it does about the intrinsic significance of the case. Indeed, \n     earlier this year, the Supreme Court decided United States v. \n     Booker and United States v. Fanfan involving the Sentencing \n     Guidelines. Few decisions have had more impact on the \n     operation of federal courts in recent years, yet it was \n     widely reported that Professor Gillers opined to Justice \n     Breyer--correctly in my view--that he need not recuse himself \n     even though his own work product as a former member of the \n     Sentencing Commission arguably was indirectly at issue. \n     Importance of the case was not the controlling issue for \n     Professor Gillers then, and it is simply not a standard now \n     that can clearly guide a judge as to which cases require \n     disqualification and which do not.\n       Indeed, the critics of Judge Roberts' remaining a part of \n     the Hamdan panel overlook the fact that judges of the D.C. \n     Circuit are assigned to the cases that they hear on a random \n     basis. That randomness is part of the integrity of the \n     court's process and it guarantees that no panel can be \n     ``stacked'' with judges favorable to one litigant or another. \n     Weakening the standard for a reasonable appearance of \n     impropriety, and making recusal turn on which litigants can \n     place news stories accusing judges with of a lack of ethics \n     would adversely affect the just outcomes of cases more than \n     almost any other thing that might come out of the hearings on \n     Judge Roberts' confirmation.\n       In short, in my opinion, no reasonable observer can \n     ``reasonably question'' the propriety of Judge Roberts' \n     conduct in hearing the Hamdan case. He clearly did not \n     violate 28 U.S.C. Sec. 455. Indeed, he did what we should \n     hope judges will do; he did his job. He participated in the \n     decision of a case randomly'assigned to him. We should honor \n     him, not criticize him, for doing so.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Thomas D. Morgan,\n     George Washington University Law School.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n     Statement by Professor Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., University of \n                        Pennsylvania Law School\n\n       In my opinion, Judge Roberts could have decided to recuse \n     himself in the Hamdan case but was not obliged to. Hence, it \n     was a matter of professional judgment. These situations, \n     where a judge is being considered for some other or \n     additional possibility, are fairly common these days, hence \n     part of the environment. Also, recusing would require some \n     kind of explanation, which could lead to leaks, which could \n     embarrass other government procedures, such as background \n     checks. I believe that it is reasonable to say that he \n     should, have recused himself, but also reasonable for him to \n     have concluded that it was not obligatory.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I thought it would be important for the American people \nto hear what our Constitution says about our judges. I also thought it \nwould be important for the American people to hear the oath sworn by a \njudge.\n  I have been a Senator for less than a year. When I was campaigning--I \nalso will readily admit I am a pro-life conservative from Oklahoma--but \nwhen I was asked during that campaign if I had a litmus test on a \nSupreme Court nominee, every time I said ``no,'' except one: Integrity. \nIt doesn't matter what position a judge holds. It doesn't matter what \ntheir background is. It doesn't matter what their thoughts on any issue \nare. If they lack integrity, none of the rest of it matters. No one can \nclaim that John Roberts lacks integrity.\n  During that campaign, I very well explained to the people of Oklahoma \nthat I didn't want a Justice that sided with me. I didn't want a \nJustice that sided with anybody, except the law and the Constitution.\n  Here is what article III says about judges:\n\n       The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in \n     one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the \n     Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The \n     Judges, both of the supreme and in inferior Courts, shall \n     hold their offices during good Behavior, [we heard some \n     conversation about foreign law; Judge Roberts passes the bar \n     on his refusal to use foreign law] and shall at stated Times, \n     receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be \n     diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n       [Their power] shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, \n     arising under this Constitution, and the Laws of the United \n     States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under \n     their Authority;\n\n  It reads in article 6 that:\n\n       This Constitution and the Laws of the United States which \n     shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or \n     which shall be made, under Authority of the United States, \n     shall be the supreme Law of the Land, and the Judges in every \n     State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution \n     or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\n       The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the \n     Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive \n     and judicial Officers, both of the United States and the \n     several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to \n     support this constitution; but no religious Test shall ever \n     be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust \n     under the United States.\n\n  The oath John Roberts will take and each Justice before him is as \nfollows:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without \n     respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and to the \n     rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge \n     and perform all the duties incumbent upon me under the \n     Constitution and the laws of these United States, so help me \n     God.\n\n  There are going to be several of my colleagues who will vote against \nJohn Roberts. The real reason they will be voting against John Roberts \nis because he would not give a definite answer on two or three of the \nsocial issues today that face us. He is absolutely right not to give a \ndefinite answer because that says he prejudges, that he has made up his \nmind ahead of time. The religious test I spoke about is one of if you \ndon't agree with me and what I believe and if you don't believe there \nare certain rights to privacy or certain rights that are there that are \nnot spelled out in the Constitution that have become rights, you have \nset up a religion. The religious test is going to be that if he won't \ngive an answer on those controversial social issues such as abortion \ntoday, he will never qualify. Under that religious test, no nominee \nPresident Bush will nominate to the Supreme Court will ever get their \nvote, regardless of whether they are pro-Roe v. Wade or against Roe v. \nWade. The fact is, they will not commit.\n  Therefore, if you can't know or you are suspicious that somebody \nmight take one position or the other ahead of time and you have that as \na test, you yourself are violating one of the tests of the \nConstitution.\n  I believe John Roberts is a man of quality. Most importantly, he is a \nman of integrity. I don't want him to rule my way. I want him to rule \nthe right way. The right way is equal justice under the law for all of \nus. If he does that and if the rest of the Supreme Court starts \nfollowing him, we will reestablish the confidence that is sometimes \nlacking in the Court today, and we will also reestablish the balance \nbetween the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches.\n  It is my hope this body will give a vote to John Roberts that he \ndeserves based on his interpretation, knowledge, and honesty with the \ncommittee and, fundamentally, with his integrity that is endorsed by \nthe American Bar Association. Everyone who knows him\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nknows he will do just that, equal justice under the law for every \nAmerican.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise today to share my thoughts on the nomination of \nJudge John Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. \nLike most Americans, I watched the Judiciary Committee hearings with \ngreat interest and curiosity. Judge Roberts could potentially be the \n17th Supreme Court Chief Justice in the history of the United States. \nIt is amazing to consider that only 16 other people have shared that \nhonor. It is a much shorter line than the number of Presidents back to \nGeorge Washington--42.\n  Considering this tie with history, I was thrilled to be watching the \nproceedings. However, I am also aware of my serious responsibility as a \nU.S. Senator at this time. The Senate has the duty to give its advice \nand consent to the President's nomination. Given the comparative youth \nof Judge Roberts, the vote this week could affect the dispensation of \nconstitutional questions for many decades.\n  During over 20 hours of questions, I had ample opportunity to \nconsider the qualities and character of Judge Roberts. I observed Judge \nRoberts' keen intelligence and modesty regarding his accomplishments. I \nalso enjoyed his sense of humor in the midst of intense and repetitive \nquestioning. He convinced me that he is qualified to serve on the \nhighest Federal bench.\n  During the hearings, I was reminded of a common fallacy where people \nthink judges are politicians. Judges are not politicians. It has been \neasy to slip into the thinking that we need to know their political \nallegiance so that we can know what their decisions will be. We also \nbegin thinking that judges should make decisions based on good policy. \nFinally, we believe that judges have to make us promises on the future \ndecisions so they can win our votes. Judges are not politicians. We \nneed to know their qualifications, not their political allegiances. We \nneed to know that their decisions will be made on the rule of law, not \non good policy. We need to know that judges will not make promises to \nprejudge future cases in order to win votes. Judges are not \npoliticians. A judge's only constituent should be the U.S. \nConstitution. If the people were the constituents of judges, our \nconfidence in an impartial hearing and ruling on our case would \ncollapse.\n  A judge should be an intelligent, impartial, open, and unbiased \nexecutor of the law. I believe that Judge Roberts meets these \nqualifications and is fit to serve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. I am pleased that a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary \nCommittee passed him through the committee. I go home to Wyoming most \nweekends. It lets me personally poll my constituents. That is an \nadvantage of being from the least populated State. I can assure you \nthey are impressed with Judge Roberts. That is probably not a surprise. \nHowever, during the week when I am in DC, I visit with the janitors, \nelectricians, picture hangers, and others around the offices. To a \nperson they had comments like ``this man really knows his stuff.'' ``He \nanswers their questions without a single note or staff person \nwhispering in his ear. I bet he could take the bar exam tomorrow and \nstill pass it. This guy is good'' and I think that is the opinion of \nmainstream America. I look forward to voting on his nomination later \nthis week.\n  Even after the vote, the Senate's work to fill the Supreme Court will \nnot be complete. We are waiting for another nomination from President \nBush to replace retiring Justice O'Connor. I am pleased with the recent \nprecedent set by the Judiciary Committee.\n  In a bipartisan and timely manner, they voted out a nominee based on \nhis qualifications. They voted him out based on his stated devotion to \napplying the rule of law. As the Senate prepares to consider the next \nSupreme Court nomination, it is my hope that the same process will be \nfollowed--a timely consideration based upon the qualifications of the \nnominee and not on scoring political points.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10508-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a recent article from Petroleum News which is entitled \n``Saudi Oil Shock Ahead,'' in which Matthew R. Simmons discusses the \nrelative importance today of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and discusses the valuable role this area can \nplay in our national energy policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Petroleum News, Sept. 11, 2005]\n\nSaudi Oil Shock Ahead--Simmons Pokes Holes in Image of Unlimited Middle \n                      East Oil; Prepare for Worst\n\n                           (By Rose Ragsdale)\n\n       As Congress turns to legislation that could open a new era \n     of Alaska Arctic oil production, one highly regarded energy \n     analyst says he's convinced the move is critical to the \n     success of a national energy strategy.\n       Matthew R. Simmons, author of ``Twilight in the Desert: The \n     Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy,'' (John Wiley & \n     Sons Inc., 2005), says crude from the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge's 1.5-million-acre coastal plain could play a \n     valuable role in the nation's energy policy.\n       Simmons, an investment banker who holds an MBA from Harvard \n     University, is chairman and chief executive officer of \n     Houston-based Simmons & Co. International, which specializes \n     in the energy industry. He serves on the boards of Brown-\n     Forman Corp. and The Atlantic Council of The United States. \n     He's also a member of the National Petroleum Council and The \n     Council of Foreign Relations.\n       Simmons recently shared his views with Petroleum News on \n     Alaska's oil and gas industry. He has been busy promoting his \n     book with appearances on several talk shows, including a \n     recent radio interview with Jim Puplava, host of Financial \n     Sense Newshour. ``Twilight in the Desert'' hit the bookstores \n     in the spring and is generating considerable comment in \n     energy, economic and political circles.\n       Simmons' book is the culmination of years of research, \n     including scrutiny of 200 technical papers, published by the \n     Society of Petroleum Engineers, on problems encountered by \n     professionals working in Saudi Arabia's oil fields. The \n     papers, combined with transcripts from little-noticed U.S. \n     Senate hearings in the 1970s and Simmons' discovery that \n     little actual public and verifiable data exists on Saudi oil \n     reserves, form the backbone of observations and conclusions \n     in the book.\n       While most energy economists start with the assumption that \n     Middle East oil reserves are plentiful, Simmons questioned \n     that assumption after he found that no one had ever compiled \n     a verifiable list of the world's largest oil fields and the \n     reserves they hold.\n       His questions first surfaced at a Washington, D.C., \n     workshop, conducted by CIA energy analysts, where top energy \n     experts gathered several years ago.\n       ``We'd spend a day doing a discussion of all the key \n     countries, and how much oil capacity they had in place over \n     the course of the corning three years,'' Simmons recalled. \n     ``And I basically said, 'How do you all even know that? What \n     are the three or four top fields in China?' And no one had \n     any answers.\n       ``So I decided it would be interesting and educational to \n     see if you could actually put together a list of the top 20 \n     oil fields by name,'' he added.\n       That exercise revealed that Saudi Arabia, like most of the \n     other Middle East countries, extracted 90 percent of its oil \n     production from five huge fields, and the biggest of the \n     fields, Ghawar, had been producing oil for more than 50 \n     years.\n       ``What I also found is that the top 14 fields that still \n     produce over 500,000 barrels per day each, were 20 percent of \n     the world's oil supply, and on average they were 53 years \n     old,'' he observed.\n       Historically, oil field discoveries fit a pattern that \n     Simmons likens to the nobility of a European country or the \n     pieces on a chessboard. In each of the world's great oil \n     basins, explorers have found a large field first, most often \n     the ``queen'' field but sometimes the ``king.'' Next \n     explorers typically find another large field, usually the \n     other half of the royal pair. After that, oil basins \n     typically yield several moderate-sized fields, or ``lords.'' \n     Beyond that, only small pools of crude reserves or \n     ``peasants'' typically remain, he said.\n       In ``Twilight in the Desert,'' Simmons not only documents \n     the history of Saudi Arabia and its oil fields, he also \n     questions the Middle East country's claims that it still has\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n     plentiful oil reserves. He notes that Ghawar is the ``king'' \n     field and is flanked by a score of lesser fields, ranging \n     from ``queen'' size in Abqaiq to much smaller pools.\n       Simmons also suggests that Saudi production is very near \n     its peak. But the feedback he has received from technical \n     people who have read the book, leads him now to believe that \n     Saudi Arabia has ``actually exceeded sustainable peak \n     production already.''\n       ``And I think at the current rates they are producing these \n     old fields, each of the fields risks entering into a rapid \n     production collapse,'' he said.\n       Simmons said energy economists are reluctant to even \n     entertain the notion that Saudi oil output is past its peak \n     because they really don't understand the difference between \n     oil supply peaking and running out of oil.\n       ``I continue to remind people that the difference is as \n     profound as someone saying, `I'm getting a little bit \n     hungry,' and someone saying, `I have about two more minutes \n     to live before I starve to death,''' Simmons said. ``. . . We \n     will never run out of oil, in our lifetime, our children's \n     lifetime, our grandchildren's lifetime. But by 2030 we could \n     easily have a world that can only produce 10 or 15 or 20 \n     million barrels per day, and the shortfall from what we \n     thought we were going to produce is only a modest 100 million \n     barrels per day. So this is really a major, major, major \n     global issue.''\n       Compounding the problem is that every energy supply model \n     used by economists today starts with the assumption that \n     Saudi oil is plentiful, Simmons said. ``What's interesting is \n     that we've based all of this assumption on no data,'' he \n     explained.\n       Meanwhile, as the world's thirst for oil grows, Saudi \n     Arabia and other oil-producing countries will be unable to \n     keep pace. Some analysts say Saudi Arabia is capable of \n     producing 20 million to 25 million bpd, but Simmons says that \n     level of production is ``impossible.''\n       ``And I also believe that--Ghawar, for instance, which is \n     really the whole nine yards, because that is 60 percent of \n     their production--that North Ghawar, which is the top 20 \n     percent of the field, has a productivity index that is about \n     25 times the productivity index of the rest of Ghawar, and \n     that's the area that is almost depleted now,'' Simmons \n     observed. ``And when that drops, you could basically see \n     Ghawar go from 5 million down to 2 million bpd in a very \n     short period of time.''\n       Until now, Simmons said the United States has been lucky \n     because Saudi oil production was 3 million bpd when U.S. oil \n     production peaked in 1971. Saudi output soared and today \n     ranges from 9 million bpd to 11 million bpd.\n       Elsewhere, explorers discovered the last three great \n     provinces of brand new oil in the last three years of the \n     1960s--Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1967-68; Siberian oil fields \n     in the same period of time; and oil in the North Sea in 1969.\n       ``And Siberia, Alaska, and North Sea oil, effectively \n     combined to produce: the North Sea peaked in 1999 at a little \n     over 6 million bpd, it's already down 25 percent; Alaska oil \n     peaked in the 1990s at 2 million bpd; it's now at about \n     900,000 bpd; and Siberia oil peaked at about 9 million bpd; \n     and it's about 5 million bpd,'' Simmons said. ``And we \n     haven't basically found another province since the late \n     `60s.''\n       To meet growing demand from existing customers as well as a \n     new surge in demand from emerging countries such as China and \n     India, Simmons said producers have continued to pull more and \n     more oil out of the North Sea. ``And then we found deep water \n     which was a fabulous last shot from the basins (in which) we \n     already had shallow water production. And we took the Middle \n     East oil back up to unsustainably high levels of \n     production,'' he said. ``So probably, we're sweeping the \n     cupboard bare. People looked at the way we were able to do \n     this and thought, `Wow! This is actually easy,' without \n     realizing what we were actually doing was totally non-\n     sustainable.''\n       America needs more oil sources and Alaska is a good place \n     to look, Simmons said. As for ANWR, he said it's ludicrous \n     for people, whether geologists or environmentalists, to make \n     definitive statements about the quantity of oil reserves in \n     the refuge.\n       ``Drilling on the (North) Slope has been tricky. Otherwise, \n     it would not have been so hard to find the 'king,' Prudhoe \n     Bay, or we would never have drilled Mukluk,'' he said. ``So \n     we shall never know whether ANWR is a series of dry holes or \n     where the missing `queen' of the slope lies until an intense \n     drilling is done. A few dry holes does not mean much \n     either.''\n       The environmental community's claim that ANWR contains only \n     a six months supply' of oil is a calculation that assumes the \n     nation has no other source of oil when ANWR oil comes on \n     line, Simmons said.\n       ``On that standard, we end any new energy development, \n     period,'' Simmons said. ``What is very important about the \n     urgent need to find more oil at ANWR, the Naval Reserve or \n     somewhere else on the slope is the inevitable decline of \n     North Slope oil, and the fast decline that will happen if a \n     gas pipeline is built and the gas caps (are) blown down.''\n       Moreover, it would not take 10 years to get a big oil find \n     in ANWR into production since the infrastructure is in place, \n     Simmons observed.\n       ``At some point, the oil that flows through the 2 million \n     bpd pipeline must fall to a level insufficient to get oil \n     over the Brooks Range other than by shutting in for part of a \n     month so the oil can be batched,'' he explained. ``If all \n     ANWR does is extend the life of the pipeline, it has filled a \n     very valuable role.\n       ``If a `lord' is found, let alone a `queen,' it is a home \n     run,'' he added.\n       As for the rest of Alaska, Simmons said he has no idea \n     whether the state contains other large pools of oil. ``The \n     only way oil is ever found (and gas, too) is to \n     drill wells,'' he said.\n       Though the world needs more oil sources, Simmons does not \n     see additional reserves curbing prices in the long term.\n       While others lament the high price of oil, the investment \n     banker says crude oil at current prices of 18-20 cents a pint \n     is ``cheap.''\n       ``Obviously it's cheap. I don't know what's the next \n     cheapest liquid we actually sell in any bulk is, that has any \n     value. I suspect there are places around the United States \n     where municipal water costs more than 18 cents a pint,'' he \n     observed. ``And yet for some reason, we created a society \n     built on a belief that oil prices in a normal range were some \n     place in the $15-20 level. It turns out $15 per barrel, which \n     is the average price of oil--in 2004 dollars--it sold for, \n     for the last 140 years, is less than 4 cents a pint. So we've \n     basically used up the vast majority of the world's high flow \n     rate, high quality sweet oil at prices that were effectively \n     so cheap, you basically couldn't sustain an industry. And now \n     we're left with lots of oil. But it's heavy, gunky, dirty, \n     sour, contaminated-with-various-things oil. It doesn't come \n     out of the ground very fast, is very energy intensive to get \n     out of the ground, and we're going to pay a fortune for it.''\n       Simmons predicted we would encounter problems with oil \n     supplies this year, nearly a month before Hurricane Katrina \n     struck the Gulf Coast.\n       He said we must operate the nation's refineries at 100 \n     percent, or we have major product shocks, and we have to \n     import oil at a rate of 10 million to 11 million bpd, or we \n     lose crude oil stocks. We have to basically create almost 3 \n     million bpd of finished product imports and we have to run \n     the system 24/7, all summer long, and we still liquidate \n     stocks, he said.\n       ``So we have actually now created a pending domestic \n     embargo, and we're going to be lucky to get through the \n     summer without some periodic shortages,'' he told Financial \n     Sense Newshour the week of Aug. 6. ``We probably will, but \n     the odds are probably as high we will have some shortages, \n     and then if we get through the summer we have a fabulous \n     respite from Labor Day to Thanksgiving, until we hunker to \n     try to figure out how the world gets through the Winter of \n     2005 and 2006 because oil demand globally could easily go to \n     86-88 million bpd during the winter, and that could easily \n     exceed supply by 2 million to 5 million bpd.''\n       In a worst case scenario, Simmons said oil prices could \n     easily soar past $100 a barrel without slowing down.\n       Such high prices would simply be a sticker shock, not an \n     end to driving, he said. ``At $3.20 a gallon, gasoline costs \n     20 cents a cup. A cup of gasoline can take a full car of \n     people about 1\\1/2\\ miles. If you think this is expensive, \n     try and hire a rickshaw or a horse-drawn wagon and pay only \n     20 cents to go a mile and half. After haggling price for an \n     hour or so, you pay about $5 to $6 for the ride and thank the \n     person for not making you walk.''\n       To cope with the coming oil shock and much higher oil \n     prices, Simmons told Financial Sense Newshour, the world, led \n     by the United States, will have to become drastically energy \n     efficient virtually overnight. A series of changes, including \n     transporting all goods that currently travel by truck, by \n     rail or water, could cut oil consumption 20-40 percent, he \n     said.\n       ``So by getting trucks off our highway system we have a \n     major impact on removing traffic congestion. And traffic \n     congestion is public enemy number 1 through 5 on passenger \n     car fuel efficiency. So it's a real win, win, win,'' he \n     observed.\n       He also suggested returning to a system of growing most \n     foods close to where they will be consumed and using \n     technology to allow people to work at home or in their \n     village rather than requiring them to commute to a central \n     location.\n       Simmons also advocates jumpstarting the largest energy R \n     program ever envisioned, and ``just pray that over 5-7 years \n     it has the same impact as when people got serious about \n     developing radar, and developing nuclear power, so that we \n     could actually win World War II.''\n       ``But if we don't do these things, then this really ends up \n     being a very dark world--no pun intended,'' he added.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10509-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10509-S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               tribute to john flynn and patrick stewart\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the \nmemory of one of the world's heroes, Mr. Simon Wiesenthal, who died on \nSeptember 20, 2005, at the age of 96.\n  Simon Wiesenthal was a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to \nhonoring its victims by bringing its perpetrators to justice. By \nfighting against intolerance and genocide everywhere, he worked \ntirelessly to see that ``never forget'' would someday mean ``never \nagain.''\n  We in California have a special bond with Simon Wiesenthal because \nthe Simon Wiesenthal Center is based in Los Angeles. Founded in 1977, \nthe Wiesenthal Center preserves the memory of the Holocaust and \ncontinues the work of Simon Wiesenthal by fostering tolerance and \nunderstanding through community involvement, educational outreach, and \nsocial action. Today, the center also includes the world-renowned \nMuseum of Tolerance.\n  Simon Wiesenthal was born on December 31, 1908, in western Ukraine. \nHe received his degree in architectural engineering from the Technical \nUniversity of Prague in 1932. After graduation, he worked as an \narchitect in Lvov, Poland. In 1936, he married his high school \nsweetheart, Cyla Mueller.\n  Three years later, Germany and Russia signed their nonaggression pact \nand partitioned Poland. As a result, the Soviet Army occupied Lvov and \nbegan purging Jewish professionals. Simon was forced to close his \nbusiness and work in a bedspring factory. Many of his family members \nwere imprisoned or killed. Simon tried to save his family from \ndeportation by bribing the Soviet Secret Police. However, he and his \nwife were sent to the Janwska concentration camp and then to a forced \nlabor camp for the Eastern Railroad. By 1942, nearly 90 members of his \nand his wife's family perished.\n  Simon was able to help his wife Cyla escape through the Polish \nunderground on false papers. However, after escaping the forced labor \ncamp in 1943, Simon was captured and sent back to Janwska. When the \nSoviet Army advanced on the German eastern front, he was forced to join \nSS guards on a march westward. The march ended in the Mauthausen \nconcentration camp. Simon narrowly survived when Mauthausen was \nliberated by the Americans on May 5, 1945. At 6 feet tall, he weighed \n100 pounds.\n  In late 1945, Simon and his wife were reunited. Both had believed the \nother to be dead. In 1946, their daughter Paulinka was born.\n  Simon spent the rest of his life tracking down Nazis and working to \nbring them to justice. He said that in various ways he helped bring \n1,100 former Nazis to trial. Of these were Adolf Eichmann, who \nsupervised implementation of the ``Final Solution,'' Karl Silberbauer, \nthe Gestapo officer who arrested Anne Frank, and Hermie Braunsteiner \nRyan, who supervised the killing of hundreds of children at a Polish \ncamp.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal prepared evidence on Nazi atrocities for the war \ncrimes section of the U.S. Army. He headed the relief and welfare \norganization, Jewish Central Committee of the United States Zone of \nAustria. After the Nuremberg Trials, Simon opened the Historical \nDocumentation Center in Linz, Austria, to assemble evidence for future \nNazi trials. The center was eventually relocated to Vienna and \ncontinues to gather and analyze information on German war criminals and \nneo-Nazi groups; thousands of former Nazis are considered still at-\nlarge throughout Germany today.\n  For his courage and commitment to justice, Mr. Wiesenthal has been \nhonored with many awards, including: the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal \npresented to him in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter; the United Nations \nLeague for the Help of Refugees Award; and an honorary British \nknighthood.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal is survived by his daughter Paulinka Kreisberg, who \nlives in Israel, and three grandchildren.\n  With the passing of Simon Wiesenthal, the world has lost one of its \ngreat heroes, but we shall never lose sight of the lesson he taught us: \nthat humanity will rise up against hate and tyranny, and those who \ncommit crimes against humanity will be brought to justice. As Mr. \nWiesenthal said in a 1964 article in the New York Times Magazine:\n\n        [w]hen we come to the other world and meet the millions of \n     Jews who died in the camps and they ask us, ``What have you \n     done?'' there will be many answers. . . . But I will say, I \n     didn't forget you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10510-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10510-S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY C. GRIFFITH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize a \ndedicated public servant at the Congressional Research Service, Jeffrey \nC. Griffith, who is retiring this month after 30 years of service to \nthe U.S. Congress. A recognized expert in information technology, Mr. \nGriffith led CRS into the digital age and was instrumental in \ndeveloping and implementing an integrated Legislative Information \nSystem, LIS, for the Congress.\n  He has been particularly helpful to the Senate Rules Committee and \nserved as an information technology adviser and facilitator to then \nChairman John Warner and Ranking Member Wendell Ford during the \nimplementation of the committee's strategic planning process for \ninformation technology in the Senate. Mr. Griffith's expertise and his \nunderstanding of the Senate institution proved invaluable to the \ncommittee during a critical time when the committee was grappling with \nexpanded Internet use, including the development and expansion of the \nlegislative information system, and changing technology expectations \nand opportunities in the Senate.\n  Mr. Griffith earned both A.B. and MAT degrees at Harvard College and \na masters in library science from UCLA. He came to the Library of \nCongress in 1976 as a participant in the Library of Congress Intern \nProgram and then moved on to the Congressional Research Service in \n1977. In the years since, he has held positions of increasing \nresponsibility and he retires as the chief legislative information \nofficer.\n  Leading change in information technology has been the hallmark of Mr. \nGriffith's career. In the early days of automation, he played a key \nrole in developing SCORPIO, a system for retrieving legislative and \npublic policy information that was one of the first systematic uses of \ndigital information in the Federal Government. Similarly, he led the \neffort to automate CRS's request management system, ISIS, which helps \nCRS assure Members of Congress and their staff that their information\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\nrequests will be responded to quickly and efficiently.\n  When information technology moved to the desktop, Mr. Griffith \nmanaged the introduction of personal computers as individual \nworkstations in CRS. Before the Internet and the World Wide Web, Mr. \nGriffith pioneered the use of optical disk technology for preserving \nand disseminating information to the Congress.\n  Mr. Griffith was a champion of interagency cooperation in the \nCongress. When a high capacity data communications network was \nestablished on Capitol Hill, he led an interagency group that resolved \nissues related to data exchange. This was the first step in the \nInternet-age. In 1997, when the Congress requested a new legislative \ninformation system, the LIS, Mr. Griffith assumed a leadership role as \nthe CRS coordinator and worked closely with the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, the Library of Congress, and the Government Printing \nOffice to develop and implement the new system. Today the LIS home page \nhas over 4 million hits per year and is the primary resource for \nlegislative information for Members of Congress and their staff.\n  Mr. Griffith's skill in leading interagency efforts extended to other \ninitiatives as well. He is a recognized leader in efforts to implement \nXML technology consistently for legislative data and he has championed \nimprovements in security initiatives to protect critical databases and \nensure continuity of operations in the event of disaster.\n  Although Mr. Griffith is retiring from the Congressional Research \nService, he will continue to contribute his professional expertise to \nthe scholarship of legislative information. In 2006, through a \nFulbright fellowship, Mr. Griffith will study the legislative \ninformation systems of the European Union and several European \ncountries. He will be joined by his wife Jane Bortnick Griffith, who is \nthe former assistant chief of the Science Policy Research Division of \nCRS and a Government information specialist in her own right.\n  Jeffrey C. Griffith has served the U.S. Congress with distinction for \n30 years. The leadership and knowledge he provided has greatly \nbenefited the Congress and the American people and his advice and \ncounsel will be missed. His retirement now provides him the time to \npursue study in legislative information systems that will continue to \nbenefit all of us. I congratulate Jeff on a distinguished career and \nwish him and Jane the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10511-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN CELEBRATION OF THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nrecognize the 60th anniversary of the United Nations.\n  In 1945, as World War II was ending, representatives of 50 countries \nmet in San Francisco, CA at the United Nations Conference on \nInternational Organization to draft the Charter of the United Nations. \nOn October 24, 1945, the Charter achieved the required number of \nsignatories for ratification, and the United Nations officially came \ninto existence. Today, 60 years later, I am proud to reflect on the \nUnited Nation's many successes. I would also like to use this occasion \nto highlight the vital importance of building an even stronger United \nNations for the future.\n  The United Nations was established with the primary purpose of \nproviding a forum for the nations of the world to resolve issues \nwithout resorting to war. It has achieved many successes on this front, \nthe greatest of which is that we have not had a world war since the \nUnited Nations was founded. For those regions of the world that have \nendured conflict, the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operation has \nfacilitated more than 67 peacekeeping operations and is credited with \nnegotiating more than 170 peaceful settlements that have ended regional \nconflicts.\n  Through the World Health Organization, the U.N. has combated the \nspread of pandemic diseases and continues to provide lifesaving drugs \nand medical care to millions of people around the world. Another U.N. \nprogram, the World Food Program, has served as a lifeline to millions \nof people who would otherwise face famine. And the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has helped raise the \nfemale literacy rate in many developing countries around the world. I \ncommend the United Nations for these outstanding achievements and the \ncountless others it has made during the last 60 years.\n  But despite these many successes, there is still a long way to go. \nFirst and foremost, the United Nations must be reformed from within. In \nrecent months, there have been far too many troubling incidents \ninvolving the United Nations, ranging from the Iraqi oil-for-food \nscandal, and the tragic sexual abuse cases involving peacekeeping \ntroops in the Congo and elsewhere--and rightfully so; these acts were \nmost egregious. These types of activities cannot continue if the United \nNations is to receive the support and legitimacy it needs to tackle the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  If the United Nations is comprehensively reformed from within, then \nit will find itself in an even better position to meet its larger \ngoals. According to the United Nations' own figures, nearly a quarter \nof the children in the developed world are malnourished, and in a \nnumber of places in the world, the poor are actually getting poorer. I \nam pleased that the United Nations has embraced these challenges \nthrough the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals, which \nrange from eradicating extreme poverty and hunger to combating the \nspread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. But there is much work \nto be done if these goals are to become reality. The international \ncommunity must commit to working together. The only way to achieve real \nprogress on these fronts will require consensus, partnership, and unity \nof effort on the part of all nations of the world. For this reason, a \nstrong United Nations is more important than ever.\n  I congratulate the United Nations on its 60th anniversary and look \nforward to doing my part to ensure its continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10511-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10511-S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INDIANA NATIONAL GUARD IN HURRICANE KATRINA RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the hard work and \nselflessness of the members of the Indiana National Guard for their \nefforts to rebuild the gulf coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. \nHelping others in need is a longstanding Hoosier value, and there is no \nquestion that the people of Mississippi and Louisiana needed help from \nall States following such a terrible natural disaster. Our Indiana \nGuard members, and those from many other States, answered that call for \nhelp, and deserve to be recognized for their work.\n  The Crescent City is a far cry from our Hoosier State, but the men \nand women of the Indiana National Guard have made New Orleans their \nhome away from home as they work to restore the city to its pre-Katrina \ngreatness. Throughout Louisiana and Mississippi, hundreds of our Guard \nmembers are helping in all aspects of the recovery efforts, by clearing \nneighborhoods, helping evacuees and restoring order to the chaos left \nby Katrina.\n  Work like this is part of what makes America great. Over the past \nmonth, we have witnessed countless acts of tremendous heroism and \nheartwarming generosity performed by complete strangers working to help \nothers weather this storm. Americans from across the country came \ntogether to give money, food, clothes, and shelter to people they will \nlikely never meet.\n  Indiana's reaction to this terrible tragedy has made me proud to be a \nHoosier. Our Guard members left behind families and loved ones--many of \nwhom they have been separated from during long tours of duty overseas--\nto come to the aid of other families and help them rebuild their lives. \nIn a true example of Hoosier hospitality, hundreds of Indiana families \nhave opened their homes to evacuees in need of shelter. Many Hoosiers \nhave donated to nonprofits like the Red Cross, and members from local \npolice and fire stations have traveled south to offer their help.\n  Whether defending our freedom overseas or rebuilding in the face of \nnatural disasters at home, the members of the Indiana National Guard \nrepresent the best of Indiana and America. They sacrifice time with \nloved ones and travel thousands of miles to shoulder some of the \nheaviest loads in the cleanup efforts. Most importantly, their work \ngives people hope that life can return\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\nto normal and that the towns devastated by Katrina can be rebuilt. For \nleading the way and reminding us of our ability to recover from such \nstorms, the Indiana National Guard, and all volunteers working in the \ngulf today, deserve our thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10512-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

This theme reflects the Pontiff's faith that only with \ngreater education and dialogue can the world's conflicts be addressed \nproperly.\n  I take this opportunity to not only thank The Pontiff for his time \nand worthy endeavors in California, but also thank the sizable Armenian \ncommunity which has been actively contributing to the California \nculture and economy since 1878. California cities of Los Angeles and \nGlendale are home to the second and third largest populations of \nArmenians outside of Armenia and are important members of their \ncommunities serving as business leaders and city council members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10512-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HARRIS H. SIMMONS\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a son of \nUtah and a good friend, Mr. Harris H. Simmons, who today, by the \nselection of his peers, becomes the next chairman of the American \nBankers Association. I am honored to highlight a few of his \naccomplishments, including his significant contributions to the banking \nworld and to the State of Utah.\n  Mr. Simmons is currently the chairman, president and CEO of Zions \nBancorporation. With its corporate offices in Salt Lake City, UT, Zions \noperates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, \nUtah, and Washington. It is included in the S 500 Index, and is a \nnational leader in Small Business Administration lending.\n  Harris started banking at the age of 16, when as a summer job he \nfiled canceled checks at Zions. He continued his work at Zions in the \ninvestment department as he studied economics at the University of \nUtah. Harris then left Utah for a period as he furthered his studies \nand received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.\n  Upon graduating, Harris took a job in Houston, TX for Allied \nBancshares. After a year and a half, he returned to Zions and became \nthe chief financial officer at the age of only 27. Nine years later he \nwas named president and CEO of the multibillion-dollar asset bank \nholding company which has seen fantastic growth and success as it has \nhelped build communities and business under his leadership.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Harris has been an \ninvaluable member of the Utah community. He has served as president of \nthe Utah Foundation, chairman of the Utah Symphony, and chairman of the \nEconomic Development Corporation of Utah. He currently serves as \npresident of the Shelter-the-Homeless Committee, as well as cochairman \nof the Utah Committee of the Newcomen Society of the United States. \nMost importantly, he is a loving husband and father of four.\n  This is but a small glimpse of Harris Simmons' contributions and \naccomplishments. I commend him to my colleagues as they have the \nopportunity to meet with him as he serves in his new role with the \nAmerican Bankers Association. The American Bankers Association is \nprivileged to have Harris Simmons as its new chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10512-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MARK SALO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to salute Mark Salo, \nwho is retiring this fall after more than 31 years as the head of \nPlanned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties, PPSDRC. A \npioneer and visionary in the field of reproductive health care, he is a \ngreat champion of women's health and freedom of choice.\n  When Mark Salo began working with San Diego Planned Parenthood in \n1974, it comprised one small clinic whose 12 employees provided 5,000 \npatient visits a year. Today PPSDRC is the second-largest Planned \nParenthood affiliate in the Nation, with an annual budget of $35 \nmillion and 400 employees who provide more than 200,000 patient visits.\n  The San Diego/Riverside affiliate has been a pioneer in the expansion \nof medical services to include vasectomies, tubal ligations, prenatal \ncare, and mifepristone. PPSDRC oversees an Emmy-award-winning teen \ntheatre and a variety of innovative teen outreach programs. It offers \nlocal midlife services, male and female sterilization services, and a \nthriving prenatal practice.\n  Mark has reached across the border from San Diego to build a Planned \nParenthood of truly international scope by developing and funding a \nbinational program in northern Baja California, Mexico. PPSDRC's \n``Mexico Fund'' supports five medical facilities in the poor colonias \naround Tijuana and funds contraceptive programs in the foreign-owned \nmanufacturing plants known as maquiladoras.\n  Over the years, Mark has also become the most visible public advocate \nof reproductive rights in the San Diego region. He represents Planned \nParenthood through television news, interview shows, debate forums, \nnewspaper commentaries, and live radio appearances.\n  I know that everyone who values women's health and reproductive \nfreedom will join me in saluting Mark Salo and sending him best wishes \nfor a well-earned, active retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10512-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, announced that the House has passed the following bill, \nin which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2123.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe expansion, intensification, and coordination of the activities of \nthe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with respect to research \non pulmonary hypertension; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pulmonary Hypertension \n     Research Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n     potential for finding a cure or effective treatment, the \n     Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension must be \n     expanded, and coordination among the national research \n     institutes of the National Institutes of Health must be \n     strengthened.\n       (2) Pulmonary hypertension (``PH'') is a serious and often \n     fatal condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises \n     to dangerously high levels. In PH patients, the walls of the \n     arteries that take blood from the right side of the heart to \n     the lungs thicken and constrict. As a result, the right side \n     of the heart has to pump harder to move blood into the lungs, \n     causing it to enlarge and ultimately fail.\n       (3) In the United States it has been estimated that 300 new \n     cases of PPH are diagnosed each year, or about 2 persons per \n     million population per year; the greatest number are reported \n     in women between the ages of 21 and 40. While at one time the \n     disease was thought to occur among young women almost \n     exclusively, we now know, however, that men and women in all \n     age ranges, from very young children to elderly people, can \n     develop PPH. It also affects people of all racial and ethnic \n     origins, with African Americans suffering from a mortality \n     rate twice as high as that affecting Caucasians.\n       (4) The low prevalence of PPH makes learning more about the \n     disease extremely difficult. Studies of PPH also have been \n     difficult because a good animal model of the disease has not \n     been available.\n       (5) In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial. The \n     familial PPH gene is located on chromosome 2 and was \n     discovered in July 2000. This discovery provided new insights \n     for determining the molecular basis of PPH and opened new \n     avenues of study for understanding the fundamental nature of \n     the disease.\n       (6) In the more advanced stages of PPH, the patient is able \n     to perform only minimal activity and has symptoms even when \n     resting. The disease may worsen to the point where the \n     patient is completely bedridden.\n       (7) PPH remains a diagnosis of exclusion and is rarely \n     picked up in a routine medical examination. Even in its later \n     stages, the signs of the disease can be confused with other \n     conditions affecting the heart and lungs. The use of new \n     diagnostic standards has been positively related to the rates \n     of diagnosis.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n       (8) In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n     established the first PPH-patient registry in the world. The \n     registry followed 194 people with PPH over a period of at \n     least 1 year and, in some cases, for as long as 7.5 years. \n     Much of what we know about the illness today stems from this \n     study.\n       (9) As research progresses, so do treatments for PH. \n     Currently, there are 4 FDA-approved medications for PH and 3 \n     more in trials. However, all medications are not effective on \n     all patients. Lung transplantation is often considered a \n     treatment of last resort for PH.\n       (10) Because we still do not understand the cause or have a \n     cure for PPH, basic research studies are focusing on the \n     possible involvement of immunologic and genetic factors in \n     the cause and progression of PPH, looking at agents that \n     cause narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels, and \n     identifying factors that cause growth of smooth muscle and \n     formation of scar tissue in the vessel walls.\n       (11) Secondary pulmonary hypertension (``SPH'') means the \n     cause is known. Common causes of SPH are the breathing \n     disorders emphysema and bronchitis. Other less frequent \n     causes are the inflammatory or collagen vascular diseases \n     such as scleroderma, CREST syndrome, or systemic lupus \n     erythematosus (``SLE''). Other causes include congenital \n     heart diseases that cause shunting of extra blood through the \n     lungs like ventricular and atrial septal defects, chronic \n     pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, and liver disease. \n     Sickle cell anemia is also linked to SPH, with preliminary \n     studies suggesting that approximately one third of sickle \n     cell patients develop SPH.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Cornyn to \nintroduce the ``Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2005.'' This \nimportant legislation increases funding for medical research dedicated \nto finding treatments and possibly a cure for Pulmonary Hypertension \n(PH), and would establish Centers of Excellence that would be charged \nwith educating health professionals and the public about the disease.\n  PH is a serious, often fatal condition. It is estimated that more \nthan 100,000 Americans suffer from pulmonary hypertension. It does not \ndiscriminate based on race, gender or age. However, women are more than \ntwice as likely as men to develop the condition. PH is characterized by \ndangerously high blood pressure in the lungs. In PH patients, the walls \nof the arteries that take blood from the right side of the heart to the \nlungs thicken so much that they restrict the flow of blood.\n  The Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act would do three things: First, \nit expands PH research at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute \nat the NIH, authorizing $250 million over five years to fund PH \nresearch. Additional funding would help researchers further understand \nPH and develop new treatment options for the illness.\n  Second, the legislation would establish ``Centers of Excellence'' \nwhich would focus on PH research and education efforts for both health \nprofessionals and the general public. One of the greatest tragedies of \nPH is that it often goes undiagnosed. Most Americans have never heard \nof PH and do not know that symptoms such as shortness of breath, \nfatigue, and dizziness are common indicators of the illness. Lastly, \nthe legislation establishes a data system and clearinghouse at the \nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that would disseminate \ninformation on PH to the general public in order to facilitate more \naccurate and timely diagnosis.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to make sure \nwomen don't get left out or left behind when it comes to their health. \nFrom women's inclusion in clinical trials to quality standards for \nmammograms, I have led the way to make sure women's health needs are \ntreated fairly and taken seriously. This legislation builds on these \npast successes to address this silent disease among young American \nwomen. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill \nsigned into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Obama, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1775.

Mr. President, today Congress is confronted with how to \nbest provide tax relief to American families earning slightly more than \nthe minimum wage. We can do that by expanding the availability of the \nchild tax credit to more working families.\n  In 2001, I pushed to make the child tax credit refundable for workers \nmaking around the minimum wage. As enacted in 2001, a portion of a \ntaxpayer's\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nchild tax credit would be refundable--up to 10 percent of earnings \nabove $10,000.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Working Families Tax Relief of 2004, \nwhich increased from 10 percent to 15 percent the portion of the child \ntax credit that is refundable. Although the legislation increased the \namount of the refundable child credit, it failed to increase the number \nof families eligible for the benefit. The consequences are serious for \nlow-income Americans living paycheck to paycheck. It means that tens of \nthousands of low-income families will be completely ineligible for a \ncredit they should receive.\n  This year, because the income threshold is indexed, only taxpayers \nearning over $11,000 are eligible to receive the refundable portion of \nthe child tax credit. Low-income families earning less than $11,000 are \nshut out of the child tax credit completely.\n  For example, a single mother who earns the minimum wage and works a \n40 hour week for all 52 weeks of the year fails to qualify for the \nrefundable portion of the child tax credit. Since the mother earns \n$10,700, she is a mere $300 away from qualifying for the credit. Worse, \nif the single mother does not receive a raise the following year, it \nwill be even tougher to qualify because the $11,000 she originally \nneeded to earn is adjusted for inflation and will increase.\n  I am introducing legislation, the Working Family Child Assistance \nAct, with Senators Lincoln, Chafee, Obama, and Rockefeller that will \nenable more hard-working, low-income families to receive the refundable \nchild credit this year. My legislation returns to $10,000 the amount of \nincome a family must earn to qualify for the credit. Moreover, my bill \nwould ``deindex'' the $10,000 threshold for inflation, so families \nfailing to get a raise each year would not lose benefits.\n  Most notably, my bill is identical to the refundable child credit \nproposal the Senate passed in May 2001 as part of its version of that \nyear's tax bill. Although I was able to ensure that a refundable child \ncredit would be part of the final bill sent to President Bush, \nconferees did index the $10,000 threshold to inflation despite my best \nefforts.\n  The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this \nlegislation will allow an additional 600,000 families to benefit from \nthe refundable child tax credit.\n  For example, the legislation provides a $113 child credit to a mom \nwho earns $10,750 per year. That's money she could use to buy \ngroceries, rent, school books and other family necessities.\n  The Commerce Department recently reported that between August 2004 \nand August 2005 average weekly wages adjusted for inflation fell 1.1 \npercent. Obviously, families need all the help we can give them.\n  Our families and our country are better off when government lets \npeople keep more of what they earn. Parents deserve their per-child tax \ncredit, and this bill rewards families for work.\n  I am committed to this issue and have called on President Bush to \nwork with Congress so we can help an additional one million children, \nwhose parents and guardians struggle every day to take care of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1775\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Working Family Child \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. $10,000 INCOME THRESHOLD USED TO CALCULATE REFUNDABLE \n                   PORTION OF CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 24(d) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to portion of credit refundable) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``as exceeds'' and all that follows through \n     ``, or'' in paragraph (1)(B)(i) and inserting ``as exceeds \n     $10,000, or'', and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (3).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2004.\n       (c) Application of Sunset to This Section.--Each amendment \n     made by this section shall be subject to title IX of the \n     Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 to \n     the same extent and in the same manner as the provision of \n     such Act to which such amendment relates.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Child Tax Credit and to \nsupport S. 1775, a bill I've worked on with Senators Snowe and Lincoln. \nI am proud to cosponsor this bill to help working families get all the \ntax relief they deserve. The Child Credit is an important component of \nour federal tax code, and S. 1775 is an important step in making the \ncredit more valuable and more fair for those who need it most.\n  The Child Credit recognizes that raising children is expensive and \nallows middle class families to claim a credit of $1,000 per child \nagainst their federal income tax. That's a big help.\n  Importantly, the Child Credit also recognizes the particular \nvulnerability of low-income families with children. Since the credit is \nrefundable to the extent of 15% of a taxpayer's earned income in excess \nof $10,750, families earning more than that threshold level of income \nget at least a partial benefit even if they have no federal income tax \nliability. The benefit may be small for families with low incomes, but \nevery penny helps defray the rising costs of being a working parent in \nAmerica today.\n  Unfortunately, as currently structured, the Child Credit leaves more \nand more families out of the benefit each year. That's because the \nincome threshold for eligibility rises annually at the rate of \ninflation even though family incomes may not rise as fast. That means \nthat if you earn the minimum wage, which has not increased since 1997, \nor if your wage is low and you didn't get a raise, or if you worked \nfewer hours than the year before, then your tax refund probably shrunk. \nIt may even have disappeared. That strikes me as unfair, and it's what \nalmost four and a half million households with children will experience \nthis year.\n  Generally, indexing the parameters of the tax system for inflation \nmakes sense because it neutralizes the effects of inflation on the tax \nsystem. In this case, however, indexing the threshold results in an \nunfair tax increase for low-income families whose incomes are stagnant \nor falling. Recent data indicates that the typical low-income household \nactually saw its earnings decline during the first few years of this \ndecade. At the same time, the costs of housing, childcare, and driving \nto work have increased.\n  This bill returns the threshold to its original level of $10,000 and \nfreezes it, thereby expanding the benefit to include more kids and \nprotecting those families from unfair tax increases due to inflation. \nThis is an important step in improving the fairness of our tax code and \nproviding necessary support to working families.\n  In time, I hope we will do more. It is unfair that more than eight \nmillion children in families with incomes too low to qualify even for a \npartial credit--these are incomes far below the federal poverty level--\nget no benefit at all. Ironically, these children have the greatest \nneeds, and their parents pay an enormous share of their incomes in \ntaxes and basic services, such as food, housing, and clothing.\n  America can do better. In time, I hope we will tackle the broader \nchallenge of ensuring that their parents have jobs that pay living \nwages, a home they can afford, a school district that enables a life of \nopportunity, a community that cares for its children, and the faith \nthat hard work and personal commitment pay off. America can do this.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill as \na first step in partnering with me in addressing the broader goal of \nequal opportunity for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1778. A bill to extend medicare cost-sharing for qualifying \nindividuals through September 2006, to extend the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families Program, transitional medical assistance under the \nMedicaid Program, and related programs through March 31, 2006, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Max Baucus in introducing the ``Medicare Cost-Sharing and \nWelfare Extension Act of 2005.''\n  This legislation extends the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, \nTANF, for 3 months and provides funding for 6 months of Transitional \nMedical Assistance, TMA, for families\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\nmaking the transition from welfare to work. As my colleagues know, H.R. \n3672, which has been signed into law, would extend TANF until December \n31, 2005, so this legislation represents a total extension of TANF \nuntil the end of March, 2006.\n  This is the twelfth extension of TANF and related programs. Welfare \nreform reauthorization should have been passed years ago. Too many \nfamilies are languishing on the welfare rolls and we are seeing a \nbacksliding of the improvements that we saw in the early years, after \nwelfare reform. Child care funding has remained stagnant. States have \nbeen operating their welfare programs under a cloud of uncertainty \nregarding what a final Federal welfare reauthorization bill would \nrequire of them. We need to make some critical reforms to build on the \nsuccess of the 1996 bill and give States the ability to manage and plan \nfor their welfare programs. I am hopeful that this represents the final \nshort-term extension of TANF and that the Congress will act quickly to \npass a comprehensive welfare bill.\n  Additionally, this legislation includes a provision to extend cost-\nsharing assistance to qualifying individuals, QIs, for the Medicare \nPart B premium through September, 2006. This program has been helping \nvulnerable individuals with incomes between 120 and 135 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Level since 1997. It is estimated that the Part B \npremiums will cost a beneficiary $88.50 a month, an increase of $10.30 \nfrom the current $78.20 premium. For these low-income individuals, that \nrepresents a significant percentage of their monthly income. The \nPresident's budget includes a one year extension of the QI program.\n  Both the QI and TANF programs provide critical support to individuals \nand families with children who are in need--folks who otherwise might \nnot be able to get healthcare services or make ends meet.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT (for himself, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Coleman):\n  S.J.

Until 6:45, if no other Senators are seeking recognition, \nmay I speak in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10521-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10521-S10523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the nomination \nof John G. Roberts, Jr. to be Chief Justice of the United States. This \nis a rare occurrence, rare for us to even consider a Supreme Court \nvacancy, let alone a Chief Justice. I have been honored to be a member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee and have spent the week before last, \na major part of it, in hearings where Judge Roberts came and testified. \nThey were historic in nature. I am surprised, as I go back home to \nIllinois, how many people followed them and listened, either over the \nradio or watched them on television, and followed the questions and \nanswers so closely.\n  It has been a very difficult process for many. I can't think of a \nmore challenging assignment than to try to measure a person and try to \ndecide how a person will react to certain questions and challenges over \nthe rest of their natural lifetime. But that is our responsibility. \nFilling this vacancy on the Supreme Court means choosing a person of \nJudge Roberts' age, for example, who could serve for 20 or 30 years. \nThat is the reality of this decisionmaking process.\n  The greatest compliment one can pay a judge is not that he is smart \nor has great intelligence. The greatest compliment one can pay a judge \nis that he is wise, that in his work on the bench, he has shown the \nwisdom of Solomon.\n  In the Scriptures, Solomon was often described as the wisest man who \never lived. But in chapter 3 of First Book of Kings, we learn what \nSolomon wanted even more than wisdom. It is written:\n\n       In Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at \n     night, and God said, ``Ask what you wish me to give you.'' \n     Then Solomon said, ``So give your servant an understanding \n     heart to judge your people, to discern between good and evil. \n     For who is able to judge this great people of yours?''\n\n  Many questions were asked of John Roberts at his hearings. If there \nwas any effort to determine whether he had a great legal mind or great \nintelligence, he certainly satisfied every question. But then if you \nlook at the questions more carefully, more closely, you will find we \nwere asking even more fundamental questions of John Roberts. We were \nasking and trying to determine not his knowledge but his wisdom, \nwhether he had, as Solomon wished, an understanding heart.\n  Some have argued that it is unfair for any Senator to raise that kind \nof a question. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is my friend. \nHe said it was not fair to get into this whole line of questioning \nabout what is in your heart. I disagree. I believe we are not being \nfair to the American people if we don't understand the values of people \nwho serve on the Supreme Court, if we don't strive to understand their \nphilosophies, and if we don't try to put ourselves inside the mind and \nheart of someone we are entrusting with a lifetime position to serve on \nthe highest Court in the United States.\n  In 1991, at his confirmation hearing, Justice Souter said that judges \nmust understand that since they are people who have the power to \n``affect the lives of other people and who are going to change their \nlives by what they do, we had better use every power of our minds and \nour hearts and our beings to get these rulings right.''\n  Justice Breyer in 1994 said:\n\n       That is why I always think that law requires both a heart \n     and a head. If you do not have a heart, it becomes a sterile \n     set of rules removed from human problems and will not help. \n     If you do not have a head, there is a risk that in trying to \n     decide a particular person's problem in a case that may look \n     fine for that person, but cause trouble for a lot of other \n     people, making their lives worse. So it is a question of \n     balance.\n\n  I asked John Roberts if he could meet the test that my mentor and \npredecessor, Illinois Senator Paul Simon, brought to the Judiciary \nCommittee questioning years ago. Senator Simon asked of the judicial \nnominees: Is this nominee committed to expanding the freedom enjoyed by \nall Americans, or will he or she restrict it? I also asked Judge \nRoberts whether he had the courage of Frank Johnson, an Alabama Federal \njudge and a Republican appointee who stood up for civil rights in the \n1960s at a time and place when it was very unpopular to do so. What did \nwe learn? Regrettably, we learned very little about Judge Roberts \nduring the 20 hours of testimony.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Biden asked an important line of \nquestions that I followed carefully. They asked of Judge Roberts what \nhe would do, not as a judge, not as a lawyer, but as a father in a \nfamily circumstance where someone you love has left instructions to you \nthat at the closing moments of their life, they do not want any \nextraordinary life support. This happens thousands of times every day. \nFamilies face this decision, and it is an important decision, not just \non a personal and emotional basis but on the basis of our right of \nprivacy in America. In the Terry Schiavo case--that tragedy in \nFlorida--this sad woman was on a support system for some 15 years, if I \nam not mistaken. The case went through the courts year after year, and \nfinally, when all the appeals in Florida had been exhausted, there was \nan effort\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\nmade by some in the House of Representatives to have the Federal courts \nintervene and try to make the decision for that family, a decision \nwhich her husband believed had already been made. It was unfortunate \nthat Judge Roberts, even on a personal basis, would not address that \nissue. We were looking for an insight into his thinking about a family \ndecision that many will face.\n  I asked him as well about his decision as a private attorney to \nrepresent an HMO in a case called Rush Prudential HMO v. Moran. That \nwas a case that was important because this patient had an expensive \nsurgery that cost over $90,000. When the doctor said the patient needed \nthe surgery and went ahead with it, the HMO said: No, we didn't approve \nit, and refused to pay.\n  John Roberts as a private attorney represented the HMO. He went \nbefore the Supreme Court and argued that the HMO should not have to pay \nfor this patient's expensive surgery. I asked Judge Roberts: When you \ntook that case, did you ever consider the fact that if you won that \ncase, millions of Americans could lose their health insurance \nprotection? Did you have any reservations about taking a case where so \nmany people could suffer as a result?\n  He said no. And he said something more. He said: If the other side on \nthat case had walked in first and asked me to be their lawyer, I would \nhave represented the other side as well.\n\n  The following day, I asked him questions about cases he had taken, \ncases he pointed to with pride, so-called pro bono cases where lawyers \nwork for free when people cannot afford a lawyer, a case where he \nrepresented welfare recipients in the District of Columbia who were \nabout to lose benefits, and another case where he represented people \nwith different sexual orientation, gays and lesbians, who were afraid \nthey would be discriminated against because of a Colorado law.\n  I asked him: In both of those cases you pointed to with pride, you \nrepresented the people who were asserting their rights, asking for \ntheir freedom, asking not to be discriminated against. From what you \nsaid yesterday, could you have represented the other side in those \ncases, taking away the rights and the freedoms of individuals?\n  He said: Yes.\n  So you have to understand that many of us come to the Chamber, having \nlistened to several days of questions and answers, still uncertain \nabout John Roberts and the values he would bring to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Many questions were asked about the power of the President in a time \nof war. We asked Judge Roberts about a recent decision, Hamdan v. \nRumsfeld. Judge Roberts signed on to an opinion in that case which \nconcludes that a detainee can challenge his detention in court but has \nno legal rights that are enforceable in court. In other words, John \nRoberts seems to believe that detainees of the Government can get to \nthe courthouse door but cannot come inside. His approach seems to be \ninconsistent with Supreme Court law. What if detainees claimed they \nwere being tortured or even executed? Would Judge Roberts say the Court \nhas no right to review the Government's actions?\n  Unfortunately, Judge Roberts would not respond, and I still don't \nknow when it comes to so many issues where he stands.\n  Fifty-five different times, he said: I will follow the rule of law. \nBut we know that following the rule of law is neither automatic nor \nsomething that is easily predicted. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. once \nwrote:\n\n       The life of the law has not been logic; it has been \n     experience.\n\n  Whenever we asked Judge Roberts basic questions about his moral \ncompass and his life experience, he declined to answer. I asked him at \none point: What could you say to a poor person in America, a minority \nin America, a disenfranchised person in America, a powerless person in \nAmerica, what can you say about your life experience that would lead \nthem to believe that if their case came before your court, they had a \nfighting chance?\n  I acknowledged the fact that Judge Roberts was raised in a \ncomfortable middle-class family in the Middle West. When it was all \nsaid and done, he could not point to many life experiences which \nsuggest he would have an understanding of those people in his Court. \nHis response again, as it was so many times, was that he would follow \nthe rule of law.\n  I voted against Judge Roberts two years ago when he was a nominee for \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I was upset with the way \nthe vacancies were created in that circuit in an effort to fill them \nwith Republicans when President Bush was elected. Perhaps I went a \nlittle too far in my language about that with my frustration, but I \nsaid at the time that I could not support Judge Roberts because I just \ndidn't know who he was or for what he stood.\n  When this process began, I promised Judge Roberts that we would start \nwith a clean slate. Sadly, when the process was over, it was largely an \nempty slate.\n  I am uncertain about Judge Roberts' commitment to civil rights. He \nwrote some memos during the Reagan administration which reflect a very \nnarrow view of voting rights in America, a right which he calls the \npreservative right, which is so important for preserving a democracy. \nWhen it came to interpreting the Voting Rights Act under the Reagan \nadministration, he took a position that was ultimately rejected and \ndiscredited. We listened as Senator Kennedy and others asked him many \nquestions about that, and we did not learn too much about his thinking \ntoday and whether it has changed.\n  I asked him about his criticism of a historic case, Plyler v. Doe. \nThis 1982 Supreme Court case held that it is unconstitutional to deny \nelementary education to children on the basis of their immigration \nstatus. The Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that allowed \nelementary schools to refuse entrance to undocumented children. It has \nbeen called the ``Brown v. Board of Education'' for Hispanics in \nAmerica.\n  On the day it was decided, Judge Roberts, then a Reagan staffer, \ncoauthored a memo that criticized the Solicitor General's Office for \nfailing to file a brief in support of the Texas law. His memo disagreed \nwith the administration's position, so he could not seek refuge in the \ncommon answer: I was just doing my job for the administration.\n  It has been 23 years since Plyler v. Doe was decided. Millions of \nchildren have been educated. Many have become good citizens. They serve \nin our military, they have become doctors, police officers, people who \nconstitute the fabric of our society--thanks to the Supreme Court \ndecision that Judge Roberts found objectionable.\n  So at the hearing, I said to him: As you reflect on this 23 years \nlater, do you agree it was the right decision and should be settled law \nto offer education to these children? He was unwilling to say that.\n  It is no surprise that Judge Roberts' nomination is opposed by the \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, the organization which \nfor the first time in its history opposes a Supreme Court nominee, as \nwell as by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nMALDEF. The President of MALDEF, Ann Marie Tallman, testified as a \nwitness against Judge Roberts and said that his opinions ``often place \nhim in opposition not only to equal justice for Latinos, but opposed to \npositions taken by bipartisan majorities in Congress and the Reagan \nadministration that he served.''\n\n  One of the most compelling witnesses against Judge Roberts is a man \nwho is one of my personal heroes, Congressman John Lewis of Atlanta, \nGA. Those who don't know John Lewis should read about this man who \nliterally risked his life time and again during the civil rights \nmovement and now serves a constituency in the House of Representatives. \nJohn Lewis opposes the nomination of John Roberts because he does not \nbelieve John Roberts is as sensitive to the issue of civil rights as he \nshould be.\n  So I asked John Lewis this. I said: John, I happen to believe in the \npower of redemption, both politically and personally. I ask you, John, \ncan't people change? Wouldn't you think Judge Roberts may have changed \nsome of his hard-line views from the Reagan days?\n  This is what Congressman Lewis said:\n\n       [W]hen you believe and feel and know from your experience, \n     or maybe from the law and from history that you have been \n     wrong, you show some sign. And you are not afraid to\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\n     talk about it. You are not afraid to go on the record. Judge \n     Roberts has been afraid to show or demonstrate any signs that \n     he has changed. I wonder whether it is part of his mindset.\n\n  To follow the words of John Lewis, we don't have from John Roberts a \ndemonstration of the kind of courage of Frank Johnson, that Alabama \nFederal judge who issued rulings that allowed Martin Luther King, Jr. \nas well as John Lewis and others to march from Selma to Montgomery, \nrulings that permitted African Americans to organize a boycott of the \ncity of Montgomery's segregated bus system following the arrest of Rosa \nParks.\n  Judge Johnson was also called the most hated man in Alabama by the Ku \nKlux Klan and received so many death threats that he and his family \nwere under constant Federal protection from 1961 to 1975, with crosses \nburned on the lawn of his family.\n  Judge Johnson's enemies, incidentally, called him a ``judicial \nactivist.'' So when you hear that term being used around here today, \nexcuse me if I happen to believe that it has been used in cases where \nit was entirely inappropriate. Judge Frank Johnson spoke out for civil \nrights at a moment in America's history when we needed a judge with \ncourage, and risked a lot to do so. He showed courage to do so. If that \nis judicial activism, then thank goodness for a judicial activist who \nwas sensitive to civil rights in America.\n  Many conservatives have also railed against the Supreme Court's \nreferences to international laws and legal opinions in recent cases. \nThis was an interesting sideline to this hearing. Putting John Roberts \non the spot: Does he promise, if he goes on the bench, that he won't be \nlooking to legal opinions from foreign countries.\n  I was disappointed to hear Judge Roberts' reply. He embraced this \nhostility toward even considering lessons of foreign law. What does it \nsay of us as a nation when we try to promote democratic ideas around \nthe world and yet recoil at the thought of another country having \nuseful ideas for our own Nation to consider?\n  Of course, U.S. judges don't base their decisions entirely on foreign \nlaw or legal opinions, but the experience of other democracies may help \ninform their thinking. Just last week, Justice Ginsburg defended the \npractice of Supreme Court reference to foreign legal opinions, not for \nprecedent but for guidance. She observed:\n\n       I will take enlightenment wherever I can get it.\n\n  I hope Judge Roberts will reconsider this position and take heart not \nonly in Justice Ginsburg's wise words but also the wise words of the \nman whose robes he hopes to fill, Chief Justice Rehnquist, who once \nsaid:\n\n       When many constitutional courts were created after the \n     Second World War, these courts naturally looked to decisions \n     of the Supreme Court of the United States, among other \n     sources, for developing their own law. But now that \n     constitutional law is solidly grounded in so many countries, \n     it is time that the United States courts begin looking to the \n     decisions of other constitutional courts to aid in their own \n     deliberative process.\n\n  It amazes me that this has become such a whipping point for some \npolitical groups in this town. Of course, we should consider other \nlegal opinions from other countries as Justice Ginsburg and Chief \nJustice Rehnquist suggested. American law will decide the case, but as \nJustice Ginsburg said, we should take enlightenment wherever we can \nfind it.\n  I think Supreme Court nominees carry the burden of proof when they \ncome before the Senate. They must prove they are worthy of a lifetime \nappointment to the highest Court in the land. In the case of Judge \nRoberts, the burden of proof is especially heavy because President Bush \nrefused to share memos from the period of time when John Roberts served \nas the Principal Deputy Solicitor General. Those more contemporary \nmemos would have given us a greater insight into what he really \nbelieves on some critical issues, but the Bush administration said \n``no.'' They denied us these documents.\n  When it came to the Reagan-era memos, many times Judge Roberts argued \nthey were so old they should be discounted.\n  I also think Judge Roberts bears a heavy burden of proof because he \nhas been nominated to serve as Chief Justice. When he is approved this \nweek, we will move from the Rehnquist Court to the Roberts Court for 20 \nor 30 years to come.\n  The Chief Justice is the most important and powerful judge in \nAmerica. We need a Chief Justice who has wisdom, courage, and \ncompassion.\n  At the beginning of the process, Judge Roberts came by my office. I \nhad a chance to sit down for a few minutes with him. I want to \ncongratulate him and thank him for doing that not only for my benefit \nbut for the benefit of so many other Senators. I like him. During the \nhearings, I looked at his wife and his kids and I said, This is a man I \nreally could like. As I said earlier, I promised him a clean slate but \nunfortunately he could not add much to that slate during the course of \nthis process.\n  Next to a vote on whether America goes to war, the most important \nvotes we cast as Senators are for Justices of the Supreme Court. That \nCourt, more than any other institution in America, is the most \nimportant when it comes to America's rights and liberties.\n  The decision made by those nine Justices can change the face of \ndemocracy in America. That Court has done that so many times in the \npast and can certainly do it in the future. Their decisions, more \nimportant than any single law we pass, can decide basic personal \nfreedoms for millions of Americans.\n  I sincerely wish I believed that John Roberts was the right person \nfor this historic appointment. I will vote no on his nomination, but I \nwill pray that John Roberts proves to be a Chief Justice with not only \na great legal mind but also the courage of Judge Frank Johnson of \nAlabama and the understanding heart of Solomon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10523-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10523-S10525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week, just days before the end of the \nfiscal year, we are going to consider the Defense appropriations bill. \nThis is an important bill for America's national security. The \nchairman, ranking member, and their staffs worked long and hard on it. \nI appreciate their commitment and willingness to work with both sides.\n  Before we even take up this bill, however, we could and should have \nvoted on the Defense authorization bill, which includes critical policy \nmatters crucial to national security importance. As hard as it may be \nto understand in the midst of a war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate pulled the Defense authorization \nbill from the calendar in July and replaced it with a bill that was \nrequested by the National Rifle Association.\n  The gun lobby wanted a bill to excuse them from liability in lawsuits \nand the Republican leadership in the Senate felt that was more \nimportant than the Defense authorization bill, which considered massive \npolicy questions involving hundreds of thousands of men and women in \nuniform and veterans.\n  I do not understand that thinking. The appropriations bill we will \nhopefully take up this week includes $50 billion for military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I said, at the start of the war in \nIraq, that while I felt the invasion was a mistake, I would not deny \none penny to our troops in the field for body armor, medical supplies, \nair support, ammunition, equipment, or any other costs associated with \nour forces and their security.\n  I have always thought that if it were my son or daughter in uniform, \nI would not shortchange them one penny, so that they could come home \nsafely with their mission accomplished, and that is still my pledge.\n  The American people should be aware of what this war is costing us. \nFirst and foremost, it continues to cost American lives. This month, \nwhile most Americans were glued to their televisions focusing on \nKatrina and Rita, the hurricanes that struck us in the Gulf of Mexico, \n37 more American soldiers died in Iraq.\n  Last month, while Congress was in recess, 85 Americans were killed in \nIraq. All told, 1,921 Americans have been killed as of today and 14,755 \nhave been wounded. Many have suffered devastating permanent injuries.\n  Senator Harry Reid and his wife Landra went to Bethesda Medical \nCenter yesterday. Senator Reid came to tell us this morning the sad \nexperience he had there, where he saw a young soldier in a wheelchair \nwho had clearly been maimed by this war in ways that\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\nare hard to believe. Having lost both legs and suffered a head injury, \nit is clear that his life will never, ever be the same. Senator Reid \nsaid to us again at lunch, he cannot get this image from his mind.\n  When we hear of injured soldiers, we should not believe that these \nare superficial injuries which can be easily overlooked. Many of those \nare life changing, life transforming.\n  This war has cost us in so many other ways as well. Sadly, it has \nundermined our war on terrorism, while it has created a new front in \nthis conflict and an advanced training ground for terrorists. It has \nstretched our Armed Forces, especially our Army, National Guard, and \nReserves, placing enormous strains on service members and their \nfamilies. It has diminished our national credibility. That loss of \ncredibility makes it harder now for the administration to go to the \nUnited Nations and present information that is needed about security in \nthe world. Some of the presentations made in the lead up to the war in \nIraq have cost us dearly in terms of our credibility.\n  A nuclear Iran is a terrible threat, but I know much of the world is \nprobably wondering if they believe any photographs that we produce \nrelative to that threat in Iran after the discredited photos before our \ninvasion of Iraq. Some Americans probably are asking the same question, \nand their doubts are another unfortunate product of this conflict.\n  There are enormous costs to this war. We have already spent over $196 \nbillion in Iraq. This week or next we are likely to approve another $50 \nbillion, which will not cover the cost of the war next year. It is a \ndownpayment for the beginning of those costs. We are currently spending \nclose to $5 billion a month in Iraq, and we are acting on this bill \nthis week in part because of the report that the Pentagon is growing \nshort of money. The new fiscal year starts in several days, and that \nmakes it virtually inevitable that at some point next year, maybe as \nearly as next spring, we will be voting another supplemental \nappropriation to fund the war in Iraq.\n  I think simply staying the course under these circumstances is no \nlonger an option. The costs in blood and treasure are too high and the \nprogress in Iraq is not there.\n  The costs of this war have been brought home to my State. We have \nlost 77 of our sons and daughters in this war, and by one calculation \nit has cost the taxpayers in the city of Chicago alone $2.2 billion. \nLast week, the Chicago city council passed a resolution addressing the \nwar in Iraq. They did so not because they believe that they are in \ncharge of foreign policy but because they wanted to speak their minds. \nThe city council's resolution honors the men and women who serve and \nthose who have been killed or wounded. It states that through their \nservice and sacrifice, our troops have substantially accomplished the \nstated purpose of the United States of giving the people of Iraq a \nreasonable opportunity to decide their own future.\n\n  The resolution concludes that we should, therefore, make an orderly \nand rapid withdrawal from Iraq. That is the conclusion of the Chicago \ncity council; it is not mine. But I sure understand the motivations and \nI sure hear many people back in Illinois saying exactly those words. I \nthink millions of Americans understand and share the sentiments.\n  Polls show that 63 percent of the people in this country believe we \nshould withdraw all or some of our troops from Iraq. This past weekend, \nat least 100,000 people, maybe many more, marched on Washington to call \nfor a way out of Iraq. They came from all over the country and from \nmany walks of life. I do not think a rapid withdrawal is in the best \ninterests of Iraq or the United States, but I understand why they came, \nand I understand why they are trying to raise this issue. It troubles \nme that we can go for days on end in the Senate without ever talking \nabout the war in Iraq that is so much in the forefront of the minds of \nthe American people.\n  I bring these charts to the floor as a reminder that as our daily \nbusiness goes apace, Americans are losing their lives and suffering \nterrible injuries.\n  America cannot simply stay the course in Iraq. The administration \nclaims its strategy is working, but there is very little evidence of \nthat. The insurgents are getting more violent, more lethal. Their \nattacks are killing more people. That is the nature of insurgency. It \nis an insurgency against foreign occupiers. History says that this can \ngo on for a long time. Do we possess more fire power than these \ninsurgents or terrorists? We sure do, but we alone cannot use that \nmilitary fire power to be successful.\n  Our military leaders tell us one cannot score a military victory over \nan insurgency. It is going to take a political victory. The only people \nwho can defeat or win over Iraqi insurgents are the Iraqis themselves, \nnot our brave soldiers. The only people who can build a sustainable \ngovernment in Iraq are the Iraqis, and those military and political \ndevelopments must be linked or neither will succeed.\n  That linkage is something we were never able to accomplish in Vietnam \nso many decades ago. What we saw instead in South Vietnam was a long \nline of corrupt governments with little legitimacy and even less \npopular support.\n  We still wait to see whether the Government of Iraq will be up to \nthis challenge. In a few weeks, the people of Iraq will vote on a draft \nconstitution. I hope that the October referendum on this constitution \nencourages a vigorous and peaceful political process and healthy voter \nturnout from all sectors of Iraqi society--Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, and \nothers. One vote does not make a democracy. Regardless of the outcome \nof the referendum, it is critical that the same people who turn out to \nvote engage in the state-building that must follow.\n  This week, according to the schedule, we are taking up the Defense \nappropriations bill. For the first time, more than 3 years into this \nbill, we are finally trying to budget for at least some of the costs of \nthis war. Any other time we passed it by emergency supplemental \nappropriations.\n  May I say a word about that for a moment. Is it not curious that when \nit comes to rebuilding the devastation from Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita, that there are many who are arguing that we need to cut \nspending in other programs, such as health care for the poor or \nprescription drugs for senior citizens, to pay for that reconstruction \nin America? There was not a single member of the other political party, \nthat I know of, who came forward and argued for setoffs when it came to \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. Is it not odd that we do not need to set \noff by cutting spending to rebuild Iraq but now many of these same \nCongressmen and Senators are saying that before we can help rebuild \nAmerica we have to cut critical programs for the needy people of this \ncountry? I do not understand their logic. It is certainly inconsistent.\n  We cannot budget for the human costs of war, and we cannot put a \nnumber on the possible strategic costs, but we should at least try to \naccount for the fiscal price tag of this conflict. We have to measure \nthose hundreds of billions of dollars which have been spent and will be \nspent against what we need in America to make our Nation strong.\n  Last month, when Katrina struck, a third of the Louisiana National \nGuard was deployed to Iraq. So was much of their equipment. These \ndeployments have had real homeland security consequences. We have \nlearned that we were not only unprepared for Katrina, but we have to \nlearn the lessons of Katrina to be prepared, God forbid another \ndisaster, either natural or terrorist-inspired, should occur. We owe it \nto our taxpayers to measure those costs. We must also measure the costs \nof war against the progress Iraqis are making, and I do not see a lot \nof progress, though I hope that changes.\n  One thousand nine hundred and twenty-one American soldiers have died \nin Iraq.

Mr. President, today a report was released showing the \nmedian difference between the lowest Medicare discount card price and \nthe best available price for the Veterans' Administration. The \ndifference was 58 percent.\n  Most people realize we are about to start this Medicare prescription \ndrug plan. This plan was created to give seniors a discount on \nprescription drugs, which is something we need. Prescription drugs keep \nseniors healthy, and the healthier they are the better their lives and \nthe less costs to taxpayers.\n  But many of us objected to the original Medicare prescription drug \nplan because it was drawn up, frankly, by the pharmaceutical companies. \nThey were unwilling to give up any of their profits to a Medicare plan, \nand that is how the law was written. As a result of that, many of us \nvoted no, saying there is a model we should follow. Currently, the \nVeterans' Administration provides prescription drugs to hundreds of \nthousands of veterans across America. To provide the drugs, the \nVeterans' Administration bargains with the pharmaceutical companies for \nthe lowest possible price. We said, Why wouldn't the Medicare system, \nwhich is much larger--embracing, I think, some 40 million Americans--\nwhy wouldn't the Medicare system be in a strong bargaining position to \nget the same discounted drug prices and therefore help the seniors to \nlower costs and reduce the burden on taxpayers that have to subsidize \nthis program? It makes sense for the VA, why wouldn't it make sense for \nMedicare? The pharmaceutical companies ended up winning that debate. \nThey ended up creating a system under Medicare which does not allow the \nMedicare system to bargain for lower drug prices.\n  A group called Families USA took a look at the Medicare drug discount \ncards being used by seniors today and compared the best prices--not the \nworst, but the best prices being paid by seniors with those discount \ncards with the amount being paid by the Veterans Administration for \nidentical drugs. Now we took a look at the most prescribed drugs for \nseniors, Families USA did, and here is what they found:\n  For Norvasc, the lowest price per year for treatment under Medicare-\napproved discount, $467; VA pricing, $301; percentage difference, 54 \npercent.\n  Protonix, $827 to Medicare; $253 is what the VA pays; a difference of \n226 percent. And Zocor, $793 under Medicare prescription drug cards; \n$167 a year at the VA. That means we will pay, under the Medicare \nprescription drug plan, the President has signed and is about to go \ninto effect, almost four times as much for the same drugs that are \nbeing dispensed at the Veterans Administration.\n  That tells a story. It tells us if we use the same bargaining power \nas the VA, we could save seniors and taxpayers dollars.\n  When the Medicare prescription drug benefit was designed, it was for \nthe pharmaceutical companies and the HMOs, not for seniors. This report \nfrom Families USA makes that point.\n  Medicare has 25 times the number of people covered by the program as \nthe Veterans' Administration. Imagine, for a moment, the bargaining \npower of Medicare compared to VA. Unfortunately, instead of simply \noffering a drug benefit through Medicare and negotiating these bulk \ndiscount prices, this Congress and the President handed the drug \nbenefit over to these private pharmaceutical companies.\n  The bill we passed in 2003 is almost impossible to describe. I can't \nunderstand how most seniors will get through this bureaucratic mess \nthat we created with this bill. CMS announced last week that there will \nbe 34 active pharmaceutical regions in the United States. Each one of \nthese regions will have 11 to 20 organizations offering prescription \ndrugs. Illinois, my State, will have 16. So with an average of 15 plans \nin each region, there will be 510 different organizations across the \nNation negotiating with pharmaceutical companies.\n  It is easy to see we have reduced the bargaining power of these plans \nin each one of these regions and therefore can expect to pay even more \nfor the basic drugs that the seniors need. Instead of the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services negotiating on behalf of one pool of 41 \nmillion seniors for lower drug prices, Medicare's purchasing power has \nbeen divided into 510 small fractions. Bulk purchasing by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services would surely save Medicare \nsignificantly more money than handing the negotiation over to these \nprivate sector negotiators.\n  There is a lot of talk in Congress these days about reimportation of \ndrugs from other countries as a way to lower prices. Look to the North. \nCanada has much lower drug prices than the United States for exactly \nthe same drugs, made by the same companies, that are sold in the United \nStates. However, with just 2 percent of the worldwide pharmaceutical \nmarket, Canada does not possess the market power necessary to influence \nprices through negotiation. They do it through regulation.\n  The United States, on the other hand, has 53 percent of the worldwide \nprescription drug market. Half of it is made up of Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Imagine the savings we could achieve simply by giving \nthe Medicare program the authority to negotiate on behalf of its \nbeneficiaries. Unfortunately, in addition to dividing up the purchasing \npool, the Medicare prescription drug bill Congress passed specifically \nforbids the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with \ndrug companies for lower prices.\n  The obvious question is, What good would that do if you gave the \nSecretary the power to negotiate? You remember the anthrax crisis--we \nall do; and the fear of anthrax contamination led many to prescribe \nCipro as a drug to protect those who might have been exposed. This was \nin October 2001. After anthrax was found on Capitol Hill, this drug \nCipro made the news. The average retail price for Cipro in 2001 was \n$4.67 for each tablet. That is when the anthrax crisis started. So \nSecretary Tommy Thompson, in President Bush's Cabinet, and the \nPresident of Bayer Corporation, announced a pricing agreement for the \nGovernment purchase of Cipro in which Bayer would provide HHS with the \nfirst 100 million of Cipro at 95 cents per tablet. Look at that, when \nwe bargained with Bayer to reduce the price of Cipro, they cut it down \nto less than a fourth of what was being charged before this \nnegotiation.\n  The Government reserved the right to purchase an additional 100 \nmillion tablets at 85 cents and another 100 million at 75 cents. \nThrough negotiation, Secretary Thompson brought down the price of Cipro \nby 490 percent.\n  That same negotiating mechanism can and should be used on behalf of \nseniors in America to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and the \ncost to taxpayers. According to the Washington Times, after the deal \nwas struck, Secretary Thompson said at a press conference:\n\n       Everybody said I wouldn't be able to reduce the price of \n     Cipro. I'm a tough negotiator.\n\n  We should have let Secretary Thompson negotiate these prescription \ndrug prices on behalf of all Medicare beneficiaries, but the bill \nspecifically prohibits him from doing it.\n  I have introduced a bill called the Medicare Prescription Drug \nSavings Act, which instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto offer a nationwide Medicare-delivered prescription drug benefit in \naddition to the PDP and PPO plans available in the 10 regions and \nnegotiate repurchasing agreements on behalf of beneficiaries who choose \nto receive their drugs through the Medicare-administered benefits.\n  Beneficiaries who choose to enroll in the Medicare-administered \nbenefit can stay enrolled as long as they desire. Giving Medicare the \nauthority to negotiate is the right prescription for real savings on \ndrug prices. Not only will this bill provide seniors with lower cost \ndrugs, it will give them a choice to enroll in a Medicare-delivered \nplan, cutting down on the confusion that the privately delivered system \nhas already created.\n  Critics and the pharmaceutical industry would say my bill is price \ncontrols and big government. They are wrong. It is good old-fashioned \nfree market economics. If one buys in bulk, the price goes down. It is \nalso a benefit in the system that American seniors believe works. Let's \nmake this process\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\neasier and cheaper for seniors and the Federal Government as well by \nallowing seniors to receive their drugs through Medicare and \ninstructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate the \nbest price for seniors and America's taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10526-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

ROBERTS, JR., TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in the complex institutional framework \nestablished by our Founding Fathers, members of all three branches of \nour national government take an oath to support the Constitution. \nHowever, it falls uniquely to the Supreme Court of the United States to \nexpound and interpret the Constitution and the laws passed pursuant to \nit so that our governing law remains true to the basic principles upon \nwhich the Nation was founded.\n  The Senate's role in giving advice and consent to the nomination of \nthe men and women who serve on the Supreme Court for a life tenure is \namongst the Senate's most important constitutional responsibilities.\n  The argument is made by some that the President is entitled to the \nconfirmation of his or her nominee unless that person is shown to have \na serious disqualification. On the contrary, it is my view that the \nSenate's duty to advise and consent on nominations is an integral part \nof the Constitution's system of checks and balances among our \ninstitutions of government. Nomination does not constitute an \nentitlement to hold the office.\n  Although all Presidential nominations require the most careful and \nindependent review, judicial nominations differ from nominations to the \nexecutive branch in two important respects. Within the constitutional \nframework, the judiciary is a third coequal branch of government, \nindependent of both the executive and legislative branches. Those who \nsit on the Federal bench receive lifetime tenure and are to render \nindependent judicial decisions. In contrast, appointees to the \nexecutive branch are meant to carry out the program of the President \nwho nominates them, and they serve only at the pleasure of the \nPresident or for limited tenure. The bar must, therefore, be set very \nhigh when we consider a judicial nomination, especially when the \nnomination is to the Supreme Court and, as in the matter pending before \nthe Senate, to the position of Chief Justice of the United States.\n  While qualifications and intellect are important criteria, obviously, \nin considering a nomination to the Supreme Court, the Senate must also \ntake into consideration the judicial philosophy and constitutional \nvision of any nominee for appointment to the Supreme Court. As Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, for whom Roberts clerked, wrote in 1959, well before \nhe went on the Court:\n\n       [U]ntil the Senate restores its practice of thoroughly \n     informing itself on the judicial philosophy of a Supreme \n     Court nominee before voting to confirm him, it will have a \n     hard time convincing doubters that it could make effective \n     use of any additional part in the selection process.\n\n  Inquiring into a nominee's judicial philosophy does not mean \ndiscovering how he or she would decide specific cases. Rather, it seeks \nto ascertain the nominee's fundamental perspective on the Constitution: \nhow it protects our individual liberties, ensures equal protection of \nthe law, maintains the separation of powers and checks and balances. \nThe Constitution is a living document. Its strength lies in its \nextraordinary adaptability and applicability over more than 200 years \nto conditions that the Framers could not have anticipated or even \nimagined.\n  The confirmation process provided Judge Roberts with an opportunity \nto outline his general approach to the Constitution in critical areas--\namong them, the rights and liberties guaranteed to our citizens, the \nextent of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, and the balance \nof power among the three branches of government. Regrettably, he \ndeclined to do so, saying that he does not have an overarching judicial \nphilosophy and comparing the role of a Justice to that of an umpire. \nThe New York Times put it succinctly in an editorial:\n\n       In many important areas where Senators wanted to be \n     reassured that he would be a careful guardian of Americans' \n     rights, he refused to give any solid indication of his legal \n     approach.\n  The uncertainty arising from the hearings is compounded by the \nrefusal of the administration to provide documents from Judge Roberts' \nservice as principal Deputy Solicitor General, which members of the \nJudiciary Committee had requested in the course of carrying out their \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  As a result, we must try to infer his underlying philosophy and views \nfrom the earlier documents made available to the committee. Those \ndocuments are not reassuring. I am deeply concerned that the documents \nwe have from John Roberts raise questions about his approach and his \nthinking on such basic issues as voting rights, affirmative action, \nprivacy, racial and gender equality, limitation on executive authority, \nand congressional power under the commerce clause.\n  Given the importance of the position of Chief Justice, in deciding \nwhether to give consent to this nomination it is essential that it be \nan informed consent--an informed consent.\n  As the New York Times editorial pointed out:\n\n       That position is too important to entrust to an enigma, \n     which is what Mr. Roberts remains.\n\n  I will vote against confirming John Roberts to be the Chief Justice \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to share my concerns about the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who have taken the floor through the last \ncouple of days and have been eloquent I think on both sides of the \naisle in their views, that I really do believe that we are at a very \nunique point in time at our history, that we are at the tip of the \niceberg as it relates to the information age, and that this issue of \npersonal privacy is only going to gain in importance over the lifetime \nof the next nominee to the Supreme Court.\n  And that is why this discussion and debate is so important, and that \nis why a diversity of voices I think should be heard on this issue.\n  Now, I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee but I did spend 2 \nyears on the Judiciary Committee, and I made it clear in my time there \nthat I had the intention to ask every nominee about their views on the \nrights to privacy and how they existed in the Constitution and what \nthey thought was settled law as it relates to that and how they viewed \nsome of the important decisions of the Courts in the past.\n  And I think that you have to give a context to the day and age in \nwhich we are making this decision on a Supreme Court nominee and the \nnext nominee as it relates to these privacy rights.\n  We are at a time and age when individual citizens are concerned about \ntheir most personal information being obtained by businesses or health \ncare organizations and somehow being released. They are concerned about \ngovernment and government's overreaching in privacy matters and the use \nof technology that could be used without probable cause and warrant. We \nhave even seen discussion by courts\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\nand judges and a variety of people on the due process of enemy \ncombatants--even a judge in our State raised concerns about how you \nbalance protecting rights and security interests.\n  I know in Washington State these are among the key issues that the \ncitizenry of Washington State cares about. They care about their \npersonal privacy and they care about it being protected. They also care \nabout that personal privacy as it relates to a variety of rights that \nthey have come to expect.\n  In fact, in Washington State, a right of privacy is guaranteed in our \nConstitution. Article 1, section 7, which says--quote--``no person \nshall be disturbed in his private affairs or his home invaded without \nthe authority of law.'' We adopted this constitutional right of privacy \nupon the founding of our State and the deep respect that we have for \nthose individual rights.\n  It has been settled for decades by the courts of Washington State. \nWashington State law even goes further than the Federal Government in \nprotecting people's privacy in a search and seizure context, for \nexample. And I thinkit is very important to understand how much the \nState of Washington cares about these constitutional protections.\n  Now, as it relates specifically to a woman's right to choose, \nWashingtonians again have been very outspoken. In fact, in 1970, 3 \nyears before the Federal courts spoke on this matter, the residents of \nmy State passed a referendum legalizing abortion rights through the \nfirst trimester. That is in 1970. In 1991, the voters of my State \npassed by initiative a codification of Roe v. Wade into State statute.\n  I would hope that any nominee to the Supreme Court would understand \nhow important the privacy rights are in not just Washington State but \nthroughout the country and how challenged they are going to be in the \nnext decades as the information age rolls out and more and more issues \nconfront Americans about their privacy and the privacy of information \nabout them.\n  During my tenure on the Judiciary Committee, I heard many \nconservative nominees express views in opposition to abortion rights \nand some were very critical of the decision in Roe v. Wade. I did not \nagree with these views, but where those nominees demonstrated an \nunderstanding that privacy in the choice context is an accepted right, \nand that the Nation and the courts have determined that right should be \nupheld, I voted to confirm these judges.\n  Sixty-one percent of Americans said that they wanted Judge Roberts to \nanswer questions about how he would have ruled on past Supreme Court \nprecedent. And I know that more than a majority of Americans believe \nthat we should do our job in asking judicial nominees about their \njudicial philosophy.\n  But as my colleagues have pointed out, I have some concerns about \nJudge Roberts' views on the rights to privacy as it relates to how \nthose will continue to protect a woman's right to choose. And I am \nconcerned, as he talks about stare decisis exactly what he will uphold.\n  Now, I think a very important case that probably hasn't gotten a lot \nof attention on the floor but it is something that again Washingtonians \ncare a lot about is Judge Roberts' dissent in the Rancho Viejo case. \nJudge Roberts went out of his way in this dissent to raise issues about \nwhether Congress had overstepped its bound in enacting the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Courts have already decided this issue: Congress has the \nauthority to protect our most precious species without concern that \nthese efforts might be thrown out bit by bit. Judge Roberts has told us \nhow important longstanding precedent is in his philosophy, yet he \nquestions congress' longstanding authority to enact environmental \nprotections.\n  In the Northwest, we absolutely rely on a very robust interpretation \nof the interstate commerce clause, both in its environmental context \nand with regard to other laws. We have a great, wonderful environment \nin the Northwest that we want to protect. And just as with the privacy \ncontext, Judge Roberts was asked during the hearing about his views on \nCongress's power to enact environmental protections and he declined to \nanswer them specifically.\n  The Pacific Northwest is blessed with incredible beauty, complemented \nby the diverse wildlife that inhabits our lands and coastal waters. \nUnfortunately, habitat loss and other pressures threaten some of my \nState's most iconic species, whether that be the salmon that spawn our \ngreat rivers, birds that depend on old-growth forests, or even the orca \nwhale that holds a special plan in the heart of everyone who lives near \nthe Puget Sound. The Endangered Species Act is helping protect these \nanimals from extinction. I have concerns about what Judge Roberts says \nabout precedent yet in the case of the Endangered Species Act; his \nconcern for following precedent wasn't there.\n  I share the concerns of my colleagues who have been to the floor that \nwe want to know how Judge Roberts is going to make his philosophy about \nthe right to privacy clearer for the individuals who have to vote for \nhim. I am not clear what he considers the privacy rights in the \nConstitution that aren't enumerated. And I know that that may not be \nthe same opinion of our Members on the floor of the Senate, but I think \nWashingtonians have come to expect that these privacy rights mean a \ngreat deal to them.\n  And so I cannot vote to confirm Judge Roberts until I know more about \nhis philosophy. I am doing the job that I think the State of Washington \nwants me to do in fighting for these protections that have been \nconstitutionally guaranteed, that have been voted on by initiative of \nthe people in our State, and for the great protection of those privacy \nrights that they know need to be protected in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/27/senate-section/article/S10527-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
