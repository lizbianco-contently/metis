Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for taking \nthe parliamentary steps that are going to permit us to consider some \nemergency help and assistance for New Orleans and the gulf area, in the \narea of education in particular. We are going to have more to say about \nthat in a very short period of time. We want our friends there to know \nhelp really is on the way, particularly in the areas of education and \nhealth.\n  On Friday, 13 of my colleagues and I visited the stricken city of New \nOrleans and the gulf coast to see Katrina's devastation firsthand and \nhear from the affected residents. Like so many millions of Americans, I \nhave been moved by the news coverage of Katrina and her brutal \naftermath for the past 3 weeks. But nothing I have seen on television, \nnothing I have read in the newspapers, and nothing I have heard from \nthe survivors we have embraced in Massachusetts could prepare me for \nthe staggering scope of the devastation when witnessed firsthand.\n  The destruction is massive in its scope. In many areas, the \ndestruction is total. Much of New Orleans is a ghost town. Troops and \npolice patrol eerily quiet streets. The desolation is frighteningly \nreal.\n  At least 40 percent of New Orleans was devastated by the calamity. We \ncould see the high water marks on buildings, far above our heads. \nDebris is strewn everywhere. Massive amounts of muck, black as ink and \nringed with the rainbow swirls of oil and chemicals, cover everything.\n  For so many of our fellow citizens--from New Orleans and throughout \nthe gulf region--there is nothing to return to. In Mississippi, entire \ncommunities are completely gone. All that is left of entire blocks is \nthe concrete slabs where families once lived. Even the old oaks that \ngraced Mississippi's historic shoreline for generations could not \nwithstand Katrina's wrath.\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\n  Survivors' stories are heartwrenching. Three babies died at the New \nOrleans convention center from heat exhaustion. A first responder at \nthe convention center found he was the only doctor for 10,000 people. \nDozens of elderly residents died of heat stroke or kidney failure. One \nwoman waded through the floodwaters to Charity Hospital, floating her \nhusband's body alongside her on a door.\n  In Pass Christian, MS, the police heroically stayed behind and braved \nthe storm to rescue as many people as they could. Finally, as the flood \nwaters were rising, they saved themselves by climbing onto the roof of \nthe police station and watched their cruiser below tossed by the \nsurging tide.\n  Rescue workers we spoke with there found some 80 bodies--many in the \nattics of their homes, dead after desperately trying to claw their way \nthrough the roof to survival. Scratch marks were visible on the \nrooftops.\n  The city's mayor is still missing. But the city attorney has been \nnamed acting mayor and has stepped up as a leader with determination \nand compassion, helping people recover and rebuild their lives.\n  So much has been destroyed. But the spirit of the people we met \nremains strong. Like Job of the Old Testament, these people have had \neverything they own and cherish torn from their grasp. But they are \ndetermined to recover and rebuild their lives. They still have hope--\nand we must do all we can to help them.\n  I was inspired by the heroism of the relief workers, the military, \nthe churches, neighbors, friends, strangers--all coming together to \nsupport those in need--truly America at its best. Those we met on \nFriday were physically and emotionally exhausted. There still does not \nseem to be enough time each day to help all those who need our aid--not \nenough energy to heal the many broken hearts. Relief workers have \nsuffered broken bones, sprained ankles, sunburns, dehydration, and \ninfections from the contaminated floodwaters.\n  But they press on, for they know there is so much remaining to be \ndone. Those we met have an unyielding determination to rebuild that \ntreasured region and rejuvenate its unique spirit. The work they do \nevery minute, every hour, every day since Katrina struck, helps us \nall--our whole American family. They need to know that we are \nlistening, and that we hear their concerns. We will not ignore them or \nput them aside. They deserve our leadership and our support, and we \nmust prove to them that we are equal to the task.\n  My wife Vicki and her family hail from the New Orleans area, and \nVicki lived several years in the city. Her family's deep roots there \nlend a special perspective to our concerns about the many affected by \nthis terrible storm. Such a treasured and vibrant part of our Nation \ndeserves nothing less than our best efforts as Senators to help it \nrebuild better than ever.\n  States across the country are responding, and I am proud of \nMassachusetts's efforts. Almost 500 Army and Air National Guard \nsoldiers and airmen from our State have been sent to provide direct \nsupport to the hurricane victims as part of Operation Helping Hand. \nThey are performing functions as diverse as security, command and \ncontrol, law enforcement, communications, medical care, including \nmental health care, and spiritual guidance. The Massachusetts Guard has \nalso activated an additional 150 persons for indirect support, staffing \nthe joint operations center and helping with logistics and airlifts. We \nhave shipped more than 200 tons of cargo using 17 aircraft, including \nhumvees, trucks, trailers, generators, a field ambulance, meals ready \nto eat, water, cots, tents, and medical supplies.\n  There are almost 200 evacuees now living at Camp Edwards on Otis Air \nForce Base on Cape Cod. We have enrolled them in health care plans, \nhelped children find their parents, offered mental health counseling, \nand enabled those who qualify for veterans benefits and Social Security \nbenefits to continue to receive them without interruption or delay--\nanything to make them feel welcome and at home.\n  For the evacuees who express interest in staying in Massachusetts, we \nare working with local housing authorities to have them placed in our \ntowns, and the Black Ministerial Alliance has welcomed them into our \ncongregations. FEMA will pay for plane tickets anywhere in the United \nStates to reunite the evacuees with their family and friends.\n  Finding employment for evacuees and schooling for their children are \ntop priorities, and Massachusetts businesses and schools are eagerly \nlending a hand. Some have already found employment, and a job fair at \nthe base has helped others.\n  Massachusetts colleges have been eager to pitch in as well. Sixty \npublic, private, and community colleges have enrolled over 1,000 \ndisplaced students and offered to assist them with financial aid. \nDisplaced undergraduates will be able to attend public colleges and \nuniversities tuition-free. And many campuses have offered to expedite \nadmission, waive fees, and help secure housing. UMass Amherst has \nalready enrolled more than a dozen undergraduate students and is \nhousing them in local hotels until more permanent housing is secured. \nBoston University has accepted 321 displaced students. Boston College \nhas accepted 150 students from Loyola and Tulane. Amherst is taking in \nstudents from Xavier and Tulane. Amherst and Williams College have \ninvited faculty from Xavier to join their campuses for the semester.\n  Katherine Barnett, a graduate student from Tulane, is now attending \nBoston University. ``I didn't think attending BU was going to be an \noption, but everyone there has been totally great,'' she said.\n  When the tsunami struck Indonesia in December, and when earthquakes \ndevastated Armenia, EI Salvador, and Iran, the courageous team of \nhealth professionals from Massachusetts General Hospital was always \namong the first to respond. The team's response to Katrina is no \ndifferent. Dr. Susan Briggs from Massachusetts General is leading the \neffort. She told me progress is being made with the team's two mobile \nclinics, and they are reaching those in more remote areas. But in New \nOrleans, they are discovering many new storm-related medical needs as \npeople begin to return to the city.\n  Three medical teams from Boston and one team from Worcester have been \non the scene since the earliest hours of the disaster, and they have \nkept up a steady pace. Additional truckloads of medical supplies left \nMassachusetts at 5 o'clock this morning for the gulf.\n  I talked with a wonderful doctor at Mass General, Dr. Larry Bronner. \nHe talked about calling up Broderick Chevrolet and saying they needed \nthree big trucks for transport. The founder of that automobile \ndistributorship said:\n\n       You tell us where you want the trucks and when you want the \n     trucks; you've got the trucks.\n\n  That is typical of the kind of reaction across the board in my State, \nand I know in many others.\n  Now they are involved in a 35-hour trip down to New Orleans, even as \nwe talk this afternoon.\n  As we traveled in New Orleans and Mississippi, I was heartened by the \nspirit of determination to overcome this disaster and improve the lives \nof those most affected. I saw it on the faces of those who stayed \nbehind to help with rescue and relief efforts, just as I have seen it \nin the faces of those who have had to leave all they know and go to \nsafe havens across the country. It is the same spirit of determination \nthat will carry them down the long road to rebuilding.\n  The residents of the gulf region and New Orleans take pride in their \ncities and towns. They want to lead the way in reviving their own \ncommunities. That should not be ignored.\n  First and foremost, this means we cannot have big businesses and \noutside contractors taking over the process of rebuilding. Local \nbusinesses, big and small, should get the lion's share of the work. And \nlocal people should get the lion's share of the jobs.\n  The businesses and residents of New Orleans should rebuild New \nOrleans. Bay St. Louis should rebuild Bay St. Louis. Their communities \nshould rebuild their communities. Pass Christian should rebuild Pass \nChristian, and we should be there to help.\n  Community leaders I spoke with in New Orleans mentioned the 9/11 \nfamilies and their ability to band together as a voice for change, \nsuccessfully pressuring the White House and Congress\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\nto form the independent 9/11 commission. Katrina survivors, they told \nme, don't need veto power over every proposal to rebuild their region, \nthey just need a voice in the rebuilding of their own communities.\n  There has been much discussion of the economic despair of those who \nwere stranded in New Orleans and other areas, because they did not have \nthe resources to escape the storm and flood. An enormous tragedy has \nafflicted a forgotten segment of our society, and it shames us all that \nin a country as rich as ours, we were not able to provide for the \nsafety and security of all our citizens, but allowed race and class to \ndevastate them.\n  Our collective effort for rebuilding and reconstruction is an \nopportunity to make amends for decades of neglect, and genuinely \naddress the needs of those most direly affected by this disaster.\n  Estimates of the Federal Government's investment in this rebuilding \neffort are now as high as $200 billion. We must be certain that these \nfunds go to the rebuilding of the new Gulf Coast and not to the \naccounts of the biggest contractors with the best political \nconnections. The enormous job of rebuilding New Orleans and the gulf \ncoast must be done right.\n  The national government can help most by seeking to develop a common \nplan for the redevelopment of the region. We should have a commission \non which everyone has a say--mayors, governors, community leaders, \nbusiness leaders, citizens, the Federal Government--everyone. There \nshould be hearings throughout the area to listen to the people's views \nof the kind of future they want. We should listen to the people of New \nOrleans on how they wish to revive the vitality of that special city. \nWe should involve the best flood control engineers, the best community \nand urban development specialists, the best city planners, the best of \neverything. Redevelopment should not be determined by the biggest most \npowerful contractors. We need to work from a shared vision for the \nfuture in which we all do our part to build the new gulf coast.\n  I commend President Bush for making the rebuilding of this damaged \nregion a high priority for the Federal Government, and I believe a \ncommission would give all of us the plan we need to get the job done \nright.\n  We must cultivate and promote public-private partnerships that are so \nimportant to successful community redevelopment. Already, many \norganizations are setting about the business of rebuilding in the gulf \ncoast region. Private companies such as Starwood Hotels and Resorts in \nNew Orleans have already set a re-opening date of November 1, and local \nsmall business owners are beginning to set up shop again. National and \nlocal philanthropic organizations such as the Baton Rouge Area \nFoundation are beginning to examine the long-term housing needs of the \narea. National efforts such as those of ACORN are underway to organize \nresidents who have been displaced and given them a fair voice and fair \nrepresentation in the process.\n  All of these groups and many others are key partners in the Federal, \nState, and local efforts to rebuild the gulf coast communities \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina.\n  It is essential, too, for contracts for rebuilding to include \ntraining for local people to do the jobs. That means training local \nresidents for debris removal, environmental clean-up, construction \ntrades and other skills necessary to get the region back on its feet.\n  Billions of Federal dollars will be devoted to the effort. We must \nmake sure that it is the residents of the region that benefit through \njobs and training.\n  We must give urgent attention to the few hospitals and clinics that \nare still operating, but they are working with reduced staff and few \nresources. Many, like East Jefferson General Hospital in the New \nOrleans area, do not have the resources to remain open much longer \nwithout government help.\n  We should also give urgent attention to schools, to help that few \nthat can reopen to do so, and to build new ones that can become the \nanchors for new communities.\n  We must also make sure that we rebuild in a thoughtful way, drawing \non the many lessons that we have learned from this disaster and other \nefforts at community building.\n  We need to build water control systems that will be able to withstand \ngiant hurricanes and floods in the future. We need to rebuild roads and \nsewers and power lines and whole public transportation systems. We need \nto restore the ecological resources of the region.\n  The rebuilding process should not merely involve reproducing \nstructures and systems in the way that they existed before the \nhurricane and flood. The people of the region have an opportunity to \ncreate better water control systems to ensure that this does not happen \nagain. They have a chance to improve schools and rely on technologies \nnecessary in the new economy. They have a chance to build the gulf \neconomy of the future--and in doing so to improve the entire Nation's \neconomic destiny. They have a chance to build a new economy that works \nfor everyone--with diverse housing and more job opportunities.\n  This new economy will of course still include a vibrant tourism \nindustry, and there will continue to be jobs for the many service \nworkers who call New Orleans home. A local union representative \nstressed to me that New Orleans can't just be a city in which only \nmillionaires can afford to live.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Department of Labor in Washington has \ntaken harmful steps that will hurt the effort to revive the region. \nThey have said that the big outside contractors moving into the area \ncan pay construction workers sub-standard wages. These workers have \nlost everything, and they are desperate to rebuild their homes and \ntheir lives and their communities. Yet now these giant contractors can \ncome in from outside and deny fair wages.\n  We are talking about $8-, $9- and $10-an-hour wages. That is what the \nprevailing wage is for basic construction trades in Mississippi, \nAlabama, and Louisiana. That doesn't sound like exorbitant wages for \nworkers who are putting in a hard day's work. It sounds like fair wages \nto me--rather than bringing in outside workers who are going to work \nfor depressed wages--not even the minimum wage.\n  This is important.\n  The Department of Labor also says these big contractors don't have to \nreach out to minority workers. The greatest devastation is for the \npoor, poor white and poor black, and we want to make sure that those \nworkers--white and black--are going to have opportunities. But the idea \nthat they are waiving all requirements to try to include local \nparticipation does not make sense.\n  Yet more than 40 percent of the people of New Orleans are African-\nAmericans. They represent a vast share of the people in the shelters \nwho are left with nothing. How can the Labor Department say that these \noutside contractors can come into Louisiana and Mississippi and thumb \ntheir nose at African-American workers there?\n  That, too, is gravely wrong. In his speech to the Nation last \nThursday, President Bush acknowledged that we must address the legacy \nof poverty as we rebuild. But authorizing substandard wages and turning \nour back on minority workers is not the way to meet that goal.\n  We have the ability in Congress to help New Orleans and the gulf \ncoast area to rebuild themselves better than ever. All we need is the \nwill to do it. I have talked with my colleagues from the region in \ntheir offices and I listened to them on Friday as we saw the storm-\nravaged areas. Senators Landrieu, Vitter, Lott, Cochran, Sessions, and \nShelby are determined to get the gulf coast back up on its feet, and I \nhave appreciated the opportunity to discuss this with them.\n  I appreciate, also, the leadership that Senator Enzi has provided on \nthis issue as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. Under his leadership, we introduced a strong bipartisan \nrelief measure on education that should be before the Senate very soon. \nAnd we hope to have measures to meet the health and employment needs \nvery soon.\n  Senator Landrieu in particular has been an inspiration to us all. She \nwas tireless in her efforts to expedite the Federal response to the \nhurricane and is extraordinary in her resolve to help New Orleans \nrecover. Her strength is a comfort to her constituents--and to the \nNation.\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\n  Senator Frist, our leader, deserves praise as he returned briefly to \nhis earlier career as Dr. Frist. I truly admire his courageous efforts \nto provide medical care in the early days at the makeshift hospital at \nthe New Orleans airport.\n  Friday was not a one-time visit; it was just one day, but it will be \na day I will not forget. We will not simply move on to a new issue \ntomorrow. This wound in our Nation runs deep, and our response must be \nequal to the task. The hurricane destroyed communities, but it did not \nand could not destroy their spirit. They will rebuild, and we will help \nthem to the very best of our ability, because in the end, we are one \nNaion, one people, one family. It is in this way that we can best tap \nthe true wealth of Nation. We must get it right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

ROBERTS, JR.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe confirmation of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, no vote cast by a Senator in this body is more \nimportant than a vote cast on the confirmation of a Supreme Court \nJustice, with the exception of a declaration of war, or a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force.\n  The confirmation process for Chief Justice is obviously somewhat more \nimportant than that for Associate Justice. It is even more important in \nthe context of Judge Roberts who is 50 years old and has the potential \nto serve for decades in that very key position, as the second youngest \nChief Justice in the history of the country and the 17th Chief Justice \nin our Nation's history.\n  Judge Roberts comes to this position with an extraordinary academic \nrecord--3-year graduate of Harvard College summa cum laude, magna cum \nlaude in the Harvard Law School, and an illustrious career in private \npractice and government service. He argued some 39 cases before the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  We have examined some 76,000 documents. We have looked at his \nparticipation in some 327 cases in the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, where he was confirmed by the Senate 2 \nyears ago by unanimous consent. We have seen his briefs in the \nSolicitor General's Office, and we have heard some 31 witnesses \nregarding his nomination. These included a witness from the American \nBar Association, which rated him unanimously well qualified, the \nhighest recommendation possible. The remaining thirty witnesses, who \nwere chosen equally by the Democrats and the Republicans, testified at \nlength about Judge Roberts' career. We know a great deal about Judge \nRoberts.\n\n  Based on all of these proceedings, including 17 hours of testimony \nbefore the committee, it is my judgment he is well qualified to be \nChief Justice of the United States. I intend to vote aye when his \nnomination is called before the Senate.\n  He has taken a position that a judge should be modest and should look \nfor stability in the law. On a number of occasions in his testimony \nbefore the committee, he emphasized the point that judges are not \npoliticians and that judges ought not inject their own personal views \ninto the law.\n  He commented about the flexibility of the law, saying that principles \nsuch as equal protection and due process were meant to last through the \nages and have a flexible quality. He said, ``They [referring to the \nframers] were crafting a document that they intended to apply in a \nmeaningful way down through the ages.''\n  While he would not accept the specific language of Justice John \nMarshall Harlan II that the Constitution is a living thing, he did \ntestify that the language of liberty and due process has broad meaning \nas applied to evolving societal conditions.\n  He talked very directly when questioned about the right of privacy. \nHe said that Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right of \nprivacy, was correctly decided. That case overturned the state law \nprohibiting the use of contraceptives for married people. He also said \nthe holding of Griswold would apply to single people as well as to \nmarried people under the Eisenstadt decision.\n  When it came to the critical question of Roe v. Wade, I did not ask \nhim whether he would affirm or reject the Roe doctrine. I did not do so \nbecause I believe it is inappropriate to ask a nominee how he would \ndecide a specific case.\n  As chairman, it was my view that any member could ask the nominee any \nquestion that the member chose to, and the nominee would be free to \nrespond as he chose. Beyond refraining from specifically asking whether \nhe would affirm or overrule Roe v. Wade, others and I questioned him \nextensively about the import of stare decisis, the Latin term meaning \n``let the decision stand.'' He emphasized that stare decisis was a very \nimportant principle in the law and that even where a justice might \nconsider Roe wrongly decided, it takes more to overturn a precedent \nthan simply to conclude it was wrongly decided initially. Because--and \nthis is Arlen Specter speaking, not Judge Roberts--where the case has \nstood for some 32 years and has been reaffirmed most emphatically in \nCasey v. Planned Parenthood, it has become, as some have called it, a \nsuper precedent.\n  I then made the point that the Supreme Court had taken up the issue \nso that Roe could have been reversed, overruled on some 38 occasions. \nShould it come before the Court again, perhaps the balance of the 38 \ncases would make super-duper precedent to uphold Roe.\n  The question remains as to how he will rule. Nobody knows that for \ncertain.\n  The one rule that seems to be the most prevalent one is the one of \nsurprise. He testified extensively about his concern for civil rights. \nHe talked about affirmative action. He agreed with Justice O'Connor \nthat the impact of the people in the practical everyday world was of \nconsiderable importance. I questioned him about his participation in \nthe case of Romer v. Evans, where he lent some counsel to the lawyers \nwho were arguing the case involving gay rights and he participated in \nsupport of gay rights.\n  His partner at Hogan and Hartson, Walter Smith, had this to say about \nJudge Roberts' participation in that case. Mr. Smith said that ``every \ngood lawyer knows that if there is something in his client's cause that \nso personally offends you morally, ligiously, or if it so offends you \nthat you think it would undermine your ability to do your duty as a \nlawyer, then you shouldn't take it on, and John wouldn't have. So at a \nminimum he had no concerns that would rise to that level.''\n  I then asked Judge Roberts if he agreed with Mr. Smith's analysis and \nif he would have refrained from helping in that situation, and he said: \n``I think it's right that if it had been something morally \nobjectionable, I suppose I would have.''\n  His support of gay rights is not an insignificant consideration in \nour evaluation of his views of civil rights.\n  Judge Roberts made quite a point of contending that he had answered \nmore\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\nquestions than most, and I think to some extent he did. He articulated \nthe standard that he would answer the questions unless the case was \nlikely to come before the Court. Some of his predecessors have refused \nto answer any questions at all.\n  As I have said, from time to time, when Justice Scalia appeared \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, he wouldn't answer much. Even prisoners \nof war are compelled to give their name, rank, and serial number; Judge \nScalia would only give his name and rank. He wouldn't give his serial \nnumber. I say that in a metaphor. Justice Scalia would not say if he \nwould uphold Marbury v. Madison, which is an 1803 decision establishing \nthe supremacy of the Supreme Court, the duty of the Supreme Court, and \nthe responsibility and authority of the Court to interpret the \nConstitution.\n  Judge Roberts did comment on Griswold and Eisenstadt and quite a \nnumber of specific cases as he went along. There were some cases where \nhe would not answer where I candidly thought he should have answered, \nbut my rule is that the Senator asks the questions, the nominee \nresponds, and it is a political judgment as to whether the nominee has \nresponded sufficiently to warrant or merit confirmation or the \nSenator's vote.\n\n  For some time now, I have expressed my concern, a concern which was \nshared by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, who now \noccupies the chair of the Presiding Officer. Senator DeWine raised a \nline of questions, as I did. I raised a question about the case of \nUnited States v. Morrison where the Supreme Court declared part of the \nlegislation unconstitutional, legislation designed to protect women \nagainst violence. I pointed to the very extensive record on surveys in \n21 days and 8 separate reports. The Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, \ndetermined that the legislative record was insufficient, but it seemed \nto me that it was probably the case that the record was more than \nsufficient. This is what I consider to be an encroachment on \ncongressional authority. The majority opinion, after reviewing that \nrecord, said it was insufficient because they disagreed with the \ncongressional ``method of reasoning.''\n  The question I have about that is, Who are they--the Supreme Court \nJustices--to say that their ``method of reasoning,'' is superior to \nours? What happens when you leave the columns of the Senate, which are \ndirectly aligned with the columns of the Supreme Court, and walk across \nthe green? Is there some superiority of competency there? The dissent \npointed out that the majority opinion was saying that there was some \nsort of unique judicial competence on the method of reasoning. The \ninference there is that there is some congressional incompetence. I \nreject that. And I believe the Constitutional separation of powers \nrejects that.\n  Where there is an expansive record, as we had in United States v. \nMorrison, it ought to have been upheld. It is a derogation of \ncongressional authority and insulting to question our method of \nreasoning.\n  I asked him about the two cases where the Supreme Court interpreted \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act 3 years apart, 2001 and 2004. In \nGarrett v. Alabama, by a 5-to-4 decision, the Court ruled \nunconstitutional the part of the Americans with Disabilities Act which \nprotected against discrimination in employment; and then, 3 years \nlater, in Tennessee v. Lane, again by a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court \nupheld the application of the section of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act concerning access to public accommodations for a \nparaplegic who had to crawl up the steps to get to a courtroom. The \nrecords were identical as to both of the sections in the same act. You \nhad the same voluminous record presented.\n  In dissent, in the Lane case, Justice Scalia called it a ``flabby \ntest.'' He said that where the Court has used a standard of what they \ncalled ``congruence and proportionality,'' that it was ill-advised. \nJustice Scalia said the Court was really making itself the taskmaster \nof the Congress and, in effect, treating us like schoolchildren.\n  Now, where did this test, ``congruence and proportionality,'' come \nfrom? It came out of thin air. In 1997, in the Boerne case where the \nCourt declared the Religious Restoration Act unconstitutional, they \ncame up with this test which has not a scintilla of objective meaning. \nHow can the Congress figure out what it is that the Supreme Court has \nin mind? They go 5 to 4 on one title of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and 5 to 4 the other way on another title of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. Frankly, I thought the committee and the Senate were \nentitled to answers on those questions, but Judge Roberts declined to \nanswer.\n  That is a work in process. We are not putting that one down. There \nare some things which the Congress can do about that to assert \ncongressional power, and it will be pursued.\n  On the issue of Judge Roberts being Chief Justice, it is an \nintriguing prospect for a man of 50 to take over the Court where Judge \nStevens is 35 years his senior; Justice Scalia is 18 years his senior; \neven Justice Thomas, the youngest of those on the Court at the moment, \nis 7 years his senior. I asked Judge Roberts about that, both in the \ninformal session in my office and in the Senate hearing. He described \nhis work as being an advocate before the Court as a ``dialogue among \nequals.'' I thought that was a fascinating evaluation.\n\n  In the Supreme Court--and I have had occasion to be there three \ntimes--a lawyer stands on one level, and the Court is on a higher \nlevel. I do not exactly perceive it personally as a dialogue among \nequals, but I consider it fascinating that he did. Perhaps when you \nhave been there 39 times, the level of inequality levels out. But he \nhas an opportunity, from his vantage point, knowing the Justices, as he \ndoes, having been there so long, and having been a clerk for Justice \nRehnquist when he was an Associate Justice back in 1980, to do \nsomething about these 5-to-4 decisions.\n  There was a discussion about what Chief Justice Earl Warren did in \nbringing the Court together. When he was appointed Chief Justice in \n1953, he molded a unanimous opinion in Brown V. Board of Education--if \nnot the most important case in the Court's history certainly one of the \nmost important cases, and one of the most contentious cases.\n  However today we see a plethora of 5-to-4 decisions--a recent case \ninvolving the Americans with Disabilities Act being one illustration, \nbut there are many others; you had the Ten Commandments cases this year \nwhere the Court said it was OK for the State of Texas to have the Ten \nCommandments on a tower but unconstitutional for Kentucky to display \nthe Ten Commandments indoors, in two decisions whose results absolutely \ndefy logic or are inexplicable.\n  I have also been troubled by the modern tendency to have so many \nconcurrences and dissents. Before the Judiciary Committee held hearings \nregarding the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, I read three Supreme Court \nopinions from June of 2004. They were a maze of confusion as you tried \nto work your way through them. One was a plurality opinion. Only four \nJustices could agree. They did not have the opinion of the Court, and \nthe other cases were replete with multiple opinions as well.\n  Currently you have a situation where Justice A will write a \nconcurring opinion, joined by Justice B; and then Justice B will write \na concurring opinion, joined by Justice A and Justice C. You wonder, \nwhy so many opinions? Judge Roberts commented and testified he thought \nthat was a matter the entire Court should work on, and certainly one he \nwould pledge to work on himself.\n  The subtle ``minuet'' of the confirmation hearings for Judge Roberts \nturned bombastic and contentious at times, but he always kept his cool \nand responded within reasonable parameters. The Judiciary Committee and \nthe full Senate cannot be guarantors that Judge Roberts will fulfill \nour's or anyone's expectations. The Court's history is full of Justices \nwho have surprised or disappointed their appointers or inquisitors. But \nthe process has been full, fair, and dignified.\n  I think Judge Roberts went about as far as he could go in answering \nthe questions and declining to answer questions on cases likely to come \nbefore the Supreme Court. When you consider all of the factors--his \nacademic record, his professional record, his record on the court of \nappeals, the witnesses who testified who have known him intimately--it \nis my judgment he is well\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\nqualified and should be confirmed as the next Chief Justice of the \nUnited States, the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. When the \nroll is called, I intend to vote yea.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my statement be \nincluded in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Floor Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on the Nomination of Judge \n         John Roberts To Be Chief Justice of the United States\n\n       After listening to Judge John Roberts testify for nearly 17 \n     hours and then hearing from 31 witnesses, some for and some \n     against his nomination, I have decided to vote to confirm him \n     to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n       Except for a declaration of war or its virtual equivalent, \n     a resolution for the use of force, no Senate vote is more \n     important than the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice; \n     and this vote has special significance because it is for \n     Chief Justice and the nominee is only 50 years old with the \n     obvious potential to serve for decades.\n       Judge Roberts comes to the committee with impeccable \n     credentials. He was graduated summa cum laude from Harvard \n     College in only 3 years, and magna cum laude from the Harvard \n     Law School. Following his graduation from law school, Roberts \n     obtained prestigious clerkships with Judge Henry Friendly of \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then \n     Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist.\n       Judge Roberts subsequently embarked on a distinguished \n     career in public service, serving as an Associate White House \n     Counsel in the Reagan administration and Principal Deputy \n     Solicitor General in the George H.W. Bush administration. \n     While in the Solicitor General's Office and then in private \n     practice with the firm of Hogan & Hartson, Judge Roberts \n     argued 39 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, earning a \n     reputation as one of the finest appellate advocates in the \n     Nation.\n       When Judge Roberts was appointed to his current position on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, he earned the \n     highest rating from the American Bar Association and enjoyed \n     broad bipartisan support in being confirmed by unanimous \n     consent.\n       A threshold question, beyond his academic and professional \n     qualifications is how a man at 50 from outside the Court can \n     effectively function as Chief Justice. His previous clerkship \n     on the Court and the 39 cases he has argued there give him an \n     intimacy with the Court that few outsiders enjoy. He knows \n     the Court and the other Justices know him. Concerned about \n     his relative youth, I questioned Judge Roberts about how he \n     would feel becoming Chief Justice of a Court where one member \n     was 35 years his senior, and the next youngest, still some 7 \n     years older. Judge Roberts' answer impressed me. He said \n     that, while in private practice, he approached his arguments \n     before the Court as a ``dialogue of equals.'' When he viewed \n     oral arguments in that light, considering himself to be their \n     equal, he projected the kind of confidence that he would be \n     comfortable and consider himself up to the job of Chief, who \n     is the ``first among equals.''\n       I also questioned him about the role the Chief Justice \n     should play in bringing about consensus on the Court. I have \n     been troubled by the numerous 5 to 4 decisions and the \n     proliferation of concurrences and plurality opinions that \n     often leave lower courts, lawyers, and litigants wondering \n     about what the Court actually held. I therefore asked:\n       ``Judge Roberts, let me [ask about] the ability which you \n     would have, if confirmed as Chief Justice, to try to bring a \n     consensus to the Court. You commented yesterday about what \n     Chief Justice Warren did on Brown v. Board of Education, \n     taking a very disparate Court and pulling the Court together. \n     As you and I discussed in my office, there are an \n     overwhelming number of cases where there are multiple \n     concurrences. A writes a concurring opinion in which B joins; \n     then B writes a concurring opinion in which A joins and C \n     joins. In reading the trilogy of cases on detainees from June \n     of 2004 to figure out what we ought to do about Guantanamo, \n     it was a patchwork of confusion. I was intrigued by the \n     comment which you made in our meeting about a dialogue among \n     equals, and you characterized that as a dialogue among equals \n     when you appear before the Court, and they are on a little \n     different level over there. Tell us what you think you can do \n     on this dialogue among equals to try to bring some consensus \n     to the Court to try to avoid this proliferation of opinions \n     and avoid all these 5-4 decisions. . . .''\n       Judge Roberts responded:\n       ``I . . . think . . . it's a responsibility of all of the \n     Justices, not just the Chief Justice, to try to work toward \n     an opinion of the Court. The Supreme Court speaks only as a \n     Court. Individually, the Justices have no authority. And I do \n     think it should be a priority to have an opinion of the \n     Court. You don't obviously compromise strongly-held views, \n     but you do have to be open to the considered views of your \n     colleagues, particularly when it gets to a concurring \n     opinion. I do think you do need to ask yourself, what benefit \n     is this serving? Why is it necessary for me to state this \n     separate reason? Can I go take another look at what the four \n     of them think or the three of them think to see if I can \n     subscribe to that or get them to modify it in a way that \n     would allow me to subscribe to that, because an important \n     function of the Supreme Court is to provide guidance. . . . I \n     do think the Chief Justice has a particular obligation to try \n     to achieve consensus consistent with everyone's individual \n     oath to uphold the Constitution, and that would certainly be \n     a priority for me if I were confirmed.''\n\n\n                  Specter Questioning, Sept. 14, 2005\n\n       Given the unusual combination of his qualifications and \n     experience, including extensive personal contact with the \n     other justices, he has the unique potential to bring \n     consensus to the Court and to reduce the numerous repetitious \n     and confusing opinions.\n       The Judiciary Committee conducted a thorough and fair \n     confirmation hearing for Judge Roberts. He answered questions \n     before the committee for nearly 17 hours. Committee members, \n     both Democrats and Republicans, stated the hearings were \n     conducted in a fair manner with ample time for questions. \n     Although historically the majority party reserves more \n     witnesses for itself than it grants to the minority party, I \n     made the decision to break with precedent and divide the \n     number of witnesses evenly between the parties--1 neutral \n     witness from the ABA, 15 witnesses chosen by the majority, \n     and 15 witnesses chosen by the minority. This testimony, \n     combined with Judge Roberts's extensive record--76,000 pages \n     of documents from his service in the Reagan and Bush \n     administrations, 327 cases decided by Judge Roberts while on \n     the D.C. Circuit, thousands of pages of legal briefs from \n     Judge Roberts's service in the Solicitor General's Office and \n     in private practice, and dozens of articles and interviews by \n     Judge Roberts--provided the committee and now the full Senate \n     ample basis to evaluate Judge Roberts's qualifications to \n     serve as Chief Justice of the United States.\n       During his hearing, Judge Roberts addressed a wide variety \n     of subjects. On the key issue of whether the Constitution is \n     a static document or one which has the flexibility to adapt \n     to changing times, he said ``they (the framers) were crafting \n     a document that they intended to apply in a meaningful way \n     down the ages.'' While he would not accept Justice Harlan's \n     language of a ``living thing,'' he testified that the \n     language of ``liberty'' and ``due process'' have broad \n     meaning as applied to evolving societal conditions.\n       At the same time, however, he did not answer all the \n     questions I would have liked him to respond to. I questioned \n     Judge Roberts closely about his views with respect to \n     congressional authority to remedy discrimination under the \n     14th amendment. I asked him how the Supreme Court could \n     possibly have struck down the private remedy the Congress \n     created in the Violence Against Women Act in view of the \n     extensive congressional record, which--\n     ``showed that there were reporters on gender bias from the \n     task force in 21 States and eight separate reports issued by \n     Congress and its committees over a long course of time . . . \n     there was a mountain of evidence.''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       In light of that record, I asked:\n       ``What more does the Congress have to do to establish a \n     record that will be respected by the Court? . . . Isn't that \n     record palpably sufficient to sustain the constitutionality \n     of the Act?''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       Judge Roberts, however, declined to comment, explaining \n     that ``. . . I don't want to comment on the correctness or \n     incorrectness of a particular decision.''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       Although I pushed him to answer my question, observing that \n     the case was long over, and the specific facts unlikely to \n     come before the Court again, Judge Roberts declined to answer \n     because of his view that:\n     ``the particular question you ask about the adequacy of \n     findings . . . is likely to come before the Court again. And \n     expressing an opinion on whether the Morrison case was \n     correct or incorrect would be prejudging those cases that are \n     likely to come before the Court again.''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       In fact, the most Judge Roberts would say is that:\n     ``the appropriate role of a judge is a limited role and that \n     you do not make the law, and that it seems to me that one of \n     the warning flags that should suggest to you as a judge that \n     you may be beginning to transgress into the area of making a \n     law is when you are in a position of re-evaluating \n     legislative findings, because that doesn't look like a \n     judicial function. It's not an application of analysis under \n     the Constitution. It's just another look at findings.''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       On the very important question of conflict between the \n     Congress and the Supreme Court, I was dissatisfied with his \n     responses on the Court's derogation of Congress' ``method of \n     reasoning'' and the Court's recent improvisation of the \n     meaningless ``congruence and proportionality'' standard. In \n     discussing the Americans with Disabilities\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\n     Act, I pointed out to him the problem of the Court issuing 5 \n     to 4 decisions in two cases with identical records going \n     entirely opposite ways within 3 years. With respect to the \n     Garrett case, where Ms. Garrett, who had breast cancer, \n     sought relief under the ADA for employment discrimination, I \n     explained:\n       ``The Court in 2001 said that the title of the Disabilities \n     Act was unconstitutional, 5-4, on employment discrimination. \n     Then 3 years later, you have the case coming up of Lane, the \n     paraplegic crawling up the steps, accommodations, 5-4, and \n     the Act is upheld.''\n       Yet, ``the record in the case was very extensive--13 \n     congressional hearings, a task force that held hearings in \n     every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including \n     thousands who had experienced discrimination.''\n       Despite these extensive factual findings, however, the \n     Court employed the ``congruence and proportionality'' test, a \n     test Justice Scalia criticized as ``flabby,'' to strike down \n     a portion of the act.\n       I asked Judge Roberts:\n       ``Isn't this congruence and proportionality test, which \n     comes out of thin air, a classic example of judicial activism \n     . . .?''\n       Judge Roberts acknowledged the applicable precedents, but \n     when asked whether he agreed with Justice Scalia's \n     sentiments, stated:\n       ``I don't think it's appropriate in an area--and there are \n     cases coming up, as you know, Mr. Chairman. There's a case on \n     the docket right now that considers the congruence and \n     proportionality test.''\n       He declined to answer the question. He did, however, state \n     that:\n       ``If I am confirmed and I do have to sit on that case, I \n     would approach that with an open mind and consider the \n     arguments. I can't give you a commitment here today about how \n     I will approach an issue that is going to be on the docket \n     within a matter of months.''\n\n\n             specter questioning, wednesday, sept. 14, 2005\n\n       Although I was disappointed that Judge Roberts did not \n     answer some of my questions, still, I believe that he went \n     somewhat beyond the usual practice of answering just as many \n     questions as he had to in order to be confirmed. Many \n     nominees decline to answer if the issue could theoretically \n     or conceivably come before the Court.\n       Judge Roberts, however, went further, testifying:\n       ``And the great danger of courts that I believe every one \n     of the Justices has been vigilant to safeguard against is \n     turning this into a bargaining process. It is not a process \n     under which Senators get to say I want you to rule this way, \n     this way, and this way. And if you tell me you'll rule this \n     way, this way, and this way, I'll vote for you. That is not a \n     bargaining process. Judges are not politicians. They cannot \n     promise to do certain things in exchange for votes. . . . \n     Other nominees have not been willing to tell you whether they \n     thought Marbury v. Madison was correctly decided. They took a \n     very strict approach. I have taken what I think is a more \n     pragmatic approach and said if I don't think that's likely to \n     come before the Court, I will comment on it . . . it is \n     difficult to draw the line sometimes. But I wanted to be able \n     to share as much as I can with the Committee in response to \n     the concerns you and others have expressed, and so I have \n     adopted that approach.''\n\n\n           schumer questioning, wednesday, september 14, 2005\n\n       Judge Roberts explained:\n       ``If I think an issue is not likely to come before the \n     Court, I have told the Committee what my views on that case \n     were, what my views on that case are.''\n\n\n                  kyl questioning, september 14, 2005\n\n       Of course, as with all nominees, there are circumstances in \n     which it would be inappropriate for Judge Roberts to take a \n     position. Since I believe it is inappropriate, for example, \n     to ask about an issue realistically likely to come before the \n     Court, I did not ask whether he would sustain or overrule Roe \n     v. Wade. Instead, I asked about his views on stare decisis, \n     or precedents, and what factors--how long ago decided, \n     stability, reliance, legitimacy of the Court--he might rely \n     on to decide whether he would vote to depart from a \n     precedent.\n       In addressing his respect for stare decisis, Judge Roberts \n     explained:\n       ``I would point out that the principle goes back even \n     farther than Cardozo and Frankfurter. Hamilton, in Federalist \n     No. 78, said that, `To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the \n     judges, they need to be bound down by rules and precedents.' \n     So even that far back, the Founders appreciated the role of \n     precedent in promoting evenhandedness, predictability, \n     stability, the appearance of integrity in the judicial \n     process.\n\n\n                  specter questioning, sept. 13, 2005\n\n       When I inquired about his application of these principles \n     to Roe, he noted that, ``it's settled precedent of the court, \n     entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.'' When \n     I pressed Roberts to explain what he meant by that in the \n     context of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey, where the Court said: ``that to overrule Roe would be \n     a `surrender to political pressure,' and `would subvert the \n     Court's legitimacy,''' he explained that ``as of 1992, you \n     had a reaffirmation of the central holding in Roe. That \n     decision, that application of the principles of stare \n     decisis, of course, itself a precedent that would be entitled \n     to respect under those principles.''\n       I called Judge Roberts' attention to the fact that Casey \n     had been labeled a super-precedent because different judges \n     had reaffirmed Roe after almost two decades. I then suggested \n     that, since the Supreme Court did not overrule Roe when it \n     had the opportunity to do so in 38 subsequent cases, it was \n     entitled to classification as a ``super-duper precedent.'' \n     Again, he was noncommittal.\n       Judge Roberts consistently reiterated his commitment to \n     modesty in the law and the importance of stare decisis by \n     explaining:\n       ``I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough--and \n     the Court has emphasized this on several occasions--it is not \n     enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly \n     decided.''\n\n\n           Specter Questioning, Wednesday, September 14, 2005\n\n       Notwithstanding his answers and my efforts to glean some \n     hint or realistic expectation from his words and body \n     language, candidly it is not possible to predict or have a \n     solid expectation of what Judge Roberts would do. If there is \n     a rule on expectations, it is probably one of surprise. \n     Professor Charles Fried, a professor of constitutional law at \n     Harvard Law School who thought Roe was wrongly decided, \n     testified that he did not think Judge Roberts would or should \n     vote to overrule Roe.\n       The Washington Post editorial of September 15 had some \n     comfort from Judge Roberts' testimony:\n       ``While he declined to address the merits of Roe v. Wade, \n     he did indicate that it is a decision to which stare decicis \n     consideration properly apply. Importantly, he said several \n     times that the subsequent decisions in Planned Parenthood v. \n     Casey which reaffirmed Roe's core principle--was \n     independently entitled to be treated as a precedent. That \n     implies that there would be a heavy burden for the court in \n     upsetting abortion rights now.''\n       Nevertheless, Judge Roberts did engage the committee on \n     several important related issues. With respect to the right \n     of privacy, for example, I asked him directly:\n       ``Do you believe that the right to privacy--do you believe \n     today that the right to privacy does exist in the \n     Constitution?''\n       Roberts was forthright in his response, declaring:\n       ``Senator, I do. The right to privacy is protected under \n     the Constitution in various ways . . . the Court has, with a \n     series of decisions going back 80 years that personal privacy \n     is a component of the liberty protected by the Due Process \n     Clause.''\n\n\n          Response to Specter Questioning, September 13, 2005\n\n       Similarly, in response to Senator Biden, who asked the \n     pointed question: ``Do you agree that there is a right of \n     privacy to be found in the Liberty Clause of the 14th \n     Amendment?'' Roberts responded:\n       ``I do, Senator. . . . Liberty is not limited to freedom \n     from physical restraint. It does cover areas . . . such as \n     privacy, and it's not protected only in procedural terms but \n     it is protected substantively as well.''\n\n\n                 Biden Questioning, September 13, 2005.\n\n       In fact, Judge Roberts was unequivocal in his support for a \n     right of privacy, asserting that:\n       ``I believe that the liberty protected by the Due Process \n     Clause is not limited to freedom from physical restraint, \n     that it includes certain other protections, including the \n     right to privacy.''\n\n\n                 Biden Questioning, September 14, 2005.\n\n       But Judge Roberts did not limit himself to finding simply a \n     general right to privacy. He also testified as to his \n     commitment to Griswold v. Connecticut. Senator Kohl, in \n     particular, asked:\n       ``Judge, the Griswold v. Connecticut case guarantees that \n     there is a fundamental right to privacy in the Constitution \n     as it applies to contraception. Do you agree with that \n     decision and that there is a fundamental right to privacy as \n     it relates to contraception? In your opinion, is that settled \n     law?''\n       Judge Roberts explicitly stated:\n       ``I agree with the Griswold Court's conclusion that marital \n     privacy extends to contraception and [the] availability of \n     that.''\n\n\n                 Kohl Questioning, September 13, 2005.\n\n       He did not limit his understanding of the privacy right \n     merely to Griswold, however. Senator Feinstein asked:\n       ``Do you think that right of privacy that you are talking \n     about [in Griswold] extends to single people as well as \n     married people?''\n       In response, Judge Roberts stated his agreement with the \n     Eisenstadt case, which provided protection to unmarried \n     couples as well as those who are married.\n\n\n               Feinstein Questioning, September 14, 2005\n\n       Roberts explained further his support for the Voting Rights \n     Act, observing that the right to vote is a ``fundamental \n     constitutional right,'' in his words:\n       ``preservative . . . of all the other rights. Without \n     access to the ballot box, people are not in the position to \n     protect any other rights that are important to them. And so I \n     think it's one of, as you said, the most precious rights we \n     have as Americans.''\n\n\n                Kennedy Questioning, September 13, 2005\n\n       He acknowledged that the Voting Rights Act had advanced the \n     rights of minorities. He explained that:\n       ``I think the gains under the Voting Rights Act have been \n     very beneficial in promoting\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\n     the right to vote, which is preservative of all other \n     rights.''\n\n\n                 Feingold questioning, Sept. 13, 2005.\n\n       He also underscored his belief in the constitutionality of \n     the Voting Rights Act, explaining in response to Senator \n     Kennedy that ``the existing Voting Rights Act, the \n     constitutionality has been upheld . . . and I don't have \n     any issue with that.''\n\n\n                Kennedy Questioning, September 13, 2005\n\n       Moreover, when Senator Leahy asked Judge Roberts whether he \n     believed that individuals should be allowed to sue State \n     governments to remedy illegal conduct, Judge Roberts \n     confirmed that he would not take a narrow or crabbed view of \n     individuals' rights.\n       Judge Roberts explained that the best place to look for his \n     views was not the briefs he filed on behalf of clients, but \n     his decisions as a judge:\n       ``I did have occasion as a judge to address a Spending \n     Clause case. It was a case called Barber v. Washington \n     Metropolitan Area. . . . . I ruled that the individual did \n     have the right to sue.''\n\n\n                 Leahy Questioning, September 15, 2005\n\n       Those individuals, it should be noted, sued Washington, DC \n     for discriminating against them based on their disabilities, \n     and Judge Roberts affirmed their right to sue in the face of \n     a dissent by a conservative panel member.\n       Moreover, demonstrating a sensitivity to the ``real world'' \n     problems of race, Judge Roberts expressed his agreement with \n     the approach taken by Justice O'Connor's opinion for the \n     Court in upholding an affirmative action program employed by \n     a university in its admissions policy, explaining that he \n     agreed that it is vital ``to look at the real-world impact in \n     this area [the area of affirmative action in university \n     admissions], and I think in other areas, as well.''\n\n\n                Kennedy Questioning, September 14, 2005\n\n       Judge Roberts further reaffirmed his support for minority \n     outreach programs that are designed to guarantee equal \n     opportunity for all:\n       ``A measured effort that can withstand strict scrutiny is, \n     I think, affirmative action of that sort, I think, is a very \n     positi[ve] approach. . . . efforts to ensure the full \n     participation in all aspects of our society by people without \n     regard to their race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs--\n     all of those are efforts that I think are appropriate. . . . \n     beneficial affirmative action to bring minorities, women into \n     all aspects of society. That's important, and as the Court \n     has explained, we all benefit from that.''\n\n\n               Feinstein Questioning, September 14, 2005\n\n       Judge Roberts also cast aside any question about his \n     commitment to civil rights for all Americans. In commenting \n     on Congress's authority under the 14th amendment to remedy \n     discrimination, Judge Roberts expressly stated that he \n     believes Congress has the power to guarantee civil rights for \n     all. In response to Senator Kennedy's question: So do you \n     agree with the Court's conclusion that the segregation of \n     children in public school solely on the basis of race is \n     unconstitutional?'' Roberts responded: ``I do.''\n\n\n                Kennedy Questioning, September 13, 2005\n\n       And, when asked by Kennedy: ``Do you believe that the Court \n     had the power to address segregation of public schools on the \n     basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution?'' \n     Roberts again responded, ``Yes. . . .''\n\n                Kennedy Questioning, September 13, 2005\n\n       Judge Roberts, in his pro bono work, further demonstrated \n     his evenhandedness. I questioned him about his participation \n     in Romer v. Evans, which involved alleged discrimination on \n     the basis of sexual orientation:\n     ``Where you gave some advice on the arguments to those who \n     were upholding gay rights, and a quotation by Walter Smith, \n     who was the lawyer at Hogan & Hartson in charge of pro bono \n     work. He had this to say about your participation in that \n     case supporting or trying to help the gay community in a case \n     in the Supreme Court. Mr. Smith said, `Every good lawyer \n     knows that if there is something in his client's cause that \n     so personally offends you, morally, religiously, or if it so \n     offends you that you think it would undermine your ability to \n     do your duty as a lawyer, then you shouldn't take it on, and \n     John'--referring to you--`wouldn't have. So at a minimum he \n     had no concerns that would rise to that level.' Does that \n     accurately express your own sentiments in taking on the aid \n     to the gay community in that case?''\n       Judge Roberts responded that:\n       ``I was asked frequently by other partners to help out \n     particularly in my area of expertise, often involved moot \n     courting, and I never turned down a request. I think it's \n     right that if it had been something morally objectionable, I \n     suppose I would have, but it was my view that lawyers don't \n     stand in the shoes of their clients, and that good lawyers \n     can give advice and argue any side of a case. And as I said, \n     I was asked frequently to participate in that type of \n     assistance for other partners at the firm, and I never turned \n     anyone down.''\n\n\n               Specter Questioning, Tuesday, September 13\n\n       In addition, Judge Roberts provided a thorough discussion \n     of a much debated issue of the day--judges' use of foreign \n     law in interpreting the U.S. Constitution. Judge Roberts \n     stated, ``a couple of things . . . cause concern on my part \n     about the use of foreign law . . . as precedent on the \n     meaning of American law.'' Judge Roberts explained:\n       ``The first has to do with democratic theory. . . . If \n     we're relying on a decision from a German judge about what \n     our Constitution means, no President accountable to the \n     people appointed that judge, and no Senate accountable to \n     the people confirmed that judge, and yet he's playing a \n     role in shaping a law that binds the people in this \n     country. I think that's a concern that has to be \n     addressed. The other part of it that would concern me is \n     that relying on foreign precedent doesn't confine judges. \n     It doesn't limit their discretion the way relying on \n     domestic precedent does. . . . In foreign law you can find \n     anything you want. If you don't find it in the decisions \n     of France or Italy, it's in the decisions of Somalia or \n     Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in \n     another context, looking at foreign law for support is \n     like looking out over a crowd and picking out your \n     friends. You can find them, they're there. And that \n     actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows \n     the judge to incorporate his or her own personal \n     preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent \n     because they're finding precedent in foreign law, and use \n     that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think \n     that's a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of \n     precedent.''\n\n\n                    kyl questioning, sept. 13, 2005\n\n       Most importantly, Judge Roberts's answers demonstrated that \n     he would take a fair, non-ideological approach to the law. As \n     Judge Roberts explained:\n       ``The ideal in the American justice system is epitomized by \n     the fact that judges, Justices, do wear the black robes, and \n     that is meant to symbolize the fact that they're not \n     individuals promoting their own particular views, but they \n     are supposed to be doing their best to interpret the law, to \n     interpret the Constitution, according to the rule of law, not \n     their own preferences, not their own personal beliefs.''\n\n\n                  kohl questioning, september 13, 2005\n\n       I think it important that Judge Roberts condemned judicial \n     activism of all stripes, from the left and the right. I found \n     it telling that when asked for an example of ``immodesty'' in \n     judging, Judge Roberts began with an example of conservative \n     judicial activism:\n       ``I would think the clearest juxtaposition would be the \n     cases from the Lochner era. If you take Lochner on the one \n     hand and, say, West Coast Hotel, which kind of overruled and \n     buried the Lochner approach on the other, and the immodesty \n     that I see in the Lochner opinion is in its re-weighing of \n     the legislative determination. You read that opinion, it's \n     about limits on how long bakers can work. And they're saying \n     we don't think there's any problem with bakers working more \n     than 13 hours. . . . Well, the legislature thought there was, \n     and they passed a law about it, and the issue should not have \n     been, Judges, do you think this was a good law or do you \n     think bakers should work longer or not? It should be: Is \n     there anything in the Constitution that prohibits the \n     legislature from doing that?\n\n\n                schumer questioning, september 14, 2005\n\n       This is a view, I should note, echoed in the work of a \n     young John Roberts of nearly 24 years ago. In November 1981, \n     Judge Roberts wrote that judicial activism is ``a concern \n     that does not depend upon political exigencies.'' The young \n     John Roberts pointed to Lochner and explained, ``The evils of \n     judicial activism remain the same regardless of the political \n     ends the activism seeks to serve.'' [Document AG7-5508]\n       Unlike Justice Scalia, who declined even to opine on \n     Marbury v. Madison, Judge Roberts not only reaffirmed his \n     commitment to Marbury, but also indicated his support for the \n     seminal Commerce Clause case of Wickard v. Filburn.\n       In response to questioning by Senator Schumer, Judge \n     Roberts stated that Wickard ``was reaffirmed in the Raich \n     case and that is a precedent of the court, just like Wickard, \n     that I would apply like any other precedent. I have no agenda \n     to overturn it. I have no agenda to revisit it. It's a \n     precedent of the Court.''\n\n\n                  schumer questioning, sept. 13, 2005.\n\n       Nevertheless, I was not wholly persuaded by Judge Roberts' \n     explanation in seeking to distance himself from memoranda \n     which he had written as an Assistant to Attorney General \n     William French Smith or as an Associate White House counsel \n     in the Reagan Administration.\n       My overall impression of Judge Roberts is that he has grown \n     considerably in the intervening twenty years. Phyllis \n     Schlafly, President of the conservative Eagle Forum, \n     characterized that potential growth from his youthful \n     position that women should be homemakers instead of lawyers. \n     Ms. Schlafly characterized that as a smart-alecky comment \n     from a young bachelor who hadn't seen a whole lot of life at \n     that point. The fact that Judge Roberts is now married to a \n     successful lawyer, who is a homemaker as well, demonstrates a \n     different current view.\n       In any event, I conclude that Judge Roberts is a very \n     different man today than he was when he wrote the early \n     memoranda and that a more appropriate way of evaluating him \n     would be on the basis of his 45 opinions and 4 concurrences \n     in two years on the Circuit Court, the extensive testimony he \n     gave, and the insights of the many witnesses who have known \n     him intimately over the intervening years.\n       The subtle minuet of the confirmation hearing for Judge \n     Roberts turned bombastic\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\n     and confrontational at times, but he kept his cool and \n     responded within reasonable parameters. The Judiciary \n     Committee and the full Senate cannot be guarantors that Judge \n     Roberts will fulfill ours or anyone's expectations. The \n     Court's history is full of justices who have surprised or \n     disappointed their appointers or inquisitors.\n       But the process has been full, fair and dignified. On some \n     questions, Judge Roberts, as the song about the Kansas City \n     burlesque queen in the stage play ``Oklahoma'' says: ``She \n     (he) went about as far as she (he) could go'' without \n     committing himself to votes on cases likely to come before \n     the court. When all the facts are considered, my judgment is \n     that Judge Roberts is qualified, has the potential to serve \n     with distinction as Chief Justice and should be confirmed. I \n     will vote ``yea.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and, in the absence \nof any Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are pleased to present to the Senate \ntoday the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill for the Department of \nAgriculture, rural development, and related agencies. The bill is \nbefore the Senate and is open for amendment or discussion and debate. I \nam pleased to announce to the Senate that this reflects a lot of hard \nwork through hearings, examining the President's budget request for \nthese Departments for this next fiscal year.\n  The subcommittee was very capably managed by the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, who is chairman of this subcommittee. \nThe bill is within the budget authority outlined by the budget \nresolution adopted by the Senate. Specifically, section 302(b) of the \nbudget resolution allocates $17.348 billion to this subcommittee's \nauthority for appropriations. It is within the outlay allocation of \n$18.816 billion.\n  Throughout the past 7 months, the committee has reviewed suggestions \nby Senators and others who are interested in the provisions of this \nbill. The bill, as reported by the subcommittee, was approved \nunanimously and submitted to the full committee. And after review by a \nbipartisan group of Senators in that subcommittee, all of the Senators \nin the full committee approved the allocation and the appropriation of \nfunds as reported in this bill.\n  We hope if any Senators have any suggestions for amendments, they \nwill bring them to the attention of the managers of the bill. We will \nbe happy to discuss those and review them. We hope we can complete \naction on this bill at an early date. There are other bills that need \nto be considered by the Senate, so we hope we can take up these \nsuggestions, and if there are amendments, we can vote on them \nexpeditiously.\n  We appreciate Senator Kohl, who is the ranking minority member of \nthis subcommittee, for his hard work and leadership in the development \nof this bill. Their staff has worked with the staff on the majority \nside in a cooperative way. This is a truly bipartisan effort. The \nSenate appreciates that fact. I congratulate all who have been actively \ninvolved in the development of the legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee to discuss the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I applaud the chairman, Senator Cochran of \nMississippi, as well as Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl for \ntheir diligence on this spending bill and for ensuring that we have \narrived at as sound a financial package as was possible, given the \npending budget resolution's mandate to cut funds from USDA. At a time \nof significant budgetary deficits and increasingly tight funding, I \nworked with my colleagues to maintain a secure package for our \nproducers and rural communities, especially in light of a sorely \ninadequate proposed USDA budget from the administration.\n  Producers and ranchers in my State of South Dakota and across the \nNation would simply prefer a fair price for what they produce at the \nday's end. USDA programs and Federal funding are crucial for producers, \nhowever, when markets are challenging and prices are depressed. The \nfarm bill that was hammered out in 2002 is a contract with rural \nAmerica, with South Dakota, to ensure adequate safety nets and \nincreased opportunities for rural communities. Numerous Members of \nCongress, as well as agricultural organizations concerned with the \nPresident's proposed budget, have pointed out that the farm bill has \nalready come in at $14 billion under its original projected costs.\n  At a time when producers need the contract negotiated by Congress and \nsigned into law by this President, the administration proposed limiting \nthe benefits promised to producers. We cannot balance the national \ndeficit on the backs of our Nation's producers. I voted to restore the \ncuts that were made to the agricultural spending package, and I am \nconcerned for the adjustments that will be made to the agricultural \nspending bill in light of the budget reconciliation instructions \nadvocated by this administration. I am concerned for the impact these \ncuts will have on our rural communities and our producers.\n  There are several initiatives, however, that I am pleased to see in \nthis spending measure. I would like to touch on a few of those \npriorities. As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, \nthere are a few South-Dakota-specific items that I am pleased are \nincluded in this measure. A few of them include funding for a \ncollaborative four-State effort led by South Dakota State University. \nThese funds will increase opportunities for South Dakota sheep and \ncattle producers, building a better climate for livestock feeding in \nour State. There is funding to work at South Dakota State University to \nintegrate pulse crops in crop rotations for South Dakota farmers. By \nintegrating pulse crops into rotations, farmers can increase profits \nand improve soil quality.\n  There is some funding for the Seed Technology Center at South Dakota \nState University. Funds will be used to conduct seed technology and \nbiotechnology research to benefit agricultural producers and consumers, \nenhancing profitability for producers and resulting in better food \nproduction.\n  Lastly, there is funding for the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks \nDepartment to continue animal damage control work. The funds allow the \nSouth Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Department to continue to meet the \ngrowing demands of controlling predatory nuisance and diseased animals. \nSDSU, a land grant university in Brookings, is significantly impacted \nby Hatch, McIntire-Stennis, and animal health Federal formula funds. \nSDSU is an institution that makes enormous contributions to our \nagricultural industry through the research initiatives that it \nspearheads.\n  The President's proposed cuts on their research centers would have \ngreatly impacted this land grant institution's ability to function in \nan effective manner. The President's proposed budget would have cut 45 \nfaculty and staff at South Dakota State University, with a 25- to 50-\npercent reduction in graduate students. These cuts would have resulted \nin closure of at least one\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\nSDSU research farm and at least one SDSU public service laboratory. I \nworked with my colleagues and with the chairman to ensure that formula \nfunds were, in fact, reinstated at sufficient levels in this bill.\n  I continue to hear from constituents about the viability of the \nResource, Conservation, and Development Program, which was funded at \nonly $25 million in the President's proposed fiscal year 2006 budget. \nThe funding level is a substantial reduction from fiscal year 2005 \nfunding at $51 million which was reinstated in the fiscal year 2006 \nspending package. Rural development initiatives are crucial for \ncreating additional opportunities. The Resource, Conservation, and \nDevelopment Program contributes tremendously to the economic growth in \nrural communities, and limiting spending for this program limits \neconomic opportunities.\n  With respect to the animal identification program, $33 million was \ndevoted to this system last year via the omnibus spending bill, and \nfunds were again requested by the Bush administration. Given the size \nand scale of this program, the projected costs, it is essential to \nensure that the Department of Agriculture includes stakeholders, \nrecognizing the concerns that producers have voiced for the \nimplementation of this system. The USDA needs to ensure adequate \ncommunication with Congress in consideration of producers and ranchers. \nI continue to hear, as well, from producers and ranchers who are \nincreasingly concerned with the Department's initiative to consolidate \nFarm Service Agency service centers. Our 59 offices in South Dakota are \nessential for providing face-to-face contact with producers. Not every \nproducer owns a computer. Expecting our farmers and ranchers to drive \nfurther distances, especially considering the significant cost of fuel, \nis not reasonable.\n  Implementation of our farm bill programs depends on the ability of \nour FSA offices to communicate with ranchers and farmers. The \nadministration is doing a severe disservice to our agricultural \ncommunities with such a drastic course of action.\n  Lastly, one of the key components I would like to address is the \nmandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling Program signed into law by \nPresident Bush in this most recent farm bill. I was the primary author \nof the mandatory country-of-origin labeling law that was included in \nthe 2002 farm bill. While I was disappointed to see the House include a \n1-year delay for meat and meat products for the Country-of-Origin \nLabeling Program in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations \nbill, the Senate bill that was reported favorably out of committee \ncontains no such delay. This bill, in fact, contains roughly $3 million \nfor program implementation, which is a modest amount compared to the \nnecessary funding for other initiatives. Mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling is a program appreciated by both consumers and producers. It \nis not rocket science and, in fact, would be inexpensive to implement. \nA recent poll by Public Citizen reflects, as well, that 85 percent of \nconsumers want to know where their food comes from. An additional 74 \npercent of consumers want this labeling program mandated. I continue to \nhear from producers and ranchers in support of this program, and any \ntype of further delay would be a severe disservice for this right-to-\nknow initiative for our consumers and a marketing tool for producers, \nas well as a great boost for our export markets.\n\n  Again, I thank Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl for their \nleadership on this agricultural spending package.\n  I thank Chairman Cochran, as well, for his leadership during a time \nof obviously tight budget constraints.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the kind remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and for his influence in \nthe process of developing the appropriate levels of funding in this \nbill. We have tried very hard not only to stay within the budget \nallocation but to try to identify priorities so that we put money where \nthe problems are and we deal with the realities of living on a farm, \ntrying to make a living, trying to meet the needs of communities around \nthe country for rural development projects. There is a wide range of \njurisdiction that comes under the authority of this subcommittee for \nrural development, such as housing for low-income people who would \notherwise not be able to have housing. Also, we have important \ncomponents in the bill relating to food safety. We are confronted with \nthreats to our country from terrorist groups, so this makes us worry \nabout bioterrorism and being able to develop an infrastructure to \nprotect ourselves against any efforts to contaminate our food supply or \nto wreak havoc in our communities with other terrorist activities that \nrelate to our food supply and its sources. For that purpose, we have \ninvested in research and other initiatives that will help us more \nsuccessfully deal with these challenges to help assure the American \npublic that our food supply is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.\n\n  In that connection, too, we realize this subcommittee has the \nresponsibility of funding the school feeding programs so that school \nlunch programs, school breakfast programs, and others maintain healthy \ndiets for children in school throughout our country to bring to them \nnutritious and safe foods.\n  We just reauthorized in the legislative Committee on Agriculture last \nyear a new law that authorizes the funding of these programs. We have \nnew initiatives, such as fruit and vegetable programs that help assure \nthat schools are able to access and provide a wide variety of healthy \nfoods for children in the public school systems of our country.\n  These are very important steps, building upon a legacy by previous \ncommittees that have worked on these challenges and expanding the \nbenefits so that more and more students are reached by these programs.\n  We try to make sure the costs of these programs are controlled so \nthat people are not priced out of the system. We want to make sure that \nin our public schools, there are free and reduced-price lunches \navailable in our schools for those who cannot afford the full cost of \nthese meals.\n  I also want to point out that access to communications systems, to \nrural water and sewer systems, to modern electricity facilities that \nare available in rural areas--where providing such services is much \nmore expensive per consumer than it is in urban areas--is made \navailable through Federal programs that help assure access of farm \nfamilies and others who live in rural areas of our country to these \nimportant quality-of-life situations.\n  We have made a tremendous contribution throughout rural America in \npromoting economic development using business and industrial loans, \ntrying to attract good-paying jobs to small towns and rural \ncommunities. Those programs are funded in this bill, too.\n  I might say for the purpose of showing the commitment, in many of \nthese areas we have increased the funding over previous year levels of \nfunding.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is an independent agency that is \nfunded in this bill as well. Such initiatives as medical device review \nto assure safety for the consumers, drug safety, and the pharmaceutical \nproducts that are supplied throughout our country have to meet \nstandards imposed by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  This year, we are providing an additional $5 million to the Food and \nDrug Administration for the purpose of helping ensure drug safety. The \nmedical device review account is increased by $7.8 million over last \nyear's level. I have mentioned our efforts in counterterrorism and food \nsafety. That is also within the purview of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the funding there is $16.6 million above last \nyear's level. To help meet those challenges, we have had to make \nadjustments elsewhere in the bill to keep it within the allocation \npermitted by the Budget Committee.\n  There is not a specific account in here directed to hurricane \nvictims. The recent hurricane that struck the Gulf Coast States has \ncaused a tremendous amount of damage throughout the Gulf of Mexico \nStates--Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. I think there are more \ncounties in my State of Mississippi affected by that disaster than any \nother State. The geographical area was so large, it is just horrible to \ncontemplate the total amount of physical\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\ndestruction of trees, of growing crops, of poultry facilities. Our \nagricultural and rural community has been hit hard by the effects of \nthis hurricane. When you get closer to the gulf coast, of course, you \nsee total destruction along the coastal areas.\n  The other day when the majority leader led a delegation of 14 \nSenators to Louisiana, New Orleans, across the Mississippi gulf coast \nand into Alabama, ending our tour in Mobile, it brought home to all of \nus that the entire gulf coast area has been devastated. Businesses are \ngone. Houses are gone. Churches are gone. Schools have disappeared. It \nis breathtaking and horrible to observe.\n  The point I am making is that while this bill is not a disaster \nassistance bill per se, there are many provisions in this bill that \nwill help these communities rebuild and recover and will help the \npeople of those areas until they can get their feet back on the ground \nand back at work and in suitable housing.\n  I mentioned the farmer's loan programs that exist. There are also \nfunds in this bill for food stamps, for the Women, Infants and Children \nfeeding program. This is for mothers, to help them care for their \nchildren, help to get them off to a healthy start in life. Food safety \nconcerns we have mentioned. Conservation recovery, rural housing \nprograms are all very important components to the recovery effort from \nHurricane Katrina. The Department of Agriculture has stepped forward \nand is making good progress in identifying areas that need special \nhelp.\n  Before long, the Senate will take up another supplemental \nappropriations bill targeted directly to disaster victims. We are in \npreliminary discussions already with the administration on when that \nmoney will be needed, when will it be considered by the Senate, when \nwill the request be submitted. These are issues we are working hard to \nresolve to be sure that Federal agencies that have the responsibility \nof responding to this disaster have the funds they need to do it and do \nit right and to do it quickly.\n  We have had a number of requests from Senators to consider changes in \nthis bill and for opportunities to speak on the bill. We are here and \nwe will be here the remainder of this day available to discuss issues \nthat may be brought to the attention of the Senate. We appreciate the \nsupport of all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when I was talking about the strong \nsupport we received in this subcommittee from staff, I wanted to \nspecifically mention those staff members who have been actively \ninvolved in the development of this legislation, helping organize the \nhearings that were held, to review requests, to assess the needs:\n  John Ziolkowski, who is the clerk of this subcommittee, formerly was \nstaff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee when I was pleased \nto serve as chairman. He has been very instrumental in managing the \nwork effort of this subcommittee.\n  Hunter Moorhead, who has had much experience in agricultural issues \nand is a veteran of this subcommittee staff as well and was very active \nin his work is deeply appreciated. He, incidentally, is from the State \nof Mississippi, so we don't have to have a translator or anybody doing \nsimultaneous translation for anyone to understand us.\n  Fitz Elder, Dianne Preece, as well as Stacy McBride, an FDA fellow \nwho has joined this staff team and has been helpful in developing our \nsection in particular dealing with the Food and Drug Administration, \nall have been very helpful, and we appreciate their good work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1735\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1735.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       Sec.  . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture may consider the Municipality of \n     Carolina, Puerto Rico as meeting the eligibility requirements \n     for loans and grants programs in the Rural Development \n     mission area.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is a provision to be added to the \nbill that deals with eligibility for USDA rural development programs.\n  This is a provision which enables the municipality of Carolina, \nPuerto Rico to be eligible for USDA rural development programs. \nEligibility for these programs is based on certain statistics such as \npopulation and income but on occasion some communities are declared not \neligible because they are too close to an urban area or there is a \nsmall pocket of higher income population in the locality.\n  There is no cost to this amendment. It merely makes the community \neligible. They still must apply through USDA and they are subject to \nthe availability of existing funds.\n  The Agriculture Committee has no objection and it has been cleared on \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle and we know of no objection to the amendment from any Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1735) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Department of Agriculture and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY 2006, H.R. 2744, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides $86.883 \nbillion in budget authority and $69.248 billion in outlays in FY 2006. \nOf these totals, $69.535 billion in budget authority and $50.456 \nbillion in outlays are for mandatory programs in FY 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in FY 2006 of \n$17.348 billion. This amount is $430 million more than the President's \nrequest, equal to the 302(b) allocations adopted by the Senate, $518 \nmillion more than the House-passed bill, and $905 million less than FY \n2005 enacted levels.\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  H.R. 2744, 2006 AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES\n       APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          Purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     17,348     69,535     86,883\n  Outlays..............................     18,792     50,456     69,248\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................     17,348     69,535     86,883\n  Outlays..............................     18,816     50,456     69,272\n2005 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.....................     18,253     71,954     90,207\n  Outlays..............................     18,649     49,563     68,212\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................     16,918     69,535     86,453\n  Outlays..............................     18,652     50,456     69,108\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     16,830     69,535     86,365\n  Outlays..............................     18,519     50,456     68,975\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................          0          0          0\n  Outlays..............................        -24          0        -24\n2005 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.....................       -905     -2,419     -3,324\n  Outlays..............................        143        893      1,036\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................        430          0        430\n  Outlays..............................        140          0        140\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................        518          0        518\n  Outlays..............................        273          0        273\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to the rounding.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are pleased to present to the Senate \ntoday the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill for the Department of \nAgriculture, rural development, and related agencies. The bill is \nbefore the Senate and is open for amendment or discussion and debate. I \nam pleased to announce to the Senate that this reflects a lot of hard \nwork through hearings, examining the President's budget request for \nthese Departments for this next fiscal year.\n  The subcommittee was very capably managed by the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, who is chairman of this subcommittee. \nThe bill is within the budget authority outlined by the budget \nresolution adopted by the Senate. Specifically, section 302(b) of the \nbudget resolution allocates $17.348 billion to this subcommittee's \nauthority for appropriations. It is within the outlay allocation of \n$18.816 billion.\n  Throughout the past 7 months, the committee has reviewed suggestions \nby Senators and others who are interested in the provisions of this \nbill. The bill, as reported by the subcommittee, was approved \nunanimously and submitted to the full committee. And after review by a \nbipartisan group of Senators in that subcommittee, all of the Senators \nin the full committee approved the allocation and the appropriation of \nfunds as reported in this bill.\n  We hope if any Senators have any suggestions for amendments, they \nwill bring them to the attention of the managers of the bill. We will \nbe happy to discuss those and review them. We hope we can complete \naction on this bill at an early date. There are other bills that need \nto be considered by the Senate, so we hope we can take up these \nsuggestions, and if there are amendments, we can vote on them \nexpeditiously.\n  We appreciate Senator Kohl, who is the ranking minority member of \nthis subcommittee, for his hard work and leadership in the development \nof this bill. Their staff has worked with the staff on the majority \nside in a cooperative way. This is a truly bipartisan effort. The \nSenate appreciates that fact. I congratulate all who have been actively \ninvolved in the development of the legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee to discuss the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I applaud the chairman, Senator Cochran of \nMississippi, as well as Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl for \ntheir diligence on this spending bill and for ensuring that we have \narrived at as sound a financial package as was possible, given the \npending budget resolution's mandate to cut funds from USDA.

I \nworked with my colleagues and with the chairman to ensure that formula \nfunds were, in fact, reinstated at sufficient levels in this bill.\n  I continue to hear from constituents about the viability of the \nResource, Conservation, and Development Program, which was funded at \nonly $25 million in the President's proposed fiscal year 2006 budget. \nThe funding level is a substantial reduction from fiscal year 2005 \nfunding at $51 million which was reinstated in the fiscal year 2006 \nspending package.

The USDA needs to ensure adequate \ncommunication with Congress in consideration of producers and ranchers. \nI continue to hear, as well, from producers and ranchers who are \nincreasingly concerned with the Department's initiative to consolidate \nFarm Service Agency service centers. Our 59 offices in South Dakota are \nessential for providing face-to-face contact with producers. Not every \nproducer owns a computer. Expecting our farmers and ranchers to drive \nfurther distances, especially considering the significant cost of fuel, \nis not reasonable.\n  Implementation of our farm bill programs depends on the ability of \nour FSA offices to communicate with ranchers and farmers. The \nadministration is doing a severe disservice to our agricultural \ncommunities with such a drastic course of action.\n  Lastly, one of the key components I would like to address is the \nmandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling Program signed into law by \nPresident Bush in this most recent farm bill. I was the primary author \nof the mandatory country-of-origin labeling law that was included in \nthe 2002 farm bill. While I was disappointed to see the House include a \n1-year delay for meat and meat products for the Country-of-Origin \nLabeling Program in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations \nbill, the Senate bill that was reported favorably out of committee \ncontains no such delay. This bill, in fact, contains roughly $3 million \nfor program implementation, which is a modest amount compared to the \nnecessary funding for other initiatives. Mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling is a program appreciated by both consumers and producers. It \nis not rocket science and, in fact, would be inexpensive to implement. \nA recent poll by Public Citizen reflects, as well, that 85 percent of \nconsumers want to know where their food comes from. An additional 74 \npercent of consumers want this labeling program mandated. I continue to \nhear from producers and ranchers in support of this program, and any \ntype of further delay would be a severe disservice for this right-to-\nknow initiative for our consumers and a marketing tool for producers, \nas well as a great boost for our export markets.\n\n  Again, I thank Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl for their \nleadership on this agricultural spending package.\n  I thank Chairman Cochran, as well, for his leadership during a time \nof obviously tight budget constraints.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the kind remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and for his influence in \nthe process of developing the appropriate levels of funding in this \nbill. We have tried very hard not only to stay within the budget \nallocation but to try to identify priorities so that we put money where \nthe problems are and we deal with the realities of living on a farm, \ntrying to make a living, trying to meet the needs of communities around \nthe country for rural development projects. There is a wide range of \njurisdiction that comes under the authority of this subcommittee for \nrural development, such as housing for low-income people who would \notherwise not be able to have housing. Also, we have important \ncomponents in the bill relating to food safety. We are confronted with \nthreats to our country from terrorist groups, so this makes us worry \nabout bioterrorism and being able to develop an infrastructure to \nprotect ourselves against any efforts to contaminate our food supply or \nto wreak havoc in our communities with other terrorist activities that \nrelate to our food supply and its sources. For that purpose, we have \ninvested in research and other initiatives that will help us more \nsuccessfully deal with these challenges to help assure the American \npublic that our food supply is safe, wholesome, and nutritious.\n\n  In that connection, too, we realize this subcommittee has the \nresponsibility of funding the school feeding programs so that school \nlunch programs, school breakfast programs, and others maintain healthy \ndiets for children in school throughout our country to bring to them \nnutritious and safe foods.\n  We just reauthorized in the legislative Committee on Agriculture last \nyear a new law that authorizes the funding of these programs. We have \nnew initiatives, such as fruit and vegetable programs that help assure \nthat schools are able to access and provide a wide variety of healthy \nfoods for children in the public school systems of our country.\n  These are very important steps, building upon a legacy by previous \ncommittees that have worked on these challenges and expanding the \nbenefits so that more and more students are reached by these programs.\n  We try to make sure the costs of these programs are controlled so \nthat people are not priced out of the system. We want to make sure that \nin our public schools, there are free and reduced-price lunches \navailable in our schools for those who cannot afford the full cost of \nthese meals.\n  I also want to point out that access to communications systems, to \nrural water and sewer systems, to modern electricity facilities that \nare available in rural areas--where providing such services is much \nmore expensive per consumer than it is in urban areas--is made \navailable through Federal programs that help assure access of farm \nfamilies and others who live in rural areas of our country to these \nimportant quality-of-life situations.\n  We have made a tremendous contribution throughout rural America in \npromoting economic development using business and industrial loans, \ntrying to attract good-paying jobs to small towns and rural \ncommunities. Those programs are funded in this bill, too.\n  I might say for the purpose of showing the commitment, in many of \nthese areas we have increased the funding over previous year levels of \nfunding.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is an independent agency that is \nfunded in this bill as well. Such initiatives as medical device review \nto assure safety for the consumers, drug safety, and the pharmaceutical \nproducts that are supplied throughout our country have to meet \nstandards imposed by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  This year, we are providing an additional $5 million to the Food and \nDrug Administration for the purpose of helping ensure drug safety. The \nmedical device review account is increased by $7.8 million over last \nyear's level. I have mentioned our efforts in counterterrorism and food \nsafety. That is also within the purview of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the funding there is $16.6 million above last \nyear's level. To help meet those challenges, we have had to make \nadjustments elsewhere in the bill to keep it within the allocation \npermitted by the Budget Committee.\n  There is not a specific account in here directed to hurricane \nvictims. The recent hurricane that struck the Gulf Coast States has \ncaused a tremendous amount of damage throughout the Gulf of Mexico \nStates--Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. I think there are more \ncounties in my State of Mississippi affected by that disaster than any \nother State. The geographical area was so large, it is just horrible to \ncontemplate the total amount of physical\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\ndestruction of trees, of growing crops, of poultry facilities. Our \nagricultural and rural community has been hit hard by the effects of \nthis hurricane. When you get closer to the gulf coast, of course, you \nsee total destruction along the coastal areas.\n  The other day when the majority leader led a delegation of 14 \nSenators to Louisiana, New Orleans, across the Mississippi gulf coast \nand into Alabama, ending our tour in Mobile, it brought home to all of \nus that the entire gulf coast area has been devastated. Businesses are \ngone. Houses are gone. Churches are gone. Schools have disappeared. It \nis breathtaking and horrible to observe.\n  The point I am making is that while this bill is not a disaster \nassistance bill per se, there are many provisions in this bill that \nwill help these communities rebuild and recover and will help the \npeople of those areas until they can get their feet back on the ground \nand back at work and in suitable housing.\n  I mentioned the farmer's loan programs that exist. There are also \nfunds in this bill for food stamps, for the Women, Infants and Children \nfeeding program. This is for mothers, to help them care for their \nchildren, help to get them off to a healthy start in life. Food safety \nconcerns we have mentioned. Conservation recovery, rural housing \nprograms are all very important components to the recovery effort from \nHurricane Katrina. The Department of Agriculture has stepped forward \nand is making good progress in identifying areas that need special \nhelp.\n  Before long, the Senate will take up another supplemental \nappropriations bill targeted directly to disaster victims. We are in \npreliminary discussions already with the administration on when that \nmoney will be needed, when will it be considered by the Senate, when \nwill the request be submitted. These are issues we are working hard to \nresolve to be sure that Federal agencies that have the responsibility \nof responding to this disaster have the funds they need to do it and do \nit right and to do it quickly.\n  We have had a number of requests from Senators to consider changes in \nthis bill and for opportunities to speak on the bill. We are here and \nwe will be here the remainder of this day available to discuss issues \nthat may be brought to the attention of the Senate. We appreciate the \nsupport of all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when I was talking about the strong \nsupport we received in this subcommittee from staff, I wanted to \nspecifically mention those staff members who have been actively \ninvolved in the development of this legislation, helping organize the \nhearings that were held, to review requests, to assess the needs:\n  John Ziolkowski, who is the clerk of this subcommittee, formerly was \nstaff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee when I was pleased \nto serve as chairman. He has been very instrumental in managing the \nwork effort of this subcommittee.\n  Hunter Moorhead, who has had much experience in agricultural issues \nand is a veteran of this subcommittee staff as well and was very active \nin his work is deeply appreciated. He, incidentally, is from the State \nof Mississippi, so we don't have to have a translator or anybody doing \nsimultaneous translation for anyone to understand us.\n  Fitz Elder, Dianne Preece, as well as Stacy McBride, an FDA fellow \nwho has joined this staff team and has been helpful in developing our \nsection in particular dealing with the Food and Drug Administration, \nall have been very helpful, and we appreciate their good work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1735\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1735.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       Sec.  . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture may consider the Municipality of \n     Carolina, Puerto Rico as meeting the eligibility requirements \n     for loans and grants programs in the Rural Development \n     mission area.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is a provision to be added to the \nbill that deals with eligibility for USDA rural development programs.\n  This is a provision which enables the municipality of Carolina, \nPuerto Rico to be eligible for USDA rural development programs. \nEligibility for these programs is based on certain statistics such as \npopulation and income but on occasion some communities are declared not \neligible because they are too close to an urban area or there is a \nsmall pocket of higher income population in the locality.\n  There is no cost to this amendment. It merely makes the community \neligible. They still must apply through USDA and they are subject to \nthe availability of existing funds.\n  The Agriculture Committee has no objection and it has been cleared on \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle and we know of no objection to the amendment from any Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1735) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Department of Agriculture and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY 2006, H.R. 2744, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations provides $86.883 \nbillion in budget authority and $69.248 billion in outlays in FY 2006. \nOf these totals, $69.535 billion in budget authority and $50.456 \nbillion in outlays are for mandatory programs in FY 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in FY 2006 of \n$17.348 billion. This amount is $430 million more than the President's \nrequest, equal to the 302(b) allocations adopted by the Senate, $518 \nmillion more than the House-passed bill, and $905 million less than FY \n2005 enacted levels.\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  H.R. 2744, 2006 AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES\n       APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2006, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          Purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     17,348     69,535     86,883\n  Outlays..............................     18,792     50,456     69,248\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................     17,348     69,535     86,883\n  Outlays..............................     18,816     50,456     69,272\n2005 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.....................     18,253     71,954     90,207\n  Outlays..............................     18,649     49,563     68,212\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................     16,918     69,535     86,453\n  Outlays..............................     18,652     50,456     69,108\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     16,830     69,535     86,365\n  Outlays..............................     18,519     50,456     68,975\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................          0          0          0\n  Outlays..............................        -24          0        -24\n2005 Enacted:\n  Budget authority.....................       -905     -2,419     -3,324\n  Outlays..............................        143        893      1,036\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................        430          0        430\n  Outlays..............................        140          0        140\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................        518          0        518\n  Outlays..............................        273          0        273\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to the rounding.

Pintor\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on October 11, 2004, the Lima, OH, \nnewspaper received an e-mail that said the following:\n\n       Greetings, My name is Captain Dennis Pintor . . . I was \n     born and raised in Lima and lived there until I enlisted in \n     the Army in 1992. I am currently requesting the help of the \n     citizens of Lima to assist in our efforts here in Baghdad. \n     School here has just begun session and many of the students \n     need supplies . . . I tell you it makes a difference in the \n     kids and my soldiers. I appreciate any assistance . . . the \n     people of Lima can offer. Respectfully--Captain Dennis \n     Pintor.\n\n  Tragically, that same newspaper reported the captain's death just a \nfew days later. He was killed when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his patrol vehicle in Baghdad.\n  At the news of his death, family friend Lillian Abelita remembered \nthat Dennis was ``one of a kind'' and that he touched thousands of \nlives. She noted that Dennis's ``last wish was for the Iraqi \nchildren.'' ``It wasn't even for himself,'' she said. The focus of his \nlife had always been giving all that he had for others.\n  Dennis Pintor was born and raised in Lima by loving parents, Bert and \nEllen Pintor. He was the big brother whom siblings Bob, Sara, and Diana \nlooked up to.\n  Dennis attended Elida High School, where he belonged to several teams \nand clubs. He played soccer and tennis, was on the yearbook staff, and \nstarted the Red Knees Club for his fellow basketball players who didn't \nget much playing time. John Hullinger, a teammate, remembered that \n``Dennis was not one to complain about sitting on the bench. He made \nthe most of it and had fun with it.''\n  Dennis made the most of everything, including his academic studies. \nDennis wanted to learn. Alan Chum, a guidance counselor at Elida High \nSchool, had Dennis in several math classes. He recalled that Dennis was \nan ``inquisitive'' student who would ``bring an energy that kept the \nclass going.''\n  Teachers wanted Dennis in their classrooms. Allen emphasized that \n``[Dennis] had a knack for being able to answer questions and ask good, \nappropriate questions. He was just a good kid--great to have in \nclass.''\n  Dennis excelled academically and earned an appointment to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point where he trained to be an engineer. He \ngraduated in 1998 and then went on to complete Army Ranger School. \nDennis quickly became a well-respected superior who was known for \nputting his men first.\n  Dennis served as a peacekeeper in Kosovo--an assignment that suited \nhis desire to help those who needed it most. In 2002, Dennis was \nassigned as Company Commander of Bravo Company, 20th Engineer \nBattalion, based in Fort Hood, TX.\n  Dennis was Army through and through. One of Ellen Pintor's favorite \nmemories of her son is when he would visit her classroom at North \nMiddle School on Veterans Day. He would playfully give the kids orders \nand assign platoon leaders. Dennis would order the kids to stand in \nline and if they wouldn't do what he said quickly enough, he would \ncommand: ``Drop and give me five!'' Simultaneously, Dennis would drop \nto the floor and do push-ups with the kids.\n  While he was in the Army, Dennis was lucky enough to meet the love of \nhis life--Stacy--and married her in 2000. The two were meant for each \nother. Stacy called her husband, ``a glimpse of heaven.'' She said that \n``it was love that struck our souls. Individually we were strong, but \ntogether we were powerful.'' They were blessed with a baby girl, whom \nthey named Rhea.\n  Being together with his wife and daughter was so very important to \nDennis. However, he also felt a great sense of duty to his fellow \nsoldiers and to his Nation. His unit was called for deployment to Iraq \nin March 2004. Although it was difficult to leave his family, Dennis \nhad a job to do. While overseas, Dennis was in charge of rebuilding and \nsecuring the safety of several schools in Baghdad. Dennis realized that \nIraqi children needed help--and they needed supplies. He enlisted the \nhelp of those in his hometown of Lima to give what they could. As he \nhad so many times before, Dennis had the needs of others foremost in \nhis mind.\n  CPT Jay Wisham, a member of Dennis's unit, noted that he was not \nsurprised Dennis was trying to secure school supplies for the Iraqi \nchildren. He said this about Dennis:\n\n       He was just a very good guy all the way around. He firmly \n     believed in what we were doing over there. All he wanted to \n     do was make things better for whomever's life he touched.\n\n  Indeed, Dennis touched many lives.\n  After his service, Dennis wanted to return to West Point as a \nprofessor. David Garrison said this about his nephew:\n\n       [Dennis] refused to take the easy way through life. As an \n     officer, he was determined to receive all the tough training. \n     Unfortunately, America's future cadets will never have the \n     opportunity to learn what this West Point hero might have \n     taught.\n\n  Although Dennis will never teach those West Point cadets in the \nclassroom, he will teach them through his legacy. He will teach them \nthrough the love he had for his family and through the lives of those \nIraqi children, who now have the opportunity to go to school.\n  At the memorial service following Dennis's death, his uncle David \nexplained that ``was loved so strongly by so many because he loved so \nselflessly.'' The Reverend Henry Sattler, who married Dennis and Stacy, \nnoted that Dennis ``knew in the career he'd chosen that he may be asked \nto lay down his life for his friends . . . and he said yes.''\n  CPT Dennis Pintor was a selfless man. Thanks to his efforts, more \nthan 30 boxes of school supplies were sent to Iraq.\n  Thanks to his efforts, hundreds of Iraqi children have a chance for a \nbetter life.\n  Thanks to his efforts, the Iraqi people have a chance for freedom.\n  My wife Fran and I keep Dennis's wife and daughter and his parents \nand siblings in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                     Army Sergeant Benjamin Biskie\n\n  Mr. President, today I remember and pay tribute to a young man from \nVermillion, OH, who gave his life for our freedom and for the freedom \nof the people of Iraq.\n  Army Sgt Benjamin Biskie gave the ultimate sacrifice--his last true \nmeasure of devotion--on Christmas Eve, 2003. His vehicle struck an \nimprovised explosive device near Samarra, Iraq. He was 27 years old.\n  Ben was born and raised in Arizona with his two sisters, Andrea and \nDarlene. He attended Tucson Junior Academy until he moved with his \nmother, Della, to Ohio in 1993. There, he graduated from Vermillion \nHigh School one year later. Following graduation, Ben enlisted in the \nArmy, but not before he met his future wife, Marcie, that summer while \nworking at Cedar Point amusement park. The two quickly fell in love and \nwere married.\n  Although Ben was proud to serve in the U.S. Army, his crowning \nachievement was the birth of his son Benjamin, Jr. Ben's Army comrades \nremember how he constantly told stories about his son.\n  Ben trained at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, where he, Marcie, and Ben, Jr. \nmade their home. Ben, Sr. would eventually serve one year in South \nKorea before he was sent to the Middle East.\n  Though Ben did not want to leave his young family, he did not \nhesitate when he and the rest of the 5th Engineer Battalion, 1st \nEngineer Brigade were called to serve in Iraq in April 2003. The men of \nthe ``Fighting Fifth'' were attached to the 4th Infantry Division and \nwere tasked with laying roads and bridges for the Division's \nadvancement. Following the successful completion of that mission, Ben \nand the rest of the Battalion aided the reconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\n  Ben believed in the work he was doing to rebuild the lives of Iraqi \npeople. Like the dreams he had for his own son, Ben knew that his work \nwould give hope for a promising future to so many Iraqi children--hope \nthat had not previously existed.\n  As Fort Leonard Wood Chaplain Gregory Tyree said at the memorial \nservice in Ben's honor:\n\n       Maybe years from now . . . a person who today is but a \n     child in Iraq will look back through the pages of his life \n     and remember a soldier in a desert-colored uniform who cared \n     enough to help rebuild his school and came with a box of \n     school supplies. And maybe, just maybe, he will offer a word \n     of thanks for Sergeant Ben Biskie and the gift of freedom he \n     died to give him.\n\n  On an Internet website honoring our Nation's fallen service men and \nwomen, Ben Biskie's sister-in-law Ginger tried her best to express her \nfeelings and her gratitude. She wrote the following:\n\n       Ben--you are always on my mind. I've been thinking about \n     you a lot lately and everything that I wish I could say to \n     you. Most importantly of all is thank you. Thank you, Ben, \n     for fighting for our freedom. Thank you, Ben, for making my \n     sister so happy and for giving me the greatest nephew anyone \n     could ask for. Thank you, Ben, for all of the lessons you \n     have taught me, even if I didn't see the entirety of them \n     until after you were taken from us. Thank you, Ben, for \n     coming to visit me in my dreams on days when you know I need \n     you the most. You are a true hero who will never be \n     forgotten.\n\n  Indeed, we will always remember Benjamin Biskie. He was a devoted \nhusband, a doting father, and a selfless soldier, who dedicated his \nlife to helping people he did not know while protecting those he loved \nat home. On that Christmas Eve in 2003, our Nation lost a great man.\n  I would like to close with the words of Ben's wife, Marcie. Knowing \nhow much her husband loved her and their son, she said the following:\n\n       I don't know where our lives will take us now, but I know \n     that wherever that may be, we'll have an angel following, \n     keeping an eye out for his little boy. [Ben] was a true hero.\n\n  Sgt Benjamin Biskie will live on in the hearts and minds of all those \nwho knew him. His family remains in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n              Marine Lance Corporal Michael J. Smith, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I today pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan and true \nAmerican hero. Marine LCpl Michael Smith, Jr., was killed on April 17, \n2004, in Al Anbar Province, Iraq. Michael was coming to the aid of his \nSergeant who had been shot. Michael was just 21 years-old.\n  In his brief 21 years on this earth, Michael Smith, Jr., touched \ncountless lives. Described as outgoing and personable, Michael's \ngrandmother Alice once said that her grandson could ``walk into a room \nand no one was a stranger to him.'' Everyone loved him.\n  Michael spent his youth crossing the Ohio River between Wellsburg, \nWV, where his father lived, and Wintersville, OH, where his mother \nresided. Known as the ``funny little redheaded kid,'' Michael and his \ncousin were partners in crime who loved to play pranks and revel in \nwhat many called their ``offbeat sense of humor.'' Though they loved to \nplay tricks on people, cousin, Amy White, noted that Michael was a \n``really sweet kid. He was the kind of kid who would do anything for \nyou.''\n  Michael would carry this reputation throughout his life. He attended \nBrooke High School in Wellsburg, where he was a diligent student, \ngifted athlete, and an active participant in school clubs--including \none tasked with discouraging fellow teens from using drugs and alcohol. \nOn the high school football team, Michael earned the nickname ``All-\nPurpose Smitty'' because he could play any position. Michael was also a \nvolunteer firefighter for the Bethany Pike Fire Department in West \nVirginia, which he formally joined when he was 18 years-old.\n  Ernestein Gorby, a guidance counselor at the high school, once \nremarked that ``[Michael] was a very pleasant young man--kind of what I \nwould call the `solid citizen,' the person who you'd want to be your \nnext-door neighbor. He was reliable. He was serious about school.''\n  After high school, Michael wanted to take the next step and help his \ncountry. When he was 17, he urged his mother, Marianne, to support his \ndecision to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. Though she was hesitant, \nMarianne knew that her son would follow his own path. And so, on \nFebruary 9, 2001, Michael enlisted. Marianne instantly found it ironic \nthat her freckled redheaded son was stationed at sunny Twentynine \nPalms, CA, with the rest of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st \nMarine Division.\n  Michael was first deployed to Kuwait and then Iraq in January 2003, \nand was part of the original advance on Baghdad. He then returned to \nthe United States in September 2003, to do something he had been \nplanning for almost a year--and that was to marry Alicia, his high \nschool sweetheart.\n  Alicia and Michael had been friends since the fifth grade. That \nfriendship eventually grew into a romance, and the two were married on \nOctober 11, 2003. Alicia described her husband as an incredible man and \na wonderful father to her young daughter Elizabeth. ``He's always been \nmy hero,'' she said, ``[and] an amazing husband, my best friend, and a \nremarkable daddy to Elizabeth.''\n  In February 2004, Michael was called back to Iraq. Shortly after \nbeing redeployed, Alicia called with the news that she was pregnant. \nTragically, Michael never had the chance to meet his son, who was born \non October 16, 2004, 6 months after Michael's death. One day before he \ndied, Michael was able to talk to Alicia via satellite phone. Alicia \nsaid that ``he just called to tell me he loved me with all his heart \nand soul.''\n  Michael was loved by all those who met him. When he died, the entire \ncommunity felt the loss. As he attempted to describe his son to \nreporters, Michael's dad, Michael Smith, Sr., noted that ``there's not \nenough tape in the cameras or time in the world [to do that].''\n  The service for LCpl Michael Smith was held at Grace Lutheran Church \nin Steubenville, OH--the same church where Michael was baptized, \nconfirmed, and married. Church members remember Michael as a moral \nguide--``a man who inspired them with laughter, love, and quiet \nleadership.'' Pastor Bethel Bateson recalls that on Michael's last \nmilitary leave, he walked through the church and thanked everyone for \ntheir prayers, their letters, and their packages.\n  Those whom Michael thanked that day came back to the church to say \ngoodbye. At the service held in Michael's honor, Pastor Bateson \ncommented that it was the most difficult service over which she had \never presided, ``because that beautiful red-haired boy playing under \nthe pews grew up to be an incredible man.'' She went to say that ``even \nthough he was only 21, a lot of us really looked up to him. . . . He \nwas so strong--physically strong--but so tender. He had a tremendous \ncapacity for love.''\n  I would like to close my remarks with the words of Marine Sgt Jason \nLong, who served as Michael's squadron leader. Following Michael's \ndeath, Sergeant Long wrote the following on an Internet tribute:\n\n       My heart goes out to Michael's family. I send my deepest \n     regrets. I could always count on [Michael] to get the job \n     done if ever I wasn't around. He was a great man and Marine \n     and an exceptional artist, as well. He showed great bravery \n     in the face of the enemy. I only wish I was there with him to \n     keep him out of danger. I could always count on him to give \n     me a laugh when times were tough. We will meet again someday, \n     my fellow Marine.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that Michael's fellow Marines and his family \nwill forever cherish the memory of their comrade, son, brother, \nhusband, and father. His tremendous capacity for love shaped their \nlives. We will never forget him.\n\n\n                              Luke Petrik\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this afternoon to pay \ntribute to a remarkable young man who died in defense of freedom. Luke \nAdam Petrik of Conneaut, OH, was killed on April 21, 2005, when his \nhelicopter was shot down a few miles north of Baghdad, Iraq. He was 24 \nyears old.\n  Luke was one of those special and courageous individuals, who spent \nhis life defending others. At the time of his death, he was working for \na private security company to provide protection to American diplomats \nin Iraq. Previously, he had served as a decorated Army Ranger, with \ntours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. After his work in security, Luke \nhad hopes of rejoining the military as a Navy SEAL. Luke knew the risks \nand accepted the challenges of this life.\n  Born on April 1, 1981, in Ohio, Luke knew from a young age that he \nwanted\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\nto live a life of adventure. As a young boy, he joined the Boy Scouts. \nLuke's Scout leader, and the man who would later serve as his high \nschool principal, John Posila, remembers Luke as ``an exceptional kid \nand very, very intelligent. From the time Luke was in Scouting, he had \nan interest in the military.''\n  In every aspect of his life, Luke sought out new experiences. His \nboyhood friend, Josh Brooks, said that ``you would get a million \nstories with Luke. Every time you hung out with him, there would be \nsome kind of story.'' Along with memorable stories, spending time with \nLuke also meant that much laughter would ensue. Luke had a great sense \nof humor, according to everybody who knew him. Friends contend that \nthere was no one who told worse jokes. He told jokes that were so bad, \naccording to his friends, that you couldn't help but crack up. Although \nhe was everything that you would expect from a future Army Ranger--\ntough, disciplined, smart, and courageous--he was also riotously funny.\n  Throughout his time at Conneaut High School, Luke knew that he wanted \nto serve in the military on the front lines. Upon graduation in 1999, \nhe immediately enlisted in the Army and trained to join that elite \nfighting force, the Army Rangers. Given his discipline and desire, it \nis no surprise that he was successful. As a paratrooper in the 3rd \nRanger Battalion, Luke joined in the hunt for Osama bin Laden in \nAfghanistan.\n  Luke's experience with the Rangers was a perfect opportunity for him \nto demonstrate his extraordinary bravery and toughness--toughness that \nwas legendary among his family and friends. Luke's stepfather, Eldridge \nSmith, remembers a remarkable story. While parachuting for a mission, \nLuke broke two bones in his foot. He was slated to be airlifted to a \nmedical hospital in Germany for treatment. However, just before the \nplane was scheduled to leave with him, he walked away and hitchhiked \nacross three countries to rejoin his company. You see, Luke felt a \nprofound sense of duty and--broken foot or not--he would never abandon \nhis mission or his men.\n  Luke's experience in the military also revealed the way he lived his \nwhole life, which was by a personal code of honor. Josh Brooks \nremembers his friend as a man of principle. On two separate occasions, \nLuke turned down--yes, turned down--a Purple Heart, saying he didn't \ndeserve the award. Josh says that both that broken foot and Iraqi \nshrapnel he later took in his body would qualify him for the honor. But \nfor Luke it was simple. Josh recalled, ``He didn't feel that he earned \n[the medals]. He did things his own way.'' Luke respected the medals \nand what they symbolized enough to refuse them.\n  After having served two tours of duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan, \nLuke left the military in late 2003. After a brief period doing \nsecurity work at a Virginia nuclear powerplant, Luke accepted an offer \nin 2004 to work for Blackwater Security Consulting. Blackwater \nspecializes in providing security and support to the military, \nGovernment agencies, law enforcement groups, and civilians operating in \nhostile regions. Luke wanted to get back to work in Iraq, and \nBlackwater would give him that opportunity.\n  While Luke was always full of stories, he was careful to focus on the \ngood he was doing. He would rather talk about the good than the danger \nand destruction around him. His friend, Chuck Lawrence, had this to say \nabout Luke's return to Iraq: ``I talked to him just about every day. He \nloved his job and had no regrets. He never regretted his decision to go \nover there [to Iraq]. He was doing what he loved.''\n  Luke's mother, Diana Spencer, agreed, saying that ``he enjoyed his \nwork. He was very focused, very patriotic, and felt he was protecting \nhis country.''\n  Luke's time at Blackwater whetted his appetite for more service in \nthe military. He told his family in one of his last e-mails home that \nhe wanted to become a Navy SEAL. His stepfather said that Luke ``missed \nspecial operations work [and that] he had a warrior's heart and had to \ndo what he loved.''\n  Tragically, though, Luke would not get the chance to become a Navy \nSEAL. On April 21, 2005, he boarded a helicopter flight bound for \nTikrit. He was going there to provide security detail for American \ndiplomats. His helicopter was shot down by insurgents a few miles north \nof Baghdad. Luke and the 10 other civilian passengers and flight crew \nwere killed.\n  A memorial service was held for Luke on Saturday, May 7, 2005, at the \nFirst United Methodist Church in his hometown of Conneaut. Pews were \npacked with mourners, from former schoolmates to friends, family, and \nhis fellow Rangers. Atop the casket was an American flag and a flower \narrangement reading ``Ranger.'' All those closest to Luke agreed that \nthis was certainly fitting.\n  His mother Diana tearfully recalled that a plaque that Luke received \nafter his discharge from the Army Rangers summed up his character. It \nreads: ``To a friend, a mentor, and the living embodiment of the Ranger \ncreed.'' As Diana put it; ``That says everything about Luke.''\n  The service provided an opportunity for all of Luke's friends to \nreflect on how much he meant to them and how much he had taught them \nboth through word and deed. Chuck Lawrence remembers his essential \ndecency, saying that ``anyone who came in contact with Luke was better \noff for it. I never met anyone more genuine.'' Childhood friend, C.J. \nWelty says that ``Luke taught me [that] there is a lot to learn, and to \ndo as much as you can in the short time [you have] here on Earth.''\n  In observance of Arbor Day, the Conneaut Tree Commission hosted a \ntree planting ceremony at Malek Park Arboretum to honor local men and \nwomen serving in Iraq. A red oak tree was planted in Luke's memory. It \nserves as a symbol of life and strength. That is how Luke should be \nremembered--as a vital, happy young man.\n  In a beautiful letter to me, Luke's stepfather Eldridge wrote that \n``I am having a life celebration for Luke and the way he lived his \nlife, where the good memories will far outweigh the oppressive grief.''\n  My wife Fran and I keep all of Luke's family and friends in our \nprayers. Luke Petrik will never be forgotten.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10178-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10178-S10181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today in North Carolina, the Secretary \nof Education, Margaret Spellings, delivered remarks that announced her \nintention to create a commission to take a comprehensive look at \npostsecondary education in the United States. I am here to say that \nSecretary Spellings is on exactly the right track with her new \ncommission. The idea is an excellent one and long overdue. While the \nUnited States has been conducting a lot of debates--many in this \nChamber--about outsourcing jobs, we have been very successfully \ninsourcing brain power. Insourcing brain power has been our secret \nweapon for job growth. It is the main reason we have 5 percent of the \nworld's population and about one-third of the world's money. Our \nunrivaled system of colleges and universities, together with our \nnational research laboratories, have been our magnet for attracting and \nkeeping home the best minds in the world who have, in turn, helped \nprovide the new jobs produced by science, who have, in turn, helped \nprovide half the new jobs since World War II. The National Academy of \nSciences estimates that one-half of our new jobs since World War II \nhave come from advances in science and technology. This secret weapon \nfor jobs' growth is at risk if we do not take several urgently needed \nsteps. Taking a comprehensive look at the Federal role in higher \neducation is a good first step. This should have happened years ago. In \nfact, my greatest regret, as Secretary of Education under the first \nPresident Bush, is that I did not volunteer to be the point person in \nhigher education in the Federal Government. Almost every Federal agency \nregulates some aspect of higher education. Last year, the Federal \nGovernment, all\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nacross the board, spent about $63 billion on all forms of postsecondary \neducation. That includes grants, as well as what call the Pell grants, \nstudent loans, money for research, the cost to the Federal taxpayers of \nthe student loans I mentioned. But despite that great interest and \ndespite the fact that nearly every Federal agency is involved, not just \nthe Department of Education, there is no one Federal official charged \nwith giving the President an overview of higher education.\n  There was a time 12 years ago--and the Presiding Officer, because of \nhis interest in higher education, may remember this--that the \nDepartment of Defense was concerned about being overcharged by many of \nthe universities in the amount of overhead the universities were \nspending in order to do Department of Defense-sponsored research. That \nwas a legitimate concern, but someone other than the Secretary of \nDefense should have been in the room advising the President about that \nbecause these universities, which were having to cough up money to pay \nback the Federal Government, which perhaps they should have, we needed \nto make sure, in our national interest, that we did not damage these \ngreat research universities that we have because those great research \nuniversities have been a major part of giving us the science and \ntechnology edge that gives us our standard of living. That is what I \nmean by saying there has been no one person in the Federal Government \nappointed by the President to look at the whole range of activities in \npostsecondary higher education, and there should be.\n  I am chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, a committee upon which the \nPresiding Officer serves. With the consent of our committee chairman, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman and I--Senator Bingaman is the \nranking Democrat on the Energy Committee--have asked the National \nAcademy of Sciences to recommend steps that the Nation should take over \nthe next 10 years so that we can keep our edge in science and \ntechnology while we are grappling with tough budget issues. Those \nhearings will begin in October. The hearings that Senator Bingaman and \nI intend to conduct on keeping our edge in science and technology \nshould complement the work of the commission that Secretary Spellings \nhas established to take a comprehensive overview of higher education.\n  Our colleges and universities are at risk for several reasons. I am \nnot suggesting that we suddenly have an emergency crisis. I am \nsuggesting that we would be wise to look down the road to make sure we \ndon't have a crisis. I believe we not only have the best colleges and \nuniversities in the world. I believe we have almost all of the best \ncolleges and universities in the world. When you add to that the unique \nnational research laboratories which we have, such as the Oak Ridge \nlaboratory or Sandia or a couple of dozen of those that we have, we \nhave an unparalleled research capacity.\n  Here are the reasons our colleges and universities may be at risk if \nwe don't pay close attention:\n  No. 1, State funding, the principal basis of support for higher \neducation traditionally grew only 6.8 percent during the last 5 years. \nState Medicaid costs are squeezing State budgets. If this trend \ncontinues, the result will be lower quality higher education and much \nhigher student tuition. I brought with me two charts to illustrate what \nI am talking about. Here is a chart on trends in higher education \nnationally over the last 5 years since 2000. State spending on Medicaid \nis up 35.6 percent over those 5 years. State spending on higher \neducation is up 6.8 percent over the 5 years. And tuition at a 4-year \npublic university is up 38 percent over the 5 years. That is the State \npicture.\n  At the same time, the Federal Government has been doing pretty well. \nFederal spending on all forms of postsecondary education over those \nlast 5 years has risen 71.8 percent. So the picture has been that in \nthe States, State spending on Medicaid is up. State spending on higher \neducation is flat, pretty flat. And tuition at 4-year public \nuniversities is up, way up.\n  In my own State of Tennessee, the situation is even more pronounced. \nTennessee's spending on Medicaid in the last 5 years is up 71 percent. \nState spending on higher education during that time is only up 10 \npercent. Tuition at a 4-year public university in Tennessee over those \n5 years is up 43 percent. Medicaid spending is way up, and State \nspending on higher education is fairly flat. Tuition at 4-year public \nuniversities is way up. That is a bad trend, if it continues over the \nnext 10 years.\n  A second reason that our university system may be at risk is that \neven though Federal funding for all forms of postsecondary education \nhas been generous over the last 5 years, up 71.8 percent, that kind of \nincrease is not likely to continue as Medicaid, Medicare, and Social \nSecurity costs put new pressures on the Federal budget. That is one \nreason Senator Bingaman and I have asked the National Academy of \nSciences to suggest to us the 8 or 10 things we must be sure to do to \nkeep our edge in science and technology over the next 10 years. Because \nwhile we are grappling with the budget to try to restrain the growth in \nspending, we want to make sure we don't squeeze out investments in \nscience and technology that give us the standard of living we enjoy \ntoday.\n  The next reason that higher education may be at some risk is national \nsecurity. Tight visa rules and other national security restrictions are \nmaking it harder for the more than one-half million foreign students \nand additional researchers who now come to our universities and \nlaboratories. More importantly, scientific conferences are being held \noverseas. We have taken for granted that we have been insourcing \nbrains. The brightest students and researchers from China, the \nbrightest from India, from France, from Germany, where do they want to \ngo? They want to come to the United States.\n  When we were Governors of Tennessee and Virginia, we would sometimes \nhear complaints from students who were being taught by graduate \nstudents who did not speak English very well. But the fact is, these \nbrilliant people from around the world, more than a half million of \nthem, have come here to do the kind of work that helps us create our \nhigh standard of living. Sixty percent of our postdoctoral students are \nforeign students. One-half of our graduate students in computers, \nengineering, and in sciences are foreign students.\n  In a way, it is a little like our natural gas problem. We are going \nto be importing liquefied natural gas from overseas to try to keep our \nprices down. We are already importing brainpower from overseas to keep \nour standard of living up. And while we need to put a focus on \nhomegrown brainpower over the next 10 years, we also need to make sure \nthat our universities and colleges continue to be a magnet for the \nbrightest people from around the world.\n  At the same time, we have something else happening. Many countries, \nincluding India, China, Germany, and Great Britain, are reorganizing \nand improving funding for their universities and creating incentives to \nkeep their most talented students and researchers home. They are asking \nthemselves: Why should we send our brightest minds overseas to help the \nAmericans create a higher standard of living for themselves when they \ncan do it right here at home?\n  So we are going to be facing more competition from the Indian \nGovernment. Chancellor Schroeder, who was visiting with us a few weeks \nago, was talking about the amount of new dollars Germany is putting \ninto its universities. They believe they have become overregulated, \nthat they have become bureaucratized, and that they have become, in \nsome cases, mediocre. He knows that if Germany wants to compete and \nwants to have a higher standard of living, they are going to have to \nhave better universities that are magnets for keeping home their \nbrightest students and researchers and attracting the best from around \nthe world.\n  There is one red flag I would like to wave, in conclusion, about the \nearly reports on Secretary Spellings' decision to create a higher \neducation commission to take a comprehensive look at the Federal role \nin postsecondary education. Some have pointed out that our system of \nhigher education in the United States is very decentralized, and it may \nbe for that reason that we are not taking a comprehensive look at \nhigher education.\n  I, for one, believe that our decentralized system of higher education \nin the\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\nUnited States is one of its greatest possible strengths. The model we \nuse for higher education is a very simple one. It is a marketplace \nmodel. We have more than 6,000 institutions--public, private, for-\nprofit, nonprofit. They are autonomous, and we respect their autonomy.\n  We have generous Federal funds that follow 60 percent of our students \nto the institutions they choose with Federal grants or Federal loans. \nWe have peer-reviewed research that goes to the very best institutions. \nSo I do not want to see any Federal commission that sends a signal that \nwe may need some Federal centralization of our control over higher \neducation. In fact, we need to be doing just the reverse.\n  I introduced earlier this year legislation that would help to \nderegulate higher education, and a number of those provisions have been \nincorporated into the Higher Education Act that was reported by our \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I believe our higher \neducation system is the best in the world because it is decentralized, \nbecause institutions are autonomous, the Federal Government has been \ngenerous, and the money follows the students to the institutions of the \nstudents' choice.\n  I commend the Secretary of Education today for her attracting such \noutstanding persons--for example, the former Governor of North \nCarolina, Jim Hunt, to be a member of this commission; Charles Miller, \nformer chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas, to \nbe chairman of the commission.\n  I cannot think of more important work to do. We not only need to \ninsource brainpower, we need to home grow a lot more of our brainpower, \nand if we do not, we will not enjoy this standard of living that we \nhave had.\n  I can recall last year a meeting in the majority leader's office that \nSenator Frist and the Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, hosted. \nIt was an opportunity for several of the Senators to meet the former \nPresident of Brazil, Mr. Cardoso. He had spent a semester here in \nresidence at the Library of Congress. I remember Senator Hutchison's \nlast question to President Cardoso. She said: Mr. President, when you \ngo back to Brazil, what will you take back home with you about the \nUnited States of America?\n  President Cardoso didn't hesitate a minute. He said: The excellence \nof the American university. There is nothing in the world like it.\n  That is a great compliment to our country and to our system of higher \neducation from one of the most erudite men in the world, the former \nPresident of Brazil.\n  But the yellow flags and red flags are waving because as we look \nahead over the next 10 years, our system of higher education and, \ntherefore, our standard of living is at risk because of a flat State \nfunding, because of upcoming pressures on the Federal budget, because \nof tight visa rules and other national security concerns, which are \nunderstandable but will have this effect, and because other countries \nin the world are recognizing there is no reason in the world why the \nAmericans should have 5 percent of the people and a third of the money. \nThey have the same brains we have in India, in China, in Germany, so we \nwill just keep our smarter people at home, they are saying, and we will \ncreate that standard of living for ourselves.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Spellings. I would like, 10 \nyears from now when the majority leader invites the former President of \nBrazil or any other President of a country to the office and we turn \naround and say to that person, Mr. President, what will you take home \nabout the United States? I would like for that President of another \ncountry to be able to say to us: The American university. There is \nnothing like it in the world.\n  I believe that is true, but I believe we have some work to do over \nthe next 10 years to keep that truth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Congressional \nRecord two charts that I referred to in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Higher Education: Trends in State Spending and Tuition Increases\n\n       Tennessee since 2000:\n       Tennessee state spending on Medicaid up 71.1 percent.\n       Tennessee state spending on higher

Research of Postsecondary.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would also like to follow my remarks \nwith this information from the American Council on Education that sheds \nadditional light on the comparison of State and Federal spending.\n  In 1995, the State spent $2.16 on higher education for every Federal \ndollar spent on higher education. In 2000, States contributed $1.55 for \nevery Federal dollar spent on higher education. In 2005, States spent \n94 cents on higher education for every Federal dollar spent.\n  So very quietly, we are seeing a major shift in how we finance higher \neducation. States are doing less, the Federal Government is continuing \nto\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nbe generous, and students are asked to do more. The insidious part of \nthis is that traditionally, States have been the largest part of \nfunding for higher education. So very quietly we see States go from \nspending $2.16 for every dollar spent, which was the case in 1995, to \nless than $1 spent for every Federal dollar spent, which is the case 10 \nyears later in 2005.\n  That is a major shift in funding, and we in the Congress and \nSecretary Spellings' new commission and the work Senator Bingaman and I \nare doing with the National Academy of Sciences need to take note of \nthis and ask what will happen if we have 10 more years of these \nfinancing trends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, before I get into the third branch of \nGovernment, I want to remark and associate myself with many of the \ncomments that were stated by Senator Alexander of Tennessee. I do \nbelieve this country, for its long-term competitiveness, must interest \nand encourage more young people to get involved in science, \nengineering, and technology.\n  The fact is, 40 to 50 percent of our students in engineering schools \nare from overseas. That is good. America ought to be a magnet for the \nbest brains in the world. I want this country to be the world capital \nof innovation, and to be the world capital of innovation, we need more \nyoung people interested in engineering, technology, and science.\n  I have a great concern that we are not matriculating sufficient \nnumbers of students in this country in areas where new inventions and \ninnovations and intellectual property will be created. We have about--\nand I think the Senator from Tennessee will corroborate this--50,000 \nengineers graduating every year. India has about 150,000 engineers \ngraduating every year. The People's Republic of China has 250,000 \nengineers graduating every year.\n  There are a variety of things we must do in this country to be more \ncompetitive, to make sure young people are getting a good quality \neducation and also develop an interest in science, technology, and \nengineering. These are great-paying jobs that are important for the \nsecurity of this country, our standard of living, and our \ncompetitiveness. Until we reverse these trends, I believe it is going \nto be a problem for us in the long term. Indeed, the Senator from \nTennessee and I have worked together on a variety of issues, including \nupgrading the technology capability of minority-serving institutions, \nwhether they are historically Black colleges or Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions or tribal colleges.\n  We also have to recognize in our engineering schools that about 15 \npercent of the students are women, about 6 percent are African \nAmerican, and only about 6 percent are Latinos. We need to get more of \nour country interested in engineering. Meanwhile, of course, we should \nbe attracting more students from overseas because if they come to this \ncountry for education--and higher education. It is vitally important \nfor our future and the future of the young people, for these graduates \nto stay in this country which I hope they do. That will continue to \nmake this country a leader in innovation in the transformative \ntechnologies of the future. Whether it is nanotechnology, which is a \nmultifaceted discipline or life sciences or microelectronics or energy \napplications to also materials engineering.\n  I associate myself with the remarks and sentiment of Senator \nAlexander who, of course, more important than being Secretary of \nEducation, was also president of the University of Tennessee. Senator \nAlexander understands how our very diverse and multifaceted higher \neducation systems in all the different States of the Union are really \ncrown jewels. We must work with our colleges and universities to \nattract more young people--people of all ages--into technology, \nengineering, and science, and also be conducive to people coming from \noverseas.\n  I recall in our formulations hearing, when Dr. Rice was before us, \none of the points I talked with her about getting student visas working \nbetter. Students are too queued up overseas. Visa requirements are \nanother impediment for students coming from countries in Europe, Asia, \nor anywhere else in the world. If they are all queued up, they think, \nthey are not welcome in this country, it is too bureaucratic. Hopefully \nthe State Department will work with our Homeland Security people to \nmake sure quality, well-qualified people from overseas can matriculate \nto our universities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10181-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10181-S10183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROBERTS NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. With that diatribe or statement on innovation and \ninvention completed, I switch to a place where I do not like invention, \nand that is in the judiciary. We have entirely too many judges in this \ncountry who invent the law rather than apply the law. I speak on this \nsubject that is very timely because the Judiciary Committee is now \nconsidering--I know the Presiding Officer has been involved in those \nhearings--on Judge John Roberts, whom I sincerely hope will soon be on \nthe floor for a vote, and confirmed to be our next Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  When I met with Judge Roberts in my office last month, I relayed to \nhim my concern about Federal judges acting as a superlegislative body, \nacting as legislators. There are judges who seem to be interpreting the \nlaws passed by the elected representatives in a way that they think \nthey know better than the elected people.\n  This country is a republic. The people of this country are the owners \nof the Government. Their views, their values, their aspirations are \nrepresented by those they elect. Sometimes it is at the local level, \nwhether it is a county, city, or parish in Louisiana, or it will be a \nState legislature or for national, Federal laws, the people they elect \nto Congress and, obviously, Governors, as well as mayors, and the \nPresident of the United States in this representative democracy.\n  In so many cases we see Federal judges who are appointed for life \nmaking decisions that completely negate and have very little respect \nfor the will of the people as expressed through their legislative \nbodies.\n  We see Federal courts striking down parental consent or parental \nnotification laws. These are laws that States passed--we did it while I \nwas Governor of Virginia, and so have other States. These laws say that \nif an unwed minor daughter is going through the trauma of an abortion, \na parent ought to be involved. It makes sense. For ear piercing, \ntattoos, taking an aspirin, one needs parental consent. Certainly for \nthis surgery, it makes sense, and many legislatures and the people in \nthe States said the parents ought to be involved. Federal judges struck \ndown that law.\n  There are those who believe parameters ought to be placed on late-\nterm, partial-birth abortion. That law was passed by the Congress and \nby various States. Federal judges struck that down.\n  We find Federal judges allowing attacks on the Boy Scouts. We see \nsome judges, not necessarily Federal judges yet, but some judges \nredefining marriage. We see judges time after time making these \ndecisions. Some folks wonder what is an activist judge. I did not get \ninto specific cases with Judge Roberts when I was talking with him, but \none of the prime examples was this Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that \nwas striking down the will of the people in California in certain \ncounties where the Pledge of Allegiance is said in their public schools \nevery day.\n  The Ninth Circuit struck that down and said, no, the Pledge of \nAllegiance cannot be recited in public schools in California because of \nthe words ``under God'' being in the pledge. This is a prime example of \njudicial activism, contrary to the will of the people of these counties \nin California.\n  That case got to the Supreme Court. They avoided the decision, saying \nthat the plaintiff did not have standing. That is a way for the U.S. \nSupreme Court to avoid making a decision.\n  Just last week we had another Federal district court judge in \nCalifornia striking down or saying that the Pledge of Allegiance cannot \nbe recited in public schools in California because\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nof the words ``under God.'' This judge was following the Ninth Circuit \nin which California is located.\n  I will give some of my colleagues a bit of legal education. When \nthere is a legal analysis of an unconstitutional establishment of \nreligion, the Supreme Court has applied a three-pronged test. This \nthree-pronged test applies to all the States in the country, even these \nFederal courts in California who strike down laws and misconstrue the \nConstitution, thwarting the will of the good people of California. Here \nis the test that the U.S. Supreme Court has applied in such cases.\n\n  The test as articulated in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Lemon v. \nKurtzman. It is called the Lemon test. The first test is used to \ndetermine whether public activity had a primarily secular purpose. In \nthis matter in California, the Pledge of Allegiance is primarily a \npatriotic event and purpose.\n  The second test is called the endorsement test. In this California \nmatter, there is no endorsement of any denomination of any religion. So \nthe endorsement test fails because there is no endorsement.\n  The third test is called the coercion test, and there is no coercion \nhere for students.\n  The Supreme Court has commented that the presence of ``one nation \nunder God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional, as has most \nrecently the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes the \ncircuit of Virginia, the Carolinas, West Virginia, and Maryland. The \nFourth Circuit ruled in a case called Myers v. Loudoun County Public \nSchools that the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional.\n  If this current decision in California that came down last week is \nnot remedied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, I surely hope the \nSupreme Court of the United States will grant review to resolve this \ndispute between the circuits, because there are sometimes judges who \nhave to be reversed on many occasions before they understand the plain \nintent of the law, of previous opinions, and the history of our \ncountry. These judges must have the proper respect for the people in \nthis country to make laws that make sense, that are constitutional, and \nindicate their will.\n  As a resource for both the Ninth Circuit and, if necessary, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, if this case reaches them. I direct the attention of my \ncolleagues to some outstanding historical analyses prepared by a \ngentleman from Texas named David Barton. Mr. Barton heads up and is \npart of an organization called Wall Builders and he noted if reciting \nthe pledge is truly a religious act in violation of the establishment \nclause, then the recitation of the Constitution itself would be, which \nrefers to ``the year of Our Lord,'' and our Declaration of Independence \nwhich contains multiple references to God.\n  Our Founders claimed the right to dissolve the political bands with \nBritain based on the laws of nature and of nature's God.\n  The most well-known passage, of course, is ``all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights.''\n  Subsequently, the signatories of our Constitution and a variety of \nother documents appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world to rectify \ntheir intentions. Our national motto is, ``In God we trust.'' And the \nsinging of the National Anthem actually has a verse and motto ``in God \nwe trust.''\n  Furthermore, the Supreme Court of the United States, even the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, opens its sessions with a call that says \n``God save the United States and this honorable court.'' This is the \nsame court that said: No, you cannot have the Pledge of Allegiance in \npublic schools. Obviously, we all recognize today as the Senate opened \nup there was a prayer, and then there was the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  There is an undeniable and historical relationship between God and \nour Founders and the Government leaders throughout the history of our \ncountry. In fact, it was the Congress in 1837, acting upon the will of \nthe people, that authorized the motto ``In God we trust'' to be printed \non our currency.\n  We can cite the actions of the entire body of the Founding Fathers. \nFor example, in 1800, when Washington, DC, became the capital of the \nUnited States, Congress approved the use of this Capitol Building as a \nchurch building for Christian worship services. In fact, Christian \nworship services on Sunday started at the Treasury Building and at the \nWar Office.\n  A scant review of the legislative history of the States and of the \nFederal Government reveals the intent of our Founders from George \nWashington to Thomas Jefferson who lay out the absurdity and even the \narrogance of this district court decision.\n  Everyone knows--maybe not everyone knows. Most of my learned \ncolleagues know one of the things that Thomas Jefferson was most proud \nof was authoring the Declaration of Independence, founding the \nUniversity of Virginia, and the third, no, was not the Louisiana \nPurchase--although that was the best real estate deal ever made--the \nthing he was thirdly most proudly of and is on his tombstone is \n``Author of the Statute of Religious Freedom.''\n  If one reads the Statute of Religion Freedom--it is in article 1, \nsection 16 of the Virginia Constitution--it is much better than the \nfirst amendment in the Constitution of the United States and the Bill \nof Rights because it goes on for paragraphs. One gets the sense of how \nthere was not to be the establishment of religion, that people would \nnot be forced or compelled to join a church contrary to their views, \nthat they would not have to tithe or pay for a church, and people's \nrights were not to be enhanced or diminished on account of their \nreligious beliefs.\n  Mr. Jefferson was elected in 1800. He took office in 1801, at the \nsame time that this Capitol Building was being used for Christian \nworship services.\n  If the author of the Statute of Religious Freedom--and it was \nauthored before the Federal Constitution and adopted in part of the \nBill of Rights--if he thought that was going to be an establishment of \nreligion or the Government funding religion, or compelling people to \nworship in a broad Christian sense, not Baptist versus Methodist versus \nAnglicans or Episcopalians or other denominations. If he saw that as \nan establishment of religion, he surely would have objected to it \nbecause he became President in 1801 right when DC became the Nation's \nCapital.\n\n  That is the sense of history of the foundation of our country, and \nthe law. It is a shame that the majority of justices on the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals do not seem to understand this.\n  Each of us who has the high privilege to serve in this Chamber is \naware of the circumstances by which ``one nation under God'' became a \npart of the pledge in 1954. It was a will of Congress. Where did \nCongress get the idea, they got the idea from the people. The will of \nthe people. Congress acted and that was made part of our Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  Today it is the will, unfortunately, of a few unelected judges that \nseek to remove those words from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  When one is dealing with Federal judges, they must get into the \nhistory, once again, that they are appointed for life. Most States do \nnot have judges appointed for life; they are appointed for terms. The \npeople have recourse from time to time to remove them. California has a \nway of recourse on State judges who are first appointed, but then there \nis a retention possibility.\n  Federal judges, though--unfortunately Alexander Hamilton won this \ndebate with Mr. Jefferson who wanted judges appointed for terms. \nHamilton wanted them for life and Hamilton won. These Federal judges \nget selected and they are on there for life.\n  Something that I know the Presiding Officer and I and others try to \ndo is try to discern their views. Judges ought to have a greater \nrespect for the will of the people.\n  The State of California is not unique in encouraging students to \nengage in an appropriate patriotic exercise.\n  In my Commonwealth of Virginia, we have a statute requiring a daily \nrecitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in every public classroom in our \nCommonwealth. It is thoughtfully crafted. The Virginia statute provides \nthat no student shall be compelled to recite the pledge if he, his \nparent, or legal guardian objects on religious, philosophical, or other \ngrounds to his participation in this exercise. Students are thus exempt \nfrom reciting the pledge and shall remain quietly standing or sitting \nat their desk while others recite the pledge.\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\n  The reason I talk about this is when I was Governor in 1996, I was \nable to sign, and happy to sign, this into law. It is a law that has \ncommonsense provisions requiring the Pledge of Allegiance, but also \nwith provisions to develop guidelines for reciting the pledge in public \nschools. That law has been the law since 1996.\n  The point is that the pledge is a patriotic exercise. Thomas \nJefferson, again, who authored the Statute of Religious Freedom, had no \nintention of allowing Government to limit, restrict, regulate, or \ninterfere with public religious practices.\n  Mr. Jefferson believed, along with our other Founders, that the first \namendment had been enacted only to prevent Federal establishment of a \nnational denomination. This patriotic pledge establishes no religious \ndenomination. There is no establishment of any religious denomination. \nI would fight against any sort of effort, by any State, or by the \nFederal Government to establish any national denomination.\n  Understand the history of our country. There was an Anglican Church, \nthe Church of England. There were people who were forced to pay tithes \nor contribute to this church, even if they did not believe in it. The \nBaptists were the ones who were the most upset. Mr. Jefferson sent a \nletter to the Baptists of Danbury, where he was espousing his views and \nwhere some of these misinterpretations may have occurred. The point is \nthis is no establishment of religion.\n  This Federal judge, though, in California, and the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals judges, are examples of Government overreach in a very \ndifferent and harmful way. It is judicial activism at its very worst. \nIt is activism by unelected judges. Through this decision and decisions \nsuch as this, they usurp the rights of the people, usurp the \npolicymaking role given to this body and also to the people in the \nStates. These are rights that are actually guaranteed to all of the \npeople in the States in our Constitution.\n\n  I do not know what the next decision from Federal judges might be, \nespecially if they are relying on this precedent from the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Will they ban the singing of God Bless America in our \nschools? Who knows?\n  Will they redact, or force the editing of founding documents, which \nare some of the greatest documents in the history of mankind and \ncivilization, because there are references to God or to our creator? \nWill the Congress, the Supreme Court, and State legislatures all across \nthe land be prohibited from opening their sessions with the pledge \nbecause it might somehow offend the sensibilities of someone watching a \nlegislative body opening with a Pledge of Allegiance, whether it is on \na public access channel or C-SPAN or otherwise?\n  The fact is this is not an argument about God or no God. It is not an \nargument about the separation of church and State. It is not an \nargument about the establishment of any particular religious \ndenomination. Saying the Pledge of Allegiance is no more of a religious \nact than buying food with currency that reads ``In God We Trust.'' It \nis a patriotic act. If a student does not want to say it, he or she can \nsit quietly in the classroom. But that should not thwart the desire of \nthe people, whether it is in counties in California or counties in \ncities and towns in the Commonwealth of Virginia or in the plains of \nKansas or in the Rocky Mountains or anywhere else. If that is what they \nso desire, then the people ought to be able to have that in their \npublic schools.\n  I sense that most Americans agree that the Pledge of Allegiance \nshould remain in our schools and other public functions. As it is \ntoday, it should be voluntary and should be a matter of public \nconscience.\n  On this issue, similar to so many others, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals is out of touch with the people and flat-out wrong. This errant \ndecision clearly points out the need to put, reasonable, well-grounded \njudges who have common sense on the Federal bench, rather than these \ndelusional activists who ignore the will of the people of the United \nStates. The promise of America is rooted in one idea, that the \ndirection of our country is, and will always be, determined by the \nconsent and the will of the people.\n  If there is anything to be understood from our Constitution, our Bill \nof Rights, it is that the Government is instituted by the people. They \nmay have representative government through the States, but the Bill of \nRights is there to protect our God-given rights. Some rights of ours \nare to have a government, with our consent, that reflects our values.\n  I hope, in this particular case, which is illustrative of others, \nthat either the Ninth Circuit, or the United States Supreme Court will \nreverse this egregious decision that bans the Pledge of Allegiance in \npublic schools.

RONALD W. KISER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding service of a remarkable Kentuckian, Mr. Ronald W. Kiser. \nMr. Kiser is the assistant chief of the Engineering Division for the \nLouisville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He will retire \nfrom the Corps of Engineers this September 30 with over 36 years of \ndedicated service to our Nation.\n  A Louisville resident for decades, Mr. Kiser is originally a native \nof Charleston, WV. He began his career with the Corps of Engineers in \nthe Huntington District, in West Virginia, upon graduation from the \nWest Virginia University Institute of Technology, where he\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nearned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. During his time with \nthe Huntington District, Mr. Kiser's duties included evaluating \nbuildings for safe refuge from nuclear fallout, overseeing relocations \nof railroads and highways at major flood-control projects and \nnavigation projects, and participating in emergency disaster recovery.\n  In 1974, Mr. Kiser was selected to lead the Relocations Branch of the \nEngineering Division in the Louisville District. His work involved many \naspects of civil-works projects, including the design of Zilpo Road at \nCave Run Lake, in northeastern Kentucky, which is now featured in a \nregister of America's most scenic highways. Over the next 10 years, Mr. \nKiser not only served the Louisville District, but was solicited by the \nPittsburgh District and the Europe Division, in addition to earning a \nmaster's degree in civil engineering from Ohio State University. While \nassisting the Pittsburgh District, Mr. Kiser led the relocations \nassociated with the Stonewall Jackson Dam Project and the Monongahela \nRiver Locks Renovation Project. During his time with the Europe \nDivision, he managed military operations and maintenance projects \ntotaling approximately $200 million a year.\n  Mr. Kiser returned to the Louisville District in 1983 and was \nselected as chief of the Army Section in the newly established Military \nBranch that had been formed to oversee the Louisville District's \nmilitary mission. Thanks to his leadership, vision, and dedication to \nduty, the Louisville District gained a reputation for excellence in \nexecution that it retains to this day. Among the many major military \ninstallations Mr. Kiser helped oversee are Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, \nboth in Kentucky, and many Army Reserve facilities nationwide.\n  During this time, Mr. Kiser extended his leadership well beyond his \nassigned missions. He mentored Captains Robert Rowlette and Mike Pratt, \nwho both went on to become Corps of Engineers District Commanders. He \nworked on the Standardized Design Program Committee for the Corps of \nEngineers Headquarters. He led the Louisville District to become the \nCenters of Expertise for Centralized Vehicle Wash Facilities, Bowling \nCenters, and Class 6 Beverage Stores. And he was a key player in \norganizing the first MILCON Conference, and developing the standard \n``partnering'' clause for construction contracts.\n  Mr. Kiser continued his leadership role in the Louisville District's \nEngineering Division throughout the 1990s, in positions ranging from \nchief of the first environmental support program to his current \nposition of assistant chief of the Engineering Division. His devotion \nto the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over several decades has made for a \nstronger, safer, more prosperous Nation for his fellow Kentuckians, and \nfor all Americans.\n  A good neighbor and a valued steward of our defense assets and \nnatural resources, Mr. Kiser will be remembered for his spirit of \nservice, patriotism and dedication to his country. On the occasion of \nhis retirement, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending best wishes \nto Mr. Ronald W. Kiser.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10184-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR ``ART'' EDWARD BERNARD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, too often, the civil servants who make a \nState run properly do not get the recognition they deserve. Arthur \n``Art'' Edward Bernard is one of those men. Today, I rise to honor a \nman who has left a lasting impact on Nevada through his work in \ngovernment.\n  Art Bernard was raised in the mining camps of Utah before striking \nout on his own at the age of 16. His travels brought him to the Bristol \nMine in Pioche, NV. There, he worked in the hardscrabble world of \n``mucking'' or loading the ore carts. Mucking is all about brute \nstrength, and Art won mucking contests throughout Nevada. The toughness \nand tenacity he showed as a miner served Art well in his appointment as \nState Mine Inspector in 1947. In this capacity, he worked to improve \nthe safety standards of the mines.\n  His work was noticed by Governor Charles Russell, and Art was \nappointed warden of the Nevada State Prison in 1950. At first, Art had \ndoubts about his new position because he had no previous experience in \nthe prison system. Like any good miner, Art refused to become \ndiscouraged, and he embraced the new challenges of his position.\n  Art's tenure could not have come at a better time for the Nevada \nState prison; he navigated the tumultuous changes occurring in prisons \nacross the country. Demanding better living conditions, prisoners \nacross the country rioted and the Nevada State prison was no different. \nRioting prisoners demanded to see the Governor, but Art refused to cave \nto their demands. Instead, he barricaded the prisoners in the prison \nyard for 3 days until the protest disbanded peacefully.\n  As part of the settlement, Art allowed a commission of three \nprisoners, called the ``three wise men,'' to submit prison grievances \ndirectly to him. Art viewed the inmates as students at what he dubbed \n``Greystone U.'' Over the years, Art developed a close relationship \nwith the inmates, and he made himself available to any inmate who \nwanted to see him during daily walks around the grounds. He worked to \nimprove the quality of life at the prison by establishing a boxing \nprogram for the inmates and a prison orchestra.\n  Art's revolutionary ideas jump started the work program at the Nevada \nState prison. Art applied his mining background to prison life when he \nstarted a rock quarry for the prisoners. Each new prisoner was \nresponsible for a certain quota from the quarry each day. In addition, \nArt allowed prisoners to work on local ranches and farms as laborers, \nand the prison received local produce and supplies for the prison in \nexchange. The prison labor exchange was not the only way Art saved \nNevada taxpayer dollars. He also used prison labor to build new \nfacilities at the Nevada State prison.\n  Art served Nevada in a great time of need and helped modernize \nNevada's prison operations with the strength and tenacity that he \nlearned from mining camps across my State. Most importantly, Art sought \nto improve the lives and treatment of prisoners when other prison \nsystems were languishing with inferior standards and facilities.\n  Art's contributions to Nevada did not stop after his retirement. \nRecently, Art finished interviews about his life with the Nevada Mining \nOral History project. Future generations will be able to hear about \nArt's years spent in mines across Nevada, in addition to stories about \nprison life at ``Greystone U.'' This oral history is another \ncontribution to Nevada history from a man who helped to shape my State. \nNevada is a better place because of men like Art Bernard, and he \ndeserves recognition today before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10184-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10184-S10185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME DISORDERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, we marked National Fetal \nAlcohol Syndrome Awareness Day. Today, I rise to join Senators Johnson, \nMurkowski, Murray and Dodd as we introduce legislation to address the \nprevention and treatment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders.\n  I have met with many families in Illinois who have made real for me \nthe challenges, the frustrations and the hope that come with a fetal \nalcohol syndrome disorder. Vivian Botka brought a picture that her 22-\nyear-old daughter Kristy had colored with crayons. Kristy requires \naround-the-clock care. Walt Teichen and his family are working to build \nan independent living home for young adults affected by fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. They want to establish a home for young people such as their \nson Kevin, who craves independence from his parents yet needs the \nsupport and vigilance of adults who understand his limitations.\n  Last year, then-Minority Leader Tom Daschle proposed the most \nambitious, comprehensive plan in America's history to advance FASD \nresearch, treatment, and prevention. I am honored to join my colleagues \nas we introduce this legislation because, as Senator Daschle says, it \nis easier to raise a healthy child than heal a broken adult. It is more \ncompassionate and, in the end, more cost-effective to prevent FASD and \nhelp families living with it than it is to ignore it.\n  To decrease the occurrence of mental retardation and birth defects, \nwe must address their most preventable cause--alcohol use during \npregnancy. FASD affects an estimated 40,000 infants each year. That is \n1 out of every 100 births\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nin the United States. The mental, physical and neurobehavioral effects \nof FASD include deformities in major organs, slow development, learning \ndifficulties, low IQs, and problems with coordination, memory, \nattention, and judgment.\n  We can make a difference in the lives of affected families in \nIllinois and throughout this country. We can prevent fetal alcohol \nsyndrome disorders. Please join me in supporting the Advancing FASD \nPrevention and Treatment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10185-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n Mr. SMITH.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On April 29, 2005, a Harvard University student was assaulted by a \nman in downtown Boston, MA. The apparent motivation for the attack was \nthat the student was openly gay.\n  I note that yesterday in the House, hate crimes legislation was \npassed in a bipartisan vote. We must also move similar legislation in \nthe Senate. In the months ahead I look forward to working with Senator \nKennedy as we continue our work in passing a hate crimes bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10185-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO YAKOV BIRNBAUM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I pay tribute to the \ncontributions of Yakov Birnbaum, an unheralded American freedom \nfighter, whose work helped free roughly five million Soviet Jews and \ntens of millions others persecuted for their faith under the former \nSoviet Union.\n  In 1964, Birnbaum launched the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry at \nColumbia University to promote awareness of the persecution of Jews in \nthe Soviet Union. His movement ultimately led to the passage of the \npivotal Jackson-Vanik Amendment a decade later, which starved the \nSoviet government of trade benefits in retaliation for its trampling on \nhuman rights.\n  Birnbaum's efforts led to freedom for individuals like Natan \nSharansky and the emigration from the Soviet Union of more than 1.5 \nmillion Jews since. His work also inspired other individuals, \norganizations and governments to decry the persecution of people of \nfaith by the Soviet government.\n  By drawing international attention to repression within the Soviet \nUnion, Birnbaum helped remind us all that the defense of human rights \nand the freedom to worship had to be battleground issues in the Cold \nWar. The final fall of the Soviet system and the flowering of religious \nfreedom that followed were both thanks to the long and tenacious \nefforts of men and women like Birnbaum.\n  For all his work in the cause of freedom we recognize him \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10185-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    POLYMER INDUSTRY IN WEST VIRGINIA AND POLYMER APPRECIATION WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimportant role the polymer industry plays in my State of West Virginia. \nAs part of Polymer Appreciation Week in the State, Governor Joe Manchin \nand I have invited a small group of international polymer executives to \nWest Virginia to showcase investment opportunities available to their \ncompanies.\n  West Virginia's polymer industry plays an important and vital role in \nWest Virginia's economy. World renowned companies such as GE Plastics, \nDuPont, Sunoco, and M Polymers have chosen to locate here. West \nVirginia's excellent infrastructure, broad range of raw materials, \nhighly skilled workforce, and close proximity to 62 percent of the \nUnited States industrial market, makes West Virginia a key player in \nthe global market.\n  The Polymer Alliance Zone of West Virginia--PAZ--is the site of the \nhighest concentration of production of high technology, speciality and \nengineering polymers in the world. The Mid-Ohio Valley has a long \nhistory in the production of industrial chemicals, petrochemicals, and \npolymers dating back to the 1940s. The region has a proud manufacturing \nheritage, and today, that expertise and dedication has gained the \nPolymer Alliance Zone national recognition.\n  The mission of the Polymer Alliance Zone is to create the most \nfavorable business climate in the world for the plastics industry \nthrough a unique partnership among business, education, and government. \nSince its inception in 1996, the focus of the organization has been the \nsupport of both new and existing polymer industries. According to \nrecent calculations by the West Virginia Development office, PAZ has \npartnered with local, State and private industry to complete 33 \nprojects that have generated more than $529 million of investments.\n  The Polymer Alliance Zone offers great opportunities for companies \nlooking to locate in West Virginia. The Mid-Ohio Valley location offers \neasy access to an increasingly global market, and the State's abundant \nresources provide companies with affordable, reliable energy. In \naddition, West Virginia's favorable business climate welcomes and \nsupports polymer companies through a number of valuable assistance \nprograms. More importantly, it is the people of West Virginia who make \nthe Polymer Alliance Zone what it is--a vibrant economy, a growing \ncommunity, and an opportunity that national polymer companies should \nnot miss.\n  Over the last 9 years, the Polymer Alliance Zone has assisted the \nWest Virginia Development Office and our county development authorities \nin creating and retaining over 1,000 jobs in the region. This is a \nlarge achievement, and in return my State recognizes 9 years of service \nthat PAZ has provided to both the polymer industry and to the State of \nWest Virginia by celebrating Polymer Appreciation Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10185-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10185-S10186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WELLNESS PROGRAM AT BRADLEY UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, every year, the Inter-Association \nTask Force on Alcohol and Other Substance Abuse Issues, IATF, gives \nawards to three universities for their programs against underage \ndrinking and over-consumption of alcoholic beverages. Bradley \nUniversity, which is located in Peoria, IL, is among the three \nuniversities being commended and has the honor of being a National \nCollegiate Alcohol Awareness Week Winner for 2004-2005.\n  I applaud the Wellness Program at Bradley University for its \ncommitment to reduce underage drinking. Alcohol misuse on college \ncampuses is not a new problem. It is entrenched in the culture of many \ninstitutions of higher learning and in students' social lives. The \nabuse of alcohol among college students is taking its toll not only on \nthe students who drink alcohol in excess but also their student peers, \ncollege administrators, health care personnel who counsel student \ndrinkers, and the community at large.\n  Help, Encourage, and Teach, HEAT, and Social Norming, SONOR, are two \nprograms that have proven to be effective at Bradley University. HEAT \nstrives to provide students with opportunities to promote positive \nlifestyle choices, such as peer-led workshops and demonstrations. The \nSONOR program utilizes creative marketing and advertising strategies to \ndisseminate information about healthy living. These programs are making \na difference in the lives of our youth by encouraging college students \nto make healthy and responsible decisions.\n  Congratulations to Dr. Alan Galsky, Associate Provost for Student \nAffairs; Melissa Sage-Bollenbach, the Wellness Program Coordinator at \nBradley University; Kelcy Hale, the President of Social Norming; and \nChrisandra Ashby, the former president of HEAT for their tireless \nefforts and outstanding leadership.\n  Bradley University is to be commended for its innovative and \ninfluential alcohol-abuse programs. Representatives of Bradley \nUniversity recently came to Washington, DC, and visited their Senator's \noffices to present their alcohol awareness programs.

Mr. President, our\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1718. A bill to provide special rules for disaster relief \nemployment under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for individuals \ndisplaced by Hurricane Katrina; read the first time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleague \nSenator Enzi in introducing a bill to bring much needed employment \nrelief to the many working men and women who suddenly lost their \nlivelihood because of Hurricane Katrina. The bill authorizes the \nSecretary to use National Emergency Grant funds to create short term \njobs as the region begins to rebuild.\n  In distributing these funds, the first priority will be the States \nwho have suffered the greatest loss. A group of us visited the Gulf \nCoast area last Friday and saw firsthand the immensity of the \ndevastation. We know these proud hard-working men and women are anxious \nto become self-sufficient again as soon as possible. The Nation has \nopened its heart to the victims of this vast tragedy, and we need to \nfocus now on making sure that their towns, cities and parishes are \nready for their return. In order to rebuild, we need to make sure that \nthere are jobs for them and schools for their children. Last week, we \ntook a first step in helping reopen the schools and we also need to \ntake a similar step to see that there are jobs when they return.\n  The most heavily affected States--Alabama, Louisiana and \nMississippi--are doing all they can to begin rebuilding the local \neconomy, so only Governors and local elected officials will control \nthese employment funds. Our intention is to help rebuild the local \neconomy and give benefits to local workers through local businesses.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi for his leadership on this bill, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1720. A bill to provide enhanced penalties for crimes committed \nusing funds appropriated for remediation of any injury or damage caused \nby Hurricane Katrina; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, our hearts go out to those who have been \naffected by the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. By now, those \nwho have been displaced by this disaster know that help is available to \nthem. And true to the American spirit, assistance has poured in from \npeople all across this great land. We have seen the Government, at \nevery level, fail in some way to respond adequately to this emergency. \nCongressional hearings will examine these failures and the reasons for \nthem to make sure that we are better prepared to respond in the future.\n  But there is no need for a review of the adequacy, efficiency, or \nresponsiveness of everyday citizens who heeded distress calls from \ntheir fellow citizens. When the history of this disaster is finally \nwritten, it will document the fact that the American people rose to the \nchallenge. Because that is what Americans do--every time, without \nexception.\n  Over the past several weeks we have seen ordinary Americans, on their \nown initiative, coordinate the donation of goods needed by evacuees, \nrent U-Haul trucks, and drive to New Orleans to deliver supplies. \nOthers have initiated fundraisers and have donated substantial funds to \naid the Red Cross and other charities that are on the ground. And still \nothers, like those in my home State of Texas, have literally opened \ntheir doors to complete strangers to provide them with food, shelter, \nand other necessities, so that they can get back on their feet and \nbegin to rebuild their lives.\n  Here in the Congress we have acted quickly, passing emergency relief \nappropriations of more than $60 billion dollars to get money into the \ndevastated areas so people can be helped and areas can be rebuilt. The \nPresident has further proposed sending an unprecedented amount of money \nand incentives to aid in the rebuilding. I plan to support reasonable \nefforts designed to aid in accomplishing these goals. However, as we \npour extraordinary amounts of money into the affected areas, we must \nguard against those callous people who may see this as an opportunity \nto wrongfully enrich themselves through fraud.\n  We all know that the Federal Government's track record at detecting \nand avoiding fraud is poor, at best. As we begin to funnel what some \nhave said may be close to $200 billion dollars into the disaster areas, \nwe must be vigilant to ensure that these funds go where they \nlegitimately are supposed to go. And we must send the message here and \nnow that the actions of those who may defraud the Government or \notherwise illegally obtain a portion of these funds will not be \ntolerated.\n  That is why I have introduced the Katrina Waste, Fraud and Abuse \nDeterrence Act of 2005. This legislation states that anyone convicted \nof any crime involving funds appropriated for disaster relief in the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina face a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 \nyears--and up to 20 years--in prison.\n  As I have said, a staggering amount of money will be, and currently \nis being sent to this area. The funds will speed the rebuilding of \nthese areas and otherwise help those who are in need of assistance. But \nthe American people will not tolerate misappropriation of these funds. \nPresident Bush has ordered that a team of inspectors general review all \nexpenditures to ensure that the rebuilding work is done honestly and \nwisely. I applaud the President for his stewardship of this money. The \nbill I introduce today will put some teeth into this oversight. It will \nsay to those who may contemplate illegally cutting corners or outright \nstealing disaster funds whether by fraud, theft, or embezzlement, that \nthey will be caught, prosecuted, and imprisoned.\n  To those who legitimately need these funds: Your country is here to \nhelp you. To those who are inclined to take advantage of the misfortune \nof others by wrongfully taking these funds: You will be prosecuted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Dodd, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1722. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention and services program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1722\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing FASD Research, \n     Prevention, and Services Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are the spectrum of \n     serious, life-long disorders caused by prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol, which include Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Alcohol-\n     Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder, and Alcohol-Related \n     Birth Defects.\n       (2) In the decades that have passed since Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome was first recognized in the United States, this \n     fully preventable condition has continued to affect American \n     children and families.\n       (3) Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause brain damage that \n     produces cognitive and behavioral impairments. Prenatal \n     alcohol exposure can cause mental retardation or low IQ and \n     difficulties with learning, memory, attention, and problem-\n     solving. It can\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n     also create problems with mental health and social \n     interactions.\n       (4) Prenatal alcohol exposure also can cause growth \n     retardation, birth defects involving the heart, kidney, \n     vision and hearing, and a characteristic pattern of facial \n     abnormalities.\n       (5) About 13 percent of women report using alcohol during \n     pregnancy even though there is no known safe level of alcohol \n     consumption during pregnancy.\n       (6) Estimates of individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     vary but are estimated to be between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 \n     births. The prevalence rate is considerably higher for all \n     Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: about 10 out of 1,000 \n     births (1 percent of births).\n       (7) Prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders can be \n     even higher in certain populations, such as Native Americans, \n     and in certain areas, such as those characterized by low \n     socioeconomic status.\n       (8) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders pose extraordinary \n     financial costs to the Nation, including the cost of \n     specialized health care, education, foster care, \n     incarceration, job training, and general support services for \n     individuals affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\n       (9) Lifetime health costs for an individual with Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome average $860,000, and can run as high as \n     $4,200,000. The direct and indirect economic costs of Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome in the United States were $5,400,000,000 in \n     2003. Total economic costs would be even higher for all Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.\n       (10) There is a great need for research, surveillance, \n     prevention, treatment, and support services for individuals \n     with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and their families.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROGRAMS FOR FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS.\n\n       Section 399H of the Public Health Service Act (48 U.S.C. \n     280f) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the section heading and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399H.

Mr. President, today I join Senators Dodd, Durbin, \nColeman, Murkowski, and Murray to introduce the ``Advancing FASD \nResearch, Prevention, and Services Act of 2005.'' I thank them for \njoining me in introducing this legislation that will improve the \nsurveillance, identification, and prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \nDisorders or FASD.\n  FASD affects 1 in 100 live births or as many as 40,000 infants each \nyear. This illness affects more people than those impacted by spina \nbifida, down syndrome, and cerebral palsy combined. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, approximately 31,777 individuals are suspected of having \nFASD. This statistic is alarming and it is for these reasons why I \nbelieve that this bill is so critical in helping fight this disease.\n  During the course of my career, I have met and worked with people \nwhose lives have been deeply affected by this preventable illness. For \na person affected by FASD, there can be numerous medical, physical, \neducational, and financial implications, such as severe learning \ndisabilities, physical abnormalities, costly medical bills, and \nbehavioral impairments.\n  According to the University of South Dakota School of Medicine and \nHealth Sciences Center for Disabilities, the lifetime cost for an \nindividual with FASD is over $2 million, and the special educational \ncosts for South Dakota children with FASD can range from $3,781 to \n$17,056 per year. Additionally, over 60 percent of the individuals in \nSouth Dakota who have been diagnosed with FASD lived within a foster \ncare home for some part of their lives. While the foster care parent \ncares and loves a child, the child will never really know the stability \nof a permanent family.\n  Furthermore, it is estimated that 60 percent of individuals with FASD \nwill end up in a correctional or mental institution at some point in \ntheir lives. Most individuals with FASD will commit their first crime \nbetween the ages of 9 and 14, costing the state of South Dakota close \nto $165.04 per day to house a juvenile offender with FASD, the total \namount of all children with FASD in the South Dakota juvenile justice \nsystem and special education program is $3,810,240.\n  These unfortunate statistics compel me to join with my colleagues to \nintroduce this bill today. While we have increased awareness about the \ndangers of consuming alcohol during pregnancy, there is much more that \nneeds to be done to reach the goal of elimination of FASD in this \nNation.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, we've had great successes in \nworking on this issue. With the leadership of the health professionals \nat the USD Center for Disabilities, the Black Hills State University \nWestern Center of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, parents, and teachers, among \ncountless others, we have been able to make some important advancements \nin addressing FASD. This legislation will bolster those efforts and \nthose of many others across the country that are working hard to \nprevent FASD and support the children and families who are living with \nits consequences.\n\n  This bill would provide much needed support in the areas of research \nand prevention. This legislation would require the National Institutes \nof Health to develop a research agenda for FASD including research \nrelated to identifying the mechanisms that produce the cognitive and \nbehavioral problems associated with fetal alcohol exposure, and \nidentifying biological markers that indicate fetal alcohol exposure.\n  This bill would also make available Federal grants to community \nhealth centers to implement and evaluate programs to increase awareness \nand identification of FASD in those settings. Participating health \ncenters would be able to make available training to health care \nproviders on identifying and educating women who are at risk for \nalcohol consumption during pregnancy and also provide training to \nhealth care providers on screening children for FASD, among other \nthings.\n  Another provision in this bill creates public awareness and education \ncampaigns in at-risk. areas, in order to further the prevention of this \ndisease. This bill would authorize the development and broadcast of \nnational public service announcements to raise public awareness of the \nrisks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n  Again, I am pleased to be introducing this bill. I would also like to \ntake a moment to thank Senator Daschle for his leadership on FASD. His \nlong commitment to combating this illness is ever present in South \nDakota and for those who continue to work with those battling FASD \nevery day. Without his hard work and dedication, we would not be as far \ntoday in preventing FASD as we are.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 1723. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to establish a grant program to ensure waterfront \naccess for commercial fishermen, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, all along our Nation's coasts are harbors \nthat were once full of the sights, sounds, and smells that accompany \nthe fishing industry. Unfortunately, a number of factors are converging \nto lead to the loss of our Nation's vital fishing infrastructure, which \nis essential for the continuance of the commercial fishing industry. I \nhave drafted legislation that will help to combat the loss of \ncommercial access to our waterfronts and to support the fishing \nindustry's role in our maritime heritage.\n  In July, I was contacted by Andy Hawke of Boothbay Harbor, ME, a \nlobsterman who explained that the local lobstermen's cooperative had \nrecently come up for sale. Unfortunately, the local fishermen could not \ncome up with the resources to purchase the cooperative's facilities, \nand they were looking for Federal assistance in order to keep this \ncoastal property accessible to the commercial fishing industry. Their \ngoal was to keep the cooperative in operation for the lobstermen of \nBoothbay Harbor and the ``upcoming youth who will be in the lobster \nindustry.''\n  There was little assistance that I could offer beyond identifying \nsome grant programs that might apply. I discovered quickly that there \nis no targeted, Federal program to help the commercial fishing industry \ngain or preserve access to waterfront areas. At the same time, the \npressures that drive the commercial fishing industry from these vital \npieces of industry infrastructure are mounting. I rise today to \nintroduce legislation that would create a program to assist our \nNation's commercial fishermen, the Working Waterfront Preservation Act.\n  I can best speak to this issue by pointing to the loss of commercial \nwaterfront access in Maine. Only 25 of Maine's 3,500 miles of coastline \nare devoted to commercial access. Sadly, portions of Maine's working \nwaterfront are being sold weekly and converted to other uses, most \noften second homes and condominiums.\n  The reasons for the loss of Maine's working waterfront are complex. \nIn some cases, burdensome fishing regulations have led to a decrease in \nlandings, hindering the profitability of shore-side infrastructure, \nlike the Portland Fish Exchange. In other cases, soaring land values \nand rising taxes have made the current use of commercial land \nunprofitable. Property is being sold and quickly converted into private \nspaces and second\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nhomes that no longer are the center of economic activity.\n  Maine's lack of commercial waterfront access has prompted the \nformation of a Working Waterfront Coalition. This coalition is \ncomprised of an impressive number of industry associations, non-profit \ngroups, and State agencies, who have come together to preserve Maine's \nworking waterfront.\n  Preservation of the working waterfront is essential to protect a way \nof life that is unique to our coastal States and is vital to economic \ndevelopment along the coast. Maine's Working Waterfront Coalition \nidentified 18 projects that would increase Maine's available working \nwaterfront. These 18 projects would create or preserve over 875 Maine \njobs. All that is needed is a modest investment in Maine's working \nwaterfront.\n  The loss of commercial waterfront access affects the fishing industry \nthroughout all coastal States. On August 28, 2005, a story appeared in \nthe Providence Journal about the fishing port of Galilee in Rhode \nIsland. Fishermen from Galilee are getting pushed out of the waterfront \nas their profitability shrinks and land values soar. This article \ndetailed plans to create more condominiums in Galilee and $2 million \nbeach houses marketed to buyers from Connecticut and New York.\n  On July 26, 2005, the Los Angeles Times ran a story on the \ndisappearance of working waterfront in Florida. In June of this year, \nGovernor Bush signed a law aimed at protecting that State's working \nwaterfront.\n  On February 20, 2005, the Seattle Times profiled the Washington town \nof Anacortes's struggle with development and the future of this port. \nIn this story, the city attorney and planner said that the biggest \nissue facing this town is whether they can continue to have a working \nwaterfront, as Anacortes ``is still a real town where people are making \na real living.''\n  Another region of the country where this bill will help the local \ncommunity and stimulate economic growth is a region we have heard a lot \nabout in recent news, the gulf coast. On September 6, 2005, the Houston \nChronicle ran a story on the havoc caused by Hurricane Katrina to \nAlabama's fishing industry. This disaster hit the town of Bayou La \nBatre; it destroyed oyster beds, upended fishing boats, and damaged the \ndocks and piers on which the fishing industry relies. The Working \nWaterfront Preservation Act would assist the victims of this storm in \nrebuilding the shore-side infrastructure vital to the industry.\n  No matter the coastal State, our Nation's fishermen are affected by \nthe loss of access to commercial waterfront properties. I have drafted \nlegislation targeting this exact problem, as no Federal program exists \nto assist States like Maine, Florida, Washington, and Alabama, which \nare trying to cope with the loss of this valuable infrastructure.\n  The loss of commercial waterfront access is apparent. The Working \nWaterfront Preservation Act would assist by providing Federal grant \nfunding to municipal and State governments, non-profit organizations, \nand fishermen's cooperatives for the purchase of property or easements \nor for the maintenance of working waterfront facilities. The bill \ncontains a $50 million authorization for grants that would require a 25 \npercent local match. Applications for grants would be considered by \nboth the Department of Commerce and State fisheries agencies, which \nhave the local expertise to understand the needs of each coastal State. \nGrant recipients would agree not to convert coastal properties to \nnoncommercial uses, as a condition of receiving Federal assistance.\n  This legislation also has a tax component included. When properties \nor easements are purchased, sellers would only be taxed on half of the \ngain they receive from this sale. Taxing only half of the gain on \nconservation sales is a proposal that has been advanced by the \nPresident in all of his budget proposals. This is a vital aspect of my \nbill because it would diminish the pressure to quickly sell waterfront \nproperty that would then, most likely, be converted to noncommercial \nuses, and would increase the incentives for sellers to take part in \nthis grant program. This is especially important given that the \napplication process for Federal grants does not keep pace with the \ncoastal real estate market.\n  This legislation is crucial for our Nation's commercial fisheries, \nwhich are coming under increasing pressures from many fronts. This new \ngrant program would preserve important commercial infrastructure and \npromote economic development along our coast. I am committed to \ncreating a Federal mechanism to preserve working waterfronts and will \npursue this legislation during the 109th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 1724. A bill to provide assistance for small businesses damaged by \nHurricane Katrina, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a bill which provides a comprehensive package for immediate \nemergency resources to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina rebuild \ntheir lives and their businesses.\n  As we are well aware, the entire Gulf Coast of the United States has \nbeen ravaged by the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. No natural disaster \nin this country in recent memory has carried with it the devastation \nand horror we have witnessed in the recent weeks. Many lives have been \nlost and damages are projected in the hundreds of billions of dollars. \nThe President and Congress have already provided over $61 billion in \nemergency funds.\n  While we work to re-establish communities and provide some stability \nto the affected areas, we must consider the enormous economic impact \nthis catastrophe has had on the region and on our entire Nation. This \nimpact is particularly pronounced for the vital small business sector. \nWith over 800,000 firms damaged in the Hurricane-affected region, \nemployment in the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama area may be \nreduced by over a million jobs! Moreover, our economy which has \nrecently recovered from recession, thanks largely to our small \nbusinesses which have created three-quarters of all new jobs, could be \ndampened by as much as a full percentage point.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nam committed to do everything in my power to provide immediate and \nnecessary support to rebuild this region and to help sustain our \neconomy. I want to ensure that every American affected by this \nHurricane has the resources to begin rebuilding their lives, their \nbusinesses and their dreams.\n  The provisions of this bill were contained in an amendment that I \nproposed, Amendment #1717, to the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nAppropriations Act of 2005, H.R. 2862. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senator Vitter, Senator Talent, Senator Kerry, and Senator \nLandrieu, for co-sponsoring that amendment. The amendment was approved \nin the Senate by a rollcall vote of 96 to 0 on September 15, 2006, and \nsubsequently passed the Senate in the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nAppropriations Act on that same day.\n  Because the Federal Disaster Loan program administered by the Small \nBusiness Administration issues Disaster Loans to businesses, \nhomeowners, and renters, this legislation would have a significant \nimpact on many facets of the efforts to rebuild the areas damaged by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I will also be holding a hearing in the Small Business Committee on \nSeptember 22, 2005 to address the impact that Hurricane Katrina has had \non small businesses.\n  The Small Business Administration is and must be at the forefront of \nthis massive relief effort, playing a significant role in assisting \nimpacted communities. This bill will strengthen the SBA's resources and \nwill enable them to pave the pathway to recovery. I have faith that \nAmerican small businesses will persevere through these difficult times \nand help lead the region's recovery. It is essential that we work \ntogether here in Congress, and put forth the best possible proposal to \nstimulate our economy and foster job growth.\n\n  I have spoken with SBA's Administrator Barreto concerning the various \nways to respond to this disaster and assist with the recovery. He \ninformed me that FEMA has referred over 500,000 cases for loan \nassistance to the SBA, and that the SBA is receiving up to\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\n20,000 calls per day. This is a tremendous volume and a vital challenge \nthat the SBA must satisfy. To date, the SBA has sent out almost 500,000 \napplications for loans to individuals and businesses, and has received \n810 loan applications as of Monday morning, which demonstrates that \nmuch assistance is yet to be provided by the SBA. Therefore, it is \ncritical that we act now!\n  I firmly believe this legislation is the best possible package to aid \nfamilies, businesses and communities through these challenging times. \nSmall businesses must have a fighting chance to survive the economic \ndisaster caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n  I have included many provisions in my bill that would assist \nhurricane victims applying for SBA disaster loans. My legislation \nincreases the maximum size of an SBA Disaster Loan from $1.5 million \nper loan to $10 million per loan and makes it possible for non-profit \ninstitutions damaged by Hurricane Katrina to be eligible for Disaster \nLoans.\n  I have also provided the SBA with the authority to grant victims of \nHurricane Katrina up to 12 months to begin repaying their SBA disaster \nloans which would assist both small and large businesses, homeowners, \nand renters. This 12 month period could be extended to 24 months at the \ndiscretion of the SBA Administrator if he determines that Katrina \nvictims would need additional time to begin repaying their loans. This \nwould allow also homeowners and businesses additional time to get their \nlives and businesses restored before being required to begin repaying \nloans.\n  This legislation also proposes lowering fees for the 7(a) program to \nmake borrowing more affordable for small businesses outside the \ndisaster areas, many of which have been impacted by the disaster, and \nare struggling to cover higher costs in health care and energy, and \nrising interest rates.\n  Recognizing the increased demand this disaster will place on all \nsmall business lending programs, the amendment proposes increasing the \n7(a) lending program from a program level of $17 billion to $20 \nbillion, and the 504 lending program from a program level of $7.5 \nbillion to $10 billion. Both the 504 and 7(a) lending programs are \nfunded entirely through fees, so the increases require no \nappropriation.\n  Moreover, this bill increases the program level for SBA Disaster \nLoans--Physical and Economic Injury--by approximately $800 million, \nrequiring an appropriation of approximately $117 million. The Committee \nis concerned there will not be enough funding for disaster loans \navailable to meet the scope of this disaster, given that the economic \ninjury disaster loans alone for 9-11 amounted to about $1 billion, and \nthe physical damage for Katrina is considered much more extensive.\n  The bill also includes a provision requiring the SBA to treat these \nspecial provisions as separate from the regular programs, to avoid \nincreasing future subsidy rates, and therefore, the costs for borrowers \nwho rely on those programs. This same protection was provided for \nemergency 7(a) loans after 9-11 and for the special disaster loans for \n9-11.\n  Additionally, many small businesses in the disaster areas will \nrequire relief from making payments and interest on 7(a) and 504 loans \nthey had before Katrina hit. Therefore, this amendment includes a \nprovision that directs the SBA to cover the payments and interest on \nexisting loans for up to two years, or until the small business can \nresume payments.\n  Similar to the Supplementary Terrorist Activity Relief (STAR) loans \nenacted by Congress after 9-11, this bill allows the SBA to provide \nsimilar loans with lower fees for small businesses located outside the \ndisaster zones but are nonetheless indirectly impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina. The lower fees also provide the lenders with an incentive to \nlend to these businesses.\n  Importantly, the bill includes protections to mitigate recent reports \nof past misdirection of loans to non-disaster victims. The protections \ninclude requiring lenders to inform borrowers that they are receiving \nKatrina relief loans, requiring lenders to document to the SBA how the \nborrower was adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina, and for the \nGovernment Accountability Office to collect the explanations and report \nto the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and \nHouse Committee on Small Business every six months, verifying loans are \nbeing used for the intended purposes. These added protections will \nensure that only applicants who really need these loans to recover from \nthe horrific effects of Hurricane Katrina will receive the loans.\n  Furthermore, the legislation authorizes $400 million to the affected \nstate governments of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and \nFlorida to provide emergency bridge loans or grants to small businesses \nin the disaster areas that have been adversely impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina and require immediate access to capital until they can secure \nother loans or financial assistance. The goal is to disburse the funds \nwithin seven days, and this measure is based on a successful program \nthat helped victims of the hurricanes in Florida.\n  With the cost of Katrina relief and rebuilding estimated at over $100 \nbillion, small businesses, particularly those located in the disaster \narea and that employ individuals in the affected areas, should receive \ntheir fair share of federal contracting and subcontracting dollars. My \nbill also attempts to provide critical assistance to small businesses \nthat have been operating in the areas devastated by the Hurricane \nKatrina by expanding access to Federal contract and subcontracts.\n  Government projects provide solid business opportunities and prompt, \nsteady pay for small businessmen and businesswomen. In addition, \ngovernment procurement would open doors for many local small businesses \nto participate in the long-term reconstruction work in the Gulf Coast \nareas. Prior to the disaster, small construction companies in Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana brought home nearly $500 million in Federal \ncontracts a year. Total small business contracts in the Gulf Coast \nregion exceeded $3 billion a year. While many small businesses would \nbenefit from other forms of disaster assistance, many of them are ready \nto get back to work and into business as soon as possible.\n  To that end, my bill designates the Hurricane Katrina disaster area \nas a HUBZone. A HUBZone designation would enable small businesses \nlocating in the disaster area and employing people in that area to \nreceive contracting preferences and price evaluation preferences to \noffset greater costs of doing business. The HUBZone program was created \nto direct federal contacting dollars to economically distressed areas. \nExtending the HUBZone designation to the Gulf Coast would bring needed \nbusinesses development tools to affected areas.\n  In addition, my bill would increase the maximum size of surety bonds \nfrom $2 million to $5 million for Katrina-related contracts. Small \ncontractors vying for work need an increase in bonds to handle greater \nprojects for Hurricane Katrina relief. Local small businesses in the \nGulf Coast can use higher bonds to compensate for the damage to their \nassets from the Hurricane.\n  My bill would also direct the SBA, its resources partners, and the \nFederal offices of small and disadvantaged business utilization to \ncreate a contracting outreach program for small businesses located or \nwilling to locate in the Katrina disaster area. Finally, my bill would \nestablish small business contracting and subcontracting goals for all \nKatrina-related contracts and subcontracts to promote greater jobs \ncreation and development, while providing reasonable flexibility to \nFederal agencies in meeting that goal in light of difficult \ncircumstances on the ground.\n  Finally I would also like to comment on the funding levels provided \nfor the SBA in this bill. I have authorized the appropriation of $24.25 \nmillion for grants to increase business counseling in the damaged areas \nfor several SBA entrepreneurial development programs including: Small \nBusiness Development Centers (SBDCs); SCORE; Womens Business Centers \n(WBCs); Veteran's Business Centers, and Microloan Technical Assistance.\n  Our Nation's 25 million small businesses prove time and again to \nbreathe new life into our economy, by growing at twice the rate of all \nfirms. And when a disaster strikes, the spirit, determination and will \nof America's small\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\nbusinesses help to create the firm economic foundation, propelling our \nnation's economic growth. Therefore, we in turn must create an \natmosphere favorable for small businesses and provide this emergency \npackage to the SBA. We must allow Nation's small businesses to do what \nthey do best--``create jobs.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Too much is at stake for \nsmall businesses, and the economy as a whole, to allow this critical \nlegislation to languish. Congress must find essential agreement and \nfulfill its obligation to America's small businesses. Clearly, if we \nstrive for anything less, we fail to support the backbone of our \neconomy, our hope for new innovation, and the entrepreneurs reach for \nthe American dream.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Levin, \n        and Mr. McCain:\n  S. 1725 A bill to strengthen Federal leadership, provide grants, \nenhance outreach and guidance, and provide other support to State and \nlocal officials to enhance emergency communications capabilities, to \nachieve communications interoperability, to foster improved regional \ncollaboration and coordination, to promote more efficient utilization \nof funding devoted to public safety communications, to promote research \nand development by both the public and private sectors for first \nresponder communications, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Assure \nEmergency and Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act of \n2005--or EICOM--as a step towards improving emergency communications \nnationwide so no community experiences the communications failure we \nsaw in parts of the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I want to thank my cosponsors, Senators Collins, Levin, Akaka, and \nMcCain, for joining me in this effort.\n  The attack of 9/11 dramatically showed how vulnerable our first \nresponders are in an emergency when they are unable to communicate with \neach other.\n  Four years after 9/11, solving the problem of interoperability \nremains the number one priority for our Nation's first responders.\n  Whether responding to a terrorist attack, natural disaster, fire, a \nmissing child, or a fleeing suspect, police, fire fighters, emergency \nmedical technicians and other responders still all too frequently \narrive at the scene with incompatible communications equipment and \ncan't share crucial, life-saving information with each other.\n  This puts at risk both the lives of our first responders and those \nthey were sworn to protect.\n  I have previously introduced legislation that addresses the problems \nof interoperability. But Hurricane Katrina spotlighted an even more \nsevere problem--operability--the need for systems that themselves can \nsurvive a disaster, either natural or manmade. Katrina has shown us \nthat without a working communications system a coordinated response to \nan emergency becomes close to impossible.\n  This bill seeks to address the challenges of both interoperability \nand operability.\n  Hurricane Katrina blew down power lines, knocked out cell phone \ntowers and wiped out regular phone service in blasts of wind and water. \nIn too many areas the result was no regular or cell phone service and \nportable radios that slowly went dead because there was no way to \ncharge the batteries.\n  What do you do when you are down to zero communications? Gulf Coast \nemergency officials were repeatedly reduced to using runners to \ncommunicate between command centers and first responders in the field.\n  And this is not the first time this has happened in the United \nStates.\n  Some have suggested that the scenes out of the Gulf Coast had a third \nworld quality about them. But runners? That isn't Third World. That is \nthe ancient world. That is Athens in 490 BC when legend has it a runner \ncovered 300 miles in a week to share information and coordinate the \ndefense of the City of Marathon--thus the name of the race.\n  But certainly between 490 BC and the 21st Century we've made greater \nadvancement in communications technologies than better running shoes.\n  This bill seeks to remedy the communications nightmare we saw in New \nOrleans and the Gulf Coast--and make sure we don't have the same \nnightmare in future disasters.\n  This bill establishes an Office for Emergency Communications, \nInteroperability and Compatibility--or ECIC--within the Department of \nHomeland Security, replacing and strengthening the present Office for \nInteroperability and Compatibility.\n  This new and stronger ECIC will be charged with finding ways to \nestablish emergency communications capabilities when a terrorist \nattack, natural disaster or other large-scale emergency has damaged or \ndestroyed usual communications and electrical infrastructure.\n  This bill also tells the Secretary of DHS to establish a \ncomprehensive, competitive research and development program to identify \nand answer the policy and technology questions necessary to sustain \nemergency communications capabilities and achieve interoperability.\n  This includes promoting research through the Directorate of Science \nand Technology Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, \n(HSARPA) and considering establishing a Center of Excellence.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary of DHS to establish at least two \npilot projects to help us develop and test working emergency \ncommunications systems for first responders and government officials \nthat will survive a natural disaster or terrorist attack where there \nhas been damage to or destruction to critical infrastructure.\n  Finally, this bill establishes a grant program for States and \nregional consortiums to develop and implement short-term and long-term \nsolutions for emergency communications capabilities and \ninteroperability. Total grant amounts would start at $400,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2006, rising to $1 billion by 2010.\n  9/11 showed us the danger of non-interoperable communications for our \nfirst responders and the people they try to protect. Lives were likely \nlost that day because some first responders didn't get the orders to \nevacuate.\n  Katrina showed us the further peril that comes with zero \ncommunications. First responders tried to react to the disaster but \ndidn't know where to go or what to do.\n  And, again, we know lives were lost.\n  This is 21st Century America, not ancient Athens. We've moved beyond \nrunners. We have technologies at our disposal undreamed of even just a \nfew years ago and breakthroughs still to come.\n  Let's marshal our resources and summon our will and--with a sense of \nurgency--create communications systems that survive disaster so our \nfirst responders can do their jobs--helping others when lives are on \nthe line and seconds matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assure Emergency and \n     Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Communications among those responding to a natural \n     disaster, terrorist attack, or other large-scale emergency \n     are critical to an effective response and to save lives.\n       (2) Ordinary modes of communications are often difficult or \n     impossible during a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or \n     other catastrophic emergency, because of damage to critical \n     infrastructure, including the destruction of phone lines and \n     cellular towers, and loss of power sources and because of \n     increased demand placed on already strained systems.\n       (3) In the days after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf \n     Coast of the United States, the communications infrastructure \n     in the affected areas was decimated, and difficulties in \n     communicating among officials and first responders \n     significantly impeded the rescue and relief efforts.\n       (4) A further major barrier to sharing information among \n     police, firefighters, and others who may be called on to \n     respond to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other \n     large-scale emergencies is the lack of\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\n     interoperable communications systems, which can enable public \n     safety agencies to talk to one another and share important, \n     sometimes critical, information in an emergency. Police and \n     firefighters responding to the attacks at the World Trade \n     Center on September 11, 2001, had difficulty communicating \n     with each other. Initial press reports indicate that \n     conflicting radio frequencies also contributed to the \n     difficulties in communications among law enforcement and \n     government relief agencies in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n       (5) The Department of Homeland Security has identified \n     communications interoperability as 1 of the key national \n     priorities for first responders to achieve the National \n     Preparedness Goal that the Department of Homeland Security \n     has established for the Nation and has identified emergency \n     response communications as an essential target capability \n     needed to respond to a major event.\n       (6) The lack of emergency communication capabilities and \n     interoperability costs lives not only during terrorist \n     attacks or natural disasters, but also during everyday \n     emergency operations.\n       (7) Assuring emergency communications capabilities and \n     achieving interoperability is difficult because some 50,000 \n     local agencies typically make independent decisions about \n     communications systems. This lack of coordination also \n     dramatically increases the cost of public safety \n     communications to Federal, State, local, and tribal \n     governments.\n       (8) Achieving the level of emergency communications \n     capabilities and communications interoperability that is \n     needed will require an unprecedented level of coordination \n     and cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal \n     public safety agencies. Establishing multidisciplinary, \n     cross-jurisdictional governance structures to achieve the \n     necessary level of collaboration is essential to \n     accomplishing this goal.\n       (9) The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     consultation with other Federal officials, to establish a \n     program to ensure public safety interoperable communications \n     at all levels of government.\n       (10) However, much more remains to be done. For example, in \n     January 2005, the National Governors Association reported \n     that while achieving interoperability ranked as the top \n     priority for States, obtaining the equipment and technology \n     to fulfill this goal remains a challenge. The large majority \n     of States report that they have not yet achieved \n     interoperability in their States.\n       (11) Much of the communications equipment used by emergency \n     responders is outdated and incompatible, which inhibits \n     communication between State and local governments and between \n     neighboring local jurisdictions. Additional grant funding \n     would facilitate the acquisition of new technology to enable \n     interoperability.\n       (12) Stronger and more effective national, statewide, and \n     regional leadership are required to improve emergency \n     communications capabilities and interoperability. The \n     Department of Homeland Security must provide national \n     leadership by conducting nationwide outreach to each State, \n     fostering the development of regional leadership, and \n     providing substantial technical assistance to State, local, \n     and tribal public safety officials, while more effectively \n     utilizing grant programs that fund interoperable equipment \n     and systems.\n       (13) The Department of Homeland Security must implement \n     pilot programs and fund and conduct research to develop and \n     promote adoption of next-generation solutions for public \n     safety communications. The Department of Homeland Security \n     must also further develop its own internal expertise to \n     enable it to better lead national interoperability efforts \n     and to provide technically sound advice to State and local \n     officials.\n       (14) Achieving emergency communications capabilities and \n     interoperability requires the sustained commitment of \n     substantial resources. Nonetheless, emergency communications \n     capabilities and interoperability can be accomplished at a \n     much lower cost than would otherwise be possible if strong \n     national leadership drives cooperation and adoption of smart, \n     new technology solutions.\n       (15) The private sector has a critical role to play in \n     developing cost-effective solutions to these problems.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled ``The Defense \nTravel System: Boon or Boondoggle?'' This Subcommittee hearing on the \nDepartment of Defense's (DOD) Defense Travel System (DTS) is part of \nits continuing investigation of DOD's travel policies and practices. \nThe DTS was intended to be a seamless integrated computer-based travel \nsystem that would facilitate travel for DOD employees and lead to \nincreased efficiency and substantial cost savings. However, reports by \nthe DOD Inspector General, the DOD Program Analysis and Evaluation \nDivision, the Government Accountability Office, The Corporate Solutions \nGroup and Citizens Against Government Waste have questioned whether DTS \nis effective and provides a cost benefit to DOD. These reports indicate \nthat DTS has cost more than was anticipated, has not been fully \ndeployed, does not appear to be widely used, does not list all \navailable airfares and may end up costing more than it has saved. The \nquestions raised by these reports remain largely unanswered by DOD. The \nhearing will explore whether DTS can deliver on the increased \nefficiency and cost savings that were anticipated when the program was \nestablished.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Thursday, September 2, \n2005, at 9:30 a.m. in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. \nFor further information, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff \nDirector and Chief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, at 224-3721.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10200-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

This was the Enzi Workforce Investment Act for victims of \nKatrina, S. 1718. I mention that only because there were a couple of \nbills this morning, and then this bill, all of which reflect a lot of \nactivity that is going on behind the scenes. By ``behind the scenes,'' \nI mean off the floor, in committees with members and chairmen working \nwith their ranking members. There is a lot of work focused on the \nresponse and the appropriate support for recovery after Katrina.\n  As several people have mentioned on the floor over the course of \ntoday, there were seven Republicans and seven Democrats who represented \nthis body last Friday in New Orleans and along the gulf coast, \nMississippi, and on to Mobile, AL. We all learned a lot. We saw a lot. \nIt contributed to our own education.\n  Then, later tonight, a number of us will continue that work as we \nfigure out how best to respond to this catastrophe, this disaster which \nis ongoing, to respond in a way that will rebuild and reconstruct in \nvery positive ways to help those affected. Our hearts and our prayers \nand our thoughts and our efforts on the floor all go out to the \nvictims, both those in Mississippi and\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\nAlabama and Louisiana and the half-a-million people, predominantly \npeople from New Orleans but also from the gulf coast, Mississippi and \nAlabama, who are in other States beyond those three.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10201-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will return to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. This bill was laid down last Thursday and we \nresumed that bill today. Unfortunately, Members did not take advantage \nof their opportunity to offer amendments during those 2 days. I very \nmuch appreciate the Democratic leader, on behalf of one of his \ncolleagues, offering an amendment a few minutes ago.\n  I am prepared to tell the managers that if no one comes to offer \namendments, we should go to third reading and passage of the bill. We \ngive Senators the opportunity to offer amendments, they say they are \ngoing to offer amendments in the future, and they do not come to the \nfloor. That leaves us with the only alternative, which is going to \nthird reading and passage of the bill. We will talk to the committee \nand see if we can vote on the amendment that the Democratic leader just \nintroduced prior to the policy recess.\n  But having said that, I do need to forewarn all of our colleagues \nthat the managers on these appropriations bills, both the ones over the \nlast 2 weeks as well as the Agriculture appropriations bill we are \ndealing with, are very patient. They have been very patient. They stay \non the floor throughout the day, and they are here many nights and \nMondays and Fridays, waiting for our colleagues to offer the amendments \nthat they say they want to offer. It is now time for people to get very \nserious and come over and, if they have amendments, to offer those \namendments. There is no reason to wait for a Wednesday night or a \nThursday night to offer amendments. I do ask our colleagues to contact \nSenators Bennett and Kohl now, to work through their amendments.\n  We are going to have a busy week. Real progress has been made on the \njudicial nomination to the Supreme Court--last week with the hearings \nand this week at the committee level. Next week that nomination will be \nbrought to the floor of the Senate, and ultimately we will all have the \nopportunity to speak and vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/19/senate-section/article/S10201-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
