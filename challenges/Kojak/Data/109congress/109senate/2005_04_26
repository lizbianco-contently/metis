Mr. President, I rise under morning business to discuss \nsome events that occurred overnight. Most important, there is a story \nin today's USA Today, based on a direct interview, that Karl Rove \nrejected a compromise with Senate Democrats Monday on long-stalled \nnominations for the Federal judiciary and strongly defended President \nBush's choice of John Bolton.\n  I am going to talk about the first matter.\n  It is disconcerting and surprising to see an aide to the President, \nan important aide, tell the Senate how to conduct itself. The Senate \nhas conducted itself by its own rules for decades--for centuries. Those \nrules, by the design of the Founding Fathers, written into the \nConstitution, talk about the Senate as being a preserve of minority \nrights. The Founding Fathers called it the cooling saucer.\n  It is clear, if you read the Federalist Papers and look at the \nhistory of this Republic, that when a Senate minority of 45 rejects 10 \nout of 215 judges and supports 205 out of 215, that is the very way the \nFounding Fathers wanted the Senate to behave. After all, one of the \nvery earliest nominations of President\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nWashington, John Rutledge, was rejected by the Senate for the Supreme \nCourt--rejected by the Senate. In that Senate were I believe eight \nFounding Fathers, the people who wrote the Constitution, rejecting the \nPresident's choice.\n  We have, in a certain sense, people way out of the mainstream, way \nover--a small group--telling the Republican Party in the Senate and \ntelling the President that they must have all the judges, including the \nmost extreme. Because, after all, it was only the most extreme we \nrejected, judges who believe, for instance, that the New Deal was a \nsocialist revolution and should be undone; judges who believe zoning \nlaws are unconstitutional; judges who believe the purpose of a woman \nshould be to be subjugate herself to a man; judges who believe slavery \nwas God's gift to white people.\n  These are some of the judges we have rejected. It was not based on \nany one particular issue. People say this is all code for abortion. It \nis not. I have voted for I believe it is about 190 of the judges. The \noverwhelming majority do not agree with me on abortion, but I believe \nthey met the ultimate test, that they would interpret the law, not make \nlaw. Thus, even though they had strongly held beliefs on their own, \nthey would be good judges. The 10 we rejected failed that test. They \nfeel so passionately that they have to impose their views.\n  One of them, Priscilla Owen of Texas, was criticized repeatedly by \nconservative members of her own court, the Texas Supreme Court, for \nplacing her interpretation of law ahead of the standard interpretation, \nthe interpretation everybody accepted.\n  So we were proud to do our constitutional duty and reject these \njudges, judges we were not consulted about, judges who were way out of \nthe mainstream.\n  Now, because of the demands of a few--way over, way out there--it \nseems the majority leader is pushing the so-called nuclear option. The \nproblem is a large number, a good number of people on the other side, \ndo not want to do the nuclear option. They know it would change the \nrules in the middle of the game. You don't change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game because you cannot get your way on every single \njudge. Our Constitution, our system of laws, is too hallowed, is too \nimportant to do that.\n  These wavering Republican Senators know the Senate has been the \nrepository of checks and balances. That is why we have not done the \nnuclear option yet. I have to say I wish the majority leader would not \nbe moving it. He should as a Senator stand up for the rights of the \nSenate. He should as an American stand up for the rights of the \nAmerican people. But that has not happened.\n  Yesterday they had to call the heavy guns in. Karl Rove, a member of \nthe executive branch, told the Senate Republicans there should be no \ncompromise.\n  It is quite natural, by the way, that the White House would not want \na Senate with checks and balances. This is not simply true of \nRepublican Presidents, it is true of all Presidents, whether they be \nDemocrat or Republican. They want to have their way. They regard the \nlegislature, and particularly the Senate, as sort of a pesky obstacle \nto getting their way.\n  But the wisdom of our Republic has shown that when the Senate does \nslow things down, when the Senate does invoke checks and balances, the \nRepublic is better off.\n  Now we have Karl Rove telling the Senate how they ought to act--how \nwe ought to act--to change a tradition of 200 years.\n  Senator Reid has said publicly that the President told him the White \nHouse would stay out of this. That is clearly not the case. The White \nHouse is not staying out of this and they are trying to aggrandize \nexecutive power. The American people, though, are not buying it. There \nis a story today in the Washington Post that shows `` . . . by a 2 to 1 \nratio''--that is pretty strong, that is more than the filibuster \namount--\n\n     the public rejected easing the Senate rules in a way that \n     would make it harder for Democratic Senators to prevent final \n     action on Bush's nominees. Even many Republicans were \n     reluctant to abandon current Senate confirmation procedures. \n     Nearly half opposed any rule changes, joining eight in 10 \n     Democrats and seven in 10 political independents. . . .\n\n  The American public may not follow minute to minute, day by day, what \nwe do on this floor, but they have a pretty good nose to smell what is \ngoing on. What they smell is a whiff of extremism, a whiff of ``I can't \nget my way so I change the rules in the middle of the game,'' a whiff \nof ``not simply a fight of the moment over a particular judge but \nrather a desire not to live with the traditions of this body and this \nRepublic, which involves compromise and mediation.''\n  Honestly, when I recommended to our caucus early on that we \nfilibuster a few of the judges and then later that we prevent and stand \nup to the nuclear option no matter what it took, I thought we would \nlose politically. I thought the argument: ``Well, have 51 votes on \neverything'' would prevail. But the American people's wisdom is large, \ndeep, and hard to fool. The American people have said they understand \nwhat is going on. When the Republicans were in charge, they didn't \nallow judges to come out. We are not in charge now and the filibuster \nis a way of mitigating the President's desire to put whomever he wants \non the bench and that the filibuster is appropriate.\n  I do not believe what some on the other side say, that the public is \nwith the Democrats because they have gotten their message out ahead of \nus. Please. The public is with the Democrats in this case, not because \nthey are Democratic and not because they may agree with the stand or \ndisagree with the stand of each of the judges we have rejected--\nalthough I suspect that would be the case if they knew--the public is \nwith us because they understand fundamentally the checks and balances \nthat are so important in this Republic and that because a President \ngets 51\\1/2\\ percent of the vote he doesn't always have to get his way, \nparticularly when it comes to choosing the third, unelected--only \nunelected branch of Government.\n  So Mr. Rove can order Senators not to compromise. I hope and pray the \nSenators will not take direction from the White House on something \nwhere the interests of the White House, whatever party the President \nmight be, are different from those of the Senate and frankly different \nfrom the Republic's--and I believe they will not.\n  The wisdom of the American people is strong. I let my colleagues \nknow, if they should try to invoke the nuclear option and it succeeds, \nwe will have no choice but to enforce the Senate rules and try to bring \nup issues the American people want us to bring up: the high cost of \nenergy and gasoline, health care, education. We do not usually do that \nbecause of comity in the Senate. After all, the other party is the \nmajority party.\n\n  But if they are not respecting the rights of the minority, as a \nmajority, they do not deserve that same deference. What we will do is \nnot shut down the Senate, not not show up. We will, rather, use the \nremaining rules at our disposal to bring up issues the American people \ncare about.\n  Again, my plea to my colleagues on the other side--I know many of \nthem have doubts about this nuclear option but are under tremendous \npressure--resist the entreaties of the executive branch, in this case \nin the personification of Mr. Rove, stand tall, stand firm. Do not \nchange the rules in the middle of the game; protect the sacred checks \nand balances at the core of the Republic by rejecting this trampling on \nthe rules, the so-called nuclear option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

There are 18 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4226-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4226-S4228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DANGEROUS POLITICAL INTERSECTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, everyone in this country knows what a \ndangerous intersection is. We all drive and understand the consequences \nof a dangerous intersection. We are coming to a dangerous intersection \nin American politics, especially in the Congress: first, by actions \nthat are, on their face, wrong and are harmful to our country; and \nsecond, by inaction on matters that cry out for attention--but, again, \nget none in this Congress and by this administration.\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\n  We face a different kind of politics than most have experienced \nbefore when we see prominent members of the Congress participate in \nexercises with outside groups who suggest those who are not with them \non the issues are people who lack faith, are people who are not people \nof faith. Those are dangerous grounds to tread on politically. Yet they \ndo it and do it willingly.\n  As I was listening to my colleague, I remembered going to a puppet \nshow my daughter participated in during grade school some years ago. Of \ncourse, in a puppet show you see only the puppet; you do not see who is \nbehind the black cloth. There are puppet shows going on here in the \nCongress, of course, and in the administration. Perhaps today's USA \nToday tells us a little bit about who is behind the screen. The chief \npolitical adviser to the White House, Mr. Karl Rove, says there will be \nno compromise on this issue of judges. It seems to me, a White House \nthat has said it is not involved in this issue is clearly neck deep in \nthis issue, and perhaps is the one behind the screen in this case. \nWhether it is on this so-called nuclear option with respect to the vote \non the judges in the Senate or the Social Security debate going on \nregarding whether we should privatize Social Security as recommended by \nthe White House, Mr. Rove has played a very prominent role.\n  To take Social Security for a moment, the memorandum leaked in \nJanuary from the White House by the chief strategist on this issue, who \nworks for Mr. Rove, said that, for the first time in six decades, we \nhave a chance to win on Social Security.\n  What does that mean? It means they have never liked Social Security. \nThey want to take Social Security apart. That memorandum also said we \nhave to claim there is a crisis and convince people there is a crisis \nin Social Security. Of course, it is not working because there is not a \ncrisis in Social Security which has been and is an enormously important \nprogram, lifting tens of millions of senior citizens out of poverty in \nthis country. The fact is that Social Security will be fully solvent \nuntil President George W. Bush is 106 years old. That is hardly a \ncrisis.\n  People are living longer, and we may need to make adjustments in \nSocial Security as we move along, but it does not require major \nsurgery. And, the President's proposal to borrow $5 trillion and then \nstick it in the stock market and cut Social Security benefits and sit \nback and hope, is not much of a plan.\n  It is interesting to me that the American people, in poll after poll \nafter poll, are rejecting this. I was at a Social Security forum over \nthe weekend. We did them in several States. A fellow came up to us at \nthe forum and said, I am 88 years old. I am blind, and Social Security \nis all I have. I think people are very concerned about this notion of \nsticking this money in private accounts and just hoping, after you have \nborrowed trillions, hoping somehow things will be better.\n  Whether it is Social Security and private accounts and the attempt to \ntake the Social Security system apart or this issue of the nuclear \noption because the majority party and the President have gotten only 95 \npercent of the Federal judges they want, these intersections are \ndangerous.\n\n  Let me describe the danger of the intersection with respect to the \nso-called nuclear option. The Constitution of the United States is \nclear about judges. In fact, originally when they put this Constitution \ntogether, they felt perhaps they would have the Senate or the Congress \nappoint judges. Instead, there is a two-step process. The President \ndecides who shall be nominated to the Senate for a lifetime appointment \non the Federal bench to the Federal courts and then the Senate decides \nwhether they will support that nomination. It is called advice and \nconsent. This President, President Bush, has sent the Senate 215 \nnominees to serve for a lifetime on the Federal court. We have \nsupported 205 of them. That is 95 percent. But that is not enough. The \nPresident and the majority party say we want it all.\n  I remember people like that on the playground when I was in school. \nThey want it all. If they do not get it all, they are going to take \ntheir bat and ball and go home. In this case, if they do not get it \nall, they will violate the Senate rules in order to change the Senate \nrules. How will they violate the rules? They will overturn precedent in \nthe Senate in terms of how the rules are changed. It takes 67 votes to \nchange the rules of the Senate. The so-called nuclear option devised by \nthe majority party is a strategy by which they will overturn the ruling \nof the Parliamentarian that the rules are being violated, and by a \nmajority vote, overturn the rule and effectively change the rules of \nthe Senate by violating the rules of the Senate. Some people do not \ncare about that. That is fine. If you care a lot about the future of \nthis country, if you care a lot about democracy, if you care about \nmaking a democratic government work by compromise, you ought to care a \nlot about this.\n  It is arrogant. It reflects the feeling of a party that controls the \nWhite House, the House, and the Senate, that they must get their way on \neverything.\n  The reason a 60-vote requirement--that is, a filibuster--is useful to \nthe workings of democracy is because it requires compromise. It \nrequires Members to reach a threshold of 60 votes in the Senate, which \nrequires you to reach across the aisle and talk to people of the other \nparty. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. Compromise is a good \nthing. Bipartisanship is a good thing, not a bad thing. We have people \nnow who look at it as something that is awful. We want to take a \npartisan group that has 51 votes and is muscle-bound--it is politics on \nsteroids--and ram it through the Congress and violate the rules in \norder to change the rules. It is not what this country should expect \nfrom the Congress.\n  Here is today's paper: ``Filibuster Rule Change Opposed.'' It is \ninteresting that there is a broad center of common sense. There always \nhas been. Over two centuries, this country's political system moves one \ndirection and then the other direction. But there is a strong magnetic \npull back to the center. That magnetic pull comes from a reservoir of \ncommon sense all across this country of people who basically know what \nis the right thing. They know from their school days, from their civic \norganizations, they know from their everyday lives you do not violate \nthe rules to change rules. We have certain rules. You do not violate \nrules to change rules. People know that inherently, and they also know \nthe consequences of one-party rule that says it is our way and that is \nthe only way and we refuse to compromise on anything.\n  For that reason, it is quite clear that two-thirds of the American \npeople have that reservoir of common sense and are expressing it. I \nhope the majority party will listen. I especially hope Mr. Rove and the \nWhite House, who says there will be no compromise, will understand that \ncompromise is what makes this Senate work.\n  In the McCullough book about John Adams, as I told my colleagues \npreviously, he would write to Abigail--because John Adams was in \nEurope, representing our country in England and France as they tried to \nput this new country together--he would write to his wife, Abigail, and \nask the question, plaintively: Who will be the leaders? Who will emerge \nas the leaders to help form this new country of ours? From where will \nthe leadership come? And then in the next letter to Abigail, he would \nask the question in different ways again: Who will be the leaders? Then \nhe would say: It appears there is only us. There is me, there is George \nWashington, there is Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, Mason, Madison.\n  In the rearview mirror of history, the only ``us'' is some of the \ngreatest human talent that has ever been assembled that created quite a \nremarkable country. For 2 centuries, Americans have asked the same \nquestion: From where will the leadership come? How will the leadership \nemerge to steer this country and provide direction for this great \ndemocracy of ours? In almost every case, the American people have been \nsurprised by those who step forward.\n  We have been enormously blessed by wonderful leaders--Republicans, \nDemocrats, conservatives, liberals--leaders who step forward at the \nright time, at the right moment, to say: Here is where America needs to \nmove. Here is how we need to improve and strengthen this great \ndemocracy of ours.\n  I ask again, and I think America asks again, with the backdrop of \nthese questions, violating the Senate rules to\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nchange Senate rules, taking apart the most successful program we have \nhad in this country's history, the Social Security Program, the \nAmerican people are asking, as they answer these polls: Where is the \nleadership? Where will the leadership come from to put this country on \ntrack?\n  We do have crisis. It is not Social Security. We have a bona fide \ncrisis in health care. Prescription drug costs, health care costs are \ngoing straight up, and no one is doing anything about it. We have a \ncrisis in jobs. We have the biggest trade deficit in human history, and \nwe are choking on it. We have massive numbers of American jobs moving \nevery single day overseas. It is an epidemic because American workers \nare being told by their multinational employers: You either compete \nwith 30-cent labor from China or we are sorry, it is over for you. That \njob goes to China for 30 cents an hour, working 7 days a week, 12 to 14 \nhours a day, often kids. We have an epidemic in jobs and trade. We have \na serious problem with the largest budget deficits in the history of \nthis country. Yes, that is a crisis.\n  Last week, we passed an $80 billion emergency supplemental bill to \npay for the costs in Iraq and Afghanistan and not one penny was paid \nfor. The administration that requested it did not suggest it be paid \nfor. Congress did not suggest it be paid for. Just add it to the debt. \nSend the soldiers to Iraq and bring them back later and have them pay \nfor the debt.\n  So, yes, we have some crises. Health care, jobs, trade deficit, \nfiscal policy, energy. Drive to the gas pumps and ask yourself whether \nthere is a problem there. And then we have the Crown Prince of Saudi \nArabia going to Texas yesterday to explain how much additional oil they \nwill pump in order to help us with our energy problem. Sixty percent of \nour oil comes from off our shores, much of it from troubled parts of \nthe world--Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela, Kuwait.\n  If, God forbid, tomorrow the pipeline for sending oil to this country \nfrom those troubled parts of the world were ruptured, this country's \neconomy would be flat on its back. We are held hostage by oil from off \nour shores to the extent we have to have the Saudis come to Texas, to \nthe ranch, to explain to us how they are going to help us solve our \nproblems.\n  The fact is, we do have crises. The operative question is, Where is \nthe leadership? Where is the leadership? Where will it come from to \ndeal with these issues? No, I am not talking about the nuclear option. \nThat is a specious approach, one that will injure this Senate and \ninjure this country. I am not talking about taking Social Security \napart--exactly the wrong thing. I am talking about the leadership for \nthings that really matter to American families.\n  When people are in their homes, sitting at their tables, having \nsupper, they talk about issues such as: Do I have a good job? Does it \npay well? Do I have job security? Do grandpa and grandma have access to \ngood health care? How about the kids, do they have access to doctors \nwhen they need it? Are our kids going to a school we are proud of? Do \nwe live in safe neighborhoods? Those are things that are operative in \nthe midst of families' interests about this country and where they \nlive.\n  I hope very much the majority party will understand what the American \npeople are telling them: Lay off the nuclear option. Accept that 95-\npercent support for judges nominated by this President, which is a \npretty good record. Ninety-five percent, that is a good record. Accept \nand understand there is an opposition party. They, too, have rights. \nAnd accept and understand that compromise is not a bad word. Compromise \nrecognizes that this democracy works when you have bipartisanship, when \nyou reach across the aisle. That is what the 60-vote margin requires us \nto do, in my judgment. And answer the question, Where is the \nleadership? Just answer that question, Where is the leadership on \nissues that matter to American families? My hope is, in the coming days \nwe will see some of that leadership both here in the Congress and also \nfrom this administration.\n  Last, and most importantly, let's not ever hear again that those with \nwhom you disagree are not people of faith. What a shameless thing to be \ndoing, to suggest that your political opponents are people who are not \npeople of faith. This country is better than that. Political debate and \ndialog can be better than that. And the American people expect and \ndeserve better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the broken \nconfirmation process for Federal judges. The Senate faces an \nunprecedented crisis and is failing the Constitution and the American \npeople.\n  For the first time in the Senate's history, a minority of Senators is \ntwisting the rules of the Senate to block the will of the majority. \nThey are taking for themselves a power granted only to the President of \nthe United States, the power of nominating judges. Just as disturbing \nis the fact that the minority is also threatening to shut down the \nSenate and the people's business if the majority acts to restore Senate \ntradition and fulfill our constitutional responsibility.\n  Make no mistake about it, we will restore the Senate tradition of \ntaking up-or-down votes on the President's nominees. Hopefully, the \nminority will support the nomination process the Senate has practiced \nfor more than 200 years and end the filibuster of judicial nominations. \nBut if the majority of the Senate must act to restore that tradition, \nwe will do so.\n  Like many Senators, I spend a lot of time in my home State. I meet \nwith constituents, give speeches to civic groups, and tour \nmanufacturing plants. I have heard a lot about the war in Iraq and \nSocial Security. People talk about gas prices and the economy, \neducation, and health care. But the topic I hear about the most is the \nimportance of confirming judges.\n  Last November, election day came and the American people spoke. \nPresident Bush won reelection by receiving the most votes ever cast for \na Presidential candidate. A majority of the American people clearly \nendorsed his policies and his leadership. So when this Congress \nconvened, I had high hopes that the crisis of judicial nominations was \nbehind us.\n\n  I hoped the Senators who obstructed the Senate's business over the \npast 2 years realized the errors of their ways. After all, they lost \nseats in the Senate, and their minority leader also was defeated in the \nlast election. I hoped we could turn to voting on President Bush's \nnominations to the Federal bench. I hoped we would return to the Senate \ntradition of giving nominees an up-or-down vote.\n  But it did not take long to realize that was not going to be the \ncase. The minority proudly boasts about their filibustering the \nPresident's nominees. And if the majority acts to restore Senate \ntradition, they say they are going to expand their obstructionism to \nthe entire business of the Senate and shut down the Government.\n  In article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the President is given \nthe power to nominate judges. And upon advice and consent of the \nSenate, those nominees shall be placed on the bench.\n  So the President alone has the power to pick judges. And the Senate \nhas the responsibility to render its advice and consent. That leads to \nthe question of what does ``advice and consent'' mean? Fortunately, I \nam not a lawyer or a constitutional scholar. But I can read. And the \nFramers were pretty clear when they spoke.\n  First, they said the Senate as a whole is to give its advice and \nconsent. When the Constitution speaks of the Senate as a whole body, it \nmeans a majority of the body. The Supreme Court has even stated as \nmuch.\n  Second, the Framers were pretty clear when they required more than a \nmajority to act. For example, they required a two-thirds vote to amend \nthe Constitution. They required a two-thirds vote to convict and remove \nfrom office an impeached President or Federal official. But even more \ntelling, in the very same sentence of the Constitution that gives the \nSenate the duty to render advice and consent on nominations, the \nFramers also required a two-thirds vote to approve a treaty.\n  Now, if Framers meant that a supermajority vote was required to \napprove\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\na nominee, they would have clearly stated so. The supermajority is \nsomething the Constitution rejects for nominees, but that is exactly \nwhat the minority is saying when they filibuster a nominee. The \nminority is attempting to shift the balance of power away from the \nexecutive to the legislative branch. That is nothing more than \nrewriting the Constitution and the separation of powers the Framers \ndesigned more than 200 years ago.\n  What the Constitution does give every Senator a right to do is to \nexpress his or her opinion on a nominee and on the nominee's \nqualifications. That right is to speak in support of or in opposition \nto, and vote for or against a nominee. But no Senator has the right to \nprevent the whole Senate from voting on judicial nominees if they are \nunable to convince enough Senators to join in their opposition.\n  It is the duty of Senators to speak their objections and then vote \nyes or no. They may make the ultimate statement against a nominee by \nvoting against him or her, but they may not prevent the rest of the \nSenate from giving the same ultimate statement. They must not block an \nup-or-down vote on the nominee. In fact, for more than 200 years, this \nis how the Senate has considered nominations: with an up-or-down vote. \nDebate has taken place, and then the nominee has been given a vote.\n  Never before the 108th Congress was a nominee with majority support \ndenied a vote on the Senate floor. Never before the last Congress had \nthe rules of the Senate been twisted to prevent such a vote. Previous \nSenates had not even considered filibustering nominees as an option. \nThe rules do not explicitly prohibit it because Senate tradition has \nalways been to allow the nominee, no matter how controversial, an up-\nor-down vote.\n  I remember a situation in the 106th Congress. A group of Republicans \nopposed several of President Clinton's nominees to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Some Senators wanted to do everything within their \npower to stop those nominees from reaching the bench. But the majority \nleader at the time, Senator Trent Lott, said this was wrong and filed \ncloture himself to move the nominations forward. Cloture was invoked, \nand both nominees were confirmed, with many more Senators opposing the \nnominations than cloture.\n  Today, President Bush's nominees, who all have majority support, are \nbeing denied a vote by a partisan filibuster led by the Democratic \nParty leadership. That is unprecedented and must come to an end.\n  Just years ago, many Senators who now champion the filibuster of \nPresident Bush's nominees stated that judicial nominees should receive \nan up-or-down vote. Some even advocated abolishing the filibuster \naltogether. In fact, 19 members of the minority who are still serving \ntoday voted to abolish all filibusters. And now some of those Senators \nare the loudest voices in the Senate for filibustering President Bush's \nnominees.\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have spoken out against \nfilibustering nominations. For example, the senior Senator from New \nYork said, in 2000:\n\n       We are charged with voting on the nominees.\n\n  The junior Senator from California said, in 1997:\n\n       It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process \n     and prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even \n     being given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  The current minority whip said, in 1998:\n\n       If, after 150 days languishing on the Executive Calendar \n     that name has not been called for a vote, it should be. Vote \n     the person up or down.\n\n  And the senior Senator from Massachusetts said, in 1998:\n\n       We should resolve these disagreements by voting on these \n     nominees--yes or no.\n\n  It is amazing how some easily forget their own words. Or maybe I \nshould say, conveniently and selectively forget their own words.\n  Well, Republicans did give President Clinton's nominees an up-or-down \nvote. And now the minority should allow the same courtesy to President \nBush's nominees.\n  Something we have heard over and over from the minority is how many \nof President Bush's nominees they have allowed to be confirmed. Let's \ntalk about that. The minority likes to talk about all nominations, but \nall nominations are not equal in their impact within the judiciary. \nDistrict court judges, while they are very important, are not as \npowerful as circuit court judges. President Bush's nominees to the \ncircuit court have the lowest confirmation rate since the Roosevelt \nadministration at 69 percent. President Clinton's circuit court \nnominees were confirmed at a rate of 77 percent, far above President \nBush.\n  And not all circuit courts are equal. The DC Circuit is the most \nimportant. For that court, only 33 percent of President Bush's nominees \nhave been confirmed. President Clinton's nominees were confirmed 78 \npercent of the time. Those differences are staggering and support the \nfact that our judicial confirmation system is broken because of the \nobstruction tactics of the minority.\n  Something must be done to fix this crisis. The solution can be up to \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The simplest, fastest, \nand most desirable option is for the minority to agree to drop its \nobstructionist ways and allow an up-or-down vote on all judicial \nnominees. Unfortunately, that does not appear likely to happen.\n  Last Congress, the current minority leader was asked how much time \nhis side needed to present their case against a nominee. He replied \nthat there was ``not a number in the universe'' that they would accept.\n  So where does that leave us? The only answer I could see is to \nrestore Senate tradition through a change in the rules of the Senate. \nArticle I, section 5 of the Constitution reads:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings . . .\n\n  That means a majority of the Senate can act to change the rules. It \nis the responsibility of the majority of Senators who want to fulfill \nthe Senate's constitutional duty to take action necessary to do so. \nMajority action to set the rules of the Senate is not unprecedented, \nnor is it an assault on the body.\n  It cannot be an attack on the Senate to act to restore 200-plus years \nof Senate tradition and allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional \nobligations. The senior member of the Senate Democratic caucus himself \nhas taken such action. Not once, not twice, but four times in a 10-year \nperiod, the senior Senator from West Virginia changed the application \nof the Senate rules through a majority vote, and all four times his \nactions were aimed at limiting Senators' rights to debate or \nfilibuster. Senate history is filled with other examples of majority \naction resulting in a change to the Senate rules to restrict the \nfilibuster.\n  Let me make something very clear: We are not talking about changing \nthe legislative filibuster. In fact, the only Senators I have heard \nadvocating elimination of legislative filibusters are on the other side \nof the aisle. Not only does the legislative filibuster have a place in \nthe Senate's tradition and history, it is fundamentally different from \nthe filibuster of judicial nominees. Writing legislation is solely \nwithin the power of the legislative branch, and the Senate is empowered \nby the Constitution to set its own rules.\n  In the case of nominations, the nominating power is the power of the \nPresident, and the Senate can only accept or reject those nominees. The \npurpose of a legislative filibuster is to force changes in the \nlegislation. However, no number of Senators can amend nominations; we \ncan only accept or reject them. There is a place for the legislative \nfilibuster within the Constitution, but there is not for the filibuster \nof judicial nominations.\n  So I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a deep \nbreath and step back from the line in the sand that they have drawn. \nOffer us a compromise that guarantees each nominee a vote. Give us a \nset of time for debate. Let's take a vote. This issue is too important \nfor the majority of the Senate to ignore anymore. We cannot and will \nnot let a minority of this body rewrite the Constitution and destroy \nthe Senate's traditions. We must vote, and we will vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 3, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill (H.R. 3) \n     to authorize funds for Federal aid highways, highway safety \n     programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am glad this day is here and that we are \nproceeding. I certainly encourage my colleagues to vote for this motion \nto proceed. I have every expectation that it will pass overwhelmingly. \nIt seems as though we are always in a lot of controversy when we talk \nabout a highway reauthorization bill. It doesn't come along very \noften--about every 6 years. In my tenure here, I have been involved in \nfour of them. This is the fourth, and it is very significant.\n  It is interesting that even though there is a lot of criticism, when \nit gets down to the vote, the vote is always overwhelming. I remind my \ncolleagues that last year's bill was at $318 billion--that was contract \nauthority--and there was about $303 billion in guaranteed spending. It \npassed by a margin of 76 to 21. It is something I know people are \ninterested in, but there are always problems. First of all, let me just \nsay how this is bipartisan. My good friend, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords--back when the Democrats were in the \nmajority, he was chairman--and I always agreed on these highway issues. \nIt is kind of interesting that those of us who are conservatives really \nbelieve this is something we are supposed to be doing here--building \ninfrastructure, building roads. I am particularly concerned that our \nState Of Oklahoma has not had its fair share. We have been ranked as \nhaving the worst bridges in the Nation.\n  Anyway, we have the bill up. It is going to be essentially the same \nbill as we had last year. We passed it out of committee. There is \nalways a problem. Let me mention this because it needs to come out in \nthe beginning. There are two different ways to have a highway program. \nOne is to do it--and essentially the other body does it more this way--\nby taking projects and adding them, and you pass this, so you know what \nprojects will be there for the next 6 years. If you do that, then the \npeople who are on the inside track would have the best opportunity to \nhave theirs, and there is always an accusation of there being pork and \nhaving special projects.\n  In the Senate, we do it the hard way. We have a formula. When you \nhave a formula, it takes into consideration so many different aspects. \nThere is not one State that could not stand and say, my State is not \nbeing treated fairly because of this factor or the other factor. If you \nlook at the formula factors, you have so many factors, such as \ninterstate lane miles, vehicle miles traveled on interstates, \ncontributions to the highway trust fund, the lane miles, principal \narteries, VMT on principal arteries, diesel fuel, donee status, donor \nstatus, and low-income States. Oklahoma is a low-income State. That \nshould be a consideration. You have a low-population State, such as the \none of Senator Baucus, who has been in the leadership working on this \nissue. They still have to be able to drive even though they don't have \na large population from which to get the funds. You have the high-\nfatality-rate States. You have a factor for the guaranteed minimum \ngrowth and the guaranteed minimum rate of return for donor States.\n  Oklahoma has been a donor State for as long as I can remember. I \nremember when we had written into the law we would get back 75 percent \nof what we have paid in. Now it is up to 90.5 percent. If we passed the \nbill last year at that funding level, it would be 95 percent. It looks \nlike with the figure that we passed out of the committee on the floor \nthat we will be considering today is one that will allow us to get to \n92 percent.\n  I know the formula is not perfect. There are a lot of donor States \nthat think they are not getting enough. A lot of donee States think \nthey are not getting enough. The unhappy donee States complain about \nthe growth rate, but they are ignoring the high rate of return. The \nunhappy donor States are complaining about the rate of return, but they \nare ignoring the high growth rates. I have seen unhappy donors trying \nto rewrite formulas. You cannot do that in a vacuum. I am sympathetic \nwith unhappy States; however, they cannot change the formula in a \nvacuum and not affect every other State. One of the States is trying to \ndo that right now, and that would adversely affect the rest of the \nStates. It is something that is difficult to deal with. When we get to \nconference, there are things we can do that we cannot do on the Senate \nfloor. Perhaps some of these things will be done.\n  With that, I will yield to Senator Jeffords, the ranking member on \nour Environment and Public Works Committee, for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \ncalling for the approval of the motion to proceed that we will soon \nvote on.\n  For more than 3 years Congress has been trying to pass a highway \nbill. Today we are taking one more step in the long road toward passage \nof this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, our Nation needs this bill. We need this bill because \nit will make our roads and transit systems more efficient and safer.\n  This year it is estimated that 33 percent of America's major roads \nare in poor or mediocre condition; 27 percent of America's bridges are \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete; 37 percent of \nAmerica's major urban roads are congested; and 42,000 Americans will \ndie in traffic accidents.\n  We need this bill because a fully funded bill is good for the \neconomy.\n  The Department of Transportation says that for every $1 billion of \nFederal spending on highway construction nationwide, 47,500 jobs are \ngenerated annually; and that every dollar invested in the Nation's \nhighway system yields $5.40 in economic benefits because of reduced \ndelays, improved safety and reduced vehicle operating costs.\n  We need this bill to maintain our current highways and bridges than \never before, while demand for our roadways only increases.\n  The Federal Highway Administration says that 52 percent of highway \nfunds spent by States went to preserving highway systems while just 19 \npercent went to building new roads and bridges.\n  At the same time, traffic congestion costs American motorists $69.5 \nbillion a year in wasted time and fuel costs and we spend an additional \n3.5 billion hours a year stuck in traffic.\n  This bill isn't perfect. In fact, I think it needs additional \nfunding. The White House has suggested an overall funding level for \nsurface transportation of $284 billion over 6 years.\n  This despite the President's own Transportation Department saying we \nneed at least $300 billion to simply maintain the status quo, and \nsomething well above that level to make progress on conditions and \nperformance.\n  Thankfully, calls for increased funding have come from Republicans, \nDemocrats and Independents; Members of the House and Senate, Governors \nand Mayors. But we will address the funding issue in due time.\n  Today we must get cloture on this bill and move forward.\n  Once again, I would like to thank the Senate leadership on both sides \nfor their support of this bill.\n  I would also like to pay tribute to Chairman Inhofe and Senators Bond \nand Baucus for their support and cooperation in helping get us to where \nwe are today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncomments. At this time, I would like to recognize that we have four of \nthe real star freshmen, the new Members of this body, on our committee. \nOne, of course, is the presiding officer from Louisiana who made very \nclear to us the problem of beach erosion in the State of Louisiana. I \nappreciate his calling that to our attention. Then, of course, we have \nthe new Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune. Senator Thune is also on \nthe committee, and we yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also rise today to speak in support of \nmoving forward with debate on reauthorization of the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century. As many of my colleagues know, \nenactment of a long-term, robust Transportation bill is long overdue. I \ncredit the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, and the ranking member, \nSenator Jeffords, for their good work in bringing this to the floor.\n  It is important work that we are about to undertake. We are in the \nsixth extension of the current bill. We have another construction \nseason that is going to be lost in the Northern States if we do not get \na long-term bill put into place.\n  I appreciate very much the chairman's work in taking a very fair and \nevenhanded approach in how he has tried to distribute a certain amount \nof finite funding for this bill. As he mentioned in his remarks, this \nis a balance that must be struck between the large States and the small \nStates. Frankly, passage of this legislation is critical not only to my \nhome State, but to the Nation as a whole.\n  Since my service in the House of Representatives, I have long been a \nsupporter of a strong federal role when it comes to transportation \ninfrastructure funding. In fact, I believe the transportation \ninfrastructure is one of the primary responsibilities of the federal \ngovernment. After all, an adequate transportation infrastructure that \nis safe and affordable helps facilitate the movement of the goods and \nservices on which our economy relies. Additionally, investing in our \ntransportation infrastructure is a proven way to ease congestion and \nimprove the safety of our highway system.\n  If we look at the economic impact of what we are talking about today, \nit is profound. For every $1 billion invested in federal highway and \ntransit spending, 47,500 jobs and job opportunities are created or \nsustained. For every $1 billion in highway and transit expenditures, \ngross domestic product, GDP, will increase by $1.75 billion, a \nmultiplier effect of 1.75.\n  So this is important to our economy in terms of the jobs it will \ncreate, the growth it will bring about in our Nation's economy, and it \nis critical that this legislation, which has been held up since the \nlast Congress, move forward. It is one of the most important measures \nthe House and Senate must resolve this year. And it is incredibly time \nsensitive as we look at the sixth extension we are operating with today \nand the need to get a permanent bill in place so this construction \nseason will not be lost on many of those transportation departments in \nthe Northern States.\n  I have heard regularly from officials from the South Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation who are concerned about the tremendous \nuncertainty they face as a result of not having a long-term bill. The \nbusiness community, local officials, tribal leaders, and constituents \nacross South Dakota continue to ask me why critical transportation \nprojects are delayed from getting off the ground. I recognize that a \nhandful of my colleagues from donor States are concerned that the bill, \nas reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, does not go \nfar enough to boost their overall rate of return. But the bill the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee reported out last month, S. 732, \ndoes more to address the donor issue than the administration's \nreauthorization proposal or the bill as passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last month.\n  The clearest way to address the underlying concern that donor States \nhave raised is to add more funding to this bill. In fact, I plan to \nsupport the amendment I understand Finance Committee Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Member Baucus intend to offer because boosting this bill's \noverall funding level is the straightforward way to increase the \nminimum guarantee donor States seek without unfairly reducing the \nfunding for donee States, such as South Dakota.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the chairmen \nand the ranking members from the various Senate committees responsible \nfor this legislation.\n  As I said earlier, time is of the essence. It is important we work \ntogether to pass this bill so that conference negotiations between the \nHouse and the Senate can get underway, especially in light of the \nextension that is slated to expire on May 31.\n  I again commend the leadership of our committee, and the leadership \non both sides in the Senate for their desire to bring this bill to the \nfloor to ensure we are taking the steps necessary, when this current \nextension expires at the end of May, to have a new permanent bill in \nplace that will address the critical infrastructure needs of our Nation \nas we move into the future. Many of the highways, interstates, and \nroads across this country are in poor or mediocre condition. Mr. \nPresident, 27 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. It is important we get to work on this \nlegislation in the Senate so we can get to conference with the House, \nresolve any differences that exist, and get a permanent funding \nsolution put in place for the States, the cities, the business \ncommunity, and all the jobs and economic development that go with it.\n  Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to support this motion to \nproceed to the legislation. I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their good work. I see Senator Bond, from Missouri, who has also \nbeen instrumental in crafting this legislation. I appreciate the \nleadership and work this committee has put in to get the bill to the \nfloor. It is time we get it voted on and signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if there is time during the course of this \ndebate, even though we are operating under 1 hour equally divided, I \nwant to go over, so everybody understands, why it is necessary to pass \nthis bill instead of going with another extension because we do not get \nall the reforms we need without passing this bill.\n  I have to agree with the Senator from South Dakota that in order to \nget up to a higher figure in terms of the donor States--and there are a \nlot of donee States that are supporting us in this effort--it is \nnecessary to have a more robust bill. I am sure we will have an \nopportunity to debate that and get to conference and see what we can \nwork out.\n  The chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation has been such a \nstrong, hard worker. The Senator from Missouri has been there every \nstep of the way and has been a part of this great bipartisan effort. So \nwe yield to him at this time for whatever time he wishes to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my sincere thanks to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inhofe; to the ranking member, Senator Jeffords; and \nmy colleague, the ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Baucus. \nThis is a job well done under the constraints we face. We have worked \nlong and hard to get to this point, and I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of proceeding.\n  The bill, S. 732, the Safe Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act, is long overdue, 2 years past due. Our roads \nare deteriorating and safety is deteriorating unless and until we can \nget this bill up. My thanks to the leader for allowing us to call up \nthe bill. It has a lot of moving parts. Every time you move one part, \nyou make somebody slightly happy and several more very unhappy. But I \nbelieve it is a good step forward in attempting to meet our goal of \ncompletion prior to expiration of the current extension of the \nauthorization on May 31. If we do not proceed to move to this debate, \nSenators should be aware we may not be able to pass a seventh \nextension, and our States may cease to let additional contracts, and \nthousands of jobs may be at stake.\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\n  We called up S. 1072 a little over a year ago, and final passage of \nthat bill last year was 76 to 21. Today's bill, S. 732, is nearly \nidentical to last year's bill, with one major problem: To comply with \nthe President's budget request of $284 billion, we have taken a \nproportional cut across the board of approximately 10.7 percent.\n  During conference last year, we were presented with $299 billion in \ncontract authority and $284 billion in guaranteed spending. Today, our \nobligation limit and contract authority numbers are both the same, at \n$284 billion. I do not think that will work.\n  Last year, $284 billion was not sufficient to meet the transportation \nand safety needs in my State and, I think, many other States. I thought \nthen, and continue to believe, more money is necessary. I understand \nthe Finance Committee will be offering an amendment which we on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee will be supporting. During the \nbudget resolution debate, my colleague from Missouri, Senator Talent, \nalong with the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, offered an \namendment that any revenue that does not add to the deficit should be \nspent. It passed with more than 80 Senators supporting it. I think the \nSenate will have a similar position when we provide for additional \nrevenues with defendable efforts.\n\n  The bill we are bringing to the floor has several major goals.\n  First, equity. While previous authorizations have talked about \nequity, our bill carefully balances the needs of the donor States, \nwhile also recognizing the needs of the donee States. There are many \nsections of the bill I am proud of supporting, such as the fact that \nall donor States will receive, at the minimum, a 92-percent rate of \nreturn by the end of the authorization.\n  My State of Missouri is a donor State which essentially means that \nfor every dollar we spend on transportation, we receive less than a \ndollar in return. In 2004, it was 92 cents.\n  There are many States that fall under the $1 rate of return--\nunfortunately, only about 20 of them, which means there were 30 votes \nfor the donee States that got back more than a dollar, and that is \nwhere our problem was.\n  Last year, with the more robust funding, we were able to get all \nStates up to 95 cents, but we were unable to achieve this rate of \nreturn as a result of going from $318 billion down to $284 billion.\n  Donor States that support additional revenue above $284 billion can \nexpect an increase in their rate of return to bring the bill more in \nline with last year's bill, but I do not think anybody is talking about \n$318 billion anymore.\n  I worked diligently with Chairman Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Baucus to ensure the bill remains as fair and equitable as \npossible among all States. I am aware some of the donor States, which \nwe commonly refer to as superdonors--it is nice when you get to select \nthe epithet by which you are called. I wish I had thought of being \ncalled a superdonor or a deserving donor. Senator Inhofe and I come \nfrom deserving donor States. We will add Senator Thune into the \ndeserving donor States. But superdonors are concerned they hit the \ngrowth caps and do not achieve a 92-cent return right away. But the \naverage rate of growth from the highway trust fund for all States is \nabout 24.38 percent. The average rate of growth of Texas and Arizona is \n31.79 percent. Senators from States that are growing below average are \nthe ones who, it seems to me, should be complaining. We were unable to \nbring up donor States as early as we might have wished due to budget \nconstraints, as well as balancing the needs of the donor States with \nthe needs of the donee States.\n  For this reason, as most donor States grow, the donee States see a \ngradual decline to bring greater equity between the States. \nNevertheless, all States will grow at not less than 10 percent over the \nprevious bill, TEA-21. We are hopeful that with additional revenue, we \nwill be able to raise that floor.\n  Safety is another key feature. We will go a long way toward saving \nlives by providing funds to States to address safety needs at hazardous \nlocations, sections, and elements.\n  Safety in this authorization is, for the first time, being elevated \nto a core program. Our bill mirrors the administration's proposal, \ncontinuing our commitment to our motoring public's safety. This is \naccomplished by providing much needed funding to reduce highway \ninjuries and fatalities, all without the use of mandates.\n  In my State of Missouri, we know inadequate roads not only lead to \ncongestion, pollution, lack of economic growth, and they delay, deny, \nand derail economic opportunity, but they also kill people. We have \naveraged more than three deaths a day on Missouri highways and probably \nclose to 40 percent, if not more, can be attributable to inadequate \nroads.\n  I have driven all the Federal highways and all the State highways and \na lot of the county roads in Missouri, and I can tell you we have \nFederal highways which are two-lane highways which have traffic that \neverybody agrees should be on four lanes. What happens? We have rear-\nend collisions, passing on blind curves and hills, and we have \nfatalities.\n  My home State of Missouri, as many other donor States, has some of \nthe worst roads in the Nation. We are among, unfortunately, that \ndistinguished group that has the highest fatalities per million miles \ndriven on the roads.\n  That is a distinction we do not like. Recent reports say we have the \nfifth worst roads in the Nation, with 65 percent of our major roads in \nfair to poor condition requiring immediate attention. We also rank \nfourth from the bottom in deficient bridges in the Nation.\n  Our committee has heard voluminous testimony from the administration \nthat nearly 43,000 people were killed on our roads and highways last \nyear alone. I am glad this bill reflects a continued commitment making \nnot only investments in infrastructure but for the general safety and \nwelfare of our constituents.\n  The bill addresses several environmental issues, such as easing the \ntransition under new air quality standards. The conformity process is \nbetter aligned with air quality planning, as well as streamlining the \nproject delivery process by providing the necessary tools to reduce or \neliminate unnecessary delays during environmental reviews.\n  Another accomplishment of our package will ensure transportation \nprojects are built more quickly because environmental stakeholders will \nbe brought to the table sooner. Environmental issues will be raised \nearlier and the public will have better opportunities to shape \nprojects.\n  Projects more sensitive to environmental concerns will move through a \nmore structured environmental review process, more efficiently, with \nfewer delays. The bill also ensures that transportation projects will \nnot make air worse in areas with poor air quality while giving local \ntransportation planners more tools and elbow room to meet their Federal \nair quality responsibilities.\n  The bill will put transportation planning on a regular 4-year cycle, \nrequire air quality checks with projects large enough to be regionally \nsignificant, and reduce current barriers that local officials face in \nadopting projects that improve air quality.\n  The final goal is jobs. The Department of Transportation estimates \nthat every $1 billion in new Federal investment creates 47,500 jobs. To \nthe Associated General Contractors, the same $1 billion investment \nyields half of that in new orders from manufacturing and half of that \nspread through other sectors of the economy. Construction pay averages \n$19 per hour, 23 percent higher than the private sector average.\n  This comprehensive package is a good step forward to creating jobs, \nbut as a Governor of the State where we placed a high emphasis on \neconomic development, it is not only the jobs that are created in \nconstruction, it is the jobs that are created by the existence of \nadequate, safe transportation that assures continued growth.\n  We have spent a lot of time in this body talking about how we get our \neconomy to grow, how we create jobs. Passing this bill to create jobs \nnow and facilitate the creation of jobs in the future is the best thing \nwe can do. I am hopeful our colleagues in the Senate will agree to move \nthis bill quickly in order to pass this legislation prior to the \ncurrent May 31 expiration date.\n  I thank the Chair and I reserve the remainder of the time for the \nleader on this side.\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first I thank the senior Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, for his hard work and for being so articulate. It \nis interesting that we have heard from Senator Thune from South Dakota, \na donee State, and Senator Bond from a donor State, and they are both \nequally enthusiastic about the fact that we have something that should \nwork, and yet we know that any change in any part of a formula is going \nto have an effect on all the rest of the States. It does not happen in \na vacuum.\n  I will yield the floor to Senator Bond to respond to a question. I \nask the Senator, would he enlighten this body as to, according to HAWA, \nwhich two States in America have the worst bridges in terms of their \nstate of disrepair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri will be permitted to answer the question.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there have been some new factors that have \ncome out. In the interest of full disclosure, Missouri has moved up to \nfifth worst in roads and fourth worst in bridges. As I understand, \nOklahoma still occupies a place of dishonor with even worse roads and \nbridges.\n  I was hoping those new studies would not come out that we are still \nright at the bottom. As two States that are in the heart of the Nation \nwith major interstates crossing our States and traffic going east, \nwest, southwest, and northeast through our States we are essential \narteries for transportation for the Nation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield for another question, he is a \nformer Governor of the State of Missouri. He knows a little bit about \nhow the construction season goes. What kind of problems would he see--\nas Senator Thune mentioned, we are in our sixth extension right now--if \nwe were merely to extend this rather than to pass this bill, from a \nState perspective?\n\n  Mr. BOND. Well, the States are absolutely frustrated beyond all means \nthat we have not been able to reauthorize the bill. Merely extending \nthe bill does not enable us to go forward with major planning. The \nextensions keep existing projects in line and allow the Department of \nTransportation to continue to operate, but if we have another extension \nit means the money that this bill would make available will now not be \nmade available until the construction season. For most of the United \nStates, the construction season is spring, summer, and fall. Not a lot \nof work can be done in the winter.\n  So with the necessary contract times, 90 days to let contracts, if we \ndo not make the May 31 deadline with new authorization, we are going to \nlose a tremendous amount of road construction necessary for economic \ndevelopment and safety.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, one of the comments was made by I believe \nit was Senator Thune about the extensions. Let me make sure we all \nunderstand because this is very significant. We have been operating on \nextensions, and when we operate on extensions we cannot plan in \nadvance. This bill has more provisions in it affecting safety, \nstreamlining, and other factors than any bill of the four that I have \nbeen exposed to in reauthorization.\n  In the event we were to have to go ahead on another extension, there \nwould be no chance of improvement on the donor State of return. In \nother words, donor State of return is going to stay at 90.5. It is not \ngoing to improve. If we were going on an extension as opposed to \npassing this new authorization bill, there would be no new safety core \nprogram to help the States respond to the thousands of deaths each year \non our roadways.\n  I would say to the Senator from Vermont, this is a life-or-death type \nof a bill before us because more people are going to die if we do not \npass the bill, if we just operate on extensions.\n  If we just do the extensions, there will be no real streamlining of \nenvironmental reviews, so critical projects will still be subject to \navoidable delay. We see events that do not make any common sense in \nterms of how many miles can be paved per dollar. We have obstacles that \nare in the way. We have addressed those obstacles, and it has not been \neasy.\n  The Democrats and Republicans on this committee had to give and take. \nFrankly, there are some provisions in this bill I do not like too well, \nand I suggest to the Senator from Vermont there are a few he does not \nlike, but one of the major things I think has to be done before we \nstart any meaningful construction in America is to have these \nstreamlining provisions. If we do not have a bill, if we go on with \nextensions, there will be no increased ability to use the innovative \nfinancing, thereby giving States more tools to advance. We are talking \nabout public and private partnerships. We have been building roads the \nsame way now for many years.\n  I have been notified that the time on our side has expired, and I ask \nunanimous consent that we be given an opportunity to share the minority \ntime to whatever extent the Senator would like to give us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the chairman such time as he desires from \nthe time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to the Senator from Vermont, with that very \ngenerous offer, as soon as he has someone coming and they want time, I \nwill cease on this side so they can be heard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is fair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The bill offers an increased ability to use innovative \nfinancing methods. Out in California and in Texas, they have been able \nto do some things where they have convinced us they get many more miles \nand much more local participation by the public-private partnership, by \nthe TIFIA rule, and it is something that we would not be able to do \nnationwide if we do not get this bill and we just operate on an \nextension.\n  There are a lot of people who are very concerned about a provision in \nour bill that is called the Safe Routes to School. I know the Senator \nfrom Vermont has been interested in that. This is something where we \nwould be talking about saving young lives. Right now, the provision is \nnot there. So if we have an extension, it is merely an extension of \nTEA-21, the one that we have been operating under for the last 7 years.\n  If we are not able to pass this bill, then the States will continue \nto have uncertainty in planning, thereby delaying projects and \nnegatively impacting jobs.\n\n  The Senator from Missouri commented that for each $1 billion spent, \nit provides 47,000 new jobs. So this would easily be the biggest jobs \nbill probably in the history of America. But if we operate on an \nextension, there can be no planning. There is not going to be the \nconstruction.\n  The Senator from Missouri is from a northern State and so is the \nSenator from Vermont. In Oklahoma, though, our construction time is \nlonger than it is in Vermont, and it is actually longer than it is in \nthe State of Missouri. It is something that has to be considered \nbecause if we have those delays and they cannot plan in advance, we are \nnot going to have the construction. We are not going to be able to \ncorrect these problems.\n  That is why I asked the question of the Senator from Missouri, who is \na former Governor of the State. We need to have certainty in planning. \nI hear every day from Gary Ridley in our Department of Transportation \nin Oklahoma that we have things we need to do and we need to be \nplanning right now. We can get so much more for each dollar if we do \nthat, and I suggest that other States have the same situation.\n  If we do not have a new bill and we just operate on an extension, \nthere is no new border program for border States to deal with NAFTA and \nother traffic. We hear a lot from the border States--California, \nArizona, Texas, and Florida--that they like the borders and corridors \nprogram. We have a borders and corridors provision in this bill that \nwill give consideration to the fact that through no fault of their own \nmany border States have a lot of traffic that comes up through Mexico \nand other places that is all in conjunction with NAFTA.\n  I can recall 10 years ago when NAFTA was voted on I happened to have \nbeen the only member of the\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nOklahoma delegation that voted against NAFTA. I think I was right and \nthey were wrong, but nonetheless when we look at what we are able to do \nwith the borders and corridors program, it is something that is very \ncritical for those States.\n  My State of Oklahoma is also affected by that because those corridors \ncome through the State of Oklahoma. If we do not have the bill, we just \nhave an extension, there is going to be a delay in the establishment of \nthe national commission to explore how to fund transportation in the \nfuture. As motor vehicles become more fuel efficient, a tax collection \nsystem based solely on gas consumption becomes less practical. Right \nnow the greatest problem we have is the cost of fuel. We have been very \nmuch concerned about that. If our taxes were based on a percentage as \nopposed to a number of cents or dollars, then we would not have that \nproblem. But in Oklahoma if we are paying $2.20 a gallon for gas \ninstead of what it was a short while ago, about $1.40, then people are \nnot going to drive as far. When they do not drive as far, that means \nthe tax revenues are going to come down.\n  There is no reason we have to continue to do business as we have done \nbusiness for the last 50, 60, 70 years and not come up with new and \ninnovative ways to pay for our system.\n  In this bill we have a provision for a national commission to look at \ndifferent transportation funding in the future. One of my complaints \nwhen we talk about the highway trust fund is about how we should or \nshould not pay for it. Every time this body has a new idea to encourage \npeople to use fuel-efficient automobiles, either hybrid or electric \ncars, that ends up with less gallons of gas produced. Yet those cars \nstill damage the highways with the wear and tear that another car does. \nI have complained if we are going to have a policy, it should not be \npaid for on the backs of the highway trust fund.\n  Anyway, those are issues they can look at. They can look at new ways \nof financing roads and new partnerships. This commission will come \ntogether and will perform for us.\n  If we do not have a new bill and we have an extension, there will be \nno increased opportunity to address chokepoints and intermodal \nconnectors. This is not simply a highway bill but an intermodal bill, \ntalking about how the highways, railroads, and airlines come together. \nIt is a complicated transportation system.\n  There was a time in the beginning during the Eisenhower \nadministration when we wanted to have a national highway system. I will \nshare with my friend from Vermont, when President Eisenhower, during \nthe war, was a major, Major Eisenhower, he was the one who realized our \ntraffic system, our road system, our network, was not a transportation \nissue as much as a national security issue. He was trying to move his \ntroops around from one place to another. So when he became President, \none of the first things he wanted to do was set up the national \ntransportation system. We have had it since that time. At that time we \nwere looking at miles of paved roads in America. Now we are looking at \nthe intermodal system that covers all transportation and brings all \ntransportation together. But we won't be able to do that if we extend \nwhat we have today because those portions of the bill will not become \nlaw.\n  There are many other provisions we would lose if we do not pass a \nbill, if we only have an extension. The firewall protection of the \nhighway trust fund would not be continued, thereby making the trust \nfund vulnerable to raids in order to pay for other programs.\n  One of the things we run into in Government I can relate to in the \nState of Oklahoma. In the State of Oklahoma we have had people, when \nyou are looking the other way, come in and raid a trust fund. The \nimpact aid is a good example. Impact aid was started way back in the \n1950s. The idea was if Government comes along and takes the land off \nthe tax rolls, you still have to educate those kids living there, so \nthey are supposed to replenish that particular subdivision to the \namount of money they lost in revenue. That was a good program. We all \nsupported it.\n  In the 1960s, people realized there was a fund and no one was \nlooking, so they took the money out of it. This has happened to other \ntrust funds. This has happened to the highway trust fund. I see that as \na moral issue.\n  In fact, when we had our bill out last year, we looked at it as if \nthis is something we can afford to do because it was paid for almost \nentirely out of user taxes. Now, if you go to the pump and you pay a \nFederal tax on the gasoline you buy, you assume that will go to \nbuilding roads and maintaining roads and people do not complain about \nit. I have never complained about it. I complain about every other tax, \nbut I don't complain about the highway taxes because I know that is how \nwe will pay for it. They have been diverting money out of the trust \nfund and putting it into other projects.\n  What we did in last year's bill, and it is in this year's bill also, \nis restore that so money will have to go to repairing roads that go \ninto the highway system. If we do not pass this bill, it is not going \nto happen.\n  To reiterate, regarding the pending bill, 76 Senators voted for it \nlast year. Very few changes have been made. We produced a solid project \nlast year to go to conference with the House. I suggest that given a \nfew changes we would have made, we would have been able to move it out \nand we would not be here today. This should have happened a year ago. \nThis should not be happening now.\n  The bill managers are ready and willing to discuss Members' \namendments. We want to work with you on your concerns. We hope you will \ncome down and offer amendments. We will have this vote in 9 minutes. \nHow quickly time flies when you are having fun. When we have this vote, \nI anticipate it will be a successful vote and we will be able to get on \nthe bill and start with amendments. When that happens, I certainly hope \nall those individuals who have said negative things about this bill--\nthey didn't like part of the formula, they didn't think they were \ntreated fairly, they thought they were bumping up to the caps for \nStates--come down and offer amendments.\n  I don't think any of us in terms of Senator Jeffords, myself, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Bond, are going to complain. We may not like the \namendments, but we want to have the amendments offered, if for no other \nreason than it is important so people realize you cannot make one \nchange in a bill without affecting everyone else. I know formulas are \ndifferent.\n\n  It would be easier if we had done the easy thing. That is, Senator \nJeffords and I could go to 60 Members of this 100-Member body and make \nthem sweetheart deals, give them what they wanted to get their vote, \nbuy their votes, get 60 votes, and tell the rest of them, it is your \nproblem. And we would have a bill today. That is not how we want to do \nbusiness. We feel we can do it being fair to our colleagues and do it \non the basis of a formula.\n  We had Members who were going to be heard on the motion to proceed \nand they have not arrived. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support \ninvoking cloture on this important legislation.\n  I had a meeting yesterday morning with highway contractors in my \nState. They once again impressed upon me the urgency of passing new \nhighway legislation.\n  In my part of the country--I represent North Dakota--our construction \nseason is a short one. We urgently need action. There are contracts \nthat are being held up, actions that need to be taken to improve the \nroad network in my State that are being held because there is no new \nhighway legislation passed.\n  We keep passing extenders. But that does not make adjustments for the \nincreased needs across the country. We know much of our bridge system \nis deficient and in serious need of repair. We know many of the roads \nin our country need repair. New highways need to be constructed. Much \nof that activity will not occur unless new highway legislation passes \nthe Congress.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the extraordinary \nefforts they have made to advance this legislation. We are being held \nup here because some are unhappy, some are not getting all they would \nlike to get. That is pretty much the norm around here. None of us get \nquite what we would like. I would like much more for my State. But I \nknow the reality we confront. I know the urgency of the need to act.\n  I ask my colleagues, please, let's invoke cloture. Let's proceed. We \nwill still have opportunities to amend this bill. Members can come \nbefore the Senate and offer amendments to change this legislation. They \ncan either prevail or lose, but they will have had their chance. I hope \nmy colleagues will support the move to invoke cloture on this \nlegislation so we can proceed, so the American people can know the \nimportant business of highway construction, highway repair, bridge \nconstruction, and bridge repair can move forward.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his good words. \nI hope the Senators viewing this will join so we can expedite passage \nof this bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again I thank the ranking member, Senator \nJeffords, who has put so much time and effort into this legislation so \nthat all at the table are fairly represented. I thank the chairman, as \nwell. The chairman has strived valiantly over an extended period of \ntime. I remember last year as we moved, we hoped, toward conclusion, \nour House colleagues had a different point of view than the Senate. I \nthank the chairman and ranking member for their exceptional efforts.\n  Now we have a chance to do it, to move forward. We need this cloture \nvote to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. It is not as great \na problem in Oklahoma as the problem in North Dakota because your \nconstruction season is shorter than ours. Right now one of our major \nconcerns is that we can get in there and get the contracts in a timely \nfashion so we can get under construction and do the work we are \nsupposed to be doing.\n  Also, before the Senator from North Dakota came in, we commented this \nis somewhat of a life-and-death situation. Last year, nearly 43,000 \npeople died on our Nation's highways. This represents the single \ngreatest cause of accidental death in Americans ages 2 to 33.\n  The core safety programs will be corrected. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, time in congestion increased from 31.7 \npercent in 1992 to 33 percent in 2000. We had several discussions \nyesterday about the cost of fuel and the fact that if you have all this \ncongestion--certainly we know what this is in Washington, DC--the cars \nare out there idling, burning fuel, not getting anywhere. We need to \nget this country moving.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  We are at the time designated to have the vote. This could be one of \nthe maybe two or three most significant votes we have this year. It \nwill allow us to do all that we have been talking about for the last \nhour. It is rather refreshing during this time we did not have anyone \ncoming down and opposing this motion to proceed.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is exactly right. We want to encourage \npeople who have a problem to come down. Maybe we can make them better. \nWe want to consider amendments. We want to get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 69, H.R. 3, a bill to authorize funds \n     for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and \n     transit programs, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, John Warner, Lindsey Graham, Craig Thomas, \n           Mike DeWine, Richard Burr, Susan Collins, Johnny \n           Isakson, James Inhofe, Gordon Smith, Pete Domenici, \n           Thad Cochran, John Thune, Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, \n           David Vitter, Mitch McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \nhas been waived.

Mr. President, this week marks the 15th anniversary of \nthe launch of the Hubble space telescope. As we watched Hubble lift off \n15 years ago, we had great hopes for the Hubble and great hopes for \nscience. Guess what. We were not disappointed.\n  Hubble ushered in a new era of astronomy and science. Hubble has \nexceeded all expectations. It is the greatest tool for studying the \nuniverse since Galileo himself invented the telescope. Because of the \nHubble, we are now living in what astronomers call the ``golden age'' \nof astronomy and physics. How incredible, how spectacular. It has been \nAmerica's gift to the world. It has been one of the greatest acts of \npublic diplomacy in history. Hubble has become a symbol of America's \ngenerosity of spirit. Whatever the Hubble sees in the world, it \ndownloads for the rest of the world to have access. Hubble even has its \nown Web site. It gets e-mails from people all over the world. Some of \nthem from the children are the most touching. There are e-mails that \nsay: Dear Mr. Hubble, did you see God today? Have you met an angel? Is \nthere another universe? What does it look like? They actually talk to \nHubble, and it has inspired their curiosity and their desire to engage \nin science.\n  It is not surprising; just look at what it has accomplished.\n  The Hubble telescope has accounted for 35 percent of all of NASA's \ndiscoveries for the past 30 years. It has seen farther and sharper than \nany telescope in history. It has observed more than 14,000 objects in \nspace. It has been the No. 1 producer of science for NASA over the past \n10 years. Over 2,600 scientific papers have been written on the Hubble \nresults. It has dramatically improved our understanding of the \natmosphere of planets; the size of galaxies; the birth, life, and death \nof stars; the existence of black holes; the age of the universe and how \nthe universe expands.\n  I have a photograph in my office of a swirling galaxy. They call it \nthe ``eye of God'' because you literally see those spectacular \npictures, and you feel in this one picture that God himself is staring \ndown at us from the universe.\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\n  Hubble has rewritten the science textbooks almost every year. It has \nexceeded our wildest expectations. But it didn't start that way. \nFifteen years ago, I was chairing the subcommittee that finances NASA, \nand we were so excited when Hubble took off. But no sooner was it in \nspace when we saw that the Hubble did not work. Something was wrong \nwith its mirror. Hubble could not see. I immediately had a hearing and \nsaid, oh my gosh, Hubble has a cataract. It needs space surgery. It \nneeds a space contact lens. Well, I never saw myself as a space \nophthalmologist, but, quite frankly, working with my dear friend from \nthe other side of the aisle, Senator Jake Garn, we took a risk to \nfinance the fix for Hubble.\n  Well, this country and this world, this big planet, was not \ndisappointed. We took the risk because we believed in Hubble's \npotential. We believed in the engineers and the scientists at NASA to \nknow how to fix it. We believed in our astronauts, that they could go \nto the Hubble and fix it and return safely to Earth. Thanks to those \nastronauts and engineers, Hubble was saved. We did fix it with a \ncontact lens that has lasted now for many years. We have had to go back \nto space and give it new batteries. We have also had to give it new \ngyroscopes so it doesn't vibrate in space. We even improved its lens. \nEach year it gets better and better. From the brink of failure to \nextraordinary success, this has been the story of Hubble.\n  Now we are once again going to have to come to the rescue of Hubble. \nLast year, the NASA Administrator announced that he was terminating the \nfinal servicing mission to give Hubble new batteries and extend its \nlife. The Administrator rejected it, saying that the Hubble would shut \ndown in 4 years when its battery runs out. The reason he gave was \nastronaut safety. I was troubled by that because astronaut safety has \nbeen my No. 1 priority as an appropriator for the space program.\n  However, I was uncertain about that decision and, like any good \nscientist, I asked for a second opinion. First, I asked Admiral Gehman, \nwho had done the study of what went wrong with Columbia, for his \nopinion. He said go to the National Academy of Sciences. I did that, \nand we found a study that concluded that a servicing mission was no \nmore risky than going back to the space station.\n  Once again, Mr. President, our shuttle is going to start flying \nagain, and our hearts and prayers will go with Colonel Collins as she \ntakes astronauts back into space and, God willing and with the help of \nour engineers, returns to Earth safely.\n  The next mission needs to go up and fix the Hubble. I believe the \nAmerican people want it. We have the will. Now we have to find the \nwallet. President George Bush, with poor advice from the NASA \nAdministrator, canceled it out of the budget. I want the President to \nlook at those NASA pictures. I want him to know what NASA has meant to \nthe world and to America in space. I am going to work with him, on a \nbipartisan basis, to find the money to keep Hubble flying and seeing \nthe universe. Who knows, maybe we will meet an angel and make some \ninteresting new friends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4236-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nsimple fairness and equity in this highway bill. I commend the chairman \nand managers of the bill for working hard to get it to the floor. Now \nthat it is here, I have some serious concerns with the bill, as \nreported, that I would like to share with my colleagues.\n  This bill is not fair to the States called donor States that send \nmore of their Federal gas tax dollar and get less of it in return. \nThose are called donor States. We donor States--and Florida is one of \nthem--are, once again, being cheated out of our fair share of highway \ndollars. Florida and roughly 20 other donor States deserve true equity, \nnot simply what the donee States think we should be happy with. They \nsend in a dollar of gas tax but they get more than a dollar in return. \nOur States, called the donor States, send in a dollar of gas tax money, \nand we receive less than a dollar of gas tax money in return.\n  In the case of Florida over the years, it has been down in the \nseventies. Presently--although it is scored at 90 cents--return on the \ndollar, in reality, when all the formulas are plugged in, is more like \n87 cents. So in Florida we send a dollar of gas tax money to \nWashington, and we get only 87 cents of that dollar back. That is not \nfair.\n  The argument I am making is not a new argument. These are arguments \nthat the ones who send in a dollar and get back less of their gas tax \nmoney are pitted against the donee States. Approximately 30 of the \ndonee States get back more than a dollar of the gas tax money. So there \nare 20 States that get less and approximately 30 States that get more. \nI am tired of hearing we should be happy with what we get. I am not \nhappy with the formula on the redistribution of the gas tax money in \nthe highway bill.\n  Last year's bill that we passed in the Senate got us a lot further \ntoward equity than this year's bill. I was disappointed, even in that \nbill, because although we had a target to get us from 90 percent, which \nis really 87 percent, return on our gas tax dollar, all the way up to \n95 percent, we did not get that 95 cents back on the dollar until the \nvery last year of the 6-year authorization of the highway bill.\n  Florida is in the category with other States such as Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Texas. We were not going to get 90 cents on the dollar, \nboosted to 95 cents on the dollar, until the very last of 6 years in \nthe bill. Those States that I just mentioned, mine included, are named \nsuperdonor States. In reality, it means we are the last in line to get \nour fair share.\n  As I look back at last year's bill, I yearn for it because that is \nnot what this bill does. This bill gets the States only to 92 cents on \nthe dollar, and large States such as Florida, California, Texas, and \nArizona only get there, again, at the end of the 6-year authorization \non the highway bill.\n  So what am I forced to look at? I am looking at we were getting it up \nto 95 cents on the dollar last year, and under this bill we are only \ngetting it up to 92 cents on the dollar. Well, this is unacceptable. \nThere is clearly a push from both sides of the aisle to add more money \nto the bill. I support more money in the bill. What we passed in the \nSenate last year was $318 billion for highway construction authorized \nover a 6-year period. What is in this bill is $284 billion over a 6-\nyear period. If we want to add more money to the bill for highways, I \nam certainly for that, but I support more money if there is an increase \nin the rate of the return for States that are giving more money than \nwhat they are getting in return.\n  It simply does my State and these other States no good to grow a pot \nof money if we are not getting our fair share of the pot.\n  I have been told by the 30 donee States--remember, those are the \nStates that get more on their dollar of gas tax than they put in--I \nhave been told by those States to look at how much money, in actual \ndollars, Florida will receive and how much Florida will grow in an \noverall percentage from the last authorization bill.\n  I am happy to know Florida, under the chairman's proposal, gets more \ndollars in this bill than it did in the last authorization, but Florida \nshould be getting more money this time around because it is putting \nmore money in. The number that is important, and the\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\nnumber that only donor States want to focus on, is the rate of return \non our gas tax dollars. What percentage of Florida taxpayer dollars are \nactually being returned to Florida to build up our infrastructure, our \nhighways, our bridges, and our transit? I asked that question not only \nfor my State but for 20 other States that are not getting their fair \nshare.\n  Why is this particularly sensitive to me? Look at all the folks that \ncome to Florida and use our roads. The Orlando area is the No. 1 \ntourist destination in the world. We have a $50 billion-a-year tourism \nindustry that, in large part, is as a result of our pristine and clear \nwaters on the beaches. People go by car.\n  What other reasons? Florida is now one of the major growth States \nalso because we are a destination during the twilight years of \nretirement. That means not only is our population growing at a rapid \nrate--1,000 people a day net growth in Florida--but on top of that, we \nget 80 million tourists a year, and they are all using those Florida \nroads. We desperately need those roads expanded and improved. I can \ntake anyone to parts of Florida and show that if you think traffic jams \nare big in Washington, DC, they cannot hold a candle to some of the \ntraffic jams in Florida. States such as mine are the States with the \ngreatest need and we are the States that continue to get the least back \non our highway tax dollars. Our populations are increasing by leaps and \nbounds, yet our highway rate of return is staying relatively the same \nin order to pay for the other States to invest in their roads, and \nthose are States that are not growing like Florida, Texas, California, \nArizona, and 15 other states. Florida is the third fastest growing \nState behind Nevada and Arizona. We will grow by 80 percent in the next \n25 years, becoming the third largest State in the country behind \nCalifornia and Texas. Florida will bump New York into fourth place by \n2011.\n  We have to have help on our highways. We need, but we also deserve, \nour fair share. States such as mine have, for the last half a century, \ngiven more than our share of highway funds. The interstate system is \ncomplete now. It has been for some time. This formula has been \noperating for over 50 years. It is past time that donor States get \njustice and equity and fair shares. We deserve to get 95 cents return \non each one of our highway dollars.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in a moment we are going to make a motion \nto substitute H.R. 3 so we will be considering the Senate-passed bill \nas it was passed out of our committee on to the floor. I think it is \nappropriate to make a couple of comments--and, of course, invite \nSenator Jeffords to also comment if he wants to--on the time we have \ntaken on this bill.\n  We have worked on this bill for some 2\\1/2\\ years. It has been \nbipartisan all the way, all of last year and this year. I think it is \nsomething that is a product we can be very proud of. It has provisions \nin it that if we do not pass will not be considered. If we are on \nanother extension, we will not have the safety provisions. We will not \nhave the streamlining provisions that will help us build more roads per \ndollar.\n  We are prepared now to proceed. I understand there is no further \ndebate on the pending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the motion to proceed is agreed to.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4237-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4237-S4252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT: A LEGACY FOR USERS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to give a short speech, if the distinguished \nmanager of the bill would not mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I am not on the \ncommittee now, but I have been on the committee during a number of \nthese highway bills. This highway bill is one of the most important \npieces of legislation that the Senate considers. One reason it is such \na good exercise is that it forces bipartisanship. It is extremely \nimportant legislation. This is one issue on which Democrats and \nRepublicans work together. I certainly wish my friend well. It is an \nimportant bill, as he and I know. We worked so hard last year to get it \ndone, and for a lot of reasons it did not happen, but the Senator from \nOklahoma has my good wishes on this most important bill for not only \nNevada but the country.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  For the last several months, the Senate has operated under a cloud, a \nnuclear cloud. I would like to give just a brief history for those who \nare here today. Filibusters have been part of our history from the very \nbeginning of our Republic. In the early years of our country, there \nwere a number of filibusters, but there was no way to stop them. As a \nresult of that, because of the filibuster, a lot of things were not \naccomplished that Senators wanted to accomplish. In fact, a number of \nvery important Cabinet nominations did not happen because of the \nfilibuster, and a number of judicial appointments in the early years of \nthis Republic simply did not go anyplace because of the filibuster.\n  It was in 1917 that this body decided to change the rule so that \nthere could be a way of ending filibusters. They decided that two-\nthirds of the Senators voting could stop a filibuster. Then, during the \nheight of the civil rights movement in this country, the Senate decided \nto lower that threshold to 60, the way it has been since then.\n  We, of course, had filibusters of judges prior to 1917. We have had \nfilibusters of judges since then. In recent years, we have had the \nperson who was nominated to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Abe \nFortas, who was a member of the Court, filibustered. He was not able to \ngo forward. There are a number of other people who were nominated to be \njudges, specifically circuit court judges, and there were filibusters \nconducted by my friends, the Republicans. There were efforts made to \nstop those with cloture motions. The two that come to my mind are two \njudges from California.\n  I worked very hard on one of them--a man by the name of Richard Paez. \nThe other was a woman by the name of Marsha Berzon. A cloture motion \nwas filed, and cloture was granted as a result of 60 Senators voting \nfor cloture.\n  My friend, the distinguished Republican leader, knows filibusters \nhave been conducted because he voted against cloture. While he was a \nMember of the Senate, he voted against cloture on a circuit court \njudge. So for\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\npeople to say there has never been a filibuster of a judge is simply \nwrong. Twenty-five percent of all Supreme Court Justices have been \nrejected--not always by filibuster, but for various reasons. More than \nhalf the filibusters have been conducted by Republican Senators. I do \nnot think that was unconstitutional.\n  During the tenure of this President, we have had 215 requests to have \nhis nominations approved. We have approved 205 of them. We have turned \ndown 10. That is a 95- to 97-percent confirmation rate, 10 rejected \njudges, 7 of whom are currently before the Senate. This does not seem \nreason enough for me, and I think for most people, to think that \nlongstanding rules in the Senate should be changed.\n  Remember, everyone has to understand that to change the rules as \nanticipated with the so-called nuclear option, the majority would have \nto break the rules. The only way a rule change can be stopped when \npeople want to talk--and that is, in effect, what is being done--is to \nchange the rule. If somebody wants to talk, there must be the votes to \nstop that. That is not what the majority is talking about doing. They \nare talking about doing something illegal. They are talking about \nbreaking the rules to change the rules, and that is not appropriate.\n  That is not fair, and it is not right.\n  The claim that there have been no filibusters, as I indicated, \nignores history, including recent history. Throughout the years, many \njudicial nominees have been denied up-or-down votes. As we know, during \nthe Clinton administration, 69 judges never even got a hearing before \nthe Judiciary Committee. They were dumped into this big dark hole and \nnever saw the light of day. Some of them waited for a very long time, \nincluding Richard Paez, who waited for over 4 years. Some of the \nloudest proponents of the so-called nuclear option opposed cloture on \nthe nominations of President Clinton's nominees.\n  America is paying attention to this hypocrisy. Citizens are alarmed \nabout what the Republican majority is planning to do. According to a \npoll that was released yesterday, Americans oppose this--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents--by a 2-to-1 margin. They oppose changing the \nrules to make it easier for the President to stack the courts with \nradical judges. The American people, in effect, reject the nuclear \noption because they see it for what it is--an abuse of power, arrogance \nof power. Lord Acton said power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely.\n\n  The American people need to understand what is going on here in our \nCongress. Across the way in the House of Representatives, the majority \nleader was censored three times within 1 year. He will not be censored \nagain because they changed the rules in the middle of the game. That is \nwhat is going on. The rules are being changed in the middle of the \ngame. They are breaking the rules to change the rules.\n  Regardless of one's political affiliation, Americans understand this \nis a partisan political grab. Nearly half the Republicans polled \nopposed any rules changes, joining 8 in 10 Democrats and 7 \nIndependents.\n  Over the last several months, I have talked about a solution. We need \nto step forward and try to work something out. Before I came here, I \ntried cases before juries. I had more than 100 jury trials. Every time \nI had a jury trial was a failure. It was a failure because it indicated \nthe participants could not work things out on their own. That is how I \nfeel about this. We should be able to work this out. We should be able \nto work it out. My door has always been open to responsible Republicans \nwho do not want the Senate to head down this unproductive path.\n  I wrote to the majority leader on March 15 and expressed a \nwillingness to find a way out of this predicament we find ourselves in, \nto find a solution. My friend, the distinguished majority leader, \nreplied 2 days later he would propose a compromise for resolving this \nissue. We are still waiting on that proposal.\n  Now, it appears maybe--and I hope this is untrue--that Republican \nleaders in the Senate do not want a compromise. Senator Frist and I do \nnot do our negotiations in public, but he and I had a nice conversation \nabout a number of issues about 12:15 today. One of the issues we talked \nabout was my proposal to try to resolve this. I thought it was a very \nconstructive meeting. I walked into a conference at quarter to 1, and I \nwas told he issued a statement that there would be no compromise. I \ndon't believe that. The wires are crossed here somewhere. I hope that, \nin fact, is the case.\n  This is something that needs to be resolved. One of my concerns \ninvolves Karl Rove. I know Karl Rove was up here today. Karl Rove is \nworld famous. He is from Nevada. I like Karl Rove. He has not been \nelected either to the executive branch of Government or to the \nlegislative branch of Government. I believe in the separation of \npowers. I believe this legislative branch of Government is as strong as \nand as important as the executive branch and the judicial branch of \nGovernment. We should conduct our business, especially when it deals \nwith procedures and rules of the Senate, without interference from the \nWhite House. In fact, I thought this is where we were headed.\n  I spoke to the President at the White House. My distinguished friend, \nthe assistant majority leader, was there. I asked the President if he \nwould step into this issue dealing with the nuclear option and help us \nresolve this, because we have lots of important legislative issues to \naccomplish.\n  The President, without any hesitation, said to me, in effect, that \nthis is a legislative matter. He said he was not going to get involved \nin it at all.\n  I was dumbfounded to find that the Vice President, a few days later, \nwas giving a speech--and I know under his constitutional role he has \ncertain obligations, one of which is if we are in a tie, he breaks the \ntie; I have no qualms about his having the ability to do that--he gave \na long speech on the history of the filibuster and how we were stopping \nthis constitutional option. Frank Luntz gave nuclear option a new name. \nAnd bang, today we get Karl Rove telling everybody that there will be \nno compromise, saying that we want all of our judges, plus Bolton.\n  These are not positions that allow for compromise. I want to work \nthis out. These are not positions that allow the Senate to proceed with \nthe work of the American people. These are positions that force a \nconfrontation. I don't think we need that. These are positions that \ndivert attention from the real problems facing America today--gas \nprices, nearly $2.75 a gallon in Nevada. That is higher than in \nCalifornia. We have poor schools, problems with schools all over \nAmerica. Minnesota is no different from Nevada. They have problems in \ntheir schools. They have inadequate health care coverage.\n  Again, 95 percent of the President's nominees have been confirmed. \nThe majority leader has said he is willing to break the rules, to \nchange the rules. He will be gone in 15 months and we will still be \naround. It would not be the right thing to do.\n  Ultimately, this is about removing the last check in Washington \nagainst complete abuse of power, the right to extended debate.\n  Ronald Reagan sent people to the Supreme Court. Richard Nixon sent \npeople to the Supreme Court. There are still two men there who were \nnominated by Nixon. We have people whom George Bush No. 1 sent here. \nSeven of the nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court are Republican \nappointees. Yet there have been attacks on these people, vile things \nsaid about David Souter, vile things said about Justice Kennedy, and \nothers.\n  The radical right, not representing the mainstream Republicans in \nthis country, wants a different kind of Supreme Court, a different kind \nof judge--maybe that is the case--one who would roll back equality, \nliberty, and the rights of all Americans. I don't think that is why \nPresident Reagan put his appointees on the Supreme Court. I don't think \nthat is why President Bush No. 1 put his appointees on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I think those who were elected to this body, the people who sent us \nhere--not Karl Rove, not James Dobson, and not radical elements of our \nsociety--should work out a solution.\n\n  There is a way to avoid this nuclear shutdown. I have outlined a \nproposal for my collective colleagues in some detail in an effort to \nprotect an independent judiciary and to preserve the Founding Fathers' \nvision of the Senate. I am not going to go into the details of my \nconversations with my\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\nfriend Senator Frist and other Members of the majority. I spoke in \nprivate. But I want to talk about why compromise is necessary.\n  We stand united against the constitutional or nuclear option, all 45 \nof us. We have a responsibility to protect checks and balances, not \nviolate them; to protect the separation of power. My offer protects \nthose checks and balances. My offer renews procedures to allow home \nState Senators to have a say in who sits on the Federal courts in their \nStates. The procedures encourage consultation and will lead to the \nnomination of consensus judges, judges who will be confirmed \nunanimously in most cases.\n  As I indicated on more than one occasion this afternoon, we have \napproved 205 judges and turned down 10. The 10 were denied confirmation \nfor a lot of reasons. I will not detail that here. We need to ensure \nthe Senate remains as a check on the President's power, especially with \nrespect to the Supreme Court. We were willing to compromise on this, \nwhich is hard to do. I believe my proposal strikes the right balance. I \nhope so because I tried. It protects our democracy and the independence \nof our Federal courts. The separation of powers doctrine means so much \nto our country. It protects the American people, lets us do our \nbusiness, and can break partisan stalemates that are unnecessarily \ndivisive. I emphasize that any potential compromise is of course \ncontingent on a commitment that the nuclear option will not be \nexercised in this Congress or any Congress. It is very important to \nunderstand this is not all done in a vacuum.\n  What I have spoken to my Republican counterparts about is an effort \nto work our way through this. I always felt that a good settlement in \nall those cases I had, the best settlement was when both parties walked \nout saying, I am happy. We cannot make both parties happy. We will have \nto compromise. We will have to be statesmen and come up with something \nthe American people will accept.\n  I recognize the same poll I talked about here, how people feel about \nthe nuclear option--I  know, reading these polls, that the present \nnumbers are tumbling downward. I know that because of what has gone on, \nfor a lot of different reasons, numbers for the Senate Republicans are \nfalling. But the general view of the Congress is not that good.\n\n  I think it would be a good moment for the American people if Senator \nFrist and I could walk out before the American people and say that we \nhave been able to work out our differences. I think the American people \nwould like that. If we do not do that, it is going to be a difficult \nsituation, as I have indicated in great detail. This is not a Newt \nGingrich threat. We are not going to shut down the Government. But we \nare going to work on a number of issues that we feel are important to \nthe American people. In fact, our hours will probably be longer, rather \nthan shorter.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's courtesy, and I especially \nthank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  If I could say this: During the Clinton years, and during the first 4 \nyears of President Bush, we had a workhorse in the Judiciary Committee. \nHe was chairman; he was ranking member; he was chairman. It went back \nand forth. He has taken a lot of spears for a lot of different people, \nstanding up for what he believes is right for this country. So I want \nthe record to reflect how much I appreciate the support and the advice \nand counsel that I have received from Senator Pat Leahy during the \nyears I have been in the Senate, but particularly during the last 5 \nmonths.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kentucky, inasmuch as \nI have been mentioned, allow me 2 minutes to refer to what the \ndistinguished leader has been saying?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Senator from Vermont asking for \n2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. President, one, I compliment the Senator from Nevada. I \nappreciate the kind words he has said about me. I know how hard he has \nworked to work out this issue. I have been in numerous meetings with \nhim. He has met with both me and the chairman of the committee. We have \ndiscussed ways we could work this out. Frankly, I have been in some of \nthose same discussions with my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nAll of us agree this is a reasonable way to work it out.\n  We should not be talking about judges under the question of nuclear \noptions or religious tests or all the other red herrings that have been \nout here. It loses sight of what the Constitution is. It speaks of \nadvice and consent. Both the President of the United States and the \nSenate have a role.\n  This begins at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The President \ncannot just simply say: I will send and you will consent. It says \nadvice and consent. I think what the distinguished Senator from Nevada \nhas said is something I have heard Republican Senators say over and \nover again in my 30 years here.\n  Let us work this out. And then let's work with the White House so we \nhave both advice and consent. That is how we got 205 judges. That is \nwhy 95 percent of President Bush's judges have been confirmed. That is \nthe way we can work on the remaining ones.\n  So I compliment the Senator from Nevada. I hope his discussions with \nthe Senator from Tennessee work out. I know there is nothing the \nchairman of the committee and I would like better than to be able to go \non with the work of the Judiciary Committee and not with parliamentary \nmaneuvering.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky, the majority whip, \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from New York approached me \na few moments ago off the floor asking for 2 minutes prior to my \nresponse to the Democratic leader. I will be happy to grant him 2 \nminutes, provided that I be recognized as soon as the Senator from New \nYork completes his 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nKentucky for his usual graciousness.\n  I compliment our leader, Harry Reid, not only for his words but for \nhis actions. The compromise he seeks is a vital one to the history of \nthis body. Because if we do not reach compromise, the constitutional \nconfrontation that will occur is something the likes of which the \nSenate has never seen. It could end up destroying whatever is left of \ncomity in the Senate and undo our efforts to move forward on issues the \nAmerican public cares about.\n  We are acting here out of strength, not out of weakness. The public \nis on our side. They realize the nuclear option is overreaching. As our \nminority leader said, it is not the first time we have seen \noverreaching here in the Congress in the last few months.\n  But the compromise is offered in the best of faith. We seriously love \nthis body and wish to avoid ripping it apart. We plead with our \ncolleagues on the other side--the Republican leadership but also those \n10 or 12 Republican Members who know this is wrong but are under \ntremendous pressure to make it come about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me first join in the compliments \nthat have been expressed toward the Democratic leader. He is new to his \nposition. This new precedent, set in the Senate over the last Congress, \nin which we routinely saw filibustering for the purpose of defeating \ncircuit judges, was not something introduced under Senator Reid's \nmajority leadership.\n  We have had numerous conversations. I have had conversations with \nSenator Reid. He has had a number of conversations with the majority \nleader about how we might be able to get the Senate back to the way it \noperated for 214 years quite comfortably.\n  So far, a compromise has not been achieved. But I compliment the \nDemocratic leader for his willingness to discuss the issue and his \nunderstanding that where the Senate is today is simply unacceptable.\n  So let's talk just for a moment about what is not in dispute. What is \nnot in dispute is that for 214 years the filibuster was not used to \nkill a nomination for the judiciary when a majority\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nof the Members of the Senate were for that nominee. When a majority of \nthe Members of this body have been for a nominee, the filibuster has \nnever been used to defeat a nominee in the history of the country.\n  It is true, we have had a few cloture votes. My good friend from \nNevada, the Democratic leader, mentioned two that I think are \nillustrative of how the Senate should operate. Toward the end of the \nClinton years, we had two nominations before this body, Paez and \nBerzon, both of whom were quite controversial and quite far to the \nleft, for the Ninth Circuit, which some would argue did not need to be \npushed any further to the left.\n  Senator Lott was the majority leader then. Senator Daschle was the \nDemocratic leader. There were people on this side of the aisle who did \nnot want to see either of those nominees go forward and were prepared \nto filibuster those nominees for the purpose of defeating them. So our \nleader had to say to people on our side of the aisle: That is a bad \nidea. He joined with Senator Daschle and filed cloture not for the \npurpose of defeating the two nominations but for the purpose of \nadvancing them because, you see, there was a core of Republicans on \nthis side of the aisle prepared to filibuster for the purpose of \ndefeating those nominations.\n  Responsible leadership on both sides conspired, filed cloture, and \ncloture was invoked. I was an example of somebody who was not keen on \neither of those nominees. I voted for cloture because I believed then, \nand believe now, that judges are entitled to an up-or-down vote here in \nthe Senate, that any President is entitled to that courtesy. So cloture \nwas invoked as a result of the leadership of Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott. We had the votes on the nominees. They both were \nconfirmed--not with my vote but confirmed.\n  That is the way the Senate ought to operate when there are some \nMembers on each side of the aisle who would go so far as to deny a \njudge an up-or-down vote. That was the status quo until the last \nCongress, when, for the first time in the history of the Senate, the \nfilibuster was used for the purpose of defeating a nominee, even when \nthe nominee had a majority of support in the Senate. So there have been \nno filibusters for the purpose of killing nominees until the last \nCongress.\n  Second, there is a lot of discussion about polls, particularly the \nunbelievable poll on the front page of the Washington Post today which \nmight give some comfort to those who think filibustering judges for the \npurpose of defeating them is a good idea until you read the way the \nquestion was asked. The way the question was asked was almost \nguaranteed to get the answer.\n  A more appropriate way to ask the question was the way it was asked \nin a recent survey by Voter Consumer Research. In that survey, 81 \npercent of those tested agreed with the idea that ``even if they \ndisagree with a judge, Senate Democrats should at least allow the \nPresident's nomination to be voted on,'' and only 18 percent disagreed \nwith that, an unbiased way of stating the question. Even if you \ndisagree with the nominee, should the nominee get an up-or-down vote: \n81 percent yes; 18 percent no. That is where the American people are on \nthis issue.\n  With regard to the President's involvement, the President has not \nbeen involved in this, but the Vice President happens to be the \nPresident of the Senate. He is, because of his duties as President of \nthe Senate, going to be called upon at some point, should we have to go \nso far as to exercise the Byrd option or constitutional option--and let \nme make the point that the constitutional option is simply a precedent \ninterpreting a rule of the Senate. Senator Byrd did this not on one \noccasion, not on two occasions or three occasions, but on four \noccasions during the time that he was leader, interpreted the rules by \na simple majority of the Senate. It has been done before and the Byrd \noption, of course, could be done again.\n  Let me say I think our good friends on the other side of the aisle \nmay have a legitimate complaint with regard to the possibility that \njudicial nominees could be held in committee. I have heard it said on \nnumerous occasions that what they have done out here on the floor of \nthe Senate in the last Congress and are proposing to do in this \nCongress is no different from what the Republicans did in committee \nduring the Clinton years. I would suggest that any solution to the \nproblem include some kind of expedited procedure under which nominees \ncould get out of committee in an orderly way and get voted on up or \ndown on the Senate floor, thereby eliminating the possibility that the \nmajority party could, in committee, in effect do the same thing the \nminority party did in the last Congress on the floor. We could level \nthe playing field and make certain that any President's nominee is \ngiven fair consideration in committee and fair consideration on the \nfloor.\n  These are the kinds of things we have been kicking around, discussing \nin good faith on both sides of the aisle. Again, I compliment the \nDemocratic leader. He has certainly been willing to discuss the issue. \nI believe we both think where the Senate is today is unacceptable. \nThere is a lot of finger-pointing going on on both sides. Democrats are \npointing fingers at Republicans for what was done during the Clinton \nyears; Republicans are pointing fingers at Democrats for what was done \nin the last Congress. There is a way to cure that, a way to fix it.\n  It would be a huge mistake for the Senate to get to the point where \n41 Members of the Senate can dictate to any President of the United \nStates who gets to be on a circuit court or the Supreme Court. Let me \nsay that again. Where this is headed, I would say to my good friend, \nthe Democratic leader, and to our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, is in the direction of 41 Members of the Senate being able to \ndictate to any President who may be on the Supreme Court or a circuit \ncourt. That is a bad idea. Against the best efforts of myself and \nothers on this side of the aisle, there could be a Democratic President \nagain as soon as 3 or 4 years from now. I don't think our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle are going to want to have a well-\nestablished notion that a mere 41 Members of the Senate are going to be \nable to dictate to the President who may be on the courts.\n  I conclude by saying we should continue our discussions--I do think \nthey have been in good faith--to see if we can resolve this situation \nand get the Senate back to the way it operated prior to the last \nCongress when nominees were entitled to an up-or-down vote on the floor \nand, I would add, should be entitled to an up-or-down vote in \ncommittee, thereby leveling the playing field and guaranteeing that any \nPresident's nominations to the circuit courts and to the Supreme Court \nget a fair up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of my \ndistinguished friend. We have worked together for I don't remember how \nmany years because I had his job. A lot of my previous life has been \nblurred as a result of the past 5 months, but I enjoyed working with \nhim then. He is a master of procedure, certainly understands the \nSenate. I appreciate not only what he said but the tone of it.\n  I would just like to say this to the Presiding Officer, being a new \nSenator, and some others here: One of the problems I have is the \ndeference to the President. George Bush is my President. I didn't vote \nfor him. When he was elected the first time, I didn't vote for him. But \nwe are a country that is so unique. When his election was decided by \nthe Supreme Court after that election, there wasn't a window broken. \nThere wasn't a demonstration held. There were no fires set. He became \nPresident of the United States. He became my President and everybody \nelse's. But the fact that he is President of the United States does not \ntake away the fact that he is President, not king. With all the power \nthat he has in that vast bureaucracy, he has no more power than we have \nin the legislative branch.\n  My distinguished friend, the Senator from Kentucky, said: We need to \ngive deference to the President's nominations. Yes, I think we need to \ngive deference to the President's nominations, but we are not a rubber \nstamp for the President. We have an advice and consent role. My friend \nsaid he doesn't think it is right to have 41 Members hold up a vote on \nhis judicial nominations. I think it speaks volumes to a\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\nstatement that was issued by the majority leader last week. Obviously, \none of his Republican colleagues said: Is this rule that you are \nbreaking to change the rules going to apply to legislative filibusters? \nHe issued a one-paragraph statement and said: No, it won't apply to \nlegislative filibusters.\n  But what it didn't say was anything about Cabinet officers, sub-\nCabinet officers, people we have to confirm by law. Do we have a right \nto say the Senate rule should be in effect and we have a right to hold \none of these up by filibuster? Using the logic of my friend from \nKentucky and the statement issued by my friend, the distinguished \nmajority leader, obviously they think he should get his choices there, \ntoo.\n  There have been would-be Cabinet officers from the very beginning of \nthis country who never made it, Cabinet officers who were nominated but \nwere never confirmed because people in the Senate, 100 years ago, 200 \nyears ago, 50 years ago said: No thanks. They didn't have a majority \nbut they had enough to filibuster. That is the Senate. If we continue \non this path on which we are going, we will just be an extension of the \nHouse of Representatives. I have served there. With every matter that \ncomes to the House floor, without exception, there is what they call a \nrule on it that comes from the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee is \nchosen by the Speaker. There are Democrats there, but they are only \ntoken because whatever the Committee on Rules says, that is what \nhappens on the House floor.\n  You can bring a bill to the floor, and the Rules Committee can say: \nNo amendments, debate time 20 minutes evenly divided. Or they can bring \na piece of legislation to the floor and they can say: Five amendments, \nan hour each. They can do anything they want to do. They set a rule on \nevery piece of legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Not right now. When Senator Inhofe brings this bill to the \nfloor, the highway bill, this bill is a free-for-all. That is what the \nSenate is. It is kind of a cluttered, clumsy procedure, but that is \nwhat the Senate is. I hope we are not an extension of the House of \nRepresentatives where everything we do here is like in the House--a \nrule is set on it. If people feel strongly enough to break the rules, \nto change the rules, as they will have to do here, they can change it \nas to the nominations I have also mentioned. And next, they can change \nit on legislation. The Senator from Florida has not been here long, but \nhe is certainly an experienced man, a former Cabinet officer of this \ncountry. I know he came here a few weeks ago with an important piece of \nlegislation. To him, it was very important because it was important, he \nbelieved, to the people of Florida. But you knew, because of Senate \nprocedures, if we wanted to stop that with 41 votes, we could do that. \nIt should apply to everything we do here.\n\n  I agree with my friend from Kentucky. I don't think we should be \nlooking to pick fights and say that everybody the President sends up \nhere has to be what we want. We know it is the President's prerogative. \nBut for 214 years, the President consulted with the Senate on judicial \nnominations, and for many years the committee honored the blue slip, \nwhich ensured consultation. We know that during the last few years of \nthe Clinton administration, Senator Hatch said: We are not going to \napprove anybody unless you run the names past me. That is how we came \nup with Ginsburg and Breyer. Orrin Hatch and the Republicans, at that \ntime in the majority, and in the minority other times, said that they \nliked Breyer and Ginsburg. These nominees flew right through here. \nPerhaps President Clinton would have liked to have had somebody else. \nMaybe they were not his first choice. They got out of this body \nquickly.\n  So we had this consultation for a long period of time. We honored the \nblue-slip policy, which ensured consultation. I haven't yet mentioned \nthat one of the many positive things all the political writers talk \nabout is that the filibuster brings about compromise and consultation. \nYou are forced to come and talk about issues, whether it is a piece of \nlegislation the Senator from Florida is trying to get through or \nwhether it is a nomination. I got a call from a Senator today saying: I \nhave a hold on a Senate Cabinet officer, and I want to talk to you \nabout it and see if you can help me work something out. It brings \npeople together. I am confident that on an important issue for the \nPresident, we can do that.\n  Mr. President, I very much thank my friend from Kentucky--not only \nwhat he said, but how he said it. I hope something can be resolved \nhere. The right to unlimited debate is something this country has had \nand something that is needed. I don't think we should be filibustering \na lot of judges unnecessarily, but a filibuster is sometimes warranted. \nThere may be unusual situations in the future where we will need to \nrely on this procedure.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I can make it in the form of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to answer a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Basically, what I want to do is not ask him a \nquestion, but allay his concerns about this being a slippery slope that \nwould lead to the end of the legislative filibuster. We had that vote \nin 1995, I remind my good friend from Nevada, to get rid of the \nfilibuster, period. It got only 19 votes; all 19 of them were \nDemocrats. Not a single Republican voted to get rid of the legislative \nfilibuster. Interestingly enough, this was the first vote after my \nparty came back to power in the Senate. So, arguably, we would have \nbeen the big beneficiaries of getting rid of the filibuster. We had \njust had a marvelously successful election in 1994. We were in the \nmajority of the House for the first time in 40 years and in the Senate. \nSomebody on your side of the aisle offered an amendment to get rid of \nall filibusters. That was the first vote Senator Frist cast after he \nwas sworn into the Senate--to keep the filibuster. So I can reassure my \ngood friend there is no sentiment that I am aware of anywhere in the \nSenate for getting rid of the filibuster.\n  Secondly, I am not aware of any sentiment about the filibuster being \na problem with regard to Cabinet or sub-Cabinet appointments.\n  Third, I am not aware of the filibuster being a problem with regard \nto district court judges. Senators seem to be--your side has done a \ngood job of confirming district court judges. That is not in dispute. \nWe appreciate that. We think you have done it in a fair manner. What we \nare talking about here is this problem: for the first time in history \nthe filibustering of circuit court nominees that have a majority of \nsupport in the Senate and, if allowed to have an up-or-down vote, all \nof these judges would be confirmed. They are for the first time in \nhistory denying them a vote when they have a majority of support in the \nSenate, and many of us have a suspicion this is precisely what our good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have in mind for any subsequent \nSupreme Court nominations. So why don't we just talk about the problem, \nwhich is circuit courts, and potentially the Supreme Court, and reach \nsome kind of understanding that gets us back to the way we comfortably \noperated here for 214 years. That is what I would hope my good friend \nfrom Nevada, the Democratic leader, and ourselves could agree to at \nsome point.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend that if a filibuster is \nOK for a person who is going to serve 4 years as a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet, or some lesser period of time, which is usually \nthe case, why would it be wrong, for someone who is going to get a \nlifetime appointment, to take a look at that person? Why in the world \nwould that be any different? Don't we have an even higher obligation to \nlook at somebody who is going to be appointed for life? Certainly, we \nhave an obligation to do that. There is no reason in the world that the \nPresident should get all of his people. I would say that my friends in \nthe majority should understand that we consider our position as \nSenators. It gives up power to the executive branch of Government.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I will address a question to my \nfriend from Nevada. I have two questions. I will ask them both. The \nfirst is this: Our good friend from Kentucky did speak of compromise, \nand we do want compromise. But you cannot call something a compromise \nand then say I\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nwant to win everything. To say that there would be no filibusters of \nany judges, to say that every judge could be discharged from a \ncommittee--you can call that a compromise; you can say the sky is \ngreen--it is not a compromise. That is totally the position of the \nother side. A compromise involves a little pain on each side to be a \ngenuine compromise.\n  So my first question to my good friend and leader, whom I am proud to \nserve under, is: Would this side saying we will not filibuster any \njudge be any kind of compromise at all? The second question to my \ncolleague--I will ask both at once--is this: My friend from Kentucky \nsaid: Well, we want an up-or-down vote. Majority rules. Are there not \nmany instances where the Senate does not operate by majority rule, \nwhere 60 votes are called for, where 67 votes are called for? In fact, \nI argue it can be said that 51 Senators, representing only 21 percent \nof the population of this United States, can pass a law. Isn't it a \nfact that the Founding Fathers wanted the Senate to be something of a \ndifferent animal, not a place where if you had 51 percent, you got your \nway 100 percent of the time but, rather, a place where the rules, the \ntraditions, the way of thinking said come together for compromise; and, \nin fact, isn't it a fact that the time when this is most important, \nwhen the Senate plays its most important role, is when the President, \nthe House, and the Senate are in the control of one party?\n  My two questions: Is it a compromise--so-called compromise--that says \nno filibuster on any judges and discharge petitions on all judges, any \ncompromise at all, which my friend from Kentucky seems to think it was, \neven though it would be everything your side wants and nothing our side \nwants?\n  And second, is it not true that the Senate has been founded not on \n51-to-49 rule governance all the time, but on a tradition of comity, \nchecks and balances, and bipartisanship where a bare majority does not \nalways rule?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, this was the Great \nCompromise during the Constitutional Convention, where these visionary \nmen, our Founding Fathers, worked out the difference between the House \nand the Senate. They did this purposely and specifically.\n  I say to my friend, there are many issues here that are decided not \nby 51, not by 60, not by 67, but many issues take unanimous consent. In \nfact, most things we do in this body are by unanimous consent. All of \nus have to agree.\n  We cannot commit to not having any filibusters, but we will exercise \nto the very best of our ability discretion, judicious discretion, \nbecause we think we are in a new day. We believe this is a new \nCongress, and we want to show the American people we can work together. \nAnd I say to everyone listening that I think we have proven that this \nyear. We have worked on issues that have taken 15 years to get to the \nSenate floor. We know that many people on this side of the aisle did \nnot particularly like the class action bill. We know that many people \non this side of the aisle did not particularly like the bankruptcy \nbill, but we took 15 years of history and came here and did things the \nold-fashioned way. We had a bill on the floor, we offered amendments--\nsome failed, some passed--and moved on. Those bills are now law. People \nmay not like that--some do not--but it shows we can work together here.\n  My plaintive plea to every one of my 99 friends in the Senate is, \nlet's work something out. Let's try to get along. Let's set a picture \nthat Bill Frist and Harry Reid can walk out here not representing these \nspecial interest groups but representing the American people and trying \nto keep this body as it is and has been for over 200 years, and walk \nout here together and say: We have resolved our differences. We are \ngoing to move forward with the business of this country. That is my \ndesire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, briefly, before the Democratic leader \nleaves, what I fear is that the only thing that has really changed in \nrecent years is the occupant of the White House. With all due respect \nto my good friend and colleague--and I thank him for his cooperation on \nclass action and bankruptcy; I know that was not easy--here we have my \ngood friend Harry Reid in June of 2001 saying:\n\n       We should have up-or-down votes in the committees and on \n     the floor.\n\n  We should have up-or-down votes in the committees and on the floor. \nJune 2001.\n  My good friend Senator Schumer is, I believe, still here on the \nSenate floor. In March of 2000, he said:\n\n       I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with \n     alacrity--vote them up or down. . . . This delay makes a \n     mockery of the Constitution.\n\n  That is the Democratic leader and our good Senator from New York in \n2000, just a few years ago. What has changed between then and now? I \nsuggest the only thing that has changed is the occupant of the White \nHouse. All we are pleading for--and again, I thank the Democratic \nleader. I think he has been gracious, he has been anxious to work with \nus to come up with some accommodation. But what was routine Senate \nprocedure as late as 2000 and 2001 now has been turned on its head and \nnight is day and day is night. I am having a hard time seeing that \nanything has changed except the occupant of the White House.\n  What we need to do is divorce ourselves from who the current occupant \nof the White House is, who the current majority is in the Senate, and \nthink about the institution in the long term. It seems to me that where \nwe are headed is that 41 Members of the Senate will, in effect, be able \nto dictate to whomever is in the White House who the nominees for \nappeals court judges and for Supreme Court Justices may be. I believe \nthat is not where we need to end up. I do not think it is in their best \ninterest. They may have the White House as soon as January of 2009.\n\n  Why can't we just pull back from the abyss, get back to the way we \nwere operating in a way apparently the Democratic leader and the \nSenator from New York felt was quite appropriate as recently as 2000 \nand 2001? Why can't we just get back to that and settle this dispute \nonce and for all for future Congresses?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I have no problem with what I \nsaid. I believe we should have had some votes in the committee. \nRemember, 69 never even came before the committee. Following that, \nthere should have been votes here on the floor. Remember, every one of \nthese judges turned down had votes on the floor. They were cloture \nmotions.\n  My distinguished friend says he does not know of any time in the \nhistory of this country where there has been a majority that favored \nsomebody, that there was not cloture filed, or words to that effect. \nThe point is, we do not need to relive history, but 69 of President \nClinton's people never even got there, and that is what I was talking \nabout in 2000 and 2001. I would never, ever consider breaking the rules \nto change the rules. I never suggested that at all.\n  I say to my friend, I want to work something out. I repeat that for \nprobably the fifth time here today, but in the process we cannot give \nup the basic rights this country and this Senate have had for more than \n200 years. We are willing to compromise, and, as my friend from New \nYork said, compromise means just that. If we are seen as not acting \nappropriately, then people can respond to us at election time. It is \ninteresting to note, I say to my friend, in talking to some of my \nRepublican friends, of all the circuit nominees I have heard of, there \nare only a few that I have a problem with. My Republican friends have \ntold me that they have a problem with a couple themselves.\n  We can work through this. Let's not have a hard-and-fast rule that \nthe only way we are going to do this is through an up-or-down vote on \njudges because if that is the case, we are wasting our time here. They \nare going to have to break the rules.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the minority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend from Missouri--he has been patient--\nfor a question without my losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to ask the minority leader--I \ncame down here to talk about the highway bill. Is it his understanding \nthat we are on the highway bill?\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n  Mr. REID. And my answer is yes, and I am going to get off the floor \njust as quickly as I can.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be brief, as I know my friend from Missouri has \nbeen patient. I want to augment, since my name was mentioned, what my \ncolleague said. What we were talking about was bringing votes to the \nfloor. We did not say majority vote, nor did we try to stop the \nfilibusters that were going on for Mr. Paez and Ms. Berzon.\n  The bottom line is those two were not allowed to get votes for 4 \nyears, 5\\1/2\\ years. The nominees here have come to the floor and, by \nthe rules of the Senate, they did not garner sufficient support. It is \na lot different not bringing them up at all, and that is what we were \ntalking about, rather than bringing them up and then letting them be \ndisposed of by the Senate rules. In fact, the quote, the first part of \nit I believe I was talking to my colleague from New Hampshire: You can \ndebate this as long as you want, just bring it up.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate everyone's patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I assure the Senator from Missouri, I \nam also about through. Listening to Senator Schumer, maybe we have \nparameters of an understanding here. I think it was probably before the \nSenator from New York came on the floor, but I suggested that we couple \nan assurance that we have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate \nfor appellate court judges and Supreme Court Justices with a guaranteed \nexpedited procedure in committee, guarantee that some of the legitimate \ngrievances his party may have had toward the end of the Clinton years \ncould not be committed again. All of this seems to me presents the \npossibility for an understanding that might settle this issue once and \nfor all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The highway bill is the pending question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as we have said, we are on the substitute, \nour committee substitute. That will be the one that will receive \namendments. We have invited Members to come to the floor with their \namendments.\n  While we are waiting for those to come to the floor, I will go over \nwhat is before us section by section. Then when someone comes in for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment, I will be glad to stop and then \nyield to that a person.\n  I first ask if the ranking minority member, Senator Jeffords, had any \ncomments to make before we go on to amendments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for the opportunity but the answer \nis no.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I will start section by section. Section 1101 of \nthe bill authorizes $283.9 billion in guaranteed spending and contract \nauthority over a 6-year period. This level is consistent with levels \nadopted by the House and the White House. Subtracting authorizations \nfor mass transit and safety and funding for fiscal year 2004, the bill \nprovides $191 billion for maintenance and improvement to the Nation's \nroads and bridges over the 5-year period from fiscal year 2005 through \n2009.\n  Let us keep in mind that this was essentially the same bill at a \ndifferent funding level than we had a year ago this week, I believe. So \nwe already have a year behind us. What we have done for this statement \nis to say what is there other than what has already been used for the \nfirst year, fiscal year 2005, and also mass transit and safety.\n  The link between a robust economy and a strong transportation \ninfrastructure is undeniable. The movement of people and goods is one \nof the foremost indicators of a growing economy and job creation. At \nthis point, we need to recognize that people have been concerned--were \nconcerned a few years ago--about the economy, and we are recognizing \nthat this administration actually inherited a recession and we are \ncoming out of it now. But there is no single thing we could do that \nwould provide more jobs and more economic activity. I suggest to the \nPresident that for each 1-percent increase in economic activity, it \nprovides an additional 47,000 jobs. So do the math and we can see what \na great boon this would be.\n  The bill before us today recognizes the realities of available \nrevenues without the need for increasing gas taxes. It is designed to \nmake the most of every available dollar for better and safer roads, \nwhile creating thousands of new jobs.\n  It probably is anticipated that there will be amendments to increase \nthis amount. I anticipate there may be an amendment by the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus, and if not them then somebody else would probably do \nit. When this happens, they would, of course, be in a position to come \nup with the amount of money that would be necessary.\n  One of the things I commented about last year is that we were always \nwithin the amount of money that we could identify--in other words, the \namount of money that was anticipated coming in from Federal revenues \nfrom gas purchases, along with other areas we could identify.\n  The total obligation authorized in this bill is $188 billion for a \nperiod from fiscal year 2005 to 2009.\n  In addition to the increases in funding for the overall program, the \nbill makes important changes to the apportionments of a few specific \nprograms. Under TEA-21, which we adopted 7 years ago, the \nadministrative expenses for the Federal Highway Administration were \nfunded as a takedown from the various core programs. This bill \nrecognizes the separate importance of costs associated with the \nadministration of the overall highway program. Therefore, the bill \nfunds Federal Highway Administration expenses at its own separate \napportionment protecting the autonomy of the individual core programs \nand the administrative fund itself.\n  Of the amount designated for program administration, the Secretary of \nTransportation is also given the authority to transfer an appropriate \namount to the administrative expenses of the Appalachian Highway \nDevelopment System.\n  As a result of the 2000 census, 46 new metropolitan planning \norganizations, known as MPOs, have been established throughout the \ncountry and are now eligible for Federal transportation planning \nfunding. To respond to this expanded need, we have increased the \nprogram set-asides for MPOs from 1 percent under TEA-21 to up to 1\\1/2\\ \npercent. This, along with the overall increase in program funds, will \nhelp to address the growing transportation planning needs.\n  Section 1104 is the equity bonus section. TEA-21 used the minimum \nguarantee calculation to guarantee that States receive back at least \n90.5 percent of their percentage contributed to the highway trust fund. \nThis is very significant. It has become quite controversial. Last week \nand this week we have talked for several hours on this bill about the \nvarious donor States. My State of Oklahoma has always been a donor \nState, since the programs began. I can remember that donor amount was \n75 percent; that is to say, each State was guaranteed to get back 75 \npercent of the money that was sent in. Slowly that has crept up and it \nis currently at 90.5 percent.\n\n  Had we passed the bill that we had in conference last year--the bill \nthat we sent to conference had $318 billion of authorization--then we \nwould have everybody at the end of this 6-year period up to 95 percent. \nSo it would have gone from 90.5 percent to 95 percent.\n  The minimum guarantee program is driven by a political distribution \nknown as the 1104 table. The bill replaces the old minimum guarantee \nprogram and the 1104 table with a new equity bonus program that ensures \na percentage return to States of 92 percent in each of the fiscal years \n2005 through 2009.\n  At this point we can say it is very complicated, but the equity bonus \nprogram is just what it states: it is an equity program. The program \ndoes away with the table in TEA-21 which determined each State's \npercentage share of the total highway program. Rather than have a \nState's return be set by a politically driven table, the equity\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nbonus program determines each State's return by first relying on the \nprogram distribution of formulas.\n  This is not the easy way of doing it; this is the hard way of doing \nit. I am sure Senator Jeffords joins me in saying it would be a lot \neasier to have a minimum guarantee for any State, work out their deal, \nmake 60 Members of the Senate happy, and walk away. That would have \nbeen done a long time ago if we decided to do it that way. But that is \nnot equitable, and I think that is the wrong way to do business.\n  In fact, I say to people who criticize this bill saying it has pork \nin it, there are only two projects in the entire bill. The bill before \nus right now in the form of a substitute only has two projects in it. \nThat is not the case over in the other body. They have several hundred \nprojects. It has been my philosophy, and I think it is shared by the \nranking minority, that the closer one gets to home, the better these \ndecisions are.\n  If we can determine an equitable formula, which I believe we have \ndone, we can send it back to the States and let the local people make \nthe determinations as to how that is going to be spent. Now, a lot of \npeople in Washington do not agree with that. A lot of them think if the \ndecision is not made in Washington, it is not a good decision. I \nbelieve we are doing it the right way.\n  The equity bonus calculation identifies a justifiable nexus in equity \nbetween the underlying formulas and responsible balanced growth for \ndonor and donee States alike. If a State fails to reach the minimum \nreturn in any year based on the formulas, that State would receive an \nequity bonus apportionment in addition to their formula funds to bring \nthem up to the required level.\n  While we allow the formulas to work under the new equity bonus \nprogram, we also recognize there would be some inequities if we allowed \nthe formulas to be the sole factor in distributing dollars to the \nStates. In order to increase the minimum rate of return for donor \nStates while ensuring an equitable transition of donee States, rates of \nreturn are subject to an annual growth ceiling to smooth out the phase-\nin of increased minimum returns. This accomplishes two goals. First, it \nkeeps the cost of the equity bonus program affordable; secondly, it \nensures that donee States are still able to grow so no States grow less \nthan 10 percent over their TEA-21 levels. Everyone is guaranteed an \nincrease from their own levels, at least 10 percent.\n\n  There is a cap on equity bonus. No State may receive a portion more \nthan a specific percentage of their average portion received under TEA-\n21. So you have two caps--a floor and a ceiling. That helps the \nformulas work.\n  There is a special rule to protect States with population densities \nless than 20 persons per square mile, a population of less than 1 \nmillion, a median household income of less than $35,000, or a State \nwith a fatality rate during 2002 on the interstate highways greater \nthan 1 fatality per 100 million vehicle miles traveled.\n  We said a lot in one paragraph. It shows the complications of a \nformula. First, we have to take care of the States that do not have a \npopulation. Look at Montana, Wyoming, some of the sparsely populated \nStates. They still have to have roads. Second, we have said for the \nStates that might have a lower per capita income, they can be \nconsidered poverty States, so there is a consideration. My State of \nOklahoma is in a different situation than many other States and we \nwould benefit from that. Or a State with a fatality rise during 2002. \nIt is absolutely necessary to have part of the formula attributed to a \nconsideration for money being made to States where the fatality rate is \nhigher than average. That takes us through several of the sections.\n  At this point, if there are any Senators who would like to offer \namendments, I encourage them to come to the Chamber and offer \namendments, at the end of which time we will continue to go through the \nbill section by section.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 572 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 572.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the section relating to National Scenic Byways to \n          provide for the designation of Indian scenic byways)\n\n       Strike section 1602(a) and insert the following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 162 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the roads as'' and all \n     that follows and inserting ``the roads as--\n       ``(A) National Scenic Byways;\n       ``(B) All-American Roads; or\n       ``(C) America's Byways.'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by striking ``To be considered'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--To be considered'';\n       (ii) in subparagraph (A) (as designated by clause (i))--\n\n       (I) by inserting ``, an Indian tribe, '' after ``nominated \n     by a State''; and\n       (II) by inserting ``, an Indian scenic byway,'' after \n     ``designated as a State scenic byway''; and\n\n       (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Nomination by indian tribes.--An Indian tribe may \n     nominate a road as a National Scenic Byway under subparagraph \n     (A) only if a Federal land management agency (other than the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs), a State, or a political \n     subdivision of a State does not have--\n       ``(i) jurisdiction over the road; or\n       ``(ii) responsibility for managing the road.\n       ``(C) Safety.--Indian tribes shall maintain the safety and \n     quality of roads nominated by the Indian tribe under \n     subparagraph (A).''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Reciprocal notification.--States, Federal land \n     management agencies, and Indian tribes shall notify each \n     other regarding nominations under this subsection for roads \n     that--\n       ``(A) are within the jurisdictional boundary of the State, \n     Federal land management agency, or Indian tribe; or\n       ``(B) directly connect to roads for which the State, \n     Federal land management agency, or Indian tribe is \n     responsible.'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by inserting ``and Indian tribes'' after ``provide \n     technical assistance to States'';\n       (ii) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``designated as'' and \n     all that follows and inserting ``designated as--\n       ``(i) National Scenic Byways;\n       ``(ii) All-American Roads;\n       ``(iii) America's Byways;\n       ``(iv) State scenic byways; or\n       ``(v) Indian scenic byways; and''; and\n       (iii) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or Indian'' after \n     ``State'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``Byway or All-\n     American Road'' and inserting ``Byway, All-American Road, or \n     1 of America's Byways'';\n       (ii) in subparagraph (B)--\n\n       (I) by striking ``State-designated'' and inserting ``State \n     or Indian''; and\n       (II) by striking ``designation as a'' and all that follows \n     and inserting ``designation as--\n\n       ``(i) a National Scenic Byway;\n       ``(ii) an All-American Road; or\n       ``(iii) 1 of America's Byways; and''; and\n       (iii) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``or Indian'' after \n     ``State'';\n       (3) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``or Indian'' after \n     ``State'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by inserting ``Indian scenic byway,'' after \n     ``improvements to a State scenic byway,''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``Indian scenic byway,'' after \n     ``designation as a State scenic byway,''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (4), by striking ``passing lane,''; and\n       (4) in subsection (e), by inserting ``or Indian tribe'' \n     after ``State''.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I hope my amendment will be included as \npart of the final bill. I know the managers intend to offer a managers' \namendment. I want my colleagues to know I have been working with the \nchairman, the Senator from Oklahoma, the ranking member, Senator \nJeffords from Vermont, of the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nconcerning this issue since we marked up the underlying bill in \ncommittee last month.\n  While Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords, Subcommittee Chair \nBond, and Ranking Subcommittee Member Baucus initially had questions \nregarding my amendment in committee, I understand now\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nthe staff has been able to work through all of those concerns.\n  Simply put, my amendment seeks to allow Native American tribes the \nability to nominate roads to the Secretary of Transportation for \ndesignation as scenic byways, All-American Roads, or America's Byways.\n  Currently, Indian tribes are only allowed to nominate roads for \ndesignation under the Scenic Byways Program if they first go through \ntheir respective State Department of Transportation or Federal land \nmanagement agencies such as the National Park Service or the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. My amendment allows tribes to designate those roads \nover which they have jurisdiction or management responsibility as \ntribal scenic byways which then allows them to directly nominate the \nroad for national designation with the Secretary of Transportation.\n  Additionally, my amendment calls on tribes to ensure the safety and \nquality of the roads that are designated as scenic byways similar to \nthe requirements States currently have. In no way does this amendment \nimpact the funding available for scenic byways. It simply grants Indian \ntribes the same ability States and Federal land management agencies \ncurrently have to nominate roads.\n  In closing, this is an issue of fairness and something I hope the \nmanagers of the bill will be able to accept. It does not impact current \nlevels of funding. It simply allows for more flexibility for the Native \nAmerican tribes in this country to designate roads that are under their \njurisdiction and management.\n  I hope the managers will be able to accept the amendment. As I said \nearlier today, I hope we can proceed to get this bill through the \nprocess, through the Senate, into conference with the House, and on the \nPresident's desk because it is so important to this Nation's future, to \nmy State of South Dakota, and to all those tribes, local governments, \nState highway departments, business groups, and those who are awaiting \nfinal action on the highway bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for favorable \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his amendment and \nfor working with us on this committee. I am sure he is aware the \namendment concerns a large number of tribal communities in Oklahoma, as \nwell as those in South Dakota. I believe right now we have the largest \npercentage of Native Americans per capita of any of the States.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. I ask the Senator from \nVermont if it is the Senator's wish to go ahead and accept this now, if \nthis has been cleared on the minority side.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am very pleased to concur in the amendment. The \nSenator has made an excellent presentation. I appreciate the work of \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 572) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator \nInhofe, and Senator Jeffords for their help.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THUNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nVermont for their assistance and for their staffs' work. This will \nimprove the way the roads are treated on the reservations and give our \ntribes more flexibility and discretion when it comes to how they treat \nthe roads.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota coming down. \nHe has submitted the first amendment to this bill, an amendment as \nmeaningful to Oklahoma and other States as to South Dakota. We thank \nthe Senator for his effort.\n  We invite other Members to offer their amendments. I am not implying \nthey will all be that easy, but we invite our Senators to offer \namendments.\n  I was going over section 1104, the most complicated section in the \nbill, the equity bonus section. We talked about the fact it does \nprotect States that are of a lower income, densely populated States, \nStates that have our donor status, States that are donee status. This \nis an important part of the bill.\n  The scope or percentage of funding included in the equity bonus and \nin the program remains the same, at 92.5 percent as TEA-21. This is \nsignificant. That means 92.5 percent of everything in this bill, \nwhatever it ends up being, whether $284 billion or another amount, is \ndone through this equitable manner. It minimizes what a lot of people \nwould criticize as being pork for special projects.\n  In order to craft a successful formula, we have to balance the needs \nof donor and donee States. I will be the first to acknowledge this \nbalance, as with any compromise, is not perfect. A few minutes ago we \ntalked about compromises and they aren't perfect.\n  However, I can say with, I am sure, the agreement of the ranking \nminority member, there were many compromises made during the \nconstruction of this bill over the past 2\\1/2\\ years the Senator from \nVermont disagreed with and with which I disagreed. But in the spirit of \ncompromise we were able to get these things done.\n  My colleagues in representing donee and donor States that received \nlower rates of return or growth rates than they feel fair have made \nthis fact very clear. I am sympathetic to the concerns of both donor \nand donees in this situation. They both have significant transportation \nneeds that cannot be ignored. Addressing their concerns is more \ndifficult in the last year due to the fact we have less money.\n  When we were dealing with the bill we passed out of the Senate and \nsent to conference last year, just at about this time, it was at a \nhigher level, and that did guarantee every State would reach, at the \nend of the 6-year period, at least a 95-percent return. I know my \npeople in the State of Oklahoma wanted a 95-percent return, and they \nwere very disappointed when we were unable to get it out of conference, \nwhen I had every expectation we would get it out of conference.\n  So now, in order to get up to a higher amount, we have to be dealing \nwith a different funding level. We have to wait and let the process \ntake place and see what happens on that.\n  Section 1105 is the revenue aligned budget authority, the RABA. The \nhuge 2003 negative adjustment in revenue aligned budget authority, or \nRABA, made it clear that some changes were needed to the RABA \ncalculation in order to provide greater stability, more accurate \npredictions, and less fluctuation in coming years. As I have indicated \nbefore, I believe the underlying principle of RABA is an important \nfiscal policy and that highway expenditures should be tied to highway \ntrust fund revenues.\n  This bill modifies the RABA calculation so that annual funding level \nadjustments are less dependent on future anticipated receipts and more \ndependent on actual receipts to the highway trust fund. If the RABA \nadjustment in a fiscal year is negative, the amount of contract \nauthority apportioned to the States for that year will be reduced by an \namount equal to the negative RABA.\n  Under TEA-21, negative adjustments were delayed until the succeeding \nfiscal year. Under the new method--the change we are making--no \nreduction to apportionments is made for RABA when the cash balance on \nthe highway trust fund, other than the mass transit account, exceeds $6 \nbillion.\n  Section 1201 is the Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance \nProgram, the IPAM. The Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance \nProgram is intended for ready-to-go projects that States can undertake \nand complete within a relatively short timeframe. This is very \nimportant because we are now--I anticipate we will pass this bill--into \nthe construction season. Some of my friends from Northern States have \nmuch shorter construction seasons than some, such as the Presiding \nOfficer. They have 12 months a year for construction. We are not quite \nthat fortunate.\n  So this allows those projects that are ready to go, to go ahead--as \nsoon as this bill is signed into law--and in a very short timeframe to \nbe completed.\n  As a result, States are given 6 months to obligate IPAM funds. We \ndesigned this discretionary program to promote projects that result in \nimmediate benefits for the highway system's\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\ncondition and performance, while avoiding long-term commitments of \nfunds. The program also provides further economic stimulus to the \neconomy and provides a way to aid in spending down balances in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  States may obligate funds for projects eligible under Interstate \nMaintenance; the National Highway System; the Surface Transportation \nProgram; the Highway Safety Improvement Program; Congestion Mitigation \nand Air Quality Improvement, the CMAQ Program; and the Highway Bridge \nProgram.\n  Eligible projects under the IPAM Program include the preservation, \nmaintenance, and improvement of existing highway elements, including \nhurricane evacuation routes, operational improvements at points of \nrecurring highway congestion, and systematic changes to manage or \nimprove areas of congestion.\n  Section 1202 is the future of the surface transportation system. In \norder to be prepared for future reauthorizations of this legislation, \nwe require the Secretary of Transportation to perform a long-term \ninvestigation into the surface transportation infrastructure needs of \nthe Nation. Specifically, the bill directs the Secretary to look at, \nfirst, the current condition and performance of the interstate system; \nnext, the future of the interstate system in 15, 30, and 50 years; \nthird, the expected demographics and business uses that impact the \nsurface transportation system; fourth, the effect of changing vehicle \ntypes, modes of transportation, traffic volumes, and fleet size and \nweights; fifth, possible design changes; sixth, urban, rural, \ninterregional and national needs; seventh, improvements in emergency \npreparedness; eighth, real-time performance data collection; and, \nninth, future funding needs and potential approaches to collect those \nfunds.\n  Now, that concludes section 1202.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that a Senator is here who \nwants the floor for a purpose other than the highway bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I would like to \nmake very brief comments on the Transportation bill, but I would also \nlike to address the Senate on another subject matter. If there were \nSenators here who would like to talk on the highway bill, I would \nwithhold. If there were not other Senators here on that legislation, I \nwould hope to be able to address the Senate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would make the request of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts to go ahead and proceed in terms of his comments on \nthe highway bill. Then, since we do have others coming down, we have to \nget through this section by section. Can the Senator give us an idea \nabout how much time he would like to have?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would ask the Senator, if we were to go ahead and allow \nyou 20 minutes on another subject, if someone came down, prior to that \ntime being used, to offer an amendment, would you at that time yield \nthe floor? It is highly unlikely that will happen, but we do want to \nstay on this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield the floor for the purpose of a \nSenator offering an amendment, if I could retain the floor just to \nfinish my remarks, but I would be glad to let the person offer their \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have no objection to the 20 minutes for \nthat purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I think all of us understand this \nTransportation bill is the No. 1 jobs bill the Senate will debate this \nyear. Mr. President, 47,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion in \nthis legislation. This bill would create 140,000 jobs in my own State \nof Massachusetts. But this bill has $34 billion less than last year's \nSenate bill, and, incredibly, a $1.7 billion cut in public transit. So \nthe Senate must find a way to restore these cuts.\n  In my own State, we have a crucial need for this kind of help and \nassistance in terms of our roads and our bridges and also in terms of \nmass transit. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation. It \nis fundamental in terms of our economy. We are very conscious that \nthere are many growth areas across this country. Those growth areas \nrequire additional kinds of investment in terms of the highway system.\n  But there are also other older areas where the roads are heavily \nused, and used much more than just by the people who inhabit that \nparticular State. Generally, consideration is not given as to the \namount of usage of many of these roads. So in many of the older States, \nin New England, for example, and the eastern seaboard, many of these \nroads are heavily used not only by those who live in those particular \nStates but others as well. There is a very important need to make sure \nthose roads are going to be safe for those who travel on the roads and \nalso be safe and secure in order to add an additional dimension to our \nnational economy.\n  So I am going to support this legislation. I do hope we will be able \nto find additional resources. I know those resources can make a major \ndifference and be put to work effectively, in terms of strengthening \nand improving not only our interstate system but also the \ntransportation systems in our States. It is a very solid investment \nthat is paid back many times over by the returns in our economy.\n\n\n                 Anniversary of the Abu Ghraib Scandal\n\n  Mr. President, the sad anniversary of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal \nis now upon us. It is an appropriate time to reflect on how well we \nhave responded as a nation.\n  The images of cruelty and perversion are still difficult to look at a \nyear later: an Iraqi prisoner in a dark hood and cape, standing on a \ncardboard box with electrodes attached to his body; naked men forced to \nsimulate sex acts on each other; a corpse of a man who had been beaten \nto death lying in ice next to soldiers smiling and giving a thumbs-up \nsign; a pool of blood from the wounds of a naked, defenseless prisoner \nattacked by a military dog. These images are seared in our collective \nmemory.\n\n  The reports of widespread abuse by U.S. personnel were initially met \nwith disbelief and then incomprehension. They stand in sharp contrast \nto the values America has always stood for, our belief in the dignity \nand worth of all people, our unequivocal stance against torture and \nabuse, our commitment to the rule of law. The images horrified us and \nseverely damaged our reputation in the Middle East and around the \nworld.\n  On December 4, 2003, President Bush had proclaimed to the world the \ncapture of Saddam Hussein brought further assurance that the torture \nchambers and the secret police are gone forever. The photos of Abu \nGhraib made all too clear that torture continued in occupied Iraq. \nWhere are we a year later? Has this problem been resolved? Has the \nmoral authority of the United States been restored? Have we recovered \nfrom what is perhaps the steepest and deepest fall from grace in our \nhistory?\n  Sadly the answer is no. Because at every opportunity, the \nadministration has tried to minimize the problem and avoid \nresponsibility for it. The tone was set at the very start. Senior level \nmilitary commanders knew about the problems much earlier. They knew \nabout Abu Ghraib photos as early as January 2004. General Taguba \nsubmitted his scathing report on February 26. Yet rather than deal with \nthe problem honestly, Pentagon officials persuaded CBS News to delay \nits report while they developed a damage control plan.\n  The plan included an effort to minimize the abuse as the work of a \nfew bad apples, all conveniently lower rank soldiers, in a desperate \neffort to emphasize the role of senior military officials in exposing \nthe scandal and insulate the civilian leadership from responsibility. \nIt was clear from the start that further investigation of the abuse was \nneeded. The American people deserved a thorough review of all detention \nand interrogation policies used by military and intelligence personnel \nabroad and a full accounting of all officials responsible for the \npolicies that allowed the abuses to take place.\n  What we got instead were nine incomplete and self-serving internal \ninvestigations by the Pentagon. None of the assigned investigators were \ngiven the authority to challenge the conduct of the civilian command. \nFor example, the Schlesinger panel's report found\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nthat abuses were widespread and there was both institutional and \npersonal responsibility at a higher level. But Secretary Rumsfeld did \nnot authorize the panel to address matters of personal accountability.\n  The assigned investigators were also denied the cooperation of the \nCIA which had a central role in the torture scandal. General Fay found \nthat CIA practices led to ``a loss of accountability, abuse'' and \n``poisoned the atmosphere at Abu Ghraib.'' His efforts to fully uncover \nthe agency's role, however, were stymied by their refusal to respond to \nhis requests for information. Indeed, no investigation, congressional \nor otherwise, has gotten full cooperation from the CIA.\n  With respect to matters under the Defense Department's control, the \nanswers we received have been inconsistent and incomplete. In May 2004, \nGeneral Sanchez categorically denied to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that he had approved the use of sleep deprivation, excessive \nnoise, and intimidation by guard dogs as interrogation techniques in \nIraq. A memorandum uncovered last month by the ACLU, however, showed he \nhad, in fact, approved the use of these techniques.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld told the committee the military received its first \nindication of trouble at Abu Ghraib when a low-ranking soldier came \nforward in January 2004. Only later did we learn from press reports \nthat throughout 2003, the Red Cross had provided the military with \ndetailed reports about torture and other abuses at the prison and \nelsewhere in Iraq. The State Department and the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority also appealed to top military officials to stop the abuse \nduring 2003.\n  The Church report, released last month, rejected any connection \nbetween the official interrogation policies in Iraq and the abuses that \noccurred. The Fay report, by contrast, blamed the abuses at Abu Ghraib \non a number of ``systemic problems'' that included ``inadequate \ninterrogation doctrine and training'' and ``the lack of clear \ninterrogation policy for the Iraq Campaign.''\n  Other parts of the Church report, including those on the role of \ngeneral counsel William Haynes in adopting the radical legal reasoning \nof the Justice Department's Bybee memoranda over the vigorous \nobjections of experienced JAG officers, have been wrongly classified. \nIn fact, the Defense Department has repeatedly abused its \nclassification procedures to hide critical information from Congress \nand the public.\n\n  Similarly, the Justice Department has gone to extremes to withhold \nfrom public scrutiny legal memos it considers too embarrassing to \nreveal. Even Congress has been remiss in its responsibilities to \noversee the scandal. As Senator Rockefeller, the vice chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, said:\n\n       More disturbingly, the Senate Intelligence Committee--the \n     Committee charged with overseeing intelligence programs and \n     the only one with the jurisdiction to investigate all aspects \n     of this issue--is sitting on the sidelines and effectively \n     abdicating its oversight responsibility to media \n     investigative reporters.\n\n  A year after Abu Ghraib, new revelations about the abuse committed by \nUnited States personnel are still being reported frequently. The \nmilitary has confirmed 28 acts of homicide committed against detainees \nin United States custody in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2002. Only one \nof these deaths took place at Abu Ghraib. The Red Cross has documented \nscores of abuses at United States facilities across Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand at the naval base at Guantanamo. FBI agents have reported ``torture \ntechniques'' at Guantanamo, including techniques that senior Pentagon \nofficials had specifically denied were being used.\n  Top officials in the administration have endorsed interrogation \nmethods we have condemned in other countries, including binding \nprisoners in painful stress positions, threatening them with dogs, \nextended sleep deprivation, and simulated drownings. The administration \nhas also increased the practice of rendering detainees to countries \nsuch as Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, countries the State Department \ncondemned in its most recent human rights reports because of their use \nof torture. The practice of rendition--described by a former CIA \nofficial as ``finding someone else to do your dirty work''--is a clear \nviolation of our treaty obligations under the Convention Against \nTorture.\n  We know many of these harsh techniques are no more effective at \nobtaining reliable information than traditional law enforcement \ntechniques. After considerable debate with the FBI, the military \nacknowledged its methods were no more successful during interrogations \nat Guantanamo Bay than the FBI's methods. General Miller, former \ncommander at Guantanamo, testified the Army Field Manual provided \nsufficient tools for intelligence gathering.\n  As Ambassador Negroponte, our Nation's new intelligence czar, said:\n\n       Not only is torture illegal and reprehensible, but even if \n     it were not so, I don't think it's an effective way of \n     producing useful information.\n\n  Stripped to its essence, torturing prisoners is morally wrong and \nunproductive. Yet political leaders made a deliberate decision to throw \nout the well-established legal framework that has long made America the \ngold standard for human rights throughout the world. The administration \nleft our soldiers, case officers, and intelligence agents in a fog of \nambiguity. They were told to take the gloves off without knowing what \nthe limits were.\n  In a series of secret memos and correspondence, some of which have \nstill not been provided to Congress, top level lawyers engaged in a \nwholesale rewriting of human rights laws. In rewriting our human rights \nlaws, the administration consistently overruled the objection of \nexperienced military personnel and diplomats.\n  As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned the White House:\n\n       It will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice \n     in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the \n     protections of the law of war for our troops.\n  Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the rules could \nlead to so-called ``force drift,'' in which, without clearer guidance, \nthe level of force applied to an uncooperative detainee might well \nresult in torture.\n  When leaders didn't like what they heard, they cut off the criticism. \nWhen Secretary Powell raised concerns about the decision not to apply \nthe Geneva Conventions to the conflict in Afghanistan, White House \nCounsel Gonzales cut him out of the process. When lawyers objected to \nthe radical views in the Bybee Torture Memorandum, Defense Department \nGeneral Counsel Haynes cut them out of the process and made the memo \nofficial policy for the entire military.\n  What happened here was not a reasoned response to 9/11--an objective \nreassessment of our rules and policies to account for the rise in \nterrorism. Instead, the leaders used 9/11 to undermine any constraints \non the power of the President, and the country has been paying a high \nprice for their arrogance ever since.\n  Dozens of administration memoranda involving post-9/11 detention and \ninterrogation have come to light in the past year. Yet, in not one of \nthese memos is there an appreciation of how well the existing rules \nserved the Nation in past conflicts. Not one of them explains why the \nArmy's interrogation manual, which discusses dozens of effective \ntechniques that comply with domestic and international law, no longer \nserves America's interests. Not one of them comments on how compliance \nwith the Geneva Conventions protects U.S. soldiers.\n  Clearly, the civilian lawyers in the Defense Department, the Justice \nDepartment, and the White House Counsel's office have been on an \nideological mission. Their goal was not to reassess the current rules \non detention and interrogation in light of the 9/11 attacks; their goal \nwas to destroy them and, to a large extent, they succeeded.\n  The military was set adrift from its longstanding rules and \ntraditions. The Bybee torture memorandum was eventually repudiated by \nthe Justice Department, but the Pentagon's Working Group Report of \nApril 2003, which incorporated the Bybee memorandum nearly verbatim, \nhas still not been explicitly superseded, and no new guidance has gone \nto the field.\n  Our men and women in the military are still not clear whether and to \nwhat extent they should consider themselves bound by the Convention \nAgainst Torture, the Federal law prohibiting torture, or even the \nprovisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that prohibit \ntorture and cruel treatment. The\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\nbasic validity of the military's ``golden rule''--treat captured enemy \nforces as we would want our own prisoners of war to be treated--is in \ndoubt.\n  The President has directed the military to treat detainees \n``humanely,'' but this directive has not provided adequate guidance to \nour troops. General Counsel Haynes himself advised Secretary Rumsfeld \nthat simulated drowning, forced nudity, the use of dogs to create \nstress, threats to kill a detainee's family, and other extreme tactics \nall qualified as ``humane.'' When the Pentagon's top civilian lawyer \nshows so little respect for human dignity, how can we expect more from \nour soldiers serving in the field?\n  As for the CIA, it was conspicuously excluded from the President's \ndirective on humane treatment. More recently, we have learned that the \nadministration does not believe that the prohibition against cruel, \ninhuman and degrading treatment applies to foreigners held by our \ngovernment agencies abroad. The CIA concealed detainees from the Army \nand the Red Cross. It continues to send dozens of detainees to \ncountries known to practice torture. It says it's conducting its own \ninvestigation into the abuses, but it refuses to provide a timetable or \nany preliminary findings. No agency should be above the law. The CIA \nmust answer for its activities.\n  Accountability for the torture scandal continues to be lacking.\n  We know about the prosecutions of the low-level, ``bad apple'' \nsoldiers involved in the abuse at Abu Ghraib. But prosecutions have \nbeen declined for other soldiers, including 17 implicated in the deaths \nof three prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not a single CIA official \nhas been charged, although one private contractor is awaiting trial for \nthe killing of a detainee in Afghanistan.\n  Even more disturbing, no action--criminal, administrative, or \notherwise--has been taken against the high civilian officials \nresponsible for the authorization of torture and mistreatment by U.S. \nofficials in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and elsewhere. We know \nabout the actions that have been taken against Charles Graner and \nLynndie England. But what about William Haynes, Alberto Gonzales, Jay \nBybee, John Yoo, David Addington, Douglas Feith?\n  These officials were warned of the consequences of undoing the rules \nbefore they changed them. They were informed of the objections to use \nof these harsh techniques. The FBI, the Naval Criminal Investigative \nService, and the British all refused to participate in interrogations \nbecause they had such grave concerns about the brutal methods. Finally, \none brave soldier, Joseph Darby, acknowledged that what was happening \nwas wrong.\n  Far from being held accountable, some of these officials have been \npromoted. Bybee, who signed the notorious Justice Department memorandum \nredefining torture, was confirmed to a lifetime judgeship on a Federal \nappellate court. Haynes, the general counsel who made the Bybee \nmemorandum official policy for the military, has been re-nominated for \nanother appellate judgeship. Gonzales now serves as the Nation's \nAttorney General.\n  Last weekend, the Army's Inspector General revealed he had exonerated \nalmost all of its top officers of any responsibility for abuse of \ndetainees at Abu Ghraib, even though one of them, Lieutenant General \nSanchez, explicitly approved the use of severe interrogation practices, \nand even though a review by former Secretary of Defense James \nSchlesinger found that General Sanchez and his deputy ``failed to \nensure proper staff oversight of'' the operations at Abu Ghraib.\n  What signal does this pattern of prosecutions for low-ranking \nsoldiers, exonerations for generals, and promotion for civilians send \nto our men and women in the Armed Services, and to our veterans?\n  The torture scandal is not going away on its own. Our Nation will \ncontinue to be harmed by the reports of abuse of detainees in U.S. \ncustody, the failure by top officials to take action, and the \nabandonment of our basic rules and traditions on human rights.\n  The scandal directly endangers U.S. soldiers and U.S. civilians \nabroad. We no longer demand that those we capture in the war on \nterrorism be treated as we treat prisoners of other wars. What will we \nsay to a country that justifies its torture of a U.S. soldier by citing \nour support for such treatment? How can we hold other nations \naccountable for their own human rights violations, when we continue to \nhold prisoners for years, without charging them or convicting them of \nanything?\n  The Nation's standing as a leader on human rights and respect for the \nrule of law has been severely undermined.\n  We cannot simply answer, as some have done, that the behavior is \nacceptable because terrorists do worse. By lowering our standards, we \nhave reduced our moral authority in the world. The torture scandal has \nclearly set back our effort in the war on terrorism. It is fueling the \ncurrent insurgency in Iraq. Even our closest allies, such as Great \nBritain, have raised objections to our treatment and rendition of \ndetainees.\n  Al-Qaida is still the gravest threat we face. The widespread \nperception that the U.S. condones torture only strengthens the ability \nof al-Qaida and others to create a backlash of hatred against America \naround the world. If we do not act to locate official responsibility \nfor Abu Ghraib, we will condone a new status quo in which our policy \ntoward torture is technically one of zero tolerance, while de facto our \nofficials tolerate and commit torture daily.\n  Many of us were struck by the rhetoric in President Bush's Inaugural \nAddress. ``From the day of our founding,'' he said, ``we have \nproclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and \ndignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker \nof Heaven and earth.'' Many of us would like to work with the President \nto develop a foreign policy that advances these important values. But \nrarely has the gulf between a President's rhetoric and his \nadministration's actions been so wide. It is simply not possible to \nreconcile his claim that ``America's belief in human dignity will guide \nour policies'' with the barbaric acts that have been committed in \nAmerica's name.\n  We must not allow inaction to undermine two bedrock principles of \nhuman rights law that we worked hard to establish at Nuremberg: that \nhigher officials cannot escape command responsibility and lower \nofficials cannot excuse their actions by claiming that they were ``just \nfollowing orders.''\n  It is time to come to terms with the continuing costs of the torture \nscandal, and respond effectively. We need to fully restore the Nation's \ncredibility and moral standing, so that we can more effectively pursue \nthe Nation's interests in the future.\n  First, we must acknowledge that the rule of law is not a luxury to be \nabandoned in time of war, or bent or circumvented at the whim and \nconvenience of the White House. It is a fundamental safeguard in our \ndemocracy and a continuing source of our country's strength throughout \nthe world.\n  Sadly, a recent National Defense Strategy policy contained this \nremarkable statement: ``Our strength as a nation state will continue to \nbe challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak using \ninternational fora, judicial processes, and terrorism.'' Who could have \nimagined that our Government would ever describe ``judicial processes'' \nas a challenge to our national security--much less mention it in the \nsame breath as terrorism? Such statements do not reflect traditional \nconservative values, and they are clearly inconsistent with the ideals \nthat America has always stood for here and around the world.\n  Second, we must acknowledge and apply the broad consensus that exists \nagainst torture and inhumane treatment.\n  Never before has torture been a Republican versus Democrat issue. \nInstead, it's always been an issue of broad consensus and ideals, \nreflecting the fundamental values of the Nation, and the ideals of the \nworld.\n  President Reagan signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988. The \nfirst President Bush and President Clinton supported its ratification. \nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by Senator Jesse Helms, \nvoted 10-0 in 1994 to recommend that the full Senate approve it. The \nClinton administration adopted a ``zero tolerance'' policy on torture. \nTorture became something that Americans of all political affiliations \nagreed never to do.\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n  And 9/11 didn't nullify this consensus. We did not resolve as a \nNation to set aside our values and the Constitution after those vicious \nattacks. We did not decide as a Nation to stoop to the level of the \nterrorists, and those who did deserve to be held fully accountable.\n  Americans continue to be united in the belief that an essential part \nof winning the war on terrorism and protecting the country for the \nfuture is safeguarding the ideals and values that America stands for at \nhome and around the world.\n  That includes the belief that torture is still beyond the pale. The \nvast majority of Americans strongly reject the cruel interrogation \ntactics used in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo--including the use of \npainful stress positions, sexual humiliation, threatening prisoners \nwith dogs, and shipping detainees to countries that practice torture. \nThe American people hold fast to our most fundamental values. It is \ntime for all branches of the Government to uphold those values as well. \nIt is clear beyond a doubt that we cannot trust this Republican \nCongress or this Republican administration to conduct the full \ninvestigation that should have been conducted long before now. We have \nhad enough whitewashes by the administration and Congressional \ncommittees.\n  Finally, to implement these values, we need a full and independent \ninvestigation of our current detention, rendition, and interrogation \npolicies, including an honest assessment of what went wrong in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and Guantanamo.\n  The investigation will require genuine candor and cooperation by all \nofficials and agencies in the Bush administration, full accountability, \na clear statement of respect for human rights, and a plan for \nprotecting those rights throughout the Government. Only a truly \nindependent and thorough investigation can restore America's reputation \nand put us back on the right path to the future.\n  The challenges we face in the post-9/11 world are obvious, and the \nstakes are very high. Working together, we have met such challenges \nbefore, and I am confident we can do so again. I urge all of my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to join to protect the rule of \nlaw, protect our soldiers serving abroad, and restore America's \nstanding in the world.\n  Mr. President, this has never been a partisan issue. We have a number \nof conventions on torture and other commitments that this Nation has \nmade under Republican Presidents and Republican leaders in the \nimportant committees of the Congress. We have had very clear leadership \nby Republicans and Democrats at other times in our history in terms of \nadhering to what they call the ``golden rule.'' The golden rule is \nbased on a very fundamental and important concept, which is we do not \nwant others to treat our soldiers harshly and, therefore, we will not \ntreat other soldiers harshly. The principal point underneath that is, \neven if we treated people harshly and went through the process of \ntorture, the information that you gain as a result of torture is rarely \nas good as what interrogators who are using and conforming to the \nGeneva Conventions get.\n  It is time for the United States to return to its better hours on \nthis issue, and it is time that we not hold the privates and corporals \naccountable. But after 9 investigations by the Defense Department \nwithout a single prosecution, after we have more than 20 individuals \nwho have actually been beaten or tortured to death and a determination \nby the administration that not a single person is going to face \ndiscipline, it is time that we take action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the regular order of business is the \nTransportation bill. We will proceed now. It is our desire to \ndiscourage people from coming down to the Senate floor until we have \nstarted receiving these amendments. There is no more important piece of \nlegislation that we will consider this year than the Transportation \nbill. I am prepared to go through it section by section. I will \ncertainly yield to the ranking minority member, Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chairman. I have a brief statement I would \nlike to put in.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, when you live in Vermont, you must \nendure a long, hard winter.\n  To keep spirits up, a Vermonter will look for signs of spring, \nsometimes in the most unlikely places.\n  One leading indicator of brighter days ahead is a phenomenon known as \nthe frost heave.\n  As temperatures rise, highways begin to buckle, producing humps in \nthe road that rattle your teeth and mangle your shocks. Highway workers \npost bright orange signs to warn drivers of upcoming frost heaves. To a \nVermonter, these signs are like the first flowers in bloom.\n  As the seasonal changes unfold, the frost heaves recede and the paved \nroads return to their more normal state. Unfortunately, that is often a \nstate of disrepair. Bridges share this sorry condition, due to effects \nof weather, wear and tear.\n  The cure is major maintenance, reconstruction or replacement. But \nthat costs money, a lot of money.\n  For more than the 3 years now, we have been working to reauthorize \nthe highway program--because our transportation challenges are many.\n  The bill before us is a good one, it may not include all the funding \nit deserves, but it does move us forward. This bill addresses many very \nimportant issues facing our roads and highways. Safety is my highest \npriority.\n  Last year, Vermont experienced the highest number of fatalities on \nits highways since 1998. Ninety-seven people died in automobile \ncrashes, up from 69 in 2003.\n  Nationally, we have made real progress on highway safety over the \nlast 10 years.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the rate of \nfatalities has declined from 1.9 to 1.5 deaths per million vehicle \nmiles traveled. But the number of fatalities has held steady at roughly \n42,000 per year. That number is unacceptable.\n  This bill is not only an investment in our highways, it is an \ninvestment in public safety.\n  And we know congestion in this country is bad and getting worse. \nCongestion costs Americans more than $69.5 billion annually in lost \ntime and productivity; 5.7 billion gallons of fuel are wasted each year \nwhile motorists sit in traffic.\n  One way to reduce congestion. is to move goods by freight and we are \nmoving more freight in this country than ever before.\n  The forecast for future demand is daunting, with U.S. DOT projecting \nthat the volume of freight will increase 70 percent by 2020.\n  This bill will expand freight capacity through new partnerships, \ninvestments and market financing techniques.\n  The highway program expired nearly 2 years ago, and the States have \nbeen operating under series of short-term extensions.\n  This has disrupted construction programs, delayed safety improvements \nand interrupted funding to transit operators.\n  It is time to act on this bill. The next sign of spring in Vermont \nafter the frost heave is something known as mud season. You can tell \nfrom the name that it's not a lot of fun.\n  Moving a highway bill over the coming weeks will feel at times like \nmud season but at the other end a brighter day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and certainly agree \nwith his remarks.\n  Once again, the ranking member and I request anyone who has \namendments to come down to the floor. We are open for amendments at \nthis time on this very significant piece of legislation.\n  Let me go through section by section and explain what we have in the \nbill.\n  Section 1203 is freight transportation gateways, freight intermodal \nconnections. I think it is important we realize--and we said this \nearlier this morning--back when the first legislation came to our \nattention--that was back during the Eisenhower administration--they \nwere talking about roads and highways. Now this has become intermodal, \nto take care of all the needs in transporting people and goods around \nthe country.\n  Freight movement in America is expected to grow dramatically in both \nvolume and value over the coming decades. Throughout reauthorization, \nthe\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nEnvironment and Public Works Committee heard concerns about inadequate \nfreight facilities, insufficient capacity, and inefficient connections.\n  In December 2003, the GAO released a report on freight transportation \nthat recommended strategies needed to address planning and financing \nlimitations. The report noted that the major challenges to freight \nmobility all shared a common theme--congestion--including overcrowded \nhighways and freight specific chokepoints. Additionally, the GAO \nreported two main limitations that stakeholders encounter in addressing \nthese challenges. They first related to the limited visibility that \nfreight projects receive in the planning and prioritization process. \nSAFETEA directly addresses this problem by creating a freight \ntransportation coordinator at the State level to facilitate public and \nprivate collaboration in developing solutions to freight transportation \nand freight gateway problems. The bill also ensures that intermodal \nfreight transportation needs are integrated into project development \nand planning processes.\n  The second limitation reported by the GAO was that Federal funding \nprograms tend to dedicate funds to a single mode of transportation or \nnonfreight purpose, thus limiting freight project eligibility among \nsome programs. SAFETEA, or the bill we have before us today, addresses \nthis problem by making intermodal freight projects eligible for STP and \nNHS funding.\n  The Freight Gateways Program under this bill promotes intermodal \nimprovements for freight movement through significant trade gateways, \nports, hubs, and intermodal connectors to the National Highway System. \nStates and localities are encouraged to adopt new financing strategies \nto leverage State, local, and private investments in freight \ntransportation gateways, thus maximizing the impact of each Federal \ndollar. The Freight Gateway Program is funded from a set-aside of 2 \npercent of each State's NHS proportions. However, in the spirit of \nState flexibility and ensuring that funds go to the areas of the \ngreatest need, a State is not required to spend 2 percent of the NHS \napportionment if they can certify to the Secretary that their \nintermodal connectors are adequate.\n  I think my colleagues see all throughout this bill that we are \ngranting more latitude for the States to determine their fate. It is a \nrecognition that the States know their needs better than we know them \nin most cases. Consequently, if they can do something better, why \ndictate something from the Federal Government when they are able to do \na better job themselves.\n\n  Section 1204 is construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal \nfacilities. TEA-21 established a discretionary program for the \nconstruction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities. This bill \ncreates a new permanent section in title 23 for this TEA-21 program. \nThe program is designed to provide for the important construction of \nferry boats, ferry terminals, and approaches to facilities that are \npart of the Nation's highway system and constitute ``last mile'' \nconnections for ferries.\n  Section 1205 is designation of interstate highways. As part of this \nbill, Interstate Highway 86 in the State of New York is specifically \ndesignated as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway in memory \nof our late colleague and friend who was not only a transportation \nsafety expert but served his country in the House and Senate for many \nyears.\n  It is important at this time to recognize that Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan was also the chairman of this committee that accomplished so \nmuch in the earlier years. And unbeknownst to most people on the \ncommittee, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was from my city of Tulsa, OK. So I \nam very supportive of this portion of the bill to make this designation \nfor him.\n  This section also designates a segment of Interstate Highway 86 near \ntowns of Painted Post and Corning in New York State as the Amo Houghton \nBypass in recognition of the former Congressman's work in making I-86 \npossible. It is interesting, we have a Democrat and Republican getting \nthese designations. It happens that I was elected in 1986 with Amo \nHoughton. He has made great contributions, and I am sure this is a very \nappropriate tribute to make to former Congressman Amo Houghton.\n  Section 1301, the Federal share. SAFETEA continues the statutory \nprovisions that lay out what the Federal share for a highway project \nwill be for different States based on the amount of Federal land within \nthe States. The Federal share provisions of the current law use a \nsliding scale which permits States with large portions of Federal land \nto match Federal funds with fewer State dollars. This is understandable \nbecause the Federal lands would consume a good portion of some States, \nStates such as New Mexico. Due to the decreasing taxing ability of \nStates with high percentages of Federal lands, these States are given \naccess to a higher Federal contribution for highway projects within \ntheir States.\n  The bill before us today modifies this provision slightly to simplify \nthe calculation used to determine the Federal share rates that apply to \neach individual State. I might add, in this respect, this is something \nwe found agreement with from both the States with large amounts of \nFederal land and States, such as my State of Oklahoma, that has a very \nsmall amount.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as we go through section by section, we \ntalked about congestion, but we neglected to elaborate because this is \none of the more serious problems we have now. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, time spent in congestion increased from \n31.7 percent in 1992 to 33.1 percent in 2000. Based on this rate, a \ntypical rush hour in an urbanized area is 5.3 hours a day. The problem \nis not simply in urban areas. Cities with populations less than 500,000 \nhave experienced the greatest growth in travel delays, according to the \nDOT.\n  Very often we do not talk enough about the cost. Right now we are \nsensitive to the cost of fuel. Yet we can see traffic stopped, with \nengines idling. This is another factor that has to be entered into the \nequation.\n  Increase in capital investment is one way to address congestion. We \nmust also consider ways to better manage existing systems. This bill \nproposes a national goal of real-time traffic information available for \nthe entire Nation. This goal, while ambitious, is important because we \nneed to reorient our thinking to recognize the importance of allowing \nusers of the system to utilize the system more efficiently, \nspecifically by providing travelers with usable information that will \nenable them to select the right travel alternative plans.\n  The biggest and fasting growing cause of congestion in our urban \ncenters is bottlenecks around port and intermodal facilities. Frankly, \ntraffic is expected to grow dramatically in volume in the coming \ndecades with increased international trade. Movement toward the just-\nin-time economy, freight shipping, will take on heightened importance.\n  Recently I visited with representatives of the Alameda Corridor \nTransportation Authority and they shared with me that more than 40 \npercent of all waterborne freight container traffic in the U.S. ports \nis handled by the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. My first thought \nwas, how does this trade through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long \nBeach affect my constituents in Oklahoma? The answer surprised me. It \nis estimated that over 100,000 jobs in Oklahoma are attributable to the \ntrade from these ports. That is one example of two ports. I suspect if \nI had statistics from other ports, I would find that economic \ndevelopment in Oklahoma is tied as closely to them, as well.\n  We are part of a global economy. This illustrates more than anything, \ngoods and services produced in Oklahoma are being shipped all over the \nworld. Likewise, Oklahomans are purchasing goods and services from \ncountries all over the world. The simple fact is that trade is the \nengine driving our economy. We cannot ignore the infrastructure needs.\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\n  It is worthwhile stating that one of the best kept secrets is we have \nactually a port that goes all the way to Oklahoma, the port of Catoosa \nin my hometown. I remember many years ago when I was serving in the \nState Senate when we were trying to get the message out that we \nactually are navigable, we have a port that comes all the way up. No \none knows it. They do not think about that in Oklahoma. It goes up the \nMississippi River from the gulf and comes across the Arkansas River and \ninto Oklahoma. At that time we decided we wanted to let people know of \nour great port and the navigation that cost billions of dollars to \nreach all the way to Oklahoma, the most inland port, only to find the \nway to do this is to demonstrate it. I actually arranged to take over \nfrom the Navy a very large World War II surplus submarine called the \nUSS Batfish.\n  All my political adversaries were saying, we will sink Inhofe with \nthis Batfish. It will never make it all the way to Oklahoma. We were \nable to bring it all the way. Now proudly displayed in Muskogee, OK, is \na World War II submarine that came all the way up the navigation \nroute. So I think it is important. I thought I would throw that out in \ncase somebody did not know it.\n\n  Section 1302 is the transfer of highway funds and transit funds. In \nan effort to provide flexible transportation funding, SAFETEA \nclarifies--by the way, SAFETEA is what we will refer to during the \nconsideration of this bill. This name could be subject to change when \nwe get to conference. But this bill clarifies that title 23 funds may \nbe transferred by the Secretary to the Federal Transit Authority for \nall projects except transit capital projects. It also allows States to \ntransfer their funds to another State or a Federal agency at their \nrequest, if the funds are used in the same manner and for the same \npurpose as they were originally authorized.\n  Section 1303 is the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Act, or TIFIA. This is very significant. We talked about it \na little bit earlier, that people come up with new ways of approaching \nthe funding for transportation, and ways that are innovative, ways that \nare partnering with the private sector, that can be much better than \nthe way we have been doing business for the last 40 years.\n  The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, TIFIA, \nwas established for the first time in TEA-21 to provide Federal credit \nassistance for major transportation investments. The TIFIA program has \nproven to be an innovative and successful addition to the conventional \ngrant-reimbursable highway program. Following the success of the TIFIA \nprogram under TEA-21, and considering input from stakeholders and \nrecommendations from the administration, the committee bill has made a \nfew changes to the TIFIA program to expand its scope and increase its \nusability.\n  The amount of the Federal credit assistance cannot exceed 33 percent \nof the total project costs. TIFIA offers three types of financial \nassistance for these large projects: first, direct loans; second, loan \nguarantees; and, third, standby lines of credit. The bill also lowers \nthe threshold cost for eligible projects from the TEA-21 level of $100 \nmillion to $50 million to make the TIFIA assistance accessible to a \ngreater number of large highway projects.\n  Projects are also eligible for TIFIA assistance when costs are \nanticipated to equal or exceed 20 percent of the Federal highway funds \napportioned to that particular State. With the increased emphasis this \nbill places on freight mobility, the definition of ``eligible freight-\nrelated projects'' is expanded to allow a group of freight-related \nprojects to be eligible, each of which individually might not meet the \nthreshold requirements for TIFIA credit assistance.\n  Section 1304 is facilitation of international registration plans and \ninternational fuel tax agreements. In response to issues surrounding \ncommerce from Mexico, SAFETEA gives the Secretary of Transportation \ndiscretion to provide financial assistance to States participating in \nthe International Registration Plan, the IRP, and the International \nFuel Tax Agreement. These States incur certain administrative costs \nresulting from their service as a home jurisdiction for motor carriers \nfrom Mexico.\n  The International Fuel Tax Agreement and the International Regional \nPlan are agreements among various U.S. States and Canadian provinces \nthat facilitate the efficient collection and distribution of fuel use \ntaxes and apportioned registration fees among each member jurisdiction. \nUnder both programs, each motor carrier designates its home State or \nprovince as the jurisdiction responsible for collecting fuel use taxes \nand fees.\n  Since the implementation of NAFTA, the Mexican Government imposes and \ncollects fuel taxes and registration fees differently from the United \nStates and Canada. The National Governors Association is currently \nevaluating Mexico and its participation in these two programs. In the \ninterim, Mexican motor carriers may use individual U.S. States or \nCanadian provinces as their home jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, I pause here to say to the majority leader and the \nminority leader, we appreciate very much our ability to go ahead and \nbring this bill to the floor. Again, we are asking Members, if they \nhave amendments, bring them down. We are eventually going to run out of \ntime, and we want to consider these amendments in a timely fashion. I \nthink we are pressing it right now. We are going to try very hard to \nhave this new bill passed before the expiration of the extension.\n  I might add, this is the sixth extension we have had, and it does \nexpire on May 31. We want an opportunity to be able to handle this \nlegislation so we will not have to ask for another extension.\n  It seems to me--and I have been asked a lot of questions as to what \nour timing looks like right now--we ought to be able to handle \namendments through the remainder of the week. Then we will go into a 1-\nweek recess. At the conclusion of that recess, on Monday, the 9th of \nMay, we will continue to look at amendments. It would be my intention \nto file a cloture motion so we can get to a final vote. Certainly, we \nhave had adequate time, and there does not seem to be that much \ninterest right now in coming down to the floor and offering amendments. \nThat would enable us to send this bill to conference sometime toward \nthe end of that week of May 9. Then we would get to the conference.\n\n  It has been our experience in the past that if it is done properly, \nwe ought to be able to get the conferees to agree to some compromises, \nif necessary, between the House bill and the Senate bill. They are \nquite different. We have explained the basic differences, and the \nphilosophy of the House, the philosophy of the Senate. Ours, I believe, \nis a more responsible way of looking at it. Having served 8 years in \nthe Transportation Committee over in the House, at that time that \nseemed to be something that was workable.\n  But we ultimately have to come to an agreement. We ultimately have to \ngo to conference and iron out the differences. We have a lot to \nconsider in conference. It is my expectation we will go to conference \nwith an amount that will exceed the current limitation of the bill that \nis before us today, that amount being $284 billion over the remainder \nof the 6-year period. However, I do not know that to be the case. If it \nis the case, then we will have to handle that in conference and make \nthat determination.\n  In conference, we are also going to have to be looking at the \napproach to a number of projects. You hear people talking quite often, \nsaying this is a big highway bill, there is a lot of pork in it. I tell \nyou, there is no pork in this bill. There are no projects in this bill. \nThere are only two projects in the entire bill, which consists of \nhundreds and hundreds of pages. Consequently, it is done on formula. We \nhave talked about the formula, all the considerations that are made by \nthe formula: the donee status, the donor status, the growth factors \nthat go into the various States, the densely populated States, the \nsparsely populated States. All make for a very equitable approach.\n  I believe we have a bill that will be able to be passed and sent to \nconference, and we will be able to come back from the conference and \nthen have it signed into law by the of May 31. If we do not do that, \nand if we ask for another extension, we will be at the time of year for \nthe peak construction season, which would merely mean we\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nwould lose very valuable time. I am sure in the States of Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, and other States, that is a very important \nconsideration.\n  With that, I anticipate there may be more Senators who wish to come \ndown and offer amendments. I am hoping they will at this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

PEYTON HEADY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nKentuckian who has done the important work of keeping a piece of the \nCommonwealth's history alive by chronicling the events of the county he \nis proud to call home, Union County.\n  Mr. Peyton Heady has written and published 25 books that cover some \naspect of the county's history. He has a particular interest in how \npeople from Union County were involved in the Civil War. One such story \ninvolves Tom Henry, a Union County native who managed to stop the \nnotorious outlaws, Frank and Jesse James from robbing a bank in \nMorganfield. Mr. Henry convinced the James brothers that he had friends \nwho had money in the bank and they wouldn't want to lose it. This story \ncould have been lost in the annals of history, but it won't be because \nof Peyton Heady's thorough research and documentation.\n  Another piece of Union County history that Mr. Heady has taken an \ninterest in is that of Camp Breckinridge. As a former clerk in the \ncivil engineering division at the camp during World War II, Mr. Heady \nhas first-hand experiences to share and draw from. Later this week he \nwill be honored by the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center, located on \nCamp Breckinridge property, for keeping a record of the history of Camp \nBreckinridge. The Center will name one of the camp administration \nbuildings the Peyton Heady Building.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving Mr. Heady the thanks of a \ngrateful Commonwealth and a grateful Nation. Thanks to his dedication, \nthe history of Kentucky shall be preserved. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record an article from The Henderson Gleaner \n``Making History: Chronicler of Union County Events Honored for Keeping \nMemories Alive,'' about Mr. Heady's contributions to his community.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Henderson Gleaner, Mar. 13, 2005]\n\n Making History: Chronicler of Union County Events Honored for Keeping \n                             Memories Alive\n\n                           (By Judy Jenkins)\n\n       Tom Henry was one of those bigger than life characters who \n     would, if he were alive today, be gracing the cover of \n     ``People'' magazine and artfully answering questions lobbed \n     at him by Larry King.\n       Tom was a handsome Union County native who served as a \n     captain in the Confederate army and, legend has it, managed \n     to earn the respect of those infamous outlaws Frank and Jesse \n     James. The James brothers spent a considerable amount of time \n     in Morganfield during the Civil War, and at one point Frank--\n     the story goes--was planning to rob a bank there.\n       Our hero Tom learned of those plans and convinced Frank to \n     forego the robbery by telling him that he had some good \n     friends who had money in that bank and he'd sure hate for \n     them to lose it.\n       On another, darker occasion, a Yankee colonel was captured \n     and tied to a tree. Apparently a couple of the captors were \n     planning a short future for the Northerner, but Tom informed \n     them they'd have to walk over his own dead body to harm the \n     colonel.\n       In a twist that Hollywood would love, Tom was captured and \n     after the war was taken to Louisville to stand trial for his \n     life. The Yankee colonel, by amazing coincidence, walked into \n     the courtroom, recognized Tom as the captain who saved his \n     life, and got the Union Countian released.\n       That's just one of the many accounts in Peyton Heady's 1985 \n     ``Union County History in the Civil War.'' The 252-page book \n     makes what could be dry, dusty descriptions of past events \n     come alive for the reader.\n       Peyton, who wrote the history because he was concerned that \n     little had been written about Union County's involvement in \n     the Civil War, noted that about 60 percent of the county's \n     population supported the Confederate cause and families were \n     often divided.\n       There were, for instance, the Lambert brothers who fought \n     in opposing armies, survived the war and never again spoke to \n     each other--but are buried side by side in a Union County \n     cemetery.\n       The book is one of 25 written and published by Peyton over \n     the decades, and they all cover some aspect of Union County \n     history. Some are genealogical volumes and some record the \n     county's cemeteries, including obscure resting places. While \n     surveying those cemeteries, the retired U.S. Postal Service \n     employee found the graves of seven Revolutionary War soldiers \n     with monuments intact.\n       Peyton, who was a clerk in the civil engineering division \n     at Camp Breckinridge during World War II, also wrote the \n     history of the sprawling camp that contained 36,000 acres, \n     had housing for 30,000 troops and 10,000 additional \n     personnel, boasted its own utility systems and airstrip, had \n     12 dispensaries and hospitals, nearly seven miles of \n     railroad, a simulated ``Japanese training village,'' four \n     movie theaters and much, much more.\n       Four divisions from that Army post fought in the Battle of \n     the Bulge, and the camp contributed a number of major units \n     that played a significant role in breaking down the Nazi \n     fortress.\n       It was at the camp that Peyton watched a young African \n     American soldier named Jackie Robinson play baseball, and it \n     was there he supervised 150 German prisoners of war.\n       For the price of a box of Cuban cigars, one of those \n     prisoners painted Peyton's portrait. The painting hangs in \n     the Morganfield home of Peyton and Cecilia, his wife of 53 \n     years and mother of their two children, James Heady and \n     Rebecca Heady Gough.\n       On April 28, Peyton no doubt will feel he's come full \n     circle in his life. On that day, one of the camp \n     administration facilities will be named the Peyton Heady \n     Building. The 11 a.m. dedication ceremony is part of the 40th \n     anniversary celebration of the Earle C. Clements Job Corps \n     Center, which is on the Camp Breckinridge property.\n       Peyton, 79, is being saluted largely for his determination \n     to keep the history of Camp Breckinridge from passing into \n     obscurity. He opted to undertake that history when he learned \n     that government archives contained a one- page description of \n     the giant complex that was last used as a military \n     installation in 1963.\n       He is touched by the upcoming honor, but he'll have you \n     know that the thousands of hours of patient research and \n     writing his books weren't for praise or glory. ``I just think \n     if you're going to live in a town and raise your children in \n     a town you should do something to make it better,'' he says.\n       Things he's done include working with Morganfield's Little \n     League program for more than two decades.\n       Peyton is on a walker now and doesn't often leave his home, \n     but he isn't complaining. ``I'm a happy man,'' he says. ``I'm \n     happy with my marriage (which naysayers said would never work \n     because Cecilia's Catholic and he's Methodist), happy with my \n     family and happy with my life.''\n       His histories have sold well and seven or eight have been \n     reprinted, but Peyton hasn't gotten rich from the sales.\n       ``I didn't write them for profit,'' he says. ``I wrote them \n     for history.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4252-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4252-S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LUTHER DEATON, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an accomplished \nKentuckian and good friend,\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\nMr. Luther Deaton, Jr. A native of Breathitt County, KY, Mr. Deaton is \nan esteemed banker, revered community leader, inspiring mentor, and \ncaring father.\n  Luther began his career in the banking industry as an assistant \nmanager and teller with Central Bank & Trust Co. in Lexington in 1978. \nLittle did he know that initial exposure would lead to a lifetime of \nprofessional achievements. Possessed with a resolute and unshakeable \ndetermination to advance his employer's cause, Luther rapidly rose \nthrough the company's ranks. In January 1996, the Board of Directors \npromoted Luther to president and CEO of Central Bank, and in March \n2002, he was named chairman of the bank. He also serves as the chairman \nof Commerce Lexington, Inc., which seeks to expand and attract economic \ndevelopment in central Kentucky.\n  While Central Bank has flourished under Luther, it is his leadership \npresence in central Kentucky I admire most. His formidable array of \naccomplishments directly results from his passion to improve the \nquality of life for his fellow Kentuckians. In September 1997, the \nLexington Theological Seminary named Luther as the second recipient of \nthe John R. Wooden Award, an honor given to layman whose life shows \ncommitment to, and active involvement in, a faith community and \nevidence of putting one's faith to work for the welfare of humankind. \nIn 2001, he was the recipient of the Governor's Economic Development \nLeadership Award for the State of Kentucky. Additionally, the Junior \nAchievement of the Bluegrass inducted Luther into the 2004 Bluegrass \nBusiness Hall of Fame, due to his labor and vision to improve the \nquality of life in the Bluegrass area.\n  Later this month, Luther will be the honoree at the Volunteers of \nAmerica Tribute Dinner in Lexington, KY. Here the community will have \nan opportunity to thank him for all of his contributions and honor his \nachievements.\n  Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and \nrecognizing one of Kentucky's pre-eminent professionals, Mr. Luther \nDeaton, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4253-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROSEMARY VITAVEC\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize several young \npeople who were recently selected by the American Automobile \nAssociation to receive special awards for their work as school safety \npatrollers.\n  More than 500,000 students in 50,000 schools across the country \nparticipate in AAA's School Safety Patrol program. These young people \nhave taken on the important responsibility of making the streets around \ntheir schools safer for their classmates. Though their responsibilities \nare often routine, the patrollers on occasion must place themselves in \nharm's way in order to save lives. It is my honor today to recognize \nsix students who were selected to receive the AAA Lifesaver Award for \ntheir selfless and heroic actions in fulfilling their duties as \npatrollers as well as the National Patroller of the Year.\n  The first AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Jessica Zeiter, a 10-year-\nold student at Huron Park Elementary School in Roseville, MI. On \nFebruary 9, 2004, Jessica was on a patrol when a pickup truck driver \nsped on icy snow in heavy traffic. The driver probably could not have \nstopped even if he had seen the small first grade student step into the \nstreet, but fortunately Jessica quickly grabbed the student by the coat \nand pulled her back to safety. Others who were at the crosswalk that \nday thought the child was going to be hit and were shocked that she was \nsaved.\n  The second AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Michelle Grimm, a 12-\nyear-old student at Weems Elementary School in Manassas, VA. On March \n5, 2004, a kindergarten student fell off of the sidewalk and was lying \ndirectly in the path of a school bus. The student was struggling to get \nup but could not regain his balance because of his heavy book bag. The \nbus driver did not see the child lying in the street, but Michelle ran \nto the student's aid, helping him out of the way of the approaching \nbus.\n  The third AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Estefan Santos, a 10-year-\nold student at Jackson Road Elementary School in Silver Spring, MD. On \nSeptember 10, 2004, a 6-year-old child broke free from his sister's \ncare and ran to cross the street towards her father who was waiting in \nhis car. Estefan realized that the 6-year-old was not going to stop at \nthe corner and held him back from the approaching traffic. Though \nbitten and kicked while holding the 6-year-old back, Estefan \nundoubtedly saved the child's life that day.\n  The fourth AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is also from Maryland. Her \nname is Pytrce Avonnia Farmer, and she is a student at Eva Turner \nElementary School in Waldorf. On October 4, 2004, a 6-year-old child \nwas waiting on the street curb under Pytrce's direction. The child's \nmother, however, moved her car forward into the second lane of traffic, \nand the child stepped into the street without noticing another car \napproaching. Pytrce acted quickly and bravely to pull the child from \nthe path of the car. The child's mother has said that her son would not \nbe alive today if not for Pytrce.\n  The fifth AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Jared Smith, an 11-year-\nold student at Combee Elementary School in Lakeland, FL. On January 7, \n2005, a 7-year-old student dashed past the group of children who were \nwaiting for a van to pick them up, darting out into the path of the \nvan. Fortunately, Jared stopped her before she was hit, though the van \nwas only a few feet away.\n  The sixth AAA Lifesaver Award recipient is Naomi Wall, an 11-year-old \nstudent at Dan Emmett Elementary School in Mount Vernon, OH. On March \n19, 2004, a 5-year-old student named Braden walked into the road, \nobeying a walk sign though against his sister Naomi's patrol flag \ntelling him to stop. At the same time, a car had run a red light and \nwas headed right for a car going through the intersection. Had Naomi \nnot held her brother back by the arm, he would have been in the middle \nof the crash.\n  In addition to honoring these six brave patrollers, AAA also \nrecognizes one student as National Patroller of the Year for \ndemonstrating leadership qualities, strong academic performance, and \ncivic involvement. This year, the National Patroller of the Year is \nDeanna Constantino, a fifth grader at Cross Street School in Williston \nPark, NY. Deanna is a member of the student council, serves on the \nschool newspaper, has been a Girl Scout for 4 years, and participates \nin charitable fundraising activities through her school. Deanna, like \nall the other safety patrollers recognized by AAA, is clearly an \nimpressive young person with tremendous potential.\n  I also thank AAA for making the school safety program possible. The \nprogram has helped save many lives over the years and has made our \nschools safer for our students, though, as the stories of the Lifesaver \nAward recipients demonstrate, the streets around our schools are not \nsafe enough. That is why I have worked for the last 2 years to create a \nnational Safe Routes to School program. This program would fund safety \nimprovements on roads near schools so that children\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\ncan safely walk or ride their bicycles to school. I hope Congress \npasses my program this year, but whether or not it does, I am comforted \nto know that 500,000 AAA patrollers across the Nation will be working \nhard to keep the streets around our schools safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4254-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke on the floor last week to briefly \nrecount some of the many reasons that Vermont and the Nation will miss \nthe leadership, the independence and the decency of Senator Jim \nJeffords when he chooses to retire from the Senate at the end of his \ncurrent term.\n  Since then there have been many news articles and editorials that \nhave also catalogued and described various aspects of Jim Jeffords' \ndistinguished legacy. As is often the case when he writes about the \nevents and issues of the day, Emerson Lynn, the publisher of the St. \nAlbans Messenger in my home State of Vermont, did this particularly \nwell. I would like to share his editorial with the members of the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Emerson Lynn's recent editorial about \nSenator Jeffords be printed in the Record\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the St. Albans Messenger, Apr. 21, 2005]\n\n           Jeffords Leaves Before His Time, Accomplishes Much\n\n       Senator Jim Jeffords, who turned Washington's political \n     world upside down 4 years ago with his defection from the \n     Republican Party, Wednesday turned Vermont's political world \n     upside down with his announcement not to seek reelection.\n       He said it was time to begin a new chapter in a life that \n     for 38 years has been dominated by an election cycle that \n     began as a state senator from Rutland in 1967, to Attorney \n     General in 1969, to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974 \n     to the United States Senate in 1988. He has represented \n     Vermont in one office or another for almost four decades. If \n     that is a chapter, most our lives can be explained in a \n     paragraph.\n       Wednesday's announcement was the sad affirmation of what \n     many of those close to the Senator had feared: his health is \n     less than optimum and his wife, Liz, is battling cancer and \n     about to undergo a third round of chemotherapy. At some point \n     the question is more akin to the clap of thunder to our \n     better senses: is being senator worth one's health; is it \n     worth not being able to pay the proper attention to one's \n     wife who is battling cancer, and, is the twilight of one's \n     life best spent with one's children, and an expected \n     grandchild, or with the churlish likes of Tom DeLay and the \n     hard right that have stolen a sense of civility and class \n     from the Senate? For anyone not suffering from the hubris \n     that often comes attached to the position, the choice is \n     clear and Jim Jeffords made that choice with grace and \n     perspective.\n       He also did the honorable thing politically. He announced \n     his retirement with sufficient time for both parties to give \n     thoughtful consideration as to how to approach the November \n     2006 race. He could have waited. He didn't, and in so doing \n     reinforced the integrity that has characterized his career.\n       And his has been a remarkable career. The history books \n     will undoubtedly begin their biographies noting the impact of \n     his May, 2001 decision to bolt from a Republican party he \n     said had left its moorings. But the senator's accomplishments \n     extend far beyond one's party allegiance. As Vermont's \n     attorney general he played a pivotal role in the \n     implementation of Act 250, and the law to outlaw billboards. \n     No Vermont politician has had a greater impact on dairy \n     farming, nor does any politician have a better understanding \n     of the industry and its needs. There isn't a single bit of \n     legislation dealing with special education [or education in \n     general] that doesn't have his fingerprints on it in one \n     fashion or another. The same can be said of his years in the \n     Senate when dealing with the environment. He was also a \n     passionate defender of the arts. What he has accomplished \n     will endure beyond fame's notoriously short life.\n       It's axiomatic that this was not the choreographed \n     conclusion of his choosing. His desire was to win reelection \n     as an independent, thereby vindicating a personally wrenching \n     decision to leave the Republican Party. Life's bows cannot be \n     so neatly tied and those who try find them but ropes of sand \n     that disintegrate in the twisting.\n       Sadly, we are in an age that exploits one's natural \n     fissures as though they were fatal flaws of one's character. \n     One's vulnerabilities are extrapolated into insurmountable \n     deficiencies, as if there were only sun and no shadows, all \n     light, no darkness. The senator knows only too well how that \n     game is played. The Yale/Harvard educated man will be known \n     more for a twisted tongue than a clear mind, as if being \n     articulate were a higher calling than being thoughtful.\n       In the end, it's not what others think of you but the joy \n     you carry in your toil. And, in the end, it is Mr. Jeffords \n     that wears the smile, not his accusers. He is like Sisyphus \n     in Albert Camus' ``Myth of Sisyphus'', the character in Greek \n     mythology who was condemned for eternity to roll a boulder up \n     a hill, only to have it roll back down again. Camus made the \n     convincing argument that Sisyphus' lot was not tragic, but \n     uplifting. He could smile at the absurd because he understood \n     it as such.\n       Camus concluded by writing: ``I leave Sisyphus at the foot \n     of the mountain! One I always finds one's burden again. But \n     Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods \n     and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This \n     universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither \n     sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral \n     flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. \n     The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a \n     man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.''\n       We imagine Mr. Jeffords' heart is full and that he is \n     happy. He should be remembered as such.\n       The clamor to claim his political perch has begun and din, \n     at times, will overwhelm. What Vermonters can hope for is \n     that all followers choose Mr. Jeffords' path of integrity and \n     independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4254-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncommemorate April 24, 2005, the 90th anniversary of the beginning of \nthe Armenian Genocide and to urge all Americans to join together to \nensure that these crimes never happen again.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began arresting hundreds of \nArmenian intellectuals, most of whom were subsequently executed. What \nsoon followed can only be described as a tragedy that shocked the human \nconscience: by some estimates, over a million Armenians were killed, \nand another 500,000 were driven from their homes. These events marked \nthe 20th century's first experience with such atrocities, and, sadly, \nthey would not be the last.\n  Maya Angelou, the famous poet and civil rights activist once said:\n\n       History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but \n     if faced with courage, need not be lived again.\n\n  Indeed it is our duty to remember this horrific tragedy, and face the \ncrimes of humanity with unflinching determination, courage, and moral \nfortitude so that they never happen again.\n  As a country founded on the principles of justice, equality, and \nliberty, the United States must take a leadership role in preventing \ngenocide.\n  I am proud that the Armenian American community in my home State of \nCalifornia--over 500,000 strong--has taken such a leadership role in \nensuring that the U.S. lives up to its values by acknowledging the \ncrimes of the past and taking action against the crimes of the present \nand future. Their determination and perseverance is a testament to the \nhuman spirit and the ability to overcome injustice and build a better \ntomorrow.\n  Today, we stand with the Armenian American community in commemorating \nthe start of the Armenian Genocide, and together we stand with those \naround the world who face persecution and even death simply because of \nwho they are. They must know they are not alone and those who commit \nthese crimes must know we are watching.\n  We will never forget the Armenian Genocide as we look to the future \nwith courage and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4254-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4254-S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL REFUSAL CLAUSE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Federal refusal clause. The \nRepublican leadership was wrong to include such a broad refusal clause \nin the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The clause was \nnever voted on by the Senate Appropriations Committee; it was inserted \ninto the bill behind closed doors.\n  The clause would allow health care firms to refuse to comply with \nexisting Federal, State, and local laws and regulations that pertain to \nabortion services, counseling, and referrals.\n  Supporters of the clause claim it simply clarifies existing law. But \nfar from clarifying it, sweeping new changes would be enacted that \nwould be devastating to women's health.\n  The reality is that no Federal law forces individuals to provide \nabortion care. The Church amendment, adopted in 1973, enacted a new \nrefusal clause. It explicitly protects individuals who object to \nproviding abortion because of their religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions. Broader refusal clauses, such as\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nthe Federal refusal clause, exempt a wide range of organizations, \nincluding health plans and hospitals, most of which not only have a \nsecular purpose but also employ and serve individuals who do not share \nthose organizations' religious beliefs.\n  The Federal refusal clause also discourages States from enforcing its \nown policies, laws and regulations to protect access to abortion \nservices and information. Republicans continually attack Democrats as \nproponents of big government who undermine State rights. Yet that is \nexactly what the Federal refusal clause does.\n  Forty-six States, including Massachusetts, already have laws that \npermit certain medical personnel, health facilities, and institutions \nto refuse to participate in abortion because of their moral or \nreligious beliefs.\n  We don't need the Federal refusal clause to protect individuals and \nhealth care organizations that oppose abortion, we already have that. \nIt exists in both Federal and State laws. Proponents want the Federal \nrefusal clause for one reason--to deny access and information to as \nmany women as possible.\n  Health care corporations now have the right to gag their doctors and \nother health care providers. The clause defines ``discrimination'' as \nany requirement that a medical service provider inform a woman about \nher option to seek an abortion--or even refer her to another plan for \nthat information. It's ridiculous to say that giving a woman full \ninformation about her medical options is discrimination.\n  The Federal refusal clause also restricts low-income women's access \nto abortion services, including information about abortion. It could \nprohibit the Federal Government from enforcing the requirement that \nTitle X funded family planning clinics provide a woman facing an \nunintended pregnancy with an abortion referral when she requests one. \nWe will be taking a giant step backward if we don't repeal this refusal \nclause.\n  In addition, under the ``Hyde Amendment,'' States are required to \nprovide Medicaid coverage for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or \nwhere pregnancy endangers a women's life. The Federal refusal clause, \nhowever, could prevent states from requiring that Medicaid HMOs provide \nor pay for these abortions.\n  Current law states that low-income women should not be denied \ncritical medical care. Why do we want to change that? What kind of \nsignal are we sending? Women who have suffered through the trauma of \nrape or incest deserve our help, not an extra burden.\n  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act guarantees that \na woman who needs an emergency abortion procedure to save her life \nwon't be turned away. Yet the Federal refusal clause could allow \nhospitals to turn away women in these dire circumstances. For a woman \nin a rural area, with only one hospital, her life itself may be in \ndanger if the hospital refuses to admit her.\n  It is wrong to deny women access to necessary and urgently needed \nmedical procedures. The Federal refusal clause should never have been \nincluded in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, and I \ncommend Senator Boxer for speaking against this provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4255-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            JUST BORN, INC.\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I would like to \ncongratulate Just Born, Inc. in Bethlehem, PA, on an outstanding \naccomplishment, shipping Peanut Chews nationwide for the first time. \nPennsylvanians should be honored to have a wonderful company such as \nJust Born in our State, and I join in congratulating Just Born on their \nrecent accomplishment.\n  Until the Spring of 2003, Peanut Chews were produced by the \nGoldenberg Candy Company. The Goldenberg Candy Company was founded in \nPhiladelphia in 1890 by David Goldenberg and called D. Goldenberg, Inc. \nBeginning as a retail confection business, which produced and sold \nfudge, marshmallow, lollipops, and chocolates, Goldenberg's also \ncreated a walnut molasses confection that later became the foundation \nfor the Peanut Chews recipe.\n  As we all know, Peanut Chews offer a unique combination of a chewy \npeanut and molasses based center with a dark chocolate coating, making \nfor a tasty candy. Just stop by my desk on the Senate floor to see for \nyourself.\n  Peanut Chews were developed during World War I and used by the U.S. \nmilitary as a ration bar. The high energy, high protein recipe and \nunique taste made it popular with the troops. Following the war, Peanut \nChews were first sold in the Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania. \nHowever, their popularity soon spread to New York, Baltimore, and \nWashington, DC.\n  In the 1930s, Peanut Chews were sold under the brand name Chew-ets \nand were often sold in movie theaters. The name stuck until 1999 when \nthe Goldenberg's changed the packaging and the name of Chew-ets to Milk \nChocolatey Peanut Chews.\n  Just Born purchased the Goldenberg Candy Company in 2003, adding the \nGoldenberg's 61 associates to the already growing Just Born family. \nJust Born produces two million Peanut Chews candy pieces every day.\n  This month, April 2005, Peanut Chews will be launched nationally, for \nthe first time reaching beyond to the East Coast. This is quite an \nachievement, and I send Just Born my best wishes in the future as their \ncompany continues to expand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4255-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4255-S4256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ONCOLOGY NURSING DAY AND MONTH\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \noncology nurses. May 1 marks the beginning of the 10th annual Oncology \nNursing Day and Month and this year marks the 30th Anniversary of the \nOncology Nursing Society.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I know oncology nurses \nplay an important and essential role in providing quality cancer care. \nThese nurses are principally involved in the administration and \nmonitoring of chemotherapy and the associated side effects patients \nexperience. As anyone ever treated for cancer will tell you, oncology \nnurses are intelligent, well-trained, highly skilled, kind-hearted \nangels who provide quality clinical, psychosocial, and supportive care \nto patients and their families. In short, they are integral to our \nNation's cancer care delivery system.\n  I congratulate the Oncology Nursing Society, ONS, on its 30th \nanniversary. ONS is the largest organization of oncology health \nprofessionals in the world, with more than 31,000 registered nurses and \nother health care professionals. Since 1975, ONS has been dedicated to \nexcellence in patient care, teaching, research, administration, and \neducation in the field of oncology. The society's mission is to promote \nexcellence in oncology nursing and quality cancer care. To that end, \nONS honors and maintains nursing's historical and essential commitment \nto advocate for the public good by providing nurses and health care \nprofessionals with access to the highest quality educational programs, \ncancer-care resources, research opportunities and networks for peer \nsupport. ONS has three chapters in my home State of Kansas, which help \noncology nurses provide high-quality cancer care to patients and their \nfamilies in our State.\n  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted, and chronic disease, and people \nwith cancer are best served by a multidisciplinary health care team \nspecialized in oncology care, including nurses who are certified in \nthat specialty. Each year, in the United States, approximately 1.37 \nmillion people are diagnosed with cancer, another 570,000 lose their \nbattles with this terrible disease, and more than 8 million Americans \ncount themselves among a growing community known as cancer survivors. \nEvery day, oncology nurses see the pain and suffering caused by cancer \nand understand the physical, emotional, and financial challenges that \npeople with cancer face throughout their diagnosis and treatment.\n  Over the last 10 years, the setting where treatment for cancer is \nprovided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all \ncancer patients receive care in community settings, including cancer \ncenters, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. \nTreatment regimens are as complex, if not more so, than regimens\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\ngiven in the inpatient setting a few short years ago. Oncology nurses \nare involved in the care of a cancer patient from the beginning through \nthe end of treatment, and they are the front line providers of care by \nadministering chemotherapy, managing patient therapies and side \neffects, working with insurance companies to ensure that patients \nreceive the appropriate treatment, provide counseling to patients and \nfamily members, in addition to many other daily acts on behalf of \ncancer patients.\n  I thank all oncology nurses for their dedication to our Nation's \ncancer patients, and commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of \nits efforts and leadership over the last 30 years. They have \ncontributed immensely to the quality and accessibility of care for all \ncancer patients and their families, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthem in their important endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4256-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DANVILLE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President. I rise today in recognition of \nRachel Simon and her extraordinary book, Riding the Bus with my Sister. \nThe book chronicles the time her developmentally disabled sister Beth \nspends riding the bus. It brings to light the world of adults with \ndevelopmental disabilities, finds unlikely heroes in everyday life, and \ndiscovers unrealized inner strength.\n  Rachel Simon was born in 1959 in Newark, NJ, the second of four \nchildren. Her family moved around New Jersey and Pennsylvania several \ntimes when she was a child, and Rachel, who was always a very social, \ncreative person, wrote mountains of letters to keep up with all her \ndistant friends. She also wrote short stories, novels, and plays, which \nshe enjoyed sharing with others.\n  Rachel graduated from Solebury School, a boarding school in New Hope, \nPA, in 1977. She then went on to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. \nDuring her years in college, she discovered the secrets of discipline \nand time management. She was also captivated by her courses in \nanthropology and graduated in 1981.\n  After college, Rachel moved to Philadelphia, where she spent the next \n5 years at a variety of jobs, including paralegal, administrative \nassistant, and research supervisor for a television study. At 26, she \nentered a graduate program in creative writing.\n  In the next several years, Rachel wrote the story collection Little \nNightmares, Little Dreams and the novel The Magic Touch. From her house \nin Abington, PA, she began teaching private classes in creative \nwriting. In 1995, Rachel took a job running events at the Barnes & \nNoble in Princeton, NJ, and eventually moving to that area.\n  Around that time, Rachel also began writing commentary for the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer and teaching at Bryn Mawr College, in addition to \ncontinuing with her private classes. In 1997, she published The \nWriter's Survival Guide and then worked on some long pieces of fiction.\n  As readers of Riding the Bus with my Sister know, Rachel's life \nchanged when she wrote an article about her sister Beth's unusual \nlifestyle of riding the buses in the city where she lives. Over the \ncourse of riding with Beth for the next year, Rachel came to leave most \nof her jobs behind, found her way back to her sister, and rediscovered \nher friendships.\n  In May 2005, Riding the Bus with my Sister will be televised as a \nHallmark Hall of Fame movie on CBS. Rosie O'Donnell is starring as \nBeth, Andie MacDowell is starring as Rachel, and Anjelica Huston is \ndirecting.\n  Both Rachel and her sister Beth are amazing women, and I rise today \nto honor them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4256-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:25 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6.

A bill to reinstate the Federal Communications Commission's \nrules for the description of video programming; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Television \nInformation-Enhancement for the Visually Impaired (TIVI) Act of 2005. \nThis bill would require television broadcasters, during at least 50 \nhours of their prime time or children's programming every quarter, to \ninsert verbal descriptions of actions or settings not contained in the \nnormal audio track of a program. This can be accomplished through \ntechnology commonly referred to as ``video description services,'' \nwhich allows television programming to be more accessible and enjoyable \nfor the visually impaired.\n  This bill is necessary due to a 2002 decision by District of Columbia \nCircuit Court of Appeals. In 2000, the Federal Communications \nCommission (``FCC'' or ``Commission''), recognizing the need to make \ntelevision programming accessible to the visually impaired, promulgated \nrules that mandated television broadcast stations and their affiliates, \nwhich met certain market requirements, provide 50 hours of video \ndescriptions during prime time or children's programming every calendar \nquarter. Television programmers challenged the Commission's authority \nto promulgate such rules. The Circuit Court held that the Commission \ndid not have authority to issue the regulations.\n  This bill would provide the Commission the authority to promulgate \nsuch regulations and reinstate the FCC's video description rules issued \nin 2000. Additionally, the bill would require the FCC to consider \nwhether it is economically and technically feasible and consistent with \nthe public interest to include ``accessible information'' in its video \ndescription rules, which may include written information displayed on a \nscreen, hazardous warnings and other emergency information, and local \nand national news bulletins.\n  Since the spectrum that television broadcasters utilize is a public \nasset, one would expect that programming over the public airwaves is \naccessible to all Americans. Unfortunately, that is not the case today \nand that is why we must pass the TIVI Act. I sincerely hope that \ntelevision broadcasters will work with us to provide video descriptions \nfor individuals with visual disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 904. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1560 Union Valley Road in West Milford, New Jersey, \nas the ``Brian P. Parrello Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nremember Lance Cpl Brian P. Parrello, a resident of West Milford, NJ, \nwho died January 1, 2005, while serving with the U.S. Marines in Iraq. \nI was privileged to attend this brave young man's funeral in West \nMilford on January 8, 2005, and I was moved by the outpouring of grief \nfor LCpl Parrello.\n  In honor of this young Marine's life, I have introduced a bill to \nrename the facility at 1560 Union Valley Road in West Milford, NJ as \nthe ``Brian P. Parrello Post Office Building.'' Senator Corzine is a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  I would like to note that the renaming of this postal facility as the \n``Brian P. Parrello Post Office Building'' was initiated by the West \nMilford Township Council, who wished to honor LCpl Parrello in this \nway. This is especially fitting since LCpl Parrello's father, Nino \nParrello, is a letter carrier in West Milford. I am proud to be able to \nassist in the commemoration of his life by helping with the renaming \nprocess.\n  LCpl Parrello served in the Small Craft Company of the 2nd Marine \nDivision's II Marine Expeditionary Force, which was based at Camp \nLejeune, NC. During his service in Iraq, he was attached to a Marine \nSwift Boat unit that patrolled the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. He was \nkilled New Year's Day as a result of hostile action in Hadithah, \nnorthwest of Baghdad.\n  During his too-short life, LCpl Parrello made a lasting impression on \nthose around him. A graduate of West Milford High School in 2003, he \nwas an athlete who played hockey and football, and he was voted to have \n``Most School Spirit'' by his classmates. As those who knew him have \nattested, LCpl Parrello was a history buff who dreamed of becoming a \nhistory teacher.\n  LCpl Parrello's route to military service is the result of an \nadmirable choice. He felt such a sense of duty after the September 11 \nattacks that he delayed going to college, and instead he enlisted in \nthe Marines before his graduation from West Milford High School.\n  Tragically, LCpl Parrello died just a few days before his 19th \nbirthday. We can commemorate the life of this extraordinary young man \nby quickly passing this bill to rename the postal facility in his \nhometown after him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 904\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BRIAN P. PARRELLO POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 1560 Union Valley Road in West Milford, \n     New Jersey, shall be known and designated as the ``Brian P. \n     Parrello Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Brian P. Parrello Post Office \n     Building''.\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 905. A bill for the relief of Heilit Martinez; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private relief \nbill for Miss Heilit Martinez. As my colleagues know, private relief is \navailable in rare instances. I believe that the circumstances \nsurrounding Miss Martinez's case are extraordinary and merit the \nintroduction of private legislation. Therefore, I am pleased to \nintroduce this legislation today.\n  Miss Martinez was brought into the U.S. with her parents when she was \nabout two years of age and has lived in Utah since that time. It is \nimportant to note that Miss Martinez did not make the decision to enter \nthis country as a young child nor did she decide to overstay a visa, \nand she was led to believe that she had legal status. Miss Martinez was \nraised and educated in the United States and is currently a straight A \nstudent at Utah State University.\n  Last year, Miss Martinez and a group of her college friends traveled \ninto Mexico for a short day of sightseeing. When questioned at the port \nof entry, Miss Martinez declared that she had not been born in the \nUnited States but had legal immigration status. However, when she could \nnot produce legal documentation, it was discovered that Miss Martinez \nwas undocumented. She was detained for some days prior to her release.\n  For all intents and purposes, Miss Martinez does not have a country \nto which to return. The United States is her home. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the passage of this legislation to help Miss \nMartinez on the path of becoming a lawful, permanent resident.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 906. A bill to promote wildland firefighter safety; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Governor Gregoire has already declared a \ndrought in Washington State and I know my colleagues and I remain very \nconcerned about what appears to be yet another year of devastating \ndrought throughout the West, and the hazards this could pose in terms \nof increased fire risk and threats to public safety.\n  But today, I want to focus the majority of my comments on a topic \nthat I have focused on and hope my colleagues will pay close attention \nto as the 2005 fire season approaches. That's the issue of wildland \nfirefighter safety.\n  Many of my colleagues are probably aware of the fact that every \nsummer, we send thousands of our constituents--many of them brave young \nmen and women, college students on summer break--into harm's way to \nprotect our Nation's rural communities and public lands. These men and \nwomen serve our Nation bravely.\n  Since 1910, more than 900 wildland firefighters have lost their lives \nin the line of duty. These firefighters represented a mix of Federal \nand State employees, volunteers and independent contractors. And they \nlost their lives for an array of reasons. We all realize that fighting \nfires on our Nation's public lands is an inherently dangerous business. \nBut what we cannot and must not abide are the preventable deaths--\nlosing firefighters because rules were broken, policies ignored and no \none was held accountable.\n  A number of my colleagues will recall that, in 2001, this issue was \npushed to the fore in the State of Washington, because of a horrible \ntragedy. On July 10, 2001, near Winthrop in Okanogan County, in the \nmidst of the second worst drought in the history of our State, the \nThirtymile fire burned out of control.\n  Four courageous young firefighters were killed. Their names: Tom \nCraven, 30 years old; Karen FitzPatrick, 18; Jessica Johnson, 19; and \nDevin Weaver, 21.\n  Sadly, as subsequent investigations revealed, these young men and \nwomen did not have to die. In the words of the Forest Service's own \nreport on the Thirtymile fire, the tragedy ``could have been \nprevented.'' At that time, I said that I believe we in Congress and \nmanagement within the firefighting agencies have a responsibility to \nensure that no preventable tragedy like Thirtymile fire ever happened \nagain.\n  I would like to thank my colleague Senator Bingaman, the \ndistinguished Ranking Member of the Senate Energy Committee, as well as \nSenator Wyden, who was then chair of the Subcommittee on Public Lands \nand Forests. In the wake of the Thirtymile fire, they agreed to convene \nhearings on precisely what went wrong that tragic day. We heard from \nthe grief-stricken families.\n  In particular, the powerful testimony of Ken Weaver--the father of \none of the lost firefighters--put into focus precisely what's at stake \nwhen we send these men and women into harm's way.\n  I can think of no worse tragedy than a parent confronting the loss of \na child, especially when that loss could have been prevented by better \npractices on the part of federal agencies.\n  At the Senate Energy Committee hearing, we also discussed with \nexperts and the Forest Service itself ways in which we could improve \nthe agency's safety performance. And almost a year to the day after \nthose young people lost their lives, we passed a bill--ensuring an \nindependent review of tragic incidents such as Thirtymile that lead to \nunnecessary fatalities.\n  Based on subsequent briefings by the Forest Service, revisions to the \nagency's training and safety protocols, and what I've heard when I have \nvisited with firefighters over the past 2 years, I do believe the \ncourage of the Thirtymile families to stand up and demand change has \nhad a positive impact on the safety of the young men and women who are \npreparing to battle blazes as wildland firefighters.\n  Yet, I'm deeply saddened by the fact that it's clear we haven't done \nnearly enough. In July 2003--2 years after Thirtymile--two more \nfirefighters perished, this time at the Cramer fire within Idaho's \nSalmon-Challis National Forest. Jeff Allen and Shane Heath were killed \nwhen the fire burned over an area where they were attempting to \nconstruct a landing spot for firefighting helicopters.\n  After the Thirtymile fire, however, I told the Weavers and the \nCravens, the families of Karen FitzPatrick and Jessica Johnson that I \nbelieved we owed it to their children to identify the causes and learn \nfrom the mistakes that were made in the Okanogan, to make wildland \nfirefighting safer for those who would follow. That is why the findings \nassociated with the Cramer fire simply boggle my mind.\n  We learned at Thirtymile that all ten of the agencies' Standing Fire \nOrders and many of the 18 Watch Out Situations--the most basic safety \nrules--were violated or disregarded. The same thing happened at Cramer, \nwhere Heath and Allen lost their lives 2 years later.\n  After the Thirtymile Fire, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) conducted an investigation and levied against the \nForest Service five citations for Serious and Willful violations of \nsafety rules. It was eerie, then, when just in March 2004 OSHA \nconcluded its investigation of Cramer. The result: another five OSHA \ncitations, for Serious, Willful and Repeat violations.\n  Reading through the list of causal and contributing factors for \nCramer and putting them next to those associated with the Thirtymile \nfire, my colleagues would be struck by the many disturbing \nsimilarities. Even more haunting are the parallels between these lists \nand the factors cited in the investigation of 1994's South Canyon Fire \non Storm King Mountain in Colorado.\n  It's been more than a decade since those 14 firefighters lost their \nlives on Storm King Mountain--and yet, the same mistakes are being made \nover and over again.\n  These facts have also been documented by an audit and memorandum \nissued last September by the Department of Agriculture's Inspector \nGeneral. The IG found that ``accidents on the South Canyon, Thirtymile, \nand Cramer Fires, all of which involved fatalities, could have been \navoided if certain individuals had followed standard safety practices \nand procedures in place at the time.''\n  The IG also noted that the Forest Service ``has not timely \nimplemented actions to improve its safety programs.'' Some 27 of 81 \naction items identified as a result of the Storm King and Thirtymile \nFires--or roughly a third--had not been fully implemented years later. \nWhile I know that the IG is monitoring implementation of some of these \nitems, the stark similarities between Storm King, Thirtymile, and\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nCramer make it seem positively astounding that the Forest Service still \nfinds my bill ``not necessary.''\n  I don't believe that's acceptable. The firefighters we send into \nharm's way this year--and the ones we've already lost--deserve better.\n  Training, leadership and management problems have been cited in all \nof the incidents I've discussed. Frankly, I have believed since the \nThirtymile tragedy that the Forest Service has on its hands a cultural \nproblem. What can we do, from the legislative branch, to provide this \nagency with enough motivation to change? I believe the first step we \ncan take is to equip ourselves with improved oversight tools, so these \nagencies know that Congress is paying attention. Today I'm re-\nintroducing legislation--the Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2005--\nthat would do just that.\n  I believe this is a modest yet important proposal. It was already \npassed once by the Senate, as an amendment to the 2003 Healthy Forests \nlegislation. However, I was disappointed that it was not included in \nthe conference version of the bill. But it is absolutely clear to me--\nparticularly in light of OSHA's review of the Cramer Fire--that these \nprovisions are needed now more than ever.\n  First, the Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2005 will require the \nSecretaries of Agriculture and Interior to track the funds the agencies \nexpend for firefighter safety and training.\n  Today, these sums are lumped into the agencies' ``wildfire \npreparedness'' account. But as I have discussed with various officials \nin hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nit is difficult for Congress to play its rightful oversight role--\nensuring that these programs are funded in times of wildfire emergency, \nand measuring the agencies' commitment to these programs over time--\nwithout a separate break-down of these funds.\n  Second, it will require the Secretaries to report to Congress \nannually on the implementation and effectiveness of its safety and \ntraining programs.\n  Congress has the responsibility to ensure needed reforms are \nimplemented. As such, I believe that Congress and the agencies alike \nwould benefit from an annual check-in on these programs. I would also \nhope that this would serve as a vehicle for an ongoing and healthy \ndialogue between the Senate and agencies on these issues.\n  Third, my bill would stipulate that federal contracts with private \nfirefighting crews require training consistent with the training of \nfederal wildland firefighters. It would also direct those agencies to \nmonitor compliance with this requirement.\n  This is important not just for the private contractor employees' \nthemselves--but for the Federal, State and tribal employees who stand \nshoulder-to-shoulder with them on the fire line.\n  The Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of 2005 is a modest beginning in \naddressing the challenges posed by integrating private and federal \ncontract crews--and doing it in a manner that maximizes everyone's \nsafety on the fire line.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this simple legislation. \nUltimately, the safety of our Federal firefighters is a critical \ncomponent of how well prepared our agencies are to deal with the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire.\n  Congress owes it to the families of those brave firefighters we send \ninto harm's way to provide oversight of these safety and training \nprograms.\n  We owe it to our Federal wildland firefighters, their families and \ntheir State partners--and to future wildland firefighters.\n  My bill will provide this body with the additional tools it needs to \ndo the job.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 908.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 908\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Commonsense Consumption \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n         (1) the food and beverage industries are a significant \n     part of our national economy;\n         (2) the activities of manufacturers and sellers of foods \n     and beverages substantially affect interstate and foreign \n     commerce;\n         (3) a person's weight gain, obesity, or a health \n     condition associated with a person's weight gain or obesity \n     is based on a multitude of factors, including genetic factors \n     and the lifestyle and physical fitness decisions of \n     individuals, such that a person's weight gain, obesity, or a \n     health condition associated with a person's weight gain or \n     obesity cannot be attributed solely to the consumption of any \n     specific food or beverage; and\n         (4) because fostering a culture of acceptance of personal \n     responsibility is one of the most important ways to promote a \n     healthier society, lawsuits seeking to blame individual food \n     and beverage providers for a person's weight gain, obesity, \n     or a health condition associated with a person's weight gain \n     or obesity are not only legally frivolous and economically \n     damaging, but also harmful to a healthy America.\n         (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allow \n     Congress, State legislatures, and regulatory agencies to \n     determine appropriate laws, rules, and regulations to address \n     the problems of weight gain, obesity, and health conditions \n     associated with weight gain or obesity.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS.\n\n         (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may \n     not be brought in any Federal or State court.\n         (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil \n     liability action that is pending on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act shall be dismissed immediately by the court in \n     which the action was brought or is currently pending.\n         (c) Discovery.--\n         (1) Stay.--In any action that is allegedly of the type \n     described in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability of \n     any kind based on accumulative acts of consumption of a \n     qualified product, the obligation of any party or non-party \n     to make disclosures of any kind under any applicable rule or \n     order, or to respond to discovery requests of any kind, as \n     well as all proceedings unrelated to a motion to dismiss, \n     shall be stayed prior to the time for filing a motion to \n     dismiss and during the pendency of any such motion, unless \n     the court finds upon motion of any party that a response to a \n     particularized discovery request is necessary to preserve \n     evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.\n         (2) Responsibility of parties.--During the pendency of \n     any stay of discovery under paragraph (1), the \n     responsibilities of the parties with regard to the treatment \n     of all documents, data compilations (including electronically \n     recorded or stored data), and tangible objects shall be \n     governed by applicable Federal or State rules of civil \n     procedure. A party aggrieved by the failure of an opposing \n     party to comply with this paragraph shall have the applicable \n     remedies made available by such applicable rules, provided \n     that no remedy shall be afforded that conflicts with the \n     terms of paragraph (1).\n         (d) Pleadings.--In any action that is allegedly of the \n     type described in section 4(5)(B) seeking to impose liability \n     of any kind based on accumulative acts of consumption of a \n     qualified product, the complaint initiating such action shall \n     state with particularity--\n         (1) each element of the cause of action;\n         (2) the Federal and State statutes or other laws that \n     were allegedly violated;\n         (3) the specific facts alleged to constitute the claimed \n     violation of law; and\n         (4) the specific facts alleged to have caused the claimed \n     injury.\n         (e) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this Act shall \n     be construed to create a public or private cause of action or \n     remedy.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to expand eligibility for governmental markers for \nmarked graves of veterans at private cemeteries; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nrestore the rights of all veterans and their families to receive an \nofficial grave marker of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This \nlegislation addresses an unfortunate inequity that exists for veterans \nwho passed away during the period between November 1, 1990 and \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  It may come as a shock to my colleagues to learn that while all other \nveterans are entitled to the VA's official grave markers, current law \nforbids veterans who passed away during this eleven year period from \nbeing so honored.\n  This situation is unacceptable and must be remedied.\n  Nearly one year ago today, the National World War II Memorial was \nunveiled to the public. Countless Americans who have passed its 50 \nstone pillars since that time have been reminded of the courage and \nsacrifice of the men and women who served our country. at its time of \ngreatest need.\n  But as Senator Bob Dole stated at its dedication ceremony, the World \nWar II Memorial is not a tribute to war and conflict. Rather, he said, \n``it's a tribute to the physical and moral courage that makes heroes \nout of farm and city boys and that inspires Americans in every \ngeneration to lay down their lives for people they will never meet, for \nideals that make life itself worth living.''\n  Indeed, monuments like the World War II Memorial serve as a reminder \nof the service, sacrifice and dedication of our veterans. The 4,000 \nstars resting on the Wall of Freedom remind us that too many paid the \nultimate price.\n  Many Americans have a similar experience when they visit the grave of \na former veteran--often a friend or relative. Most of these grave sites \nhave markers paying tribute to the veteran's service. We place flags by \ntheir side on Memorial Day. Until 1990, moreover, the family of a \ndeceased Veteran could receive reimbursement for a VA headstone, a VA \nmarker, or a private headstone. However, in the name of cost-cutting, \nmeasures were taken to prevent the VA from providing markers to those \nfamilies that had purchased gravestones out of their own pockets.\n  In my view, this measure was a serious injustice. Nearly all families \ntoday provide for some gravestone or other privately purchased marker \nfollowing the death of a relative. Yet most were unaware of the new VA \nregulation. Many veterans were buried without any official recognition \nof their service to our country. As of 2001, the VA estimated that it \nwas forced to deny nearly 20,000 requests for such markers every year.\n  This body first endorsed a provision restoring the right of every \nveteran to receive a grave marker as early as June 7, 2000 as part of \nthe fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Bill. This body approved \nthis language again on December 8, 2001. But it was not until December \n6, 2002 that legislation was signed into law as part of the Veterans \nImprovement Act allowing VA markers to be provided to deceased veterans \nretroactively. Unfortunately, however, when the bill went to a \nconference with the House of Representatives, this benefit was only \napplied retroactively to September 11, 2001 rather than to November 1, \n1990, the date at which the new VA regulation came into effect. \nVeterans who passed away between those two dates were cut out.\n\n  That decision has never satisfied me or many veterans and their \nfamilies. Why should one veteran receive recognition, while the family \nof another is told that there is nothing our government can do simply \nbecause of the date of their passing?\n  My legislation will correct this inequity. This bill is simple. It \nensures that all veterans who have passed away since 1990 are able to \nreceive a VA grave marker.\n  It is inexpensive. In 2001, the Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthat providing such a benefit to all veterans would cost no more than \n$3 million per year for the first 5 years. Since most of the families \nof veterans who passed away between 1990 and 2001 have already \ncompleted their burial plans, it is safe to assume that a substantially \nsmaller number of individuals would require this benefit.\n  Today is the seventh anniversary of the passing of Agostino Guzzo, a \nConnecticut resident who bravely served in the United States Armed \nForces in the Philippines during World War II. His family interred his \nbody in a mausoleum at the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, \nConnecticut. The family was not aware of the VA's restrictions on grave \nmarkers, and was told by the VA that there was no way to receive an \nofficial recognition.\n  Agostino's son, Thomas Guzzo, brought the matter to my attention, \nand, along with Representative Nancy Johnson, we were able pass to \nlegislation granting Agostino the memorial he deserves. But too many \nfamilies are still denied such markers. This legislation honors the \nmemory of Agostino Guzzo and all of the veterans who have served their \ncountry in war and in peace. Thomas Guzzo's commitment to this issue \nhas not ended. The commitment of this Congress to the issue should \ncontinue as well.\n  I hope our colleagues will give this important legislation their \nfavorable consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROVISION OF GOVERNMENT MARKERS FOR MARKED GRAVES \n                   OF VETERANS AT PRIVATE CEMETERIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 502(d) of the Veterans Education \n     and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 (38 U.S.C. 2306 note) is \n     amended by striking ``September 11, 2001'' and inserting \n     ``November 1, 1990''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of section \n     502 of the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of \n     2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Cochran):\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  S. 910. A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node \ndissection for the treatment of breast cancer and coverage for \nsecondary consultations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Breast Cancer \nPatient Protection Act of 2005. I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenator Landrieu in introducing this legislation to assure women of a \nhigher standard of breast cancer treatment. We are joined today by \ncolleagues who have supported our efforts in the past--Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Boxer, Senator Murray, Senator Corzine, and Senator \nDurbin. Today in the House, Representatives Kelly and DeLauro are \nintroducing identical legislation. Working together in this bipartisan, \nbicameral effort--supported by so many breast cancer advocates--we \nshould at last achieve for American women the protections they so \ndeserve.\n  A woman in the United States has a 1 in 7 chance of developing breast \ncancer in her lifetime. This year over 216,000 women will receive a \nlife-altering diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. At some point in \ntheir lives, nearly every American will have a family member or friend \nwho must battle breast cancer. Yet current standards of health care \ncoverage have created a situation in which thousands of women each year \nundergo mastectomies needlessly, and women have even undergone breast \ncancer surgery as an outpatient--the ``drive through mastectomy'' as it \nhas been called--being sent home without critical support for their \nrecovery.\n  Our legislation empowers women and their doctors to make treatment \ndecisions based on what is medically prudent, not simply what will \nachieve short-term savings. The stress of a cancer diagnosis is \ndebilitating. To compound that stress, to leave a woman with the \nknowledge that she must undergo a disfiguring procedure due only to her \nfinancial position, or to undergo surgery without proper \nhospitalization, is absolutely unconscionable.\n  This bill achieves three important objectives. First, it assures a \npatient of a second opinion for any cancer diagnosis. A cancer \ndiagnosis simply must be reliable.\n  Second, this legislation assures a patient of a reasonable minimum \nlength of hospital stay for invasive treatment of breast cancer. Many \nof us have heard of women receiving outpatient mastectomies, being sent \nhome without the necessary support. Such treatment is unconscionable. \nThis legislation establishes a 48 hour minimum stay assurance for \nmastectomy and lumpectomy. I must point out that this assurance does \nnot require a woman remain hospitalized that long if she and her doctor \nconcur that she goes home earlier--nor does it prevent a longer \nhospitalization if her medical condition warrants it.\n\n  However, this provision will protect women from that small fraction \nof insurance plans which will not allow such reasonable treatment. This \nassurance is offered regardless of whether the patient's plan is \nregulated by ERISA or State regulations.\n  Finally, this legislation does more than simply ensure a patient of \nreasonable hospitalization. It assures her of support in making the \nbest choices about her treatment.\n  It is not hard to understand why the words ``you have breast cancer'' \nare some of the most frightening in the English language. For the woman \nwho hears them, everything changes from that moment forward. No wonder, \nthen, that it is a diagnosis not only accompanied by fear, but also by \nuncertainty. What will become of me? What will they have to do to me? \nWhat will I have to endure? What's the next step?\n  For many women, the answer to that last question is a mastectomy or \nlumpectomy. But despite the fact that studies are demonstrating that \nlumpectomy often is just as effective as mastectomy for treating breast \ncancer, an insurance coverage bias causes too many to unnecessarily \nundergo mastectomy. By ensuring a reasonable hospital stay, as well as \ncoverage for radiation therapy, this legislation removes much of the \nfinancial incentive that has caused women to receive a mastectomy when \na lumpectomy would have been just as effective.\n  In fact, when the pain, trauma, and cost of breast reconstruction is \nconsidered, together with the frequent need for follow-up surgeries, \nand when we consider the additional health risks which implants may \npose, it is clear that mastectomy can entail greater health and \neconomic costs. Decisions about treatment simply must be based on sound \nscience and a long term view, not what is most financially expedient at \nthat very moment. A woman must have the ability to make a choice with \ntheir physician which considers what is in her best long term interest. \nThis legislation ensures that choice is not influenced by a short term \noutlook.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and work \ntowards passing it this year.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, approximately 211,300 women will be \ndiagnosed with breast cancer this year. No doubt, you know one of these \nwomen. In fact, they may be your sister, mother, aunt, cousin or dear \nfriend. In most cases, the doctor will prescribe immediate and often \ntimes aggressive treatment in the hopes of stalling further progression \nof the disease. The quality of care that breast cancer patients receive \nis critically important to their survival. Despite the urgent need for \nFederal protections to ensure that breast cancer sufferers receive \nappropriate treatment, very few exist.\n  It may shock you to learn that women who have undergone surgical \ntreatments such as breast removal mastectomy--or lymph node dissections \nare being sent home within hours of having surgery because insurance \ncompanies are unwilling to reimburse recovery time in hospitals, a \npractice referred to as ``Drive-Through Mastectomies.'' These women \nhave reported being sent home still drowsy from anesthesia, weakened \nfrom hours of surgery, and with drainage tubes attached to their \nbodies, while simultaneously experiencing the immense emotional trauma \nassociated with the removal of a breast or lymph nodes.\n  To this end, I am pleased to have worked with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005. This \nlegislation will prevent insurance companies from restricting hospital \nstays resulting from mastectomies to less than 48 hours and hospital \nstays resulting from lymph node dissections to less than 24 hours. This \nbill does not prevent a doctor from discharging a woman prior to these \nminimum requirements, if he/she determines, in consultation with the \npatient, that this is the best treatment option. The Breast Cancer \nPatient Protection Act simply ensures that these types of medical \ndecisions are made by doctors, not insurance companies. The legislation \nalso prohibits insurance companies from circumventing the legislation \nthrough practices such as providing incentives to doctors or patients \nto reduce length of stays associated with mastectomies or lymph node \ndissections.\n  To be fair, we must acknowledge that this legislation will not change \nthe nature of mastectomies and lymph node dissections for the majority \nof women. Over 19 States have already put State laws in place that work \nto the same end as the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act, and the \nvast majority of insurance companies have already responded on their \nown to this problem. However, this is a case in which the injustice, \nwhile small in number of women it affects, is clear. And just as the \ninjustice is apparent, the solution is simple. It is high time that the \nFederal Government took action. Yes, many states have already done so, \nand yes, many insurance companies have, too, but if even one woman is \nforced to go home too soon after such an invasive surgery, that is one \nwoman too many. It is not the fact that this is happening to many \nwomen, it is the fact that it is happening to any women.

Res. 123\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'' on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 Americans is projected to be of Hispanic \n     descent by the year 2050, and as of 2003, approximately \n     12,300,000 Hispanic children live in the United States;\n       Whereas traditional Hispanic family life centers largely on \n     children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year, and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and to find comfort and security in \n     the support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society--their curiosity, laughter, \n     faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2005, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, and especially \n     extended and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength--the \n     will and fire of the human spirit--to make their dreams come \n     true.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important \nresolution designating the 30th day of April 2005 as ``Dia de los \nNinos: Celebrating Young Americans.''\n  Nations throughout the world, and especially within Latin America, \ncelebrate Dia de los Ninos on the 30th of April, in recognition and \ncelebration of their country's future--their children. Many American \nHispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on \nthis day by celebrating Dia de los Ninos in their homes.\n  The designation of a day to honor the children of the Nation will \nhelp affirm for the people of the United States the significance of \nfamily, education, and community. This special recognition of children \nwill provide us with an opportunity to reflect on their future, \narticulate their dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security \nin the support of their family members and communities. This resolution \ncalls on the American people to join with all children, families, \norganizations, communities, churches, cities, and states across the \nNation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Joining me as original co-sponsors to this Resolution are John \nCornyn, Charles E. Grassley, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mel Martinez, and \nLisa Murkowski.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in promptly passing this \nResolution designating April 30, 2005 Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating \nYoung Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4264-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4264-S4265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 124--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING \n    AWARENESS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS, SUPPORTING PROGRAMS FOR \n  INCREASED RESEARCH AND IMPROVED TREATMENT OF AUTISM, AND IMPROVING \nTRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR \n                        INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 124\n\n       Whereas the Autism Society of America, Cure Autism Now, the \n     National Alliance for Autism Research, The Dan Marino \n     Foundation, and numerous other organizations commemorate \n     April as National Autism Awareness Month;\n       Whereas autism is a developmental disorder that is \n     typically diagnosed during the first 3 years of life, robbing \n     individuals of their ability to communicate and interact with \n     others;\n       Whereas autism affects an estimated 1 in every 166 children \n     in America;\n       Whereas autism is 4 times more likely in boys than in \n     girls, and can affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, \n     or other factors;\n       Whereas the cost of specialized treatment in a \n     developmental center for people with autism is approximately \n     $80,000 per individual per year;\n       Whereas the cost of special education programs for school-\n     aged children with autism is often more than $30,000 per \n     individual per year;\n       Whereas the cost nationally of caring for persons affected \n     by autism is estimated at upwards of $90,000,000,000 per \n     year; and\n       Whereas despite the fact that autism is one of the most \n     common developmental disorders, many professionals in the \n     medical and educational fields are still unaware of the best \n     methods to diagnose and treat the disorder: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the establishment of April as National Autism \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of \n     children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in \n     providing for the special needs of children with autism and \n     for absorbing significant financial costs for specialized \n     education and support services;\n       (3) supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for \n     aggressive research to learn the root causes of autism, \n     identify the best methods of early intervention and \n     treatment, expand programs for individuals with autism across \n     their lifespan, and promote understanding of the special \n     needs of people with autism;\n       (4) commends the Department of Health and Human Services \n     for the swift implementation of the Children's Health Act of \n     2000, particularly for establishing 4 ``Centers of \n     Excellence'' at the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention to study the epidemiology of autism and related \n     disorders and the proposed ``Centers of Excellence'' at the \n     National Institutes of Health for autism research;\n       (5) stresses the need to begin early intervention services \n     soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism, noting \n     that early intervention strategies are the primary \n     therapeutic options for young people with autism, and early \n     intervention significantly\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n     improves outcomes for people with autism and can reduce the \n     level of funding and services needed later in life;\n       (6) supports the Federal Government's nearly 30-year-old \n     commitment to provide States with 40 percent of the costs \n     needed to educate children with disabilities under part B of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA);\n       (7) recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained \n     teachers who have the skills and support necessary to teach, \n     assist, and respond to special needs students, including \n     those with autism, in our school systems; and\n       (8) recognizes the importance of worker training programs \n     that are tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled \n     persons, including those with autism, and notes that people \n     with autism can be, and are, productive members of the \n     workforce if they are given appropriate support, training, \n     and early intervention services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4265-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 125--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA GOLDEN \n  GOPHERS WOMEN'S ICE HOCKEY TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2004-2005 NATIONAL \n COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION I WOMEN'S HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 28, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res 28) expressing the \n     sense of Congress on World Intellectual Property Day \n     regarding the importance of protecting intellectual property \n     rights globally.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today, on World Intellectual Property Day, \nI rise in support of a resolution I have submitted recognizing the \nimportance of\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nprotecting intellectual property. One of the key benefits of protecting \nintellectual property is preserving innovation. Only with enforcement \nof protections will there be incentives for inventors to create and \nprotect their innovations. As the sharing of goods and ideas transcends \nnational boundaries, it is vital that these protections be able to \naccompany the ideas that they protect globally.\n  Although most of our trading partners have national domestic laws \nprotecting intellectual property piracy and are even parties to \nagreements which contain intellectual property protections, piracy \ncontinues largely due to lack of enforcement. Theft of intellectual \nproperty results in competitive disadvantages to U.S. industries and \njob loss for American workers.\n  Counterfeiting and digital piracy have increased dramatically in \nrecent years. In addition to the direct impact on the sales and profits \nof the subject industries, there is also significant harm and deception \nto consumers who believe they are purchasing legal and legitimate \ngoods. Piracy and counterfeiting of copyrighted products in digital and \nother formats have grown to an enormous scale because these illegal \nactivities offer a high rate of return with minimal risk to the \ncriminal producing element. This element can conduct piracy with little \ncapital investment, and in many countries, little chance of \napprehension. Even if apprehended, the penalties may be so minor that \nthey offer no deterrent.\n  There are various agreements between nations implemented at different \nlevels for the protection of intellectual property. One of these is \npart of the World Trade Organization, WTO, charter, the Trade Related \nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS. Key TRIPS provisions \nrequire all WTO members to provide certain minimum standards of \nprotection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, \ngeographical indicators, and other forms of intellectual property. \nThere is also a requirement to provide effective enforcement of each \nnation's domestic intellectual property regulations.\n  Also currently in force are two copyright treaties of the World \nIntellectual Property Organization: the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the \nWIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which entered into force in \n2002. These treaties help raise the minimum standards of intellectual \nproperty protection around the world, particularly with respect to \ninternet-based delivery of copyrighted works. As with the TRIPS \nagreement, enforcement of obligations by member countries remains the \nissue.\n  This resolution focuses on two nations, China and Russia, with which \nwe have significant trading relationships, yet, are still not offering \nthe necessary enforcement of protections. China has become a leading \nexporter of counterfeit and pirated goods to the world. It is, \ntherefore, critical that we address the issue of protection and \nenforcement in China. At the April 2004 meeting of the Joint Commission \non Commerce and Trade, JCCT, the Chinese Government indicated that it \nwould undertake a series of actions to significantly reduce \ninfringement throughout the country. Piracy rates in China have \nremained at extremely high levels for the past decade, despite numerous \nactions by the Chinese Government such as the seizure and destruction \nof millions of pirated products, often via highly publicized \nsteamrollings of counterfeited discs. As a fellow member of the WTO, we \nmust ensure that China fulfills its commitments to enforce intellectual \nproperty protections under the rules of the WTO.\n  Piracy in Russia continues to be a growing problem. Only a few pirate \noptical disc factories existed in Russia in the late 1990s. Reports \nindicate that there are now over 30 such plants producing pirated \nproducts in Russia, ruining the Russian market for American right-\nholders and substantially undermining other markets in Europe as well. \nThe Russian Government has made many promises to solve this problem, \nbut meaningful results have yet to occur. Russia recognizes that its \ndomestic laws and enforcement measures still do not meet TRIPS \nrequirements; however, the required legislation has not been \nimplemented. We should encourage the Government of Russia to act \npromptly and implement these measures so that it can fully comply with \nthe rules of the WTO.\n  The problem of protecting intellectual property is evident. Going \nforward, our focus should be on the solutions. What enforcement methods \nshould be utilized that have not been thus far? Should our \ninternational agreements and treaties with our trading partners be \nbetter utilized to ensure enforcement of intellectual property rights \nlaws? Some progress has been made in these areas, yet there is much \nmore ground to cover. I encourage the administration to insure that our \ntrading partners fulfill their commitments and agreements to abide by \nglobal intellectual property rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the International Intellectual Property Alliance, Apr. 26, 2005]\n\n     Statement of the International Intellectual Property Alliance \n              Celebrating World Intellectual Property Day\n\n       Washington, DC.--The International Intellectual Property \n     Alliance (IIPA), a coalition of six trade associations \n     representing 1,300 U.S.-based copyright companies, today \n     celebrates 2005 World Intellectual Property Day. Eric H. \n     Smith, President of IIPA, issued the following statement:\n       ``The theme for 2005's World Intellectual Property Day is \n     `Think, Imagine, Create.' This message from the Director \n     General of the World Intellectual Property Organization \n     (WIPO), Kamil Idris, is directed at the world's young people \n     to build awareness about the importance of creativity--and \n     the protection of the intellectual property that supports \n     that creativity--to the daily lives of every global citizen. \n     Without providing this protection, many of the great cultural \n     and technological assets that we now take for granted would \n     never have been available to us to improve our lives. Strong \n     protection and enforcement of the world's laws that nurture \n     the creativity embodied in intellectual property are all too \n     often taken for granted or viewed by a few as no longer \n     necessary. We too often forget the important cultural and \n     economic benefits, jobs, contributions to GDP and tax \n     revenues that are dependent on a strong intellectual property \n     system.\n       ``U.S. creators have benefited significantly from a strong \n     global system of protection enshrined in treaties and \n     conventions to which virtually all the world's nations \n     belong. Yet weak laws and inadequate enforcement of those \n     laws continue to plague all those individuals and companies \n     that contribute to this great global creative and \n     technological explosion.\n       ``Today, Senators Lugar and Baucus introduced a Sense of \n     the Congress Resolution, celebrating World Intellectual \n     Property Day, and highlighting the massive damage done--over \n     $4 billion just to U.S. creators of copyright products \n     alone--to global creativity by just two countries, China and \n     Russia, through their failure to abide by internationally-\n     agreed standards of protection and enforcement. The message \n     to these countries is clear: they are cheating themselves by \n     failing to take effective action to prevent the creative \n     works of their own citizens, U.S. citizens and those of other \n     countries, from blatant theft. IIPA members join with the \n     sponsors of this Resolution to call upon these governments to \n     take earnest measures to halt this theft and upon the U.S. \n     government to use all the tools provided by Congress to see \n     that these countries take effective action to prevent pirates \n     from stealing intellectual property with impunity. Economic \n     and cultural development is increasingly dependent on the \n     creation and protection of intellectual property of all \n     kinds. The resolution hits the mark in targeting two of the \n     world's worst offenders of intellectual property rights.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Association of American Publishers News]\n\n   Publishers Applaud Senate Resolution on Safeguarding Intellectual \n                           Property Worldwide\n\n       Washington, DC, April 26, 2005.--The U.S. publishing \n     industry enthusiastically welcomed today's introduction in \n     the Senate of a bipartisan Concurrent Resolution stressing \n     the importance of protecting intellectual property rights \n     around the world. The Association of American Publishers \n     (AAP) expressed special thanks to Senator Richard Lugar (R-\n     IN), Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator \n     Max Baucus (D-MT), Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, \n     who joined in sponsoring the resolution to mark the \n     observance of World Intellectual Property Day.\n       Noting that the theft of intellectual property hurts the \n     U.S. economy and costs American jobs, and citing deep concern \n     over the failure of many U.S. trading partners to fulfill \n     obligations to protect intellectual property, the resolution \n     is particularly critical of China and Russia, where piracy \n     threatens the very existence of legitimate markets for \n     copyright products. The resolution calls on the \n     Administration to use ``all available tools provided by \n     Congress,'' and the leverage provided by bi-lateral and \n     multi-lateral\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\n     trade agreements (including, where appropriate, WTO \n     commitments) as well as terms regulating benefits such as the \n     Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, to protect \n     the intellectual property rights of American businesses.\n       AAP President and CEO Pat Schroeder congratulated Senators \n     Lugar and Baucus for focusing attention on the serious matter \n     of international piracy. ``Chinese pirates are decimating \n     markets for legitimate commercial best sellers, academic arid \n     professional works and English language learning materials. \n     Russia leads its region in consumption of pirated books in \n     both English and translation, and the impact on American \n     publishers will only deepen as demand for English language \n     materials grows in the region. Piracy cost American \n     publishers an estimated $50 million last year in China, and \n     $42 million in Russia, and the situation is worsening with \n     the growth of the Internet as a distribution channel for \n     pirated works,'' Mrs. Schroeder said. ``In marking World \n     Intellectual Property Day, this strong statement of \n     Congress'' commitment to protect American creativity is very \n     welcome.''\n       The Association of American Publishers is the national \n     trade association of the U.S. book publishing industry.

In particular, there is an urgent need to direct \n     attention to markets like Russia and China, which remain \n     essentially closed to U.S. businesses due to stifling piracy \n     rates. As the Senators aptly mention, piracy in these markets \n     and elsewhere around the world ``is open, notorious and \n     permitted to operate without meaningful hindrance from the \n     government.''\n       There may be no single economic issue that has a greater \n     bearing on American competitiveness in the 21st century than \n     the protection of intellectual property. As such, it is \n     imperative that we not shy away from demands that our trading \n     partners meet their obligations under international \n     agreements as well as the criteria for participating in US. \n     trade programs affording unilaterally extended trade \n     benefits. We simply cannot enter into political arrangements \n     that fail to protect our greatest economic assets.\n       On the occasion of World Intellectual Property Day, we wish \n     to call upon the Russian and Chinese governments to reform \n     their approach to this critical issue and to begin to \n     seriously address the rampant piracy that is so endemic in \n     their societies today. It is of utmost importance that the \n     Sino-U.S. and U.S.-Russia relationships are built upon a \n     mutual understanding of shared obligations and a strong \n     commitment to embracing and enforcing the rule of law. While \n     we very much want to see Russia join the community of nations \n     bound to one another in the World Trade Organization, \n     negotiations cannot conclude without marked improvement and a \n     commitment on the part of the Russian government to the \n     protection of intellectual property.\n       We also wish to express our great concern about the current \n     state of affairs in China and the apparent determination of \n     the Chinese government to limit the ability of U.S. companies \n     to meaningfully engage in the Chinese market. At present, the \n     Chinese government continues to maintain significant barriers \n     to entry for some of our nation's most competitive \n     industries, particularly in the area of music and film \n     production and distribution. In addition, the government \n     continues to permit Chinese pirate businesses to be built on \n     the back of American creativity. Without question, these \n     practices must change if China wishes to maintain a secure \n     and stable relationship with the United States.\n       We appreciate the continued attention of our nation's \n     political leaders to this pressing issue--on both the \n     occasion of World Intellectual Property Day and beyond. We \n     look forward to working with Congress and the Administration \n     to help produce--and if necessary, demand--effective changes \n     to create a more level playing field and a global environment \n     that values and respects American intellectual property.\n                                                    Mitch Bainwol,\n                                                 Chairman and CEO.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the theme of this year's World \nIntellectual Property Day, which we commemorate today, is ``Think, \nImagine, Create.''\n  Think, imagine, create, these simple words are at the center of what \nmakes America great and what continues to drive our progress. American \nthought produced our Constitution and our system of government. \nAmerican imagination put a person on the moon. And American creativity \nhas made U.S. culture the envy of the world.\n  It is astounding how important intellectual property has become in \nour everyday life. It is even more astounding how much we take human \ncreativity and intellectual property for granted. Just think about it \nfor a moment and imagine what a world would be like without \nintellectual property rights.\n  Without copyrights, who would want to write the books we read, \nproduce the movies we watch, or compose the music that fills our ears?\n  Without trademarks, who would want to invest the enormous time, \nenergy, and resources required to develop a brand name synonymous with \nquality and reliability?\n  And without patents, who would have the incentive to innovate and \nproduce inventions that change our world and save our lives?\n  Intellectual property rights are not just some abstract legal concept \nthe sole province of lawyers and judges. They are an essential motor of \nour economy.\n  Look at the copyright industry. These are the folks who produce \nnewspapers, books, movies, computer software, and radio/TV \nbroadcasting. This industry alone accounts for 12 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. That's $1.25 trillion.\n  If these numbers don't impress, then let's look at the impact the \ncopyright industries have on U.S. jobs. They alone employ roughly 11.5 \nmillion workers. That is nearly 8.5 percent of total U.S. employment. \nBelieve it or not, that number approaches the level of employment in \nthe heath care sector or the entire manufacturing sector. And between \n1997 and 2002, the rate of\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\njob growth in the copyright industry exceeded that of the U.S. economy \nas a whole.\n  That is why protecting intellectual property rights worldwide is \ncritical. It is not just a concern for the overall health of the U.S. \neconomy. And it is not just a concern of this or that company. It is a \nconcern of each and every worker that the intellectual property \nindustries employ. And it is a concern of each and every one of us that \nenjoys going to see the latest movie, likes wearing a hip new pair of \nNike shoes, or needs the most innovative life saving drug.\n  Unfortunately, while we have a robust IPR regime here in America, \nsome of our trading partners do not. In certain countries, IPR theft is \nrampant.\n  China is probably the most notorious example. USTR reports that \ncounterfeiting and piracy in China are at ``epidemic levels and cause \nserious harm to U.S. businesses in virtually every sector of the \neconomy.'' In fact, as USTR pointed out, one U.S. trade association \nclaims that counterfeiting and piracy in China exceeds 90 percent. \nEstimates of the value of counterfeit and pirated goods in China are \nbetween $19 billion and $24 billion in 2001. That translates into \nlosses of $2.5 to $3.8 billion to U.S. industry.\n  Russia is also a serial IPR violator. The scale of intellectual \nproperty rights infringement there is vast and growing. Russia's legal \nframework has huge gaps, and the enforcement of existing laws is lax. \nThis has real costs. Estimated losses to U.S. copyright industries due \nto piracy of films, videos, sound recordings, books, and computer \nsoftware continue to exceed $1 billion annually. Over 80 percent of all \nDVDs on the Russian market are estimated to be pirated. Pirated music \nis estimated at 66 percent of sales, and software piracy is estimated \nat about 88 percent.\n  IPR violations in Brazil are also very troubling, particularly given \nthat Brazil is both a WTO member and receives benefits from the United \nStates under the Generalized System of Preferences. USTR reports that \nestimated losses in Brazil due to piracy of copyrighted materials \ntotaled over $930 million in 2004 alone. An estimated 75 percent of \naudiocassettes sold in Brazil are pirated.\n  These violations run counter to the entire spirit and purpose of \nWorld Intellectual Property Day. Rather than foster an environment that \nencourages thought, imagination, and creativity, IPR violations in \nChina, Russia, Brazil, and other countries stifle creativity and \ninnovation. They send the chilling message that the short-term profit \nof pirates, counterfeiters, and other IPR thieves matter more than the \nlong term gains of society.\n  We need to crack down on countries that fail to protect and enforce \nintellectual property rights. We should use all tools at our disposal \nto address barriers to thought, imagination, and creativity.\n  In my view, we are long overdue in initiating a WTO case with China \nfor its failure to comply with its obligations under the WTO's TRIPS \nagreement, particularly in the area of copyrights.\n  In my view, we should not give a green light to Russia's bid to join \nthe WTO until Russia makes visible and sustained improvements to its \nlegal regime as well as a demonstrable commitment to long-term \nenforcement.\n  And in my view, we should not continue to give countries with serious \nintellectual property deficiencies, like Russia and Brazil, GSP \nbenefits until they clean up their act.\n  That is why I am today cosponsoring with Senator Lugar a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution on the importance of protecting intellectual \nproperty. Among other things, this resolution urges the administration \nto use all effective remedies to address the lack of intellectual \nproperty protection. It also urges the administration to take action to \nensure that China, Russia, and our other trading partners comply with \ntheir international trade obligations.\n  Think, imagine, create, that is the theme of this year's World \nIntellectual Property Day. I hope that next year we can celebrate an \nimproved global environment that truly fosters these important \naspirations.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 28\n\n       Whereas protection of intellectual property is critical to \n     our nation's economic competitiveness, cultural diversity, \n     health and scientific development;\n       Whereas the United States economy depends increasingly on \n     the work of authors, artists, inventors, programmers, and \n     many others who create intellectual products of high value;\n       Whereas theft of intellectual property results in \n     competitive disadvantages to United States industries and job \n     losses for American workers, and for the United States \n     economy as a whole;\n       Whereas the copyright industries employ approximately \n     11,500,000 workers or 8.41 percent of total employment in the \n     United States, a number that approaches the levels of \n     employment in the health care and social assistance sector \n     (15,300,000 employees) and the entire manufacturing sector \n     (14,500,000 workers in 21 manufacturing industries);\n       Whereas there is great concern about the failure of many of \n     our trading partners to live up to their international \n     obligations in the area of intellectual property protection;\n       Whereas counterfeiting of copyrighted products in digital \n     and other formats, as well as counterfeiting of all types of \n     trademarked products, has grown to an enormous scale;\n       Whereas many of our trading partners, in particular Russia \n     and China, have laws in place to prevent piracy and \n     counterfeiting, but are failing to enforce the laws;\n       Whereas Russia and China alone are responsible for over \n     $4,000,000,000 in losses a year to United States industries \n     due to piracy;\n       Whereas piracy in Russia and China is open, notorious, and \n     permitted to operate without meaningful hindrance from the \n     governments of those countries;\n       Whereas China should be encouraged to meet its intellectual \n     property protection obligations as a member of the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO);\n       Whereas Russia should be encouraged to explore means to \n     provide effective piracy protection enabling compliance with \n     the rules set forth by the WTO;\n       Whereas the United States Government must convey to these \n     countries that failure to act will have political and \n     economic consequences for relationships with the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas Congress has enacted legislation regarding the \n     protection of intellectual property, including measures which \n     direct the Administration to censure countries that fail to \n     provide adequate and effective protection for intellectual \n     property: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Administration should utilize effective remedies \n     and solutions in addressing the lack of intellectual property \n     protection in China and Russia, using all available tools \n     provided by Congress;\n       (2) the Administration should ensure that any country that \n     enjoys benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences \n     (GSP) program, such as Russia, lives up to its obligations to \n     provide adequate and effective protection for intellectual \n     property rights, or lose its eligibility to participate in \n     trade preference programs;\n       (3) the Administration should ensure that action is taken \n     against any country with which the United States shares \n     mutual commitments under the WTO, such as China, when the \n     country fails to live up to its WTO commitments;\n       (4) the Administration should urge Russia to promote \n     measures to enforce intellectual property protection which \n     will enable compliance with the intellectual property \n     commitments required by the WTO; and\n       (5) the President should take any additional action the \n     President considers appropriate to protect the intellectual \n     property rights of United States businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/26/senate-section/article/S4348-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4348-S4349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMENDING UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WOMEN'S ICE HOCKEY TEAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
