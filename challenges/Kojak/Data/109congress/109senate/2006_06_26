Mr. President, here is the lead sentence from an article in \nthis day's New York Times. This headline also appeared in other \nnewspapers around the country. It ran under the headline of ``U.S. \nGeneral in Iraq Outlines Troop Cuts.''\n  Mr. President, I think this first paragraph says most of it:\n\n       The top American commander in Iraq has drafted a plan that \n     projects sharp reductions in the United States military \n     presence there by the end of 2007, with the first cuts coming \n     this September, American officials say.\n\n  This, of course, we have learned came from General Casey. This \nannouncement from our military was one piece of good news for those of \nus who believe we need a new course in Iraq. But it was not the only \ngood news we received this weekend regarding Iraq.\n  Another encouraging sign came from Baghdad itself where the Prime \nMinister believes it is also the time to start thinking about the \nwithdrawal of United States troops. Together, these reports--one from \nGeneral Casey, the one on the chart, and the other from Prime Minister \nMaliki--provided a glimmer of hope for those of us who have been \ndemanding a new direction in the war in Iraq, a change of course.\n  This afternoon, I want to note the similarity between General Casey's \napparent plan to withdraw U.S. forces and the plan put forth by Senate \nDemocrats on this floor last week with the Defense authorization bill. \nOur plan, designed by Senators Levin and Reed, is very much like this \nprogram shown on the chart. That is by our commanding general in Iraq. \nIt said much the same thing as our military leaders are saying all over \nthe country, specifically through General Casey, specifically, that it \nis time for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\nown security and government so that the phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces from Iraq can begin by year's end.\n  As we all know, I think the Republican majority rejected the Levin-\nReed proposal on a straight party-line vote. One courageous Republican \nvoted with us. The rest were all no votes. Even though it represents \nour best chance at making sure our troops succeed in Iraq, and Iraq as \na country succeeds, and, secondly, even though it is consistent with \nthe plan of our top military commander in Iraq, on a straight party-\nline on the floor last week the Republicans voted against the Levin-\nReed proposal, even though it was very much like General Casey's \nproposal.\n  By rejecting this amendment--the Democratic amendment--the \nRepublicans made clear that they were content to stay the course and to \nstay forever in Iraq. I wonder how the majority feels today now that \nGeneral Casey's plan is in the open, now that it is clear that the \ncongressional Republicans stand alone in opposition to troop \nredeployment, apart from the American people, even though their stand \nis contrary, I repeat, to the American people, even though the \nRepublican stand is contrary to the military commanders, those who are \nin the battlefield in Iraq, and even though the Republican majority \nvote last week was contrary to the Iraqi Government.\n  Did they disagree with General Casey? Do they disagree that we need \nto begin ending the open-ended commitment in Iraq? Do they, the \nRepublican Senators, believe a plan for reducing our troop levels, as \nthey said last week with the Levin-Reed proposal--do they believe that \nwhat General Casey suggests is defeatist and that he is unpatriotic? Do \nthey have a plan now of their own--the Republican majority--or do they \nstill want to stay the course?\n  These are questions the American people are going to demand that the \nRepublican majority answer.\n  The open-ended commitment the majority advocates is simply not \nsustainable, as seen through the eyes of General Casey, as seen through \nthe eyes of the Iraqi Prime Minister. We must transform the United \nStates mission in Iraq and begin the responsible redeployment of U.S. \nforces this year. That is what the Levin-Reed amendment said last week \nthat the Republicans defeated.\n  The war is now costing the American people about $2.5 billion each \nweek. Our military has been stretched thin, with every available combat \nunit in the Army and Marine Corps serving multiple tours in Iraq, and \nour equipment needing $50 billion or $60 billion to be in the shape it \nwas when we went to war in Iraq. We have lost more than 2,500 American \nlives, 15 just last week. We have seen more than 18,000 wounded and a \nthird to a half of them grievously wounded. Iraq, according to a new \nreport in Sunday's L.A. Times, has lost at least 50,000 of its citizens \nsince 2003.\n  We cannot continue to pay these costs, nor can we continue to try to \nengage growing threats such as North Korea, Iran, and Somalia with \nengagements in Iraq tying one hand behind us.\n  The phased redeployment this year will put Iraqis in charge of their \nown security and allow many of our troops to be redeployed. Some will \ncome home and some will be available to deal with other crises, such as \nAfghanistan, where the resurgent Taliban threat must be eliminated, and \nwhere those responsible for attacks on this Nation still roam free \nbasically.\n  It is time for a new direction. General Casey realizes this. The \nAmerican people realize this. The Iraqi Government realizes this. And \nit is time for the Republican majority in the Congress to realize this \nas well.\n  We don't need a September or October surprise with the President and \nRepublicans proclaiming victory and announcing troop redeployment just \nin time for the mid-term elections. We need a nonpartisan approach that \nprovides Iraqis and our troops with the best chance for success now, in \nJune, 2006.\n  We are in the fourth year of this war. It is time that the direction \nis changed. It is time to end this game of partisan politics, of \nblindly rubber-stamping the White House, and of publicly rejecting \nideas that are being embraced in private, and now in public, by our \nmilitary leaders. Our troops in Iraq are too important to fall victim \nto these political games.\n  This leads me to another important subject the Senate must consider, \nwhich has also fallen victim to partisan politics--amnesty for \nterrorists who have killed our troops.\n  I have come to the floor many times in recent weeks to discuss Iraq \ngranting amnesty to terrorists. Rumors are no longer valid. These are \nnot rumors. The Prime Minister himself has submitted an amnesty plan. \nSo it has turned into fact. But I still have very serious concerns.\n  According to the news reports out of Baghdad over the weekend, the \nPrime Minister will pardon those who engaged in legitimate acts of \nresistance. Against who, Mr. President? What does that mean? Does it \nmean that these are legitimate acts of resistance when we have soldiers \ntrying to free someone who is being detained by a kidnapper? What are \nlegitimate acts of resistance? Against a Nation that liberated that \nnation from a brutal dictator? Is it a sniper who shoots at a soldier \nwho is trying to restore power and electricity to a Baghdad \nneighborhood? Is it placing a roadside bomb next to a convoy that was \ntrying to repair a road in the Sunni triangle or fix a school? Is it \ndetonating an improvised explosive device against a team of U.S. \nsoldiers who are attempting to build a hospital in Iraq? I think not.\n  Just who is this resistance? What are they resisting? Are they \nresisting freedom or democracy? Why should they be given immunity for \nacts that have been perpetrated against the United States and against \ncoalition forces? Why? The concept, I believe, is outrageous and an \ninsult to all of the brave American soldiers who serve with distinction \nevery day.\n  President Bush needs to forcibly tell the Iraqi Prime Minister that \nhis amnesty plan, as reported, is not welcome. The Senate had the \nchance to send this message last week. The majority strenuously \nresisted the attempt of us Democrats to send a clear message to Iraq. \nIn spite of the attempts to minimize our amendment, it passed. We \ncarried the day.\n\n  I hope Republicans will revisit their opposition in light of the \nlatest developments, and I hope President Bush will stand up for our \ntroops by demanding the Iraqis drop any intentions they may have to let \nthe terrorists go.\n  I support reconciliation in Iraq; however, not at the expense of our \nAmerican troops, those who have sacrificed and those who are there now. \nThey have sacrificed too much to see their service dishonored or their \nsafety put at risk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with the Senate heading for the break for \nthe Fourth of July recess, obviously, there will not be many more days \nleft in this year's schedule. I am going to spend\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\nsome time on the floor in the days ahead focusing on those areas where \nthere is significant bipartisan support for making a real difference \nfor the American people, especially on those key domestic issues of \nenergy and health care, two areas I know the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, cares a great deal about.\n  For example, on the energy front, today, I and Senator Kyl and \nSenator Snowe and Senator Lieberman sent a letter to the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, asking that we have an opportunity to \ndebate how the Government can save between $20 billion and $80 billion \non an energy program that is totally out of control. It involves the \nFederal Government's oil and natural gas royalty program.\n  It is a program that began at a time when oil was somewhere in the \nvicinity of $20 a barrel. It has been a bipartisan concern of Senators \nthat it makes no sense to spend billions and billions of dollars \nsubsidizing the price of oil when it is at record levels.\n  I spent, as you know, Mr. President, about 5 hours on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate discussing this issue a few weeks ago, and I certainly \nhave no intention of duplicating that this afternoon. But I do think it \nis important to zero in on those issues that have bipartisan support, \nand I want to describe what has happened in the Senate and in the other \nbody since I and Senator Kyl talked about this program a number of \nweeks ago.\n  After we discussed it for those many hours on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, on May 17 the House of Representatives voted on a measure that \nwas virtually identical to the final Wyden-Kyl amendment. Two-hundred \nand fifty Members of the House of Representatives, with regard to this \nissue, after a lengthy debate, voted to address a mistake that has been \npointed out by Senators of both political parties here on this floor.\n  So my hope is--and this is the point of our bipartisan letter to \nSenator Frist today--we can get an opportunity for a real debate on \nthis issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate before the Senate breaks for \nthe August recess.\n  It is one thing to talk about subsidies at a time, for example, when \nthe price of oil is low, when the oil sector is hurting, when they are \nhaving difficulty getting the adequate dollars together for the \ninvestments that are needed in this vital part of our economy. But \ncertainly that is not the case today. Today we are talking about record \nprofits, we are talking about record prices, and we certainly do not \nneed record subsidies.\n  I and Senator Kyl would like a chance to put this issue before the \nentire U.S. Senate. On our letter today to the majority leader, Senator \nSnowe and Senator Lieberman--two Members who have been very involved in \nthese issues for a number of years as well--are joining us.\n  I also point out the mistakes in this program are bipartisan. \nCertainly, there were mistakes made during the Clinton administration \nwhen there was a failure to address what is called the threshold issue \nto ensure you do not subsidize these oil companies at a time when \nprofits are extremely high and you do not need these incentives. So the \nClinton administration mangled the job before President Bush and his \nteam took over. But certainly the problem was compounded by Gale \nNorton, who was then Secretary of the Interior, who insisted on raising \nthe subsidies even more administratively.\n  And then, as I talked about on the floor of the Senate when the \nCongress passed the energy bill as part of this session, the deal was \nsweetened even more. Again, virtually no independent expert thought the \nsubsidies were needed. When I asked the oil company executives, who \ncame before the Energy Committee, on which the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina, and I both serve, the \nexecutives, to a person, said: We do not need these subsidies at a time \nof record prices and record profits.\n  So the Congress is behind the American people. Frankly, the Congress \nis lagging behind even what the oil executives have said they could \nlive with. At a time when the House of Representatives--more than 250 \nin number--has voted to cut these subsidies, the Senate should not be \ndawdling on this issue any longer.\n  We are talking about substantial sums of money. The General \nAccounting Office has said it is in the vicinity of $20 billion. There \nis litigation underway now. If the litigation is successful, the bill \nto the Government could be in the vicinity of $80 billion. That is a \nsubstantial amount of money to be frittering away now when there are \nall these pressing needs here at home and for our country.\n  So given that I am going to be talking in the days ahead about issues \nwhere there is significant bipartisan support, specifically focusing on \nthese key domestic issues of health care and energy, I start today by \nmaking a unanimous consent request that the letter that I, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Lieberman, and Senator Snowe have sent to Senator Frist be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: Serious concerns have arisen regarding \n     the implementation of the federal government's oil and \n     natural gas royalty program. Recent news reports and the \n     administration's own statements suggest that the government \n     may be unable to collect billions in royalties from certain \n     leases of federal land and waters. With oil and gas prices at \n     historic levels, there is no good reason for royalty relief \n     incentives.\n       In an effort to promote the exploration and production of \n     natural gas and crude oil in deep water, the Deep Water \n     Royalty Relief Act of 1995 implemented a royalty-relief \n     program that relieves eligible leases from paying royalties \n     on defined amounts of deep-water production. This would be \n     accomplished by allowing the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the oil and gas companies to enter into leases with a defined \n     volume suspension and price threshold. This incentive was \n     intended to help companies that undertook these investments \n     in particularly highcost, high-risk areas to be able to \n     recover their capital investment before having to pay \n     royalties on their gross revenues. It came at a time when oil \n     and gas prices were low and the interest in deep water \n     drilling was lacking. At that time, the program was needed to \n     encourage production and it helped achieve that goal. The \n     American Petroleum Institute estimates that since 1996, \n     natural gas production is up 407 percent and oil 386 percent.\n       However, during 1998 and 1999, price thresholds were not \n     included in terms of the leases, thereby allowing companies \n     to recoup their capital investments long before the \n     expiration of volume suspension. The absence of price \n     thresholds in these leases allows companies to benefit both \n     from both high market prices and volume suspensions. The \n     Mineral Management Service has said the failure to include \n     price thresholds was not intentional, but a costly mistake--\n     and one that must be corrected with some help from Congress.\n       On May 17, the House of Representatives during \n     consideration of the Fiscal Year 2007 Interior Appropriations \n     Bill debated and voted 252-165 to address this mistake. We do \n     not necessarily believe the House proposal is the answer, but \n     we should have an opportunity in the Senate to take up the \n     issue. We want to correct the error by requiring the federal \n     government to add price thresholds to all leases including \n     those issued in 1998 and 1999.\n       We ask that you schedule an up-or-down vote on the issue at \n     the earliest opportunity and no later than the August recess. \n     Thank you for your prompt consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ron Wyden.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman.\n     Jon Kyl.\n     Olympia Snowe.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is the hope of the bipartisan group of Senators that \nhave followed this issue that this program, run by the Minerals \nManagement Service, can be corrected. These are costly, costly mistakes \ninvolving billions of dollars. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, has been a great advocate of renewable energy.\n  For example, think what you could do if you took just a fraction of \nthe money that is being wasted on royalty relief and moved it to the \nrenewable energy field. You could help stimulate renewable energy \nproduction and reduce the deficit simultaneously. So that is what the \nbipartisan group of Senators want to do on this key issue.\n  Since I talked at some length about this a few weeks ago, I think I \nwill move on to the other pocketbook issue. But I do hope, with \nhundreds of bills having been introduced in the Senate in both the \nenergy and health care areas, that as we go into these last days of the \nsession, the focus can be on those pieces of legislation that have\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nsignificant bipartisan support. That is true in the case of oil royalty \nrelief and cutting those needless subsidies. It is also true with \nrespect to prescription drugs, and I will wrap up with a few comments \nin that regard.\n  Mr. President, on the prescription drug issue, we saw, just a few \ndays ago, two reports issued, one by AARP and the other by Families \nUSA, indicating we have seen a very significant increase in the cost of \nprescription medicine since the beginning of this year. This comes, of \ncourse, at a time when Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, \nis just kicking in. It comes at a time, of course, when we have seen \nthe costs of this program skyrocket far beyond the original \nprojections.\n  It would indicate to me that some of those who said competition in \nthe private sector alone was going to do the job have not dealt with \nthe consequences of what happens when the Government does not back up \nthose private-sector kind of efforts. As you will recall, in the \nprescription drug debate, I was one of nine on this side of the aisle \nwho voted for the legislation. I have got the welts on my back to show \nfor it.\n  Senator Snowe and I said then that we have to make sure the \nGovernment isn't the only part of the prescription drug arena where \nthere is no opportunity to hold down the cost of medicine. Everybody \nelse bargains today for the cost of medicine. That is true for any \nmanufacturing in North Carolina. It is true in Oregon. It is true \nanywhere. Nobody ties their hands behind their back when it comes to \ntrying to get the full value for their dollar in the health care \nsector. The only one who has their hands tied behind their back is the \nFederal Government when it comes to prescription medicine purchased \nunder the Part D Medicare Program.\n  My sense is that this is another area where, with significant \nbipartisan support, Congress can move ahead. On the question of lifting \nthe restriction so that Medicare can bargain to hold down the cost of \nmedicine, Senator Snowe and I got 54 votes for our bipartisan proposal \nto change the law. Once again, significant bipartisan support was given \nfor a major change that will help taxpayers and consumers.\n  My sense is the price increases in prescription drugs we are seeing \ntoday is because there are few restraints on the prices that can be \ncharged. There are what are called PBMs, pharmaceutical benefit \nmanagers. They have a role to play. It can be a useful one. But if we \nare really going to make sure we are using all the tools to hold down \nthe cost of medicine, the Government ought to have authority to say, if \nthe private sector isn't going to give a fair shake to seniors and \ntaxpayers, there ought to be backup authority. The Government should be \nable to say: We are going to now make it clear that there is an \nopportunity to bargain and do what everybody else in America does to \nhold down the cost of medicine.\n  The price increases we have seen in the first 3 months of this year \ncomprise the largest quarterly price increases in 6 years. It comes at \na time when the Medicare prescription drug program is going into \neffect. The prices jumped something like four times the general \ninflation rate. We are seeing, right at a key time when the Medicare \nprescription drug program is getting off the ground, prices go up four \ntimes faster than the inflation rate. We are seeing the biggest \nquarterly price increases in 6 years. That makes the case for the \nCongress looking at a bipartisan way to beef up opportunities to \ncontain the cost of prescription drug medicine.\n  In the Snowe-Wyden legislation which received 54 votes, we \nspecifically state that there can be no price controls and no uniform \nformulary which would be, in effect, a backdoor Federal price control. \nI know the Senator from North Carolina has been interested in the \nquestion of what will happen to research, what will happen to \ninnovation. I happen to share the view of the Senator from North \nCarolina that to come up with big price control regimes and Federal \narbitrary standards for the formularies that make judgments about \nmedicine would be a mistake. Under our legislation, we specifically say \nwe will lift the restriction on bargaining power so the Government will \nnot be the only part of the health care sector that is not trying to \nget value for the dollar. But our amendment said no price controls and \nno uniform, one-size-fits-all formulary that, for all practical \npurposes, would be a backdoor set of price controls.\n  These two studies from AARP and Families USA are extremely alarming \nbecause the theory behind the Medicare prescription drug program was \nthat having a variety of plans in the private sector would produce \ncompetition, and competition would serve to hold down the cost of \nmedicine. Now there is concrete proof that competition alone is not \nserving to be an adequate strategy for containing the cost of medicine. \nThat is why the bipartisan amendment Senator Snowe and I have been \npursuing since the prescription drug program went into effect several \nyears ago is much needed.\n  When you have these higher prescription drug prices, premiums seniors \nhave to pay almost always bump up. Let's think about what happens if \nyou bump up the premiums the seniors pay for Medicare Part D. One of \nthe things I have seen in my years of working with older people--it \ngoes back to my days when I was director of the Gray Panthers--is you \njack up the premiums on seniors and, as sure as the night follows the \nday, you will get fewer seniors enrolling in the program.\n  We understand that if this program is going to be successful over the \nlong term, you have to get more seniors signed up. You have to get more \nseniors enrolled. But what happens when you have higher drug prices as \nAARP and Families USA found, will be higher premiums next year for \nseniors in the Part D program. Then all of a sudden, with higher prices \nand higher premiums, what will happen is fewer seniors will sign up for \nthe program. And without them enrolling in this program, Part D will \nnot be the success we all would like to it to be, especially those of \nus who voted for it.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes today to talk about two issues: the \nquestion of needless oil company subsidies, an effort Senator Kyl and I \nhave spearheaded that has significant bipartisan support for saving \ntaxpayers money, getting us on track for a fresh, new energy policy \nthat can truly make us free of our dependence on foreign oil; and this \nquestion of prescription drug costs where, as well. There is \nsignificant bipartisan support to put bargaining power in Medicare. The \nSnowe-Wyden amendment received 54 votes the last time the Senate voted \non it. There is a real role for the Senate to play at this key time now \nthat it has been reported that drug prices jumped up in the first \nquarter of this year just as the Medicare Part D Program was going into \neffect.\n  Finally, we understand that on the Senate calendar there is not going \nto be a time for every possible issue to be considered. In the case of \nenergy and health care, there are hundreds of bills in both areas, both \nenergy and medical services, that have been introduced by Senators of \nboth parties. My hope is that a handful of these issues can be moved to \nthe head of the queue. The real measure for consideration ought to be \nsignificant bipartisan support.\n  In the areas I have talked about this afternoon, that test has been \nmet. The other body has already passed efforts to reduce these needless \noil subsidies, essentially passed the very thing I talked about on the \nfloor of the Senate for 5 hours. A majority of Senators have voted for \nthe effort Senator Snowe and I have spearheaded to hold down the cost \nof medicine. There are opportunities, at a time when the country is \nlooking at the partisanship coming from Washington, DC, to bring the \nSenate together around good and bipartisan legislation that addresses \nthe pocketbook concerns of the American people. That is why I have come \nto the Chamber to talk about how we can make a difference working \ntogether for the public.\n  It is my intention to come back in the weeks ahead to talk about \nsimilar efforts that can actually be passed in the Senate before the \nsession wraps up and constitute the kind of good government the \nAmerican people expect from the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 4 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S.J. Res. 12, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 12) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to \n     prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \n     States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution which had been \nreported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an amendment, as \nfollows:\n  [Omit the part struck through and insert the part printed in italic.]\n\n                              S.J. Res. 12\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States [within 7 years after the \n     date of its submission by the Congress] within seven years \n     after the date of its submission for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article __\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, \nhas reported to the floor an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States which would authorize legislation to prohibit burning of \nthe American flag.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in Texas v. Johnson in 1989 \nand again in United States v. Eichman in 1990, in a 5-to-4 decision \nruled that the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution relating to \nfreedom of speech would be violated by legislation which prohibited \nflag burning.\n  At the outset of the debate on this amendment, it is vital to note \nthat the pending amendment does not seek to alter the language of the \nfirst amendment. The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution \nprotecting speech, religion, press, and assembly is inviolate, really \nsacrosanct. But that is not to say the decisions of the Supreme Court \nof the United States have that same status.\n  We have, since the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 and the \nBill of Rights, the 10 amendments, in 1791, held freedom of speech as \none of our highest values, along with freedom of religion, freedom of \nthe press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the \nGovernment. But decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States \nare, in a sense, transitory. They have the final word, and we respect \ntheir judgment, but our constitutional process allows for amendments in \na complicated way. It has to pass both Houses of the Congress by two-\nthirds vote and then be ratified by three-fourths of the States. So it \nis a high bar to change what the Supreme Court of the United States \nsays the Constitution means.\n  The five Justices who found the first amendment violated are Justice \nBrennan, Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Scalia, and \nJustice Kennedy. The four Justices in dissent were Chief Justice \nRehnquist, Justice White, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Stevens. So had \nthe Court been slightly differently constituted, we wouldn't be talking \nabout a constitutional amendment.\n  It is important to focus on the basic fact that the text of the first \namendment, the text of the Constitution, the text of the Bill of \nRights, is not involved. It is the decision by the Supreme Court, it is \nthe decision where any one of five made a majority. It is that \ndifference of opinion that is at issue, and it is important to note \nthat when decisions are rendered by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, they are the ``opinion'' of the Court. There is no verity, \nthere is no absolutism, unlike what might be contended for the \nConstitution itself, especially the first amendment.\n  It is important to note that there have been many decisions by the \nSupreme Court of the United States which have limited freedom of speech \nunder the first amendment. The first case which comes to mind is the \nfamous opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes saying that an \nindividual could not cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. People have a \nright to speak, but there are limitations as to how people may exercise \nfreedom of speech, and that is one limitation.\n  A Supreme Court decision in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire in 1942 had \nspecial significance when the Court decided that fighting words were \nnot protected by the constitutional protection of freedom of speech. \nThe defendant in a criminal case had used condemnatory curse words, a \nfight resulted, and he was convicted. The Court said freedom of speech \ndid not go that far and upheld his conviction.\n  The Court observed in that case a standard which is significant, and \nthat is:\n\n       It has been well observed that such utterances are no \n     essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such \n     slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that \n     may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social \n     interest in order and morality.\n\n  I believe that standard applies to flag burning.\n  We have had other instances where the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has limited freedom of speech. For example, on inciting unlawful \nconduct, you can say what you please, but you cannot incite others to \nunlawful conduct and then defend on the ground of freedom of speech.\n  Obscenity cases are another line of decisions, complex decisions, \nconduct which is gauged by contemporary community standards and the \nquestion of whether the speech has its dominant appeal to prurient \ninterests. It is pretty hard to define what that means. That was a \ndefinition I wrestled with consistently when I was assistant attorney \nof Philadelphia to make a determination as to where freedom of \nexpression and freedom of speech crossed the line.\n  On pornography, which is a lesser standard, you don't have to go to \nthe level of obscenity on pornography if children are involved. There \nagain, the first amendment protection for freedom of speech does not \ncover it.\n  An individual in our society does not have the constitutional right \nto make false statements of fact, but that individual may be taken to a \ncourt of law, sued, and damages collected for slander, verbal false \nstatements of fact, or libel, written false statements of fact.\n  Similarly, the first amendment does not protect speech which \nconstitutes threats of violence. And just last month in a widely noted \ncase, the Supreme Court decided that governmental employees have limits \non what their speech can contain.\n  The Chaplinsky decision, which I cited a few moments ago, sets a \nstandard which, as a generalization, notes that there will not be \nprotection for utterances which are no essential part of any exposition \nof ideas and therefore are of slight social value.\n  It is my opinion--and again, I denominate it as an opinion, just as \nthe Supreme Court of the United States denominates its decisions as \nopinions. We all have our own opinions. We are all entitled to our own \nopinions. If there are enough opinions to the contrary of the five \nSupreme Court Justices--that is, the opinions of two-thirds of the \nSenate and two-thirds of the House of Representatives and three-fourths \nof the legislatures of the States--then we may make a modification of \nwhat the Supreme Court has said in declaring that flag burning is \nprotected by freedom of speech.\n  It is my sense that under the Supreme Court decision in Chaplinsky, \nwe are dealing with conduct which is not an essential part of an \nexposition of ideas and does not have social value as a step to the \ntruth, and that whatever is derived from it is clearly outweighed by \nthe social interest in order and tranquility. It is my view that flag \nburning is a form of expression which is spiteful or vengeful or \ndesigned to antagonize, designed to hurt. It is not designed to \npersuade.\n  Again referring to the opinion of perhaps America's greatest Jurist, \nOliver\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nWendell Holmes, on the Supreme Court in the case Abrams v. United \nStates, decided in 1919, Justice Holmes noted that time has upset many \nfighting faiths. Time has upset many fighting faiths, and ideas and \nconcepts and doctrines which men and women think are veritable truths \nmay turn out not to be so. That opinion which I studied in law school a \nfew years ago made the deepest impression on me of any which I have \never read. I think that is really the hallmark of freedom of speech, \nand that is in the context of seeking to persuade the marketplace of \nideas. When Holmes said that time has upset many fighting faiths, he \nwas extraordinarily prescient in that declaration.\n  In evaluating the speech issue and in evaluating what I believe is an \nappropriate resolution of the pending constitutional amendment, I think \nof the veterans in our society and I think of the veterans' expectation \nof the sanctity of the flag. I think of the flag as a symbol of what \nveterans fought for, what they sustained wounds for, what they \nsustained loss of limbs for, and what they sustained loss of life for.\n  In being the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nsome 6 years and a ranking member a number of years beyond, I had more \nduties than most would on veterans' issues. The veterans, with some \nsubstantial justification, repeatedly made the point at our hearings \nthat they were not treated right for the sacrifices they had made; that \nwhen it came to compensation and disability, the Nation which has \ncalled upon them to fight wars and sustain wounds and sustain loss of \nlimbs, comrades who have given their lives, the Nation was not very \nappreciative or grateful or didn't reciprocate with the kinds of \nbenefits to which the veterans thought and think they are entitled to. \nIt is a continuing battle, given the budget limitations.\n  The Congress of the United States is very much concerned about \nveterans' rights and veterans' benefits, and we make an effort, but in \nso many cases, it has been my judgment, reflected in my views and my \nvotes and my chairmanship of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, that we \nare not sufficiently considerate, and not a matter of being generous \nbut not sufficiently just with our veterans.\n  When it comes to the issue of flag burning, I have heard many \nveterans express deep concern about disrespect for the American flag, \nwhich they equate as disrespect for them, disrespect for the sacrifices \nthey and their buddies have made.\n  I think of my brother's service in the U.S. Navy, and I think of \nMorton Specter, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. I think of \nthe service of my brother-in-law, Arthur Morganstern, who served in the \nSouth Pacific for 31 months and came home to find a 2-year-old baby \ndaughter from whom he had been separated for a protracted period of \ntime, and fortunately came home in time.\n\n  My own service stateside during the Korean war was something I was \nproud to do. I did not face the rigors of combat, although when you are \nin the service, you respond to what the service tells you to do.\n  I also think of the service of my father, Harry Specter, an \nimmigrant. It always makes me mindful of immigrants who have built this \ncountry. My mother, too, was an immigrant. She came at the age of 6 \nwith her family from the Ukraine. I have had some comments about their \ncontributions to this country in another context as we have talked \nabout immigration reform, which is now pending before the conference \ncommittee of the House and Senate. My father came to this country at \nthe age of 18, in 1911. The czar wanted to send him to Russia, and he \nwanted to go to Kansas.\n  As I say sometimes in jest, it was a close call, but he got to go to \nKansas. But he didn't know that when he sailed steerage from Europe to \nthe United States, he had a round-trip ticket to France--not to Paris \nand the dancing girls, but to the Argonne Forest. It took exactly 30 \ndays for the U.S. Army to induct Harry Specter in Fairbrook, NE, and \nship him overseas. He didn't have a whole lot of training, but he was \n``cannon fodder,'' as they expressed. These Doughboys were meant for \nthe enemy German cannons. They all had a bull's eye painted on their \nback. He went to war, and he was wounded in action. He was struck by \nshrapnel, and he carried shrapnel in his legs until the day he died.\n  When my father was in need of medical care, when he had a serious \naccident where a spindle bolt broke on a pickup truck when my sister \nwas driving and rolled over and broke his arm, he was taken to the \nveterans hospital in Wichita, KS, where we lived. I was 7 at the time \nand would ride a bicycle out many miles from the residential section of \ntown to where the veterans hospital was located. Now it is all built \nup. I had some exposure to the veterans there, and I have had exposure \nto veterans as I have traveled around Pennsylvania and on a trip I made \nin 1991 around the country to look at veterans' hospitals when I was on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee to see if we had adequate care for the \nveterans who might come back injured from the gulf war. Fortunately, we \ndid not have many casualties from the Gulf War in 1991.\n  I visited the veterans at Walter Reed, as so many of us have, to try \nto give them a morale uplift and to tell them how much we appreciate \ntheir service. It is very difficult for those who go to visit them, \nwith their artificial limbs and their loss of arms and their metallic \nlegs. It is obviously disquieting to see them and realize how \ndifficult, how tragic it is for them. Their spirits, by and large, are \nremarkable. But I think of our veteran population when I think about \nthis amendment. I don't want to dwell on it overly, but I do not think \nit is an irrelevancy when we consider this flag protection amendment \nand consider what the expectations are.\n  During the Memorial Day recess I had occasion to travel to Europe to \nvisit veterans' cemeteries with the Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nSenator Craig, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee now, led \na delegation with the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr, who is presiding at the moment, and Senator Johnny Isakson from \nGeorgia. I was along, and it was an enormously moving experience to see \nthe rows of white crosses and the rows of Stars of David. We went to \nthe cemeteries in the Netherlands. We went to the cemeteries in \nnorthern France not too far from the Argonne Forest where my father had \nfought. We went to the cemetery in Normandy and saw those steep cliffs \nand marveled at how our troops, on June 6, 1944, could scale those \ncliffs to lead to the invasion of Europe and free the world of the \ndespotism of Nazi Germany and Hitler's annihilation of 6 million Jews \nand the treachery of Mussolini and the treachery of the war in the \nPacific with the Japanese.\n  I made a report to the Senate--as I do on my foreign travel--a week \nago today. I noted in that report that when my father, Harry Specter, \nwas hit by shrapnel in the legs, the possibility--as I saw in viewing \nthe World War I cemeteries--noted that in World War I, there were \n126,000 deaths; in World War II, 407,300 deaths; and, of course, Harry \nSpecter was not in one of the cemeteries. But had the shrapnel hit him \na little higher, Harry Specter might have been in one of those \ncemeteries and he wouldn't have been my father and I wouldn't have \nbeen. Of all the sobering thoughts, none can compare to that one.\n  I have voted on the constitutional amendment in the past when, years \nago, I voted in favor of the constitutional amendment to protect the \nflag, so these thoughts are not new to me or a change of heart. But it \nis my view that given the expectation of so many Americans, especially \nAmerican veterans, and given the fact that the text of the first \namendment is in no way altered by this amendment, but it is only a \ndecision by the Supreme Court of the United States, the opinion of five \nthat freedom of speech precludes flag burning, and the opinion of four \nJustices that freedom of speech should not preclude flag burning, it is \nmy opinion that the opinions of the five Justices ought not to \ndominate, and the opinions of the four Justices ought to dominate, \nprovided that their opinion is the opinion of two-thirds of this body, \ntwo-thirds of the House, and the opinion of three-quarters of the State \nlegislatures, which provides the constitutional basis for a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my printed statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          2006 flag amendment\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to support Senate \n     Joint Resolution 12, which proposes a constitutional \n     amendment allowing Congress to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the American flag. I will vote in support of \n     this resolution. I do not take this step lightly. Just three \n     weeks ago, I voted against a proposed constitutional \n     amendment to define marriage as the union of one man and one \n     woman. I did so not because I do not support traditional \n     marriage, but because I believe that we have not reached the \n     point in time where the extraordinary measure of a \n     constitutional amendment has become necessary. The states \n     have shown that they are willing and able to preserve \n     traditional marriage, and the Supreme Court has not stepped \n     in to take that power away from them.\n       With regard to the protection of our most cherished \n     national symbol, though, we have unfortunately reached the \n     point where we cannot protect our flag by any means short of \n     a constitutional amendment. In 1989, the Supreme Court's 5-4 \n     decision in Texas v. Johnson stripped from the people the \n     ability--through their elected representatives--to make laws \n     to protect our flag. Prior to the Texas v. Johnson decision, \n     48 states had laws on the books prohibiting flag desecration. \n     There was also a 1968 federal law in place to prohibit \n     desecration of the flag. The 1968 law made it a crime to \n     ``knowingly cast contempt upon any flag of the United States \n     by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning, or \n     trampling upon it.'' (Pub. L. 90-381.)\n       These state and federal laws existed because it appeared to \n     be beyond question that we could act to protect the American \n     flag. In addition to the law prohibiting flag desecration, \n     Congress had prescribed detailed rules for the flag's design, \n     the times and occasions for its display, and particular \n     protocols for conduct during the raising, lowering, and \n     passing of the flag. In 1907 in Halter v. Nebraska, the \n     Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a Nebraska \n     statute that prohibited the use of the flag for advertising \n     purposes.\n       In later years, the Court continued to recognize the right \n     of the people to protect our flag. In Spence v. Washington, \n     the Court struck down a student's conviction for taping a \n     peace symbol to a flag. But in striking down the conviction, \n     the Court was careful to note that the defendant ``did not \n     permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it.'' In the same \n     year, in Smith v. Goguen, the Court held that a Massachusetts \n     flag misuse statute was impermissibly vague, but explained \n     that ``nothing prevents a legislature from defining with \n     substantial certainty what constitutes forbidden treatment of \n     United States flags.'' In his concurrence, Justice White went \n     even further, stating that ``[t]he flag is a national \n     property, and the Nation may regulate those who would make, \n     imitate, sell, possess, or use it. I would not question those \n     statutes which proscribe mutilation, defacement, or burning \n     of the flag or which otherwise protect its physical integrity \n     . . . .''\n       In Street v. New York in 1969, the Court struck down a \n     protester's conviction for flag burning, but only because it \n     was unclear whether he was arrested for his conduct in \n     defacing the flag or for the statements he made as he did so. \n     Dissenting from the 5-4 majority opinion, Chief Justice Earl \n     Warren explained that ``the States and the Federal Government \n     do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \n     desecration and disgrace.'' Justice Hugo Black, the ardent \n     exponent of First Amendment absolutism, stated in his dissent \n     that, ``[i]t passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American flag an offense.''\n       And Justice Abe Fortas articulated ``the reasons why the \n     States and the Federal Government have the power to protect \n     the flag from acts of desecration committed in public.'' He \n     explained that the flag is ``traditionally and universally \n     subject to special rules and regulation,'' and that ownership \n     of a flag is ``subject to special burdens and \n     responsibilities.'' Although ``[a] flag may be property, in a \n     sense,'' ``it is a property burdened with peculiar \n     obligations and restrictions'' and ``these special conditions \n     are not per se arbitrary or beyond governmental power under \n     our Constitution.''\n       In light of these repeated statements of support for the \n     flag from the Supreme Court, it was a surprise when a bare, \n     five-justice majority of the Court in Texas v. Johnson struck \n     down Texas's flag protection act and invalidated the laws of \n     48 states and the federal government.\n       Congress reacted swiftly to protect the flag by passing the \n     Flag Protection Act of 1999, which made it a crime to \n     knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn, keep on \n     the ground or floor, or trample upon the United States flag. \n     We tried to work within the confines of Texas v. Johnson to \n     ensure that the Flag Protection Act would not target \n     expressive conduct based on the content of its message. But \n     the very next year, in United States v. Eichman, five \n     justices of the Supreme Court the same five justices who \n     struck down the Texas statute in Texas v. Johnson, held that \n     Congress could not protect the flag through even a neutral \n     desecration statute.\n       This amendment is an extremely narrow solution to correct \n     those two opinions in the only way the American people can. \n     For 198 years, from the ratification of the Bill of Rights in \n     1791 until the Texas v. Johnson decision in 1989, the states \n     and the Congress were free to protect the flag from \n     desecration and defilement. Can it be reasonably argued that, \n     for those 198 years, Americans lacked the freedom of speech \n     guaranteed by the First Amendment?\n       I question whether defilement of the flag should even be \n     considered ``speech'' protected by the First Amendment. To \n     quote Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting in Texas v. \n     Johnson:\n       ``[F]lag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt \n     or roar that, it seems fair to say, is more likely to be \n     indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to \n     antagonize others. . . . The Texas statute deprived Johnson \n     of only one rather inarticulate form of protest--a form of \n     protest that was profoundly offensive to many--and left him \n     with a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable \n     form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of \n     national policy.''\n       Flag burning is the equivalent of ``fighting words,'' those \n     words ``which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend \n     to incite an immediate breach of the peace.'' Chaplinsky v. \n     New Hampshire. Fighting words are just one category of \n     expression that the First Amendment has never protected, for \n     the First Amendment has never been a blanket cover for every \n     conceivable form of expression. We have long recognized \n     numerous exceptions to the First Amendment's freedom of \n     expression, including: incitement to unlawful conduct; libel \n     and slander; obscenity; child pornography; and threats of \n     physical harm.\n       In other instances, we have balanced an interest in \n     legitimate speech against overarching societal interests. For \n     example, Congress has passed copyright laws that limit a \n     speaker's ability to use the words of another person. The \n     Supreme Court has also held that government employees do not \n     have an absolute right to free speech for statements made in \n     the workplace.\n       Just because conduct may have some expressive element, it \n     does not mean that it is entitled to First Amendment \n     protection. None of us would question the government's power \n     to prohibit vandalism of the Washington Monument, the Vietnam \n     Wall, or this beautiful Capitol building, even if the vandal \n     were expressing his outrage with government policies. Indeed, \n     Justice White stated in 1974 that ``[t]here would seem to be \n     little question about the power of Congress to forbid the \n     mutilation of the Lincoln Memorial. . . . The flag is itself \n     a monument, subject to similar protection.'' Just as we do \n     not allow criminals to deface the symbols of our Nation that \n     stand throughout this city, we should not allow vandalization \n     and desecration of our most precious and most recognizable \n     national symbol.\n       We do not limit the expressive rights of those who wish to \n     voice dissatisfaction with our government by declaring flag \n     desecration off-limits any more than we do by prohibiting \n     desecration of our national buildings and monuments. The \n     avenues for expressing dissent are still wide open--``a full \n     panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal \n     expression.''\n       All this amendment seeks to do is restore to Congress the \n     power it held for those 198 years before five justices took \n     it away in Texas v. Johnson: the power to protect our flag. \n     That's all. The amendment itself does not even prohibit flag \n     burning or other forms of flag desecration. The text of the \n     amendment is very simple: ``The Congress shall have power to \n     prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \n     States.'' In other words, the amendment says, let's give the \n     people of the United States, through their elected \n     representatives, the right to offer protection to our most \n     cherished national symbol.\n       There are those who claim that because our liberties are \n     enshrined in the Constitution, the flag is not properly \n     viewed as the symbol of our liberty. They claim that those of \n     us who support restoring to the people the ability to protect \n     the flag are not true defenders of the Constitution. Those \n     critics are wrong. One of the most important aspects of our \n     constitutional system is its recognition that we may, from \n     time to time, need to amend our founding document to reflect \n     the will of the people. Article 5 gives the people this most \n     important right. It takes a super-majority of Americans to do \n     so--two-thirds of the people's elected representatives here \n     in Congress and three-fourths of the states--so we can rest \n     assured that our Constitution is only amended when it is \n     absolutely necessary. But when the opinion of five unelected \n     judges overrides the voice of the people expressed through 48 \n     state laws and a national flag protection law, how can we say \n     an amendment is not necessary?\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in Texas v. Johnson that: \n     ``The cry of `no taxation without representation' animated \n     those who revolted against the English Crown to found our \n     Nation--the idea that those who submitted to government \n     should have some say as to what kind of laws would be passed. \n     Surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society is to \n     legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and \n     profoundly offensive to the majority of people whether it be \n     murder, embezzlement, pollution, or flag-burning.''\n       Our Constitution lives by giving the American people a \n     means to raise their voices over the words of five justices \n     here in Washington. The American people have called on\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\n     the members of this body to protect our most cherished \n     national symbol, and I agree with that sentiment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now on the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in 1791, the year that the Bill of Rights became part \nof our Constitution, the State of Vermont joined the Union, and then \nthe State of Kentucky followed. Then Congress saw fit to change the \ndesign of the American flag to include 15 stars and 15 stripes, one for \neach State. In fact, it was this flag, the one recognizing the addition \nof Vermont and Kentucky to the United States, that flew over Fort \nMcHenry in 1814 and that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the \n``Star-Spangled Banner.''\n  Fifty years after that famous battle that inspired our National \nAnthem in Baltimore's harbor, President Abraham Lincoln visited that \ncity as our country confronted its greatest test. It was a time in \nwhich this Nation faced grave peril from a civil war whose outcome \ncould not yet be determined. Many flags flew over various parts of the \nUnited States, and our existence as a nation was in doubt. President \nLincoln used the occasion to reflect on a basic feature of American \ndemocracy. President Lincoln observed:\n\n       The world has never had a good definition of the word \n     liberty. The American people just now are much in need of \n     one. We all declare for liberty, but using the same word we \n     do not mean the same thing.\n\n  I would hope that all of us in this Chamber champion liberty. If any \nof us were asked, we would say: Of course we do. But when I hear some \ntalk about the desire to restrict our fundamental freedoms by cutting \nback on our first amendment rights for the first time in our history, \nyou see why people wonder. The danger of this amendment is that it \nwould strike at the values the flag represents and the rights that have \nmade this Nation a vibrant democratic republic in which we have enjoyed \nfreedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and \nfreedom to think as individuals.\n  Along with Vermonters, I find the American flag inspirational in all \nits incarnations, whether it is the current flag with 50 stars that was \ncarried in formation at Parris Island when my youngest son Mark became \na proud member of the U.S. Marine Corps; whether it is the American \nflag with 48 stars under which Vermonters joined in fighting World War \nII, including members of my family; the flag commemorating Vermont's \nbecoming a State; the Bennington flag that commemorated our Declaration \nof Independence; or the revolutionary flag with 13 stars in a circle \nsaid to be designed by George Washington and sewn by Betsy Ross.\n  Ultimately, the debate over this amendment turns on the scope we \nthink proper to give to speech which deeply offends us. For two-thirds \nof the Senate to vote to amend the Bill of Rights to amend the U.S. \nConstitution because, as the Constitution requires, that we deem it \n``necessary'' in 2006, strikes me as extraordinary. The Senate oath of \noffice, which the people of Vermont have authorized me to take six \ntimes, requires that we ``support and defend the Constitution.'' And I \nbelieve that doing so means opposing this effort to cut back on \nVermonters' constitutional rights and freedoms.\n  Regrettably, the Senate leadership is returning again and again to \nusing constitutional amendments as election year rallying cries to \nexcite the passion of voters. That is wrong. The Constitution is too \nimportant to be used for partisan political purposes--and so, in my \nview, is our American flag.\n  With the rights of Americans being threatened in so many ways today \nby this administration, this is most especially not the time for the \nSenate to vote to limit Americans' fundamental rights or to strike at \nthe heart of the First Amendment.\n  The chairman has referred to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. It was \nJustice Holmes who wrote that the most imperative principle of our \nConstitution was it protects not just freedom for the thought and \nexpression we agree with, but ``freedom for the thought that we hate.'' \nHe also wrote that ``we should be eternally vigilant against attempts \nto check the expression of opinions that we loathe.''\n  We all know that the First Amendment never requires people to defend \nit when it is upholding popular speech. It needs defense when the \nspeech is unpopular.\n  What is so distinctive about America is that our Government does not \nendorse religious or political orthodoxy. The price of our freedom of \nexpression is our willingness to protect the expression of those with \nwhom we disagree. America does not impose a state-designed dogma on its \nfree people the way totalitarian regimes do. We value our freedom and \nwe protect the freedom of others.\n  Justice Robert Jackson made this point with unsurpassed eloquence in \na Supreme Court decision made during World War II. He did this in West \nVirginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. His decision for the \nSupreme Court upheld our fundamental tradition of tolerance, holding \nthat State school boards may not compel teachers and students to salute \nthe flag.\n  Remember, Justice Jackson was writing during World War II--during \nwartime. He wrote:\n\n       [F]reedom to differ is not limited to things that do not \n     matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test \n     of its substance is the right to differ as to things that \n     touch the heart of the existing order. If there is any fixed \n     star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no \n     official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox \n     in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of \n     opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their \n     faith therein.\n\n  That was a powerful statement by Justice Jackson, at a time when \ncertainly the attention of this country was focused on a real war \neffort, the effort of World War II. But he knew what unifies our \ncountry is the voluntary sharing of ideals and commitments. Americans \nare free, free to offend but also free to respond to crude insults with \nresponsible action--the way many of us remember and applaud--when that \ncrowd at Dodger Stadium responded by spontaneously singing ``God Bless \nAmerica'' when a couple of miscreants attempted to burn the American \nflag in the outfield 30 years ago, shortly after the end of the Vietnam \nwar.\n  When I am home in Vermont, our family home, I fly the flag--not \nbecause the law tells me to but because, as an American, I want to. I \nfly the flag out of pride. I remember my parents, still alive, when \nthey used to look with pride to see that flag flying and they knew \ntheir son was home from Washington. It is the same sense of pride I \nfelt when I saw my son march in uniform under that flag, our flag, our \nAmerican flag. It is the same sense of pride I feel when I see that \nflag flying over this Capitol Building when I come to work each day, \nand I stop and look at it sometimes when the Senate leaves at 2 or 3 \no'clock in the morning. I look at the dome and I see that flag \nilluminated and flying there.\n  One of my colleagues, former Senator Bob Kerrey, a man of great \nbravery, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery \nin battle, said in a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post, \n``Real patriotism cannot be coerced.'' It has to be a voluntary, \nunselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the washingtonpost.com, June 15, 2006]\n\n                        Our Flag and Our Freedom\n\n                            (By Bob Kerrey)\n\n       With campaigns at full tilt and the Fourth of July just \n     around the comer, the Senate's new priority is to debate and \n     vote on yet another resolution to amend our remarkable \n     Constitution. This time it's an amendment that would allow \n     Congress to prohibit a form of protest that a large majority \n     of Americans do not like: the burning or desecration of the \n     American flag. Since 1989, when the Supreme Court decided \n     unanimously and correctly that these rare, unpleasant \n     demonstrations are expressions of speech and therefore \n     protected by the First Amendment, there have been many such \n     attempts. Fortunately, all have failed.\n       Unfortunately, enthusiasm for this amendment appears to \n     have grown even as flag-burning incidents have vanished as a \n     means of political protest. The last time I saw an image of \n     the U.S. flag being desecrated in this way was nearly 20 \n     years ago, when the court issued its decision. Thus this \n     amendment--never appropriate in the oldest democracy on \n     earth--has become even less necessary. But necessity is not \n     always the mother of legislation.\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n       In defense of speech I do not like, I recall a ceremony I \n     have come to love: a military funeral. The finest of all is \n     conducted at Arlington National Cemetery. At graveside, an \n     honor guard holds the American flag while taps are played as \n     a final farewell. The guards then fold the flag into a \n     triangle and deliver it to the next of kin.\n       It is as if the flag becomes the fallen. In the hands of a \n     widow or mother it is much more than a symbol of the nation. \n     At that moment the American flag is a sacred object that \n     holds the sweet memory of a life given to a higher cause. Or \n     so it seems to me each time I am witness to these hallowed \n     events.\n       To others the ceremony may mean something entirely \n     different. I recall vividly one such situation: A mother of a \n     friend who was killed in Vietnam recoiled when the flag was \n     offered to her. She would not take it. In her heart the \n     American flag had become a symbol of dishonor, treachery and \n     betrayal. At the time, and perhaps to her dying day, she \n     wanted nothing to do with it.\n       If our First Amendment is altered to permit laws to be \n     passed prohibiting flag desecration, would we like to see our \n     police powers used to arrest an angry mother who burns a \n     flag? Or a brother in arms whose disillusionment leads him to \n     defile this symbol of the nation? I hope the answer is no. I \n     hope we are strong enough to tolerate such rare and wrenching \n     moments. I hope our desire for calm and quiet does not make \n     it a crime for any to demonstrate in such a fashion. In \n     truth, if I know anything about the spirit of our \n     compatriots, some Americans might even choose to burn \n     their flag in protest of such a law.\n       No doubt the sponsors and advocates of this amendment mean \n     well. They believe it is a reasonable and small sacrifice of \n     our freedoms. They believe no serious consequence will come \n     of this change.\n       No doubt, too, some of the increasing interest in limiting \n     free speech is a response to the Sept. 11 attacks on the \n     United States. It was a remarkable moment, when the hearts of \n     most of us filled with a kind of pure patriotism we had never \n     felt before. It was a patriotism that bound liberty to \n     equality and fraternity. It was a patriotism that brought us \n     together, friend and stranger alike. We discovered heroes who \n     inspired us. No longer did we say, ``It's good to see you,'' \n     and not mean it.\n       Most impressive to me was that the ``we'' included men and \n     women of many nations, every religion and every ethnic group. \n     The ``we'' was global. The patriotism we felt extended beyond \n     our boundaries and beyond the cramped spaces of ritual \n     nationalistic fervor. We understood that the vulnerability of \n     our freedom bound us together more than any symbol or slogan \n     can. Millions of Americans, then and now, proudly flew their \n     flags because they wanted to, not because any law told them \n     to.\n       All the more reason, then, for patriotism to turn aside the \n     understandable impulse to protect our flag by degrading the \n     constitutional freedoms for which it stands. Real patriotism \n     cannot be coerced. Our freedom to speak was attacked--not our \n     flag. The former, not the latter, needs the protection of our \n     Constitution and our laws.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The French philosopher Voltaire once remarked that liberty \nis a guest who plants both of his elbows on the table. I think what \nVoltaire meant by that is that liberty is sometimes even an unmannerly, \nvulgar guest, yet liberty requires we tolerate rudeness even when \nadmittedly it is hard to do so. That is what allows us, in turn, the \nindividual freedoms that we cherish for ourselves.\n  Despicable, outrageous gestures like flag burning are hard to \ntolerate, but we do so because political expression is so central as to \nwhat makes America great and what protects the rights of each of us to \nspeak, or to worship as we choose, and to petition our Government for \nredress. The flag is a symbol of the greatness that the American ideals \nof freedom and liberty have helped foster in this blessed land. The \nConstitution ultimately goes beyond symbols. The Constitution is the \nreal bedrock of our rights.\n  In a letter to me expressing his opposition to the constitutional \namendment, my friend General Colin Powell said it very well. Let me \nquote Colin Powell in this regard. He said:\n\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration. . . .\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag. . . . I feel the same sense of \n     outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to \n     relieve that outrage. The First Amendment exists to insure \n     that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to \n     that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we \n     find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly, long \n     after they have slunk away.\n\n  What powerful, powerful words from General Powell. I ask unanimous \nconsent a copy of his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                               Alexandria, VA,\n\n                                                     May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking \n     my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. \n     Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is \n     under consideration. Few countries in the world would think \n     of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting \n     such a symbol.\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after \n     they have slunk away.\n       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will \n     create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge \n     from such an amendment.\n       If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the \n     proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the \n     views of those who would. For or against, we all love our \n     flag with equal devotion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n       P.S. The attached 1989 article by a Vietnam POW gave me \n     further inspiration for my position.\n\n                 [From the Retired Officer, Sept. 1989]\n\n     Thoughts of a Former POW: When They Burned the Flag Back Home\n\n                          (By James H. Warner)\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark AB in the \n     Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I looked up and \n     saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as tears filled my \n     eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country more than at \n     that moment. Although I have received the Silver Star Medal \n     and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared with the \n     gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to serve the \n     cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time after five and a half years, it \n     hurts me to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. But I \n     have been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit \n     of hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the \n     flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish \n     the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were \n     wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released \n     early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful \n     accepted, most did not. In our minds, early release under \n     those conditions would amount to a betrayal of our comrades, \n     of our country and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of use were tortured, and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the \n     summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutrition. I had \n     long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal \n     parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our \n     cause worth all of this? Yes, it was worth all this and more.\n       Rose Wilder Lane, in her magnificent book The Discovery of \n     Freedom, said there are two fundamental truths that men must \n     know in order to be free. They must know that all men are \n     brothers, and they must know that all men are born free. Once \n     men accept these two ideas, they will never accept bondage. \n     The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal to teach \n     slaves to read.\n       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp. \n     Marxists believe that ideas are merely the product of \n     material conditions; change those material conditions, and \n     one will change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``re-\n     educate'' us. If we could show them that we would not abandon \n     our beliefs in fundamental principles, then\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\n     we could prove the falseness of their doctrine. We could \n     subvert them by teaching them about freedom through our \n     example. We could show them the power of ideas.\n       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country \n     protest against your cause. That proves that you are \n     wrong.''\n       ``No,'' I said. ``That proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an \n     instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party, \n     was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British \n     definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view. Bevan \n     responded, forcefully, that if Khrushchev really wanted to \n     know the difference, he should read the funeral oration of \n     Pericles.\n       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides' \n     History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted \n     democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the \n     Spartans, he said, the Athenians did not fear freedom. \n     Rather, they viewed freedom as the very source of their \n     strength. As it was for Athens, so it is for America--our \n     freedom is not to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. The flag in Dallas was burned to protest the \n     nomination of Ronald Reagan, and he told us how to spread the \n     idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America into \n     a ``city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't \n     be afraid of freedom--it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Another American who honorably served our country, Gary \nMay, Chairman of Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights, wrote in a \nletter:\n\n       This country is unique and special because the minority, \n     the unpopular, the dissident also have a voice. The freedom \n     of expression, even when it hurts the most, is the truest \n     test of our dedication to the principles that our flag \n     represents.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of his letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Veterans Defending\n\n\n                                           The Bill of Rights,\n\n                                        Newburgh, IN, May 4, 2006.\n     Re Oppose S.J. Res. 12, the Flag Desecration Constitutional \n         Amendment.\n\n       Dear Senator: My name is Gary May. I am writing to you \n     today as the chair of a group called Veterans Defending the \n     Bill of Rights to urge you to oppose S.J. Res. 12, the flag \n     desecration constitutional amendment. I know you hear from \n     some who say veterans support this amendment, but you should \n     also know that there are many veterans that have faithfully \n     served our nation who strongly believe that amending the \n     Constitution to ban flag desecration is the antithesis of \n     freedoms they fought to preserve.\n       I lost both my legs in combat while serving in the U.S. \n     Marine Corps in Vietnam. I challenge anyone to find someone \n     who loves this country, its people and what it stands for \n     more than I do. It offends me when I see the flag burned or \n     treated disrespectfully. But, as offensive and painful as \n     this is, I still believe that dissenting voices need to be \n     heard, even if their methods cause offense.\n       This country is unique and special because the minority, \n     the unpopular, the dissident also have a voice. The freedom \n     of expression, even when it hurts the most, is the truest \n     test of our dedication to the principles that our flag \n     represents.\n       In addition to my military combat experience, I have been \n     involved in veterans' affairs as a clinical social worker, \n     program manager, board member of numerous veterans \n     organizations, and advocated on their behalf since 1974. \n     Through all of my work in veterans' affairs, I have yet to \n     hear a veteran say that his or her service and sacrifice was \n     in pursuit of protecting the flag.\n       When confronted with the horrific demands of combat, the \n     simple fact is that most of us fought to stay alive. The \n     pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's in \n     the principles for which it stands for and the people who \n     have defended them.\n       I am grateful for the many heroes of our country. All the \n     sacrifices of those who served before us would be for naught, \n     if the Constitution were amended to cut back on our First \n     Amendment rights for the first time in the history of our \n     great nation. I write to you today to attest to the fact that \n     many veterans do not wish to exchange fought-for freedoms for \n     protecting a tangible object that represents these freedoms.\n       To illustrate my point, here is what some of the Veterans \n     Defending the Bill of Rights have said about this amendment:\n       ``During the fighting in Iraq, I saw friends of mine die in \n     battle. Each of us suffered and sacrificed to provide freedom \n     to the Iraqi people. With this in mind, I am profoundly \n     disturbed by the apparent willingness of Congress to \n     sacrifice our own freedoms here at home by amending the First \n     Amendment for the first time ever. When the coalition forces \n     entered Iraq, it was to topple a brutal and repressive \n     dictatorship, one that did not hesitate to jail and torture \n     its own citizens who protested against it. By amending the \n     Constitution to ban a form of expression, Congress dishonors \n     the legacy of servicemembers who fought and died in defense \n     of freedom.''--Jeremy Broussard, Bowie, MD, a combat veteran \n     of Operation Iraqi Freedom and a former Captain in the U.S. \n     Army whose artillery unit was among the first to enter Iraq.\n       ``The proposed constitutional amendment is in my eyes, and \n     the eyes of countless other veterans, a slap in the face to \n     our service in combat. We volunteered to go to war to protect \n     the freedoms in this country, not watch them be taken away by \n     politicians who have never been to the front lines. I \n     consider myself an independent-minded conservative, and \n     believe that creating unnecessary amendments to the U.S. \n     Constitution is a betrayal of conservative principles.''--\n     Specialist Eric G Eliason, Englewood, CO, a combat veteran \n     who served as an Infantryman in the Army for three years, \n     including one year overseas as part of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom.\n       ``It is a bad thing to burn the flag, but it is a worse \n     thing to damage the Constitution.''--James Pryde, Tuskegee \n     Airman, combat veteran of the 477 Bomber Group in WWII.\n       ``After devoting most of my career to working in military \n     intelligence, I was appointed Army Deputy Chief of Staff for \n     Intelligence in 1997. I served in that position until my \n     retirement in 2000. I am well acquainted with the many \n     threats facing the United States, and I must say that flag \n     burning does not begin to rise to a level of threat \n     justifying the attention of this distinguished body... I \n     served in the United States Army, like my father before me, \n     to defend fundamental American liberties. To begin the trend \n     of amending the First Amendment each time a particular form \n     of speech is found to be offensive sets a dangerous \n     precedent, and undermines the very freedoms for which I and \n     my fellow servicemembers served.''--Lt. General Claudia J. \n     Kennedy (USA, Ret.). Highest ranking woman to ever serve in \n     the U.S. Army.\n       ``Like many of those who have served in the armed forces, I \n     am deeply concerned about this proposed attempt to undermine \n     free speech. While I do take offense at disrespect to the \n     flag, I nonetheless believe it my duty to defend the \n     constitutional right of protestors to use the flag in \n     nonviolent speech.''--Richard Olek, Fargo, ND, Army veteran \n     and past Commander of AMVETS Jon A. Greenley Memorial Post 7 \n     in Fargo.\n       ``Today the U.S. Senate is again debating an amendment to \n     the Constitution to ban desecration of the flag. It's an \n     issue on which I believe I can claim some authority. I laid \n     my life on the line and fought under the flag of the United \n     States during World War II. I watched some of my closest \n     friends fall during eight grueling campaigns, I was awarded a \n     Silver Star and Purple Heart. I'm a disabled veteran and long \n     standing Republican since 1940, and nothing angers me more \n     than the desecration of the U.S. flag. It is an \n     abomination to me and to other veterans. That said, \n     though, I believe the push to amend the Constitution to \n     criminalize flag burning is misguided. Our forefathers \n     would spin in their graves to think: that our government \n     would turn the established principle of free speech on its \n     end and consider persecuting people who disagree with its \n     actions.''--James Bird, Lumberton, NJ, is a decorated \n     veteran of World War II, where he survived eight campaigns \n     in combat and was a liberator of the Dachau concentration \n     camp.\n       ``. . . to undertake to carve out an area of free speech \n     and say that this or that is unpatriotic because it is \n     offensive is a movement that will unravel our liberties and \n     do grave damage to our nation's freedom. The ability to say \n     by speech or dramatic acts what we feel or think is to be \n     cherished not demeaned as unpatriotic ... I hope you will \n     hear my plea. Please do not tinker with the First \n     Amendment.''--Reverend Edgar Lockwood, Falmouth, \n     Massachusetts, served as a naval officer engaged in more than \n     ten combat campaigns in WWII.\n       ``My military service was not about protecting the flag; it \n     was about protecting the freedoms behind it. The flag \n     amendment curtails free speech and expression in a way that \n     should frighten us all.''--Brady Bustany, West Hollywood, \n     California, served in the Air Force during the Gulf War.\n       ``The first amendment to our constitution is the simplest \n     and clearest official guarantee of freedom ever made by a \n     sovereign people to itself. The so-called `flag protection \n     amendment' would be a bureaucratic hamstringing of a noble \n     act. Let us reject in the name of liberty for which so many \n     have sacrificed, the call to ban flag desecration. Let us, \n     rather, allow the first amendment, untrammeled and unfettered \n     by this proposed constitutional red tape, to continue be the \n     same guarantor of our liberty for the next two centuries (at \n     least) that is has been for the last two.''--State Delegate \n     John Doyle, Hampshire County, West Virginia served as an \n     infantry officer in Vietnam.\n       ``As a twenty two year veteran, combat experience, shot up, \n     shot down, hospitalized\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n     more than a year, Purple Heart recipient, with all the proper \n     medals and badges I take very strong exception to anyone who \n     says that burning the flag isn't a way of expressing \n     yourself. In my mind this is clearly covered in Amendment I \n     to the Constitution--and should not be `abridged'.''--Mr. Bob \n     Cordes, Mason, Texas was an Air Force fighter pilot shot down \n     in Vietnam. He served for 22 years from 1956 to 1978.\n       ``Service to our country, not flag waving, is the best way \n     to demonstrate patriotism.''--Mr. Jim Lubbock, St. Louis, \n     Missouri, served with the Army in the Phillipines during \n     WWII. His two sons fought in Vietnam, and members of his \n     family have volunteered for every United States conflict from \n     the American Revolution through Vietnam with the exception of \n     Korea. His direct ancestor, Stephen Hopkins, signed the \n     Declaration of Independence.\n       ``The burning of our flag thoroughly disgusts me. But a law \n     banning the burning of the flag plays right into the hands of \n     the weirdoes who are doing the burning. . . . By banning the \n     burning of the flag, we are empowering them by giving \n     significance to their stupid act. Let them burn the flag and \n     let us ignore them. Then their act carries no \n     significance.''--Mr. William Ragsdale, Titusville, Florida, \n     an engineer who worked in the space industry for over 30 \n     years, retired from the US Naval Reserve in 1984 with the \n     rank of Commander, having served in the Navy for over forty \n     years including active duty in both WWII and the Korean War. \n     He has two sons who served in Vietnam.\n       ``I fought for freedom of expression not for a symbol. I \n     fought for freedom of Speech. I did not fight for the flag, \n     or motherhood, or apple pie. I fought so that my mortal enemy \n     could declare at the top of his lungs that everything I held \n     dear was utter drivel . . . I fought for unfettered \n     expression of ideas. Mine and everybody else's.''--Mr. John \n     Kelley, East Concord, Vermont, lost his leg to a Viet Cong \n     hand grenade while on Operation Sierra with the Fox Company \n     2nd Battalion 7th Marines in 1967.\n       I hope you will join me and the Veterans Defending the Bill \n     of Rights in opposing S.J. Res. 12, the flag desecration \n     constitutional amendment. We must not allow this ``feel \n     good'' measure to restrict freedoms for which so many \n     veterans sacrificed so much. I look forward to working with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Gary E. May.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been to countries, as have many of us, countries \nwith dictators--countries like China and Cuba, the former Soviet Union. \nThey require a law to protect their flags and their symbols. I have \ntaken great pleasure in those countries to point out that America does \nnot need the kind of laws they do. America protects our symbols. The \nAmerican people honor our national flag out of respect, not out of fear \nthat they may break a law. I point out to them what real freedom is, \nand it includes the freedom to dissent and to differ, even in ways that \nI would find obnoxious and offensive.\n  As the son of a printer, I was brought up to know how important the \nFirst Amendment is to maintaining our democracy. It allows us to \npractice any religion we want, or no religion if we want. It allows us \nto think as we choose and to express ourselves freely, even though \nothers may disagree.\n  We do not have a state-imposed orthodoxy in this great and good \ncountry. Instead, we have freedom and diversity--diversity in religion, \ndiversity in thought, diversity in speech, diversity that is guaranteed \nand protected by our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and particularly \nthe First Amendment. When you guarantee and protect diversity, then you \nguarantee and protect democracy. When you guarantee and protect \ndiversity, by definition you are going to have a democracy. No real \ndemocracy exists without diversity. But when you exclude and stamp out \ndiversity and freedom of thought and expression, you act to stamp out \ndemocracy.\n  We have seen this in history. In the former Soviet Union or other \ntotalitarian governments of history, when they wanted to destroy \ndemocracy they started, sometimes in little ways at first, but \nultimately to stamp out diversity in dissent.\n  American democracy has succeeded because we have fought to live with \nthat unruly guest with his elbows on our table of which Voltaire spoke, \nand to tolerate speech and expressive conduct that probably virtually \nall of us here would find disrespectful and crude.\n  We protect dissent, not because we oppose liberty but because we love \nliberty.\n  Wendell Phillips, a great New England abolitionist, wrote:\n\n       The community which dares not to protect its humblest and \n     most hated member in the free utterance of his opinion, no \n     matter how false and hateful, is only a gang of slaves.\n\n  Probably no person disagreed more vehemently with Wendell Phillips on \nthe burning issues of their day than Senator John C. Calhoun of South \nCarolina. Yet Senator Calhoun came to much the same conclusion in a \nspeech he gave on the Senate floor, our Senate floor, in 1848, more \nthan 150 years ago. Senator Calhoun said:\n\n       We have passed through so many difficulties and dangers \n     without the loss of liberty that we have begun to think that \n     we hold it by divine right from heaven itself. But it is \n     harder to preserve than it is to obtain liberty. After years \n     of prosperity the tenure by which it is held is too often \n     forgotten; and I fear, Senators, that such is the case with \n     us.\n\n  This is what Senator Calhoun said 150 years ago.\n  I am immensely proud to be given the privilege to be one of the two \nSenators who have the opportunity to represent the State of Vermont. \nVermont has a proud tradition defending liberty and encouraging open \ndebate. We are the State of the town meeting. If you want to experience \nopen debate, I urge you to attend a Vermont town meeting. Everybody \ngets heard. Everybody gets heard about every disagreement, every \ndiffering view. A Vermont town meeting is as democratic as you can get. \nThere is debate. There is expression. There is disagreement and \nagreement. There is freedom and democracy being lived.\n  In fact, Vermont for many years engaged in such a great and open \ndebate on this very issue of how best to approach protection of our \nflag. For years the Vermont General Assembly remained the only State \nlegislature not to have passed a resolution in favor of a \nconstitutional amendment. In January 2002 the Vermont Legislature \npassed a resolution, but it was written, interestingly, in a manner \nthat shows Vermont's respect for the Constitution. It concludes that \nthe Congress should take steps to ``ensure that proper respect and \ntreatment . . . always be afforded to the flag,'' but in ways \nconsistent with the principles that the flag represents, foremost among \nthese being, ``the protection of individual freedoms enumerated in the \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution, including free \nspeech.''\n  Our Legislature stopped short of taking the easy way out and simply \nparroting a politically popular demand to amend the Constitution. \nRather, Vermont remained true to its proud tradition of encouraging \nopen debate and called on Congress to ``explore all avenues available'' \nto protect the flag from desecration. Vermont's actions are consistent \nwith our strong tradition of independence and commitment to the Bill of \nRights. Indeed, Vermont's own Constitution is based on our commitment \nto freedom and our belief it is best protected by open debate.\n\n  At one time, when we were afraid we might not have that chance for \nopen debate, Vermont declared itself an independent republic. In fact, \nVermont did not and would not become a State until 1791. That was the \nyear the Bill of Rights was ratified. Following that tradition, this \nVermonter is not going to vote to cut back on the First Amendment of \nthe Bill of Rights for the first time since its adoption.\n  Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to Congress. He, incidentally, cast the \ndecisive vote, Vermont's vote, for the election of Thomas Jefferson. \nThat election was thrown into the House of Representatives. Had Matthew \nLyon voted otherwise, Thomas Jefferson would not have become President. \nMatthew Lyon was the same House Member who was a target of a shameful \nprosecution under the Sedition Act in 1789. Why? For comments he made \nin a private letter. And the power of the U.S. Government, under that \nhorrible act, came down on Matthew Lyon. He was locked up for daring to \nbe so critical in a letter.\n  Vermonters showed what they thought of the Sedition Act and what they \nthought of trying to stifle free speech. While Matthew Lyon was in \njail, Vermonters reelected him and sent him back to Congress. Along \nwith our own lone Congressman, Congressman Sanders, I am working on \nthat commitment to having a post office named for Matthew Lyon in \nVermont.\n  Vermont has stood up for the rights of free speech before and since. \nVermont served the Nation during the dark days of McCarthyism. In one \nof the most remarkable and praise-worthy actions of any Senator from \nany\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nState, Vermont Senator Ralph Flanders stood up for democracy in \nopposition to the repressive tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. When \nso many others, both Republicans and Democrats, ran for cover, Senator \nRalph Flanders of Vermont, a Republican, a conservative, a businessman, \ncame to the Senate floor and said: Enough is enough. He asked for the \ncensure of Senator McCarthy and allowed people once more in this \ncountry to speak freely.\n  Vermont has a great tradition we cherish. It is one I intend to \nuphold. I honor the Vermont tradition that includes Senator Flanders \nwhen I oppose cutting back the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights.\n  I know there is an impulse, a natural impulse, to restrict speech \nwith which we disapprove. But America is strong because we do not fear \nfreedom; we do not restrict freedom of speech. We should have \nconfidence our institutions are stronger than a bunch of hooligans and \nthat their ideas are better than those of cranks and crackpots.\n  We know the vast majority of the people in this great country are \npatriotic, especially thinking of September 11 the way the American \npeople have demonstrated patriotism, as rarely in our history. I can \nnever remember a time in our history when I have seen more people fly \nmore flags, and proudly.\n  The crisis confronting America is not flag burning. Americans honor \nflags as a symbol of our country. Americans also know we face real \nchallenges. The confidence of the American people and this Government \nand institutions is quite low. But even though confidence in the \ninstitutions of our Government may be low, Americans love their \ncountry. They respect the flag. It is the misuse of their Government \nfor partisanship, the corruption of the Government and its processes, \nit is a lack of credibility and competence that they see in their \nGovernment that concerns Americans in the face of real threats and real \nproblems.\n  Mark Twain said: Honor your country, question your Government. That \nis what is happening today.\n  I see respect for our flag in the actions and attitudes of the \ncitizens of America. I see it in the dedication of Don Villemaire and \nhis friends of Essex Junction, VT, who stood and proudly waved American \nflags every single night after the horrible tragedy of September 11, \n2001, until the search for remains officially ended. That was a vigil \nevery single night in Essex Junction, VT--longer than 8 months. That is \nshowing respect.\n  I see in Montpelier, my birthplace, in their annual Independence Day \nparade, where flags are waved in support of our country and our \nsoldiers. I see it in the memorial of American flags planted along the \npaths of funeral processions of Vermonters killed serving their country \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Vermonters' respect for the flag is born from \nrespect for this country and the values it protects. Our patriotism is \nfelt, it is willful. It is not forced on us.\n  Instead of telling the American people, the people beyond the 100 who \nhave the privilege of serving here, what they can and cannot do, maybe \nwe should talk about what we 100 do and how we do it. We honor America \nwhen we in the Senate do our jobs, when and if we work on the matters \nthat can improve the lives of ordinary Americans. Let the 100 Members \nof the Senate work to raise the minimum wage, lower gas prices, provide \nbetter health care and health insurance for more Americans. Let the 100 \nSenators act to fund the promise of stem cell research that could end \nthe suffering of so many Americans.\n  The proposed amendment to the Constitution would do harm to the First \nAmendment protections that bind us all against oppression, especially \nthe oppression of momentary majority thought. The amendment violates \nthe precept laid down more than 200 years ago that ``he that would make \nhis own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression.''\n  It undercuts the principle that a free society is a society where it \nis safe to say and do the unpopular. Let us not give away our liberties \nin order to impose orthodoxy so others cannot offend.\n  Let me be clear, I am deeply offended when anyone defiles the \nAmerican flag. I expect one thing that unites all 100 Senators is that \nevery one of us is deeply offended when the flag is defiled. Two years \nago, a flag incident occurred in Vermont outside St. Augustine's Church \nin Montpelier. Someone wrapped a statue of the Virgin Mary in the \nAmerican flag and set it on fire. This is a church in which I have been \nbaptized. When this act was first reported, I called it an act intended \nto outrage, an attack on the religious community, and a gross show of \ndisrespect for the flag. We also know acts like these can and should be \nprosecuted under Vermont's law, as I suspect they should be under all \nof the laws of any of the 50 States. Laws prohibit such damage to \nproperty.\n\n  If someone seeks to do harm to the flag I proudly fly in my home when \nI am there, they, too, would be prosecuted under Vermont law. In fact, \nhaving been a prosecutor in Vermont, knowing what I know of Vermont \njuries, they would be convicted, but I can replace a flag of mine that \nwas destroyed, and would. I can buy another flag. But if we act to \ndiminish the Bill of Rights that protect our rights and freedoms of a \nquarter billion Americans and of generations to come, we cannot replace \nthat. We cannot go to the store and buy a new Bill of Rights once it is \ndiminished.\n  Ours is a powerful Constitution, all the more inspiring because of \nwhat it allows and because we protect each other's liberty. Let us be \ngood stewards. Let us preserve and protect for our children and our \nchildren's children a Constitution with the freedoms we were bequeathed \nby the founding patriots and by the sacrifice of generation after \ngeneration of Americans.\n  I urge Senators to think about this vote. Do not diminish that pillar \non which our democracy and our freedoms depend. Do not cut back on the \nFirst Amendment of our Bill of Rights for the first time in American \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will respond, but first I ask unanimous \nconsent to allow the distinguished Senator from Alabama to speak, and \nthen allow me to go next.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the antiflag desecration resolution that is before the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, 229 years ago this month, the Continental Congress \nadopted a resolution giving the United States a flag, the stars and \nstripes, the American flag that we know today. There is no greater \nsymbol of our freedom and our liberty.\n  The stars and stripes epitomize the underpinnings of the United \nStates, that which was envisioned and created by the Founders of this \ngreat Nation, solidified by the Framers of the Constitution, and \nrepresented at that first Continental Congress.\n  Old Glory was raised at Iwo Jima, was placed on the Moon, and drapes \nthe coffin of every servicemember who has sacrificed his life for our \nNation. Our flag is emblematic of liberty and democracy. It honors all \nthose who have defended our Nation from enemies at home and abroad, and \nall those who carried it into battle and never returned.\n  Yet there are some throughout this country who have chosen to express \ntheir views and opinions by defacing and even burning the flag. They \nbelieve the flag is simply a piece of fabric upon which stars and \nstripes have been sewn. They refuse to respect and revere the flag as a \ntrue monument to the freedoms and ideals of our great Nation. These \nnotions were bolstered by a 1989 Supreme Court decision that protected \nthe desecration of the flag.\n  Throughout the history of our Nation, the flag has been protected by \nlaws. In fact, before the Supreme Court decision in 1989, 48 States and \nthe District of Columbia had laws regulating the physical misuse of the \nAmerican flag. Even today, a majority of Americans continue to believe \nthe flag should be protected, that the Court was basically wrong in \ntheir decision.\n  It is that strong support and my firm belief that we must protect the \nflag that has sent me here today to advocate for this resolution. While \nsome\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nhave argued we should simply accept court interpretations of first \namendment issues as final, irreversible truths, I disagree. Our system \nof government is based upon checks and balances and allows for \nlegislative reactions to judicial decisions.\n  While rarely invoked, amending the Constitution is a reasonable \nreaction to a controversial and clearly wrongheaded court decision. The \nAmerican system of government provided for amendments, and there are \nsome issues that deserve that attention. I believe protecting the flag \nis one.\n  In debating this issue, we must look beyond burning the flag and \nprotecting one's freedom of expression. This issue must be considered \nin a broader context. We must remember that this issue is about \nrespecting the single unifying symbol of this great democracy, the \nAmerican flag.\n  Defacing the U.S. Capitol or the Washington Monument would never be \nconsidered legitimate acts of free speech. The flag should be entitled \nto the same considerations. The flag is a national treasure, a \nmonument, even, and like other national treasures, it deserves to be \nprotected and respected.\n  Our flag is a unique national symbol that represents common values, \nshared aspirations, and the sacrifices of millions of Americans. The \nargument is not about legitimate free speech, in my judgment, but, \nrather, the extent to which free people must tolerate offensive acts. \nWhile some will say that a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning \nunduly inhibits free speech, I respectfully disagree.\n  Let me be clear. It will not diminish the Bill of Rights, in my \njudgment, to allow Congress to define and enforce a law which protects \nthe American flag much like other national treasures are protected. To \ndesecrate the American flag, in my judgment, is to desecrate the memory \nof the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their \nlives to keep our flag flying. It is to destroy everything this country \nrepresents.\n  There are some things that just need to be treated with respect and \nreverence for no other reason than to honor all those who have served \nand died for this country.\n  When we look at our flag, I believe we should see more than a piece \nof fabric colored red, white, and blue. We should see our Nation and \nall that it symbolizes. Our Armed Forces put their lives on the line \ndaily to defend what Old Glory represents. We have a duty and a \nresponsibility to honor their sacrifices by giving the flag the \nconstitutional protection it deserves.\n  At this time, before I yield the floor, I thank Senator Hatch for all \nof his work in this regard and also for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a bipartisan amendment. It is \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. We have always gotten over 60 votes. The \nHouse of Representatives passes it overwhelmingly and gets the \nrequisite two-thirds vote every time. It has always been stopped here \nin the Senate.\n  Bringing it up at this time is certainly not an election-year ploy, \nas we have Democrats and Republicans who feel very deeply about this \nissue. It is bipartisan. The last time we brought it up was in the year \n2000. If I had my way, we would have brought it up every one of those \nintervening years so the American people could really realize what is \ninvolved here.\n  So today we begin the debate on the flag protection amendment. This \nis an important debate. This is a constitutional amendment. It ought to \nbe difficult to pass any constitutional amendment, and they truly make \nit difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote of both bodies. Assuming we \nget those votes and it passes both bodies, it has to be submitted to \nthe States, and 38 States would have to ratify it, at least 38, in \nother words, three-quarters of the States.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting this \neffort. I especially thank my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, for working so hard to see this amendment \nthrough the committee. I thank my dear friend from Alabama who just \nspoke because, in his own cogent, very clear spoken way, he has made it \nvery clear this is not some inconsequential, inconsiderate, partisan \nthing that is going on here. I also thank the majority leader, Senator \nFrist, for bringing it to the floor.\n  Like I say, this is an important debate. A lot depends on this \ndebate. In fact, I would say it is a critical debate. Should this \namendment pass, we will restore--that is a very important word--the \npower of the people over their own Constitution. We will make it clear \nthat in America it is the people, not the judges, who are sovereign.\n  This is a debate worth having. There has been a lot of \nmisunderstanding about this amendment. I believe even the distinguished \nranking member on the committee has misconstrued this amendment in his \nremarks here today. This is what the amendment says. It is simple. It \nhas nothing to do with free speech. The amendment says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  Let's read that again. It does not ban anything. It says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  This body and the other body will have the power. The other body has \nalready voted it out of that body by a two-thirds vote. Some say we are \nonly one vote short of having 67 votes. Some want to make this a \npartisan debate. It is not. Some want to make it an election-year \ndebate. It is not. This is a bipartisan debate over whether we are \ngoing to stand up and restore the Constitution to what it was before \nfive unelected Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court--to four who totally \ndisagreed with them--decided to change the Constitution. Those who \nargue that this is a change of the Bill of Rights have failed to \nrecognize there are millions in this country--the vast majority--who \ndiffer with those five unelected Justices. And there were four with an \nopinion, written by arguably one of the most liberal Justices on the \ncourt, Justice Stevens, saying that desecrating the flag is not free \nspeech but offensive conduct.\n\n  But even if you want to make that argument, it does not belong here \nin the context of this debate because what we are arguing is whether we \ncan restore the Constitution to what it was before five unelected \njurists, Justices, on the Supreme Court changed it.\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n  I have heard Senators on this floor criticize the administration and \nother administrations on both sides of the aisle saying that they have \nusurped the powers of the Congress of the United States. Yet some of \nthem who are voting against this amendment turn around and fail to stop \nthe usurpation of powers by the Supreme Court of the United States in a \n5 to 4 decision.\n  Well, don't miss the point here.\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  That is what this amendment says. It is a simple statement of the \npower of the people and of their Representatives in Congress. So all \nthe high-flown talk about the Bill of Rights and this is going to be \nthe first time the Bill of Rights will be overturned--come on, the Bill \nof Rights was overturned when five unelected jurists changed it and \nchanged the Constitution. Now we will get it back to the people.\n  This amendment does not ban anything. It does not amend the first \namendment. It does not prohibit speech. What it does is simple. It \nrestores the power of the people's Representatives to protect the flag \nfrom acts of physical desecration. That is it. That is it. It is that \nsimple.\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  In the United States, we have government by the people. The \nDeclaration of Independence makes it clear that in this country--for \nthat matter, in any just political community--the people are sovereign.\n  Sometimes we need to be reminded of this powerful truth. This is how \nThomas Jefferson explained what he called ``the common sense of the \nmatter.''\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the Pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these Rights, \n     Governments are instituted among Men--\n\n  Now, get this last part:\n\n     deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.\n\n  It is the first principle of the American founding, and it is one \nthat the American people still hold true today. Government exists \nbecause of the people, and it only exists with their consent, meaning \nour consent.\n  The Constitution affirmed this when it began with ``We the People.'' \nThe people wrote the Constitution at the Convention. The people created \nthe Congress and the courts. The people ratified the Constitution. They \ngave it life. And the people ratified the first amendment.\n  Yet, for too long, some unelected judges have mistakenly concluded \nthat it is the courts that have exclusive dominion over the \nConstitution. This is a chance for us to say to the Supreme Court: We \nare not going to let you intermeddle in the affairs of the people \nthemselves with regard to the flag of the United States.\n  For too long, some unelected judges have mistakenly concluded that it \nis the courts that have exclusive dominion over the Constitution.\n  The Constitution began with ``We the People.'' The people wrote the \nConstitution at the Constitutional Convention. The people created the \nCongress and the courts. The people ratified the Constitution and gave \nit life. And the people ratified the first amendment.\n  Yet the courts seem to say they are the only ones who have authority \nover the Constitution. This was certainly the case in 1989, when a \nseverely divided Court reversed 200 years of American jurisprudence and \noverturned the considered judgment of the American people in almost \nevery State.\n  For generations, the American people provided protections for their \nbeloved symbol, the flag.\n  On June 20, 1989, 48 States and the District of Columbia had statutes \nthat protected the flag from physical desecration.\n  On June 21, 1989, all of those statutes suddenly became \nunconstitutional--all of the people's statutes, all of that work by all \nof these legislatures and the District of Columbia. All of them were \nruled unconstitutional by five unelected Justices who were contested by \nfour Justices on the Court.\n  Now, how did this come to pass? One vote on the Supreme Court \nswitched, one vote. That is it. One vote and the will of the people in \nvirtually every State in the Union was overturned--in nearly every \nState. One vote, one person--five people.\n  For many years, the Court well understood the obvious and compelling \ninterest of political communities in protecting the American flag from \ndesecration. In 1907, Justice Harlan wrote for the Supreme Court in \nHalter v. Nebraska. That decision reviewed a Nebraskan statute \nprotecting the flag from physical misuse.\n  This was Justice Harlan's--one of the all-time greatest Justices on \nthe Supreme Court--conclusion:\n\n       It is not remarkable that the American people, acting \n     through the legislative branch of the Government, early in \n     their history, prescribed a flag as symbolical of the \n     existence and sovereignty of the Nation . . . [L]ove both of \n     the common country and of the state will diminish in \n     proportion as respect for the flag is weakened. Therefore, a \n     state will be wanting in care for the well-being of its \n     people if it ignores the fact that they regard the flag as a \n     symbol of their country's power and prestige, and will be \n     impatient if any disrespect is shown towards it.\n\n  In short, there was a clear interest in providing protection for the \nAmerican flag, recognized by one of the greatest Justices in the \nhistory of the Supreme Court.\n  Now, following this holding in the Court, the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Flag Act in \n1917. Section 3 of that act provided that:\n\n       No person shall publicly mutilate, deface, defile, trample \n     upon, or by any word or act cast contempt upon any such flag, \n     standard, color, ensign, or shield.\n\n  Now, many States used this Federal statute as a model for their State \nstatutes or to supplement existing statutes.\n  There is no doubt that desecrating a flag is meant to express \nsomething. But as the late Chief Justice Rehnquist understood, that \nexpression is more akin to an ``inarticulate grunt'' than a serious \npublic statement when they desecrate the flag. The States concurred \nwhen they did their own balancing of the interests of the political \ncommunity in protecting the flag with the interest of the individual in \nexpressing himself.\n  The Court agreed that not all expressive conduct could simply be \nlabeled speech and given full first amendment protection. As the \nSupreme Court explained in United States v. O'Brien:\n\n       [W]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless \n     variety of conduct can be labeled ``speech'' whenever the \n     person engaging in the conduct intends to express an idea.\n  In instances where expressive conduct, not speech, is at issue, the \nCourt must balance the interests of the community in prohibiting this \nconduct with the interests of the person who wishes to express himself \nor herself. With regard to flag burning, the Court's approach was \nmeasured. In Smith v. Goguen, the Court overturned a flag desecration \nconviction in Massachusetts, concluding that the statute which punished \nwords and acts of desecration was void for vagrants. The Court added, \nhowever, that:\n\n       nothing prevents a legislature from defining with \n     substantial specificity what constitutes forbidden treatment \n     of United States flags.\n\n  This is the Supreme Court. The Court pointed to the Federal flag \nprotection statute, one which prohibited only physical desecration \nrather than words, as an example of a constitutionally permissible \nstatute. And so it was, until five unelected Jurists changed it--\nactually, until one vote changed it, one vote combined with the four \nwho had always voted against the flag.\n  The Court and the people were in agreement. Not all expressive \nconduct can receive first amendment protection. The Government's \ninterest in protecting the American flag from physical desecration was \na real one. But be that as it may, we could argue right now about \nwhether this is conduct or whether it is speech. The fact is, we are \nnot talking about free speech. We are talking about restoring the \nConstitution to what it was before five unelected judges or Justices on \nthe Supreme Court changed it. And it really came down to one changed \nvote on the Court because the Court had always upheld amendments that \nprotected the flag from acts of physical desecration.\n  The flag is a unique symbol of our nationhood that demands \nprotection. The American people do not share a common religion or \ncommon political beliefs. We do not share a common ethnic heritage. But \nthere are a few public symbols we do share as people. The American flag \nis a unique representation of our remarkable union. Its 13 stripes \nrepresent our origins as a nation, and its 50 stars, separate but \nunified on a field of blue, represent what we have become. From a small \noutpost of the Colonies fighting for freedom, we have become a beacon \nof liberty to the whole world.\n  For years, interest in protecting this symbol was deemed strong and \nreal enough to rebut serious constitutional challenges. What changed? \nWhy do the American people no longer have the right to protect the flag \nfrom acts of physical desecration? Why can't the Congress do that? One \nvote switched and went with the other four, and all of these rights \nwere gone. So to those who say this is a denigration of the first \namendment, the first amendment was denigrated when five unelected \nJustices took the power away from the people.\n  Prior to 1989, 48 States protected the flag, and the other two \nbasically stood for protecting the flag, and the District of Columbia. \nI am not making this up. On June 20, 1989, nearly every State had laws \nprotecting the flag from physical desecration. All those States rights, \nall the people's rights, were wiped out when one person changed his \nvote on the Supreme Court. One day later, after June 20, 1989, all of \nthese State laws were unconstitutional. All that changed is the Supreme \nCourt determined that it would disregard the beliefs of the American \npeople and their representatives in Congress and in the States.\n  When the Supreme Court had the opportunity to execute its balancing \ntest in Texas v. Johnson, balancing the interests of the people and \nprohibiting certain conduct with the individual's\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\ninterest in expressing himself in a particular manner, the Justices put \ntheir finger on the scale. They rejected as insufficient the States' \ninterests, all of these States and their interests, one supported by \nthe people in protecting the flag. They did not do so through a \nunanimous opinion. The Justices were severely divided, issuing a 5-to-4 \ndecision. The dissent of Justice John Paul Stevens, arguably one of the \nmost liberal Justices in history, was compelling. He dissented from \nthat five-person majority case. He spoke for the opinion that the Court \nhad arbitrarily abandoned. Here is what Justice Stevens said:\n\n       The Court . . . is quite wrong in blandly asserting that \n     respondent ``was prosecuted for his expression of \n     dissatisfaction with the policies of this country, expression \n     situated at the core of our First Amendment values.'' \n     Respondent was prosecuted because of the method he chose to \n     express his dissatisfaction with those policies. Had he \n     chosen to spray-paint--or perhaps convey with a motion \n     picture projector--his message of dissatisfaction on the \n     facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there would be no question \n     about the power of the Government to prohibit his means of \n     expression. The prohibition would be supported by the \n     legitimate interest in preserving the quality of an important \n     national asset. Though the asset at stake in this case is \n     intangible, given its unique value, the same interest \n     supports a prohibition on the desecration of the American \n     flag.\n\n  That is Justice Stevens, who wrote the opinion for the Court and who \nmany would arguably say may be the most liberal Justice on the Court. \nThe American people agreed: the Court got this one wrong. They got it \nvery wrong. So Congress acted immediately. We believed that Congress \ndid have the power to protect the flag. For well over 100 years, the \nCourt had upheld State and Federal protection measures.\n  On July 18, 1989, two separate measures were introduced in the \nSenate. Former Senators Robert Dole, Alan Dixon, Strom Thurmond, and \nHowell Heflin introduced S.J. Res. 180, which would restore the power \nto protect the flag to the States and affirm the existing power of \nCongress to do so. On the same day, Senators Joseph Biden, William \nRoth, and William Cohen introduced the Flag Protection Act.\n  While the amendment would have merely restored and confirmed the \npower of the people's representatives to protect the flag, as this \nresolution does, this statute which was filed by Senators Biden, Roth, \nand Cohen would have actually codified that legal protection.\n  Ultimately, the Senate acted on the bill authored by my colleague \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nhe was committed to resolving this issue. He held four hearings with 20 \nhours of testimony and 26 witnesses. I was there. After consulting with \nmany experts, he was convinced that his bill would pass constitutional \nmuster. It was a great bill, consistent with the desires of the \nAmerican people. It provided extremely broad protection for our \nAmerican flag. This is what became law. This is Senator Biden's \nlanguage and others of us who supported it:\n\n       [W]hoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, \n     burns, maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any \n     flag of the United States shall be fined under this Title or \n     imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\n  This bill passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. There are not \nmany things which go through the Senate on a vote of 91 to 9, but the \ndetermination to pass a constitutional statute to protect the flag from \nphysical desecration was one of them. Going back and looking at that \nrollcall vote, we should be proud of our actions. Current Senators, \nincluding my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Senators Biden and \nHerb Kohl, supported the bill. So too did my colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, who has since been elected majority whip. A number \nof other Senators who are no longer here supported this as well, \nincluding former Democratic leader Tom Daschle. It was a good bill. But \nthe Supreme Court had other ideas.\n  On June 11, 1990, the Supreme Court struck down this overwhelmingly \ncongressionally approved statute in United States v. Eichman. Again, \nthis Court was severely divided along familiar lines. So what now? What \ncourse of action is available to Congress? They have made it clear you \ncan't do this by statute. They made it abundantly clear. The Court had \ngiven us its opinion. It said that statutory protection of the American \nflag was not content-neutral and therefore violated core constitutional \nrights to expressive conduct. An amendment really is the only way we \ncan solve this problem. So Congress began to focus its attention on a \nconstitutional amendment that would restore the power of the people to \nprotect the flag from acts of physical desecration.\n  Those who supported this amendment believed that the Court got this \none wrong, badly wrong, and it was up to the people to correct these \ndecisions. A constitutional amendment is really the only way to do it. \nI am not the only one who has thought so. Some of the most compelling \nstatements on behalf of an amendment have come from my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad. In the past, he argued forcefully for an \namendment to fix this problem:\n\n       Because I believe that the flag should have legal \n     protection, I supported statutes last year and today to \n     protect the American flag. But these attempts have failed. \n     And now we are left with no other choice if we believe that \n     the flag deserves protection.\n\n  Senator Conrad went on to say:\n\n       We should let the States decide this matter. If we fail to \n     adopt an amendment today, we will deny the States the right \n     to express their views on this matter.\n\n  That was a statement made in 1990.\n\n       By approving the constitutional amendment before us, we \n     will foster a healthy debate in this country about the Bill \n     of Rights, the freedoms we enjoy, our constitutional \n     guarantees, and how we can legally and legitimately protect \n     the flag. It is for these reasons that I will support a \n     constitutional amendment in this body and let the people \n     decide this important matter.\n\n  I agree with that. That statement was made on June 26, 1990. He was \nright. This is the way to create a debate all over the country that \nwould be a debate on virtue and values. I couldn't have said it better \nmyself than the way Senator Conrad said it in 1990. An amendment really \nis the only way.\n  In a recent letter on this subject, Stephen Presser, professor of \nlegal history at Northwestern University School of Law, explained that \nan amendment was and remains our only option. He said:\n\n       We were told by proponents of a statute to correct the \n     Court's error in 1989 that they could draft one that would \n     survive Constitutional challenge. I testified at a hearing \n     before the Judiciary Committee at that time that it could not \n     be done, and, sure enough, in 1990, the Supreme Court ruled \n     in U.S. v. Eichman that the statute (which scholars such as \n     Larry Tribe, for example, told us would be deemed \n     constitutional) was unconstitutional. It is significant that \n     Professor Tribe, along with his Harvard colleague Richard \n     Parker have now clearly taken the position that no flag \n     protection statute can pass Constitutional muster. They are \n     correct: any statute would be deemed by the Court to be the \n     government's unconstitutional favoring of one form of speech \n     over another, and would thus be deemed to be unconstitutional \n     content, discrimination with regard to speech.\n\n  A constitutional amendment is the only way. The alternative is to do \nnothing. Congress believed that it had the power to protect the flag; \nthe Court disagreed.\n  I listen to many of my colleagues routinely complain that other \nbranches are usurping the powers of Congress. I have heard that through \nmy whole 30 years in the Congress. They are always complaining about \nthe executive branch usurping the powers of Congress. The judicial \nbranch is usurping the powers of Congress. Here we have a chance to \nrestore those powers:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  What does that ban? It doesn't ban a thing. All it says is that we \nare going to restore the power the Congress had before five unelected \nJurists said we didn't have the power.\n  When we passed the Flag Protection Act in 1989, we believed we had \nthe power to pass that bill. The Court had different ideas. They \noverturned this overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation. We have an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan constitutional amendment here. It isn't \npartisan. It is bipartisan. We will have people come on the Senate \nfloor and try to make this a partisan issue, which is all too frequent \naround here, and ignore the fact that a lot of colleagues on both sides \nof the floor, an overwhelming number, are in favor of this amendment.\n  If we want a statute to do this, we need to restore our \nconstitutional authority to pass it--the alternative to\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\nour constitutional amendment, a simple amendment, restoring the power \nto the Congress. That is all it does. If you listen to the media, they \nact like it is going to be a ban. It would not be a ban. If we can pass \nthis amendment and have it ratified by 38 States, I have no doubt there \nwill be a constitutional debate on the floor as to what language will \nprotect our beloved flag. It would take at least 60 votes on the floor \nof the Senate to pass any language because of our filibuster rule, so \nit is going to take a supermajority no matter what. We are not about \nthat right now. That has nothing to do with this amendment, except it \nwould be inevitable. What has to do with it is restoring the power to \nthe Congress which was taken by five unelected Justices on the Supreme \nCourt. If we want this type of statute, it is important to restore our \nconstitutional authority to pass it.\n  As I said, the alternative to this amendment is to do absolutely \nnothing and acquiesce in the usurpation of our institutional power by \nanother branch of Government. By doing nothing, we accede, through our \ninaction, to a decision by five unelected Justices who took the power \nfrom an American people over an important cultural issue.\n  Abraham Lincoln addressed this issue before becoming President. What \ndo you do when the Supreme Court gets it wrong? This is what Lincoln \ntaught us:\n\n       The candidate citizen must confess that if the policy of \n     the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole \n     people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme \n     Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation \n     between parties in personal actions, the people will have \n     ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent \n     practically resigned their Government into the hands of that \n     eminent tribunal.\n\n  Well, that is what Lincoln had to say. Are we going to just continue \nto allow five unelected Jurists to determine what the vast majority of \nthe American people believe is right or are we going to continue to \ndetermine that they are taking away the power that the Congress has \nalways had? We should restore that power? That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  The answer in a democracy is that you let the people decide, \nespecially on these sensitive, tough issues. I routinely hear some of \nmy liberal colleagues who have recently re-minted themselves as \nprogressives, complain that we don't listen to the people enough. They \nencourage direct democracy. They speak at blogging conventions. Let's \nsee them put their money where their mouth is. There is nothing more \ndiscouraging to a democracy than a divided court abandoning its past \nprecedent, overturning laws in 48 States, and overturning a duly passed \nFederal statute.\n  The reasonable reaction of many Americans might be: why bother? Why \nbother to write and e-mail and petition Congress? Why advocate on \nbehalf of legislation? When it is all said and done, the Supreme Court \nwill appear deus ex machina and declare those laws unconstitutional, \neven absent any real precedent, text, or tradition to support its \ndecision.\n  Fortunately, that hasn't been the reaction among our Nation's civic \ngroups. Everybody from the American Legion, to the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, to the Knights of Columbus has urged Congress to support this \namendment. They have been tireless in their efforts. They see this \nconstitutional amendment for what it is. All this constitutional \namendment does is restore power to the people's representatives in \nCongress. Read it again:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  All it does is restore it to where it was. It was the Court that \nchanged the Constitution. It is not us changing it. We are trying to \nrestore it to where it was and send a message to the Supreme Court that \non these great social issues you have to let the elected \nrepresentatives of the people make these decisions for the people, and \nyou should quit playing around with issues for which you should not \nhave responsibility but the people should.\n  This is not a perennial partisan issue. This has not just been \nbrought up because we are in an election year. I would bring it up \nevery year if we could. The last time it came up was in 2000. This is \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats, liberals, \nmoderates, and conservatives all support our efforts. In fact, it makes \nyou wonder who would not support it in the Congress because all we are \ntrying to do is give the power back to the Congress.\n  Quite the contrary. It is broadly supported on both sides of the \naisle, and the groups supporting it are distinctly nonpartisan.\n  At the Judiciary Committee markup of this resolution a few weeks ago, \nSenator Feinstein spoke eloquently on its behalf. She has been one of \nthe amendment's strongest supporters. Last week, this is what she had \nto say in an editorial in USA Today:\n\n       Throughout our Nation's history, the flag has been \n     protected by law. In 1989, 48 of our 50 States had statutes \n     restricting flag desecration. . . .But its protection ended \n     in 1989, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law \n     prohibiting flag desecration. Congress responded by passing \n     the Flag Protection Act of 1989, but the Supreme Court struck \n     down that law as well. The only way to restore protection to \n     the flag is to amend the Constitution. Otherwise, any \n     legislation passed by Congress would be struck down.\n       The flag Protection Amendment would not prohibit flag \n     burning. Rather, the amendment would simply return to \n     Congress the ability to protect the flag as it has been \n     protected throughout most of this Nation's history.\n\n  That is what she said. This is not a partisan issue. I am confident \nthat all of this constitutional amendment's supporters would prefer to \nsee it off the agenda. We want it passed and sent to the American \npeople for ratification. We are getting very close. We have voted on \nthis amendment in the Senate only twice before. The last time we voted \non it was in 2000. Right now, we have 60 upfront cosponsors. Three of \nmy colleagues who are not cosponsors voted for the amendment as \nSenators in 2000. Another three voted for it while members of the House \nof Representatives. These are people who are not among the 60.\n  In the case of Senator Menendez, he is going to have the opportunity \nto vote for it twice in the same Congress--once as a Member of the \nHouse, where he did, and now as a Senator. That is pretty unique.\n  I have no doubt that if Members voted their consciences, we would be \nwell above the required 67 votes. Unfortunately, radical special \ninterest groups are strongly opposed to this amendment. It appears from \nsome press accounts that they are prepared to bring down the hammer, \nunless some Members pull back their support with inspired and last-\nminute changes of heart.\n\n  I know many newspaper editorial boards oppose this amendment. They \nstill think it is a banning amendment. They think we are banning flag \ndesecration. No, we are not. Right now, this amendment says the \nCongress will have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of \nthe flag of the United States. It doesn't ban anything. Many law \nprofessors--or some at least--oppose this amendment. The ACLU opposes \nthis amendment. But the people support it. It is insulting to them to \nsuggest that they want to amend the first amendment, as the talking \npoints opposed to our effort put it. This proposal does not amend the \nfirst amendment; it restores the power of the people to the people.\n  Do over 60 colleagues oppose the first amendment? Bipartisan \ncolleagues. Do the majority of Americans in every State oppose the \nfirst amendment? Do some of our Nation's finest civic organizations \noppose the first amendment? Do four Justices on the Supreme Court of \nthe United States oppose the first amendment? Of course not.\n  But they do think the Court got these decisions badly wrong. They \nthink the people have the right to protect the flag, consistent with \nthe first amendment. They think the opinion of five unelected Judges \nshould not forever bind the American people.\n  We need to send this amendment to the States and let them determine \nwhether they are going to ratify it. I guarantee you that it will \ncreate a debate on virtue, which has kept this country the greatest \ncountry in the world, and values, which our young people need to see \nmore of. We will debate it in every State if we can pass this by 67 \nvotes.\n  It is beyond time. I do not know what so many of my colleagues fear. \nThey say this is not a major issue. Who is kidding whom? This is the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nflag. This is our national symbol. They say that flag burning is a rare \noccurrence. That is not that rare.\n  As this chart indicates--and I will put it up here--flag desecration \nis an ongoing offense against common decency. These are recent \nincidents of flag desecration: Montpelier, VT, June 19, 2004; \nLittleton, NH, September 9, 2004; Las Vegas, NV, September 11, 2004; \nSarasota, FL, December 20, 2005; St. Clair Shores, MI, August 27, 2005; \nBeaumont, TX; Hurricane, UT, July 4, 2005, right on Independence Day; \nMaryville, TN, July 4, 2005; Murrieta, CA, July 2, 2005; Sarasota, FL, \nJune 28, 2005. There are many more listed here; that is just mentioning \nsome of these. We know there are a lot more than that, I am sure.\n  Look at this article that just happened a few days ago. A reward was \noffered Friday for information leading to the arrest of whoever burned \nseven American flags in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn this week. \nThis is dated June 23, by the way, 2006, last week:\n\n       The flags, including one that was hung by a couple after \n     their son was killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks. They were burned in what police said was a case of \n     criminal mischief. Residents of seven homes woke up Thursday \n     morning to find their flags torched, police said. \n     Investigators said they believe the flag burning occurred \n     some time overnight. ``As we approach the celebration of our \n     Nation's independence, this July 4, some vandal has defined \n     our freedoms, rights, and liberties by setting fire to the \n     American flag,'' said State Senator Martin Golden who offered \n     a $1,000 reward. ``Flag burning is something we will not \n     tolerate in our neighborhood''.\n\n  Regina Coyle said:\n\n       I can't believe someone would actually invade our personal \n     space. We lost so much. It is the flag.\n\n  Other residents said they found the vandalism equally upsetting.\n  All I can say is that you can go back in time and find hundreds, \nmaybe even thousands of these incidents. We are not even talking about \nthose we don't know about. For the American people, and for me, even \none instance of flag burning is one too many. My brother died in the \nSecond World War fighting for us. Another brother-in-law died in \nVietnam. We buried our top sergeant marine brother-in-law in Arlington \na year or so ago. I feel deeply about this.\n  The first amendment guarantees another right besides the freedom of \nspeech. It gives the American people the right ``to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of grievances.'' I have to tell you, the \nAmerican people are aggrieved, sick and tired of unelected judges \ntaking the most important issues out of the hands of the people and \ntheir representatives and acting like junior legislators who will draft \nour social policies for us. This is bad for democracy, and it is \ninconsistent with the American Constitution. The American people have \nspoken in a historic event. All 50 States--every one of them--have \npetitioned the Congress to protect the American flag, every one of \nthem. So if you hear some who are opposed to this constitutional \namendment come on the Senate floor and say ``this is political, this is \nan election year,'' think about that.\n  All 50 States have petitioned us to do what this amendment will do: \nrestore the Constitution to what it was before these five unelected \nJustices changed it.\n  As I said before, if we are to be responsive to our constituents, we \nonly have one option: We must pass this amendment and send it to the \nStates for ratification.\n  I understand some of my colleagues have some reservations about the \namendment. Some are very sincere--not all but some are. I urge them to \ntrust the people, to trust their instincts.\n  This amendment is not going away so long as I serve in the Senate. I \nwill certainly fight for it. Should we pass this amendment, I think we \nwould see perhaps the greatest public debate that we have witnessed in \nour lifetime. The debate over ratification in every State will be an \nongoing history lesson for younger Americans. It will bring them in \ncontact with our veterans to whom we owe our freedom, and it will \nintroduce them to the civic organizations that are the soul and spirit \nof our democracy.\n  Yes, there are some very fine people and noted people who don't think \nwe should do this, but if you look at their comments, they are not that \nthey don't think we should restore to the Congress that which the \nCongress should have. They are actually treating this amendment as if \nit is an absolute ban of free speech when, in fact, it has nothing to \ndo with that.\n  I have to admit, if we pass this amendment and it is ratified, I am \nsure there will be a debate over what form of language should we have \nto protect our beloved flag. What is important is to have our young \npeople come in contact with the veterans and others to whom we owe our \nfreedoms.\n  The Constitution begins with ``We the people,'' and in the end it is \nstill we the people, it is the people's Constitution. We should send \nthis constitutional amendment to the States. I want everybody to think \nabout this. As we hear them talk about: Oh, we must protect our rights \nof free speech, and so forth, this doesn't have anything to do with \nfree speech. Read the words. Indirectly, I guess you could say it does \nin the sense that undoubtedly there will be a debate if this is passed \nand ratified, but it would still take a supermajority of the Senate to \npass any form of statute afterwards. There would be plenty of \nprotections for those who would disagree with our position. But for \nthose who argued against this amendment, many of whom are constantly \narguing about the usurpation of congressional powers by the Executive, \nespecially when the Executive is not of their own party, this is a \nchance to restore the power back to the Congress that should never have \nbeen taken by five unelected Jurists to begin with.\n  We should send this amendment to the States. We should let the people \ndecide because, after all, that is all we would be doing. If we pass \nthis constitutional amendment, we will be turning it over to the people \nthemselves. Whatever people want to debate they can, and it would take \nan overwhelming 38 States, or three-quarters of the States, to ratify \nthis amendment so that it would become the 28th amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  I can't think of a more complete declaration of the rights of the \npeople than this particular very simple amendment that ``Congress shall \nhave power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is S.J. Res. 12. \nIt is a one-page resolution which is being suggested for passage by the \nSenate. It is a matter which we will likely debate the rest of this \nweek. The reason we are going to spend this much time on it is because \nthis one-page document represents a historic change in America. If this \namendment were to be ratified, it would mark the first time in our \nnation's history that we would amend the Bill of Rights of the United \nStates of America.\n  The handiwork of Thomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers, which has \nguided our Nation for over 200 years, which has become a model for \nnations around the world in terms of liberty and freedom, is about to \nbe changed if the sponsors of this amendment have their way.\n  It takes a great deal of audacity for anyone to step up and suggest \nto change the Constitution. It happens. There is an amendment process. \nBut in this particular instance, I think what we are about to do is \nwrong.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate debated and voted on a constitutional \namendment to ban same-sex marriage. This amendment was, of course, \ndefeated. Now, as I said, we are debating this constitutional amendment \nto criminalize the desecration of the U.S. flag.\n  I am not quite sure that our Senate in which we serve still has its \nbearings. That we would so quickly consider amending this Constitution, \nwhich has served our Nation so well and for so many years, so \nfrequently suggests to me that there may be something at work here that \ngoes beyond constitutional law and constitutional study.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  This marks the fifth time in 17 years that Congress has debated \namending the U.S. Constitution to prohibit burning or desecration of \nthe United States flag--the fifth time. In the final weeks of this \nCongress, with all of the other urgent challenges facing our Nation, \nwhy are we coming back to this amendment, having finished the same-sex \nmarriage amendment unsuccessfully? Well, perhaps the argument has been \nmade--and I think my colleague and friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, \njust made it--that there is a serious problem in America with flag-\nburning.\n  The Citizens Flag Alliance is a group that supports Senator Hatch's \nposition on flag-burning, and they keep track of how many people in \nthis Nation of about 300 million have actually engaged in this \ndisgusting practice of burning our flag. So far, in the year 2006 in \nthe United States of America, with almost 300 million people, the \nCitizens Flag Alliance has recorded two instances of flag burning--\ntwo--in the entire United States of America. There has been an average \nof only seven acts of flag desecration annually in America in the last \n6 years. So to argue that we have this growing trend toward desecration \nand burning our flag defies the facts.\n  Here, the Citizens Flag Alliance gave us a State-by-State background \nwhere flags were burned or desecrated in the year 2004. So let's count. \nIn this column of States: None. In this column of States: Two. And here \nin the State of Vermont: One. So three times in the year 2004, the \nCitizens Flag Alliance found three incidents where flags were \ndesecrated--three times in the entire year.\n  In 2005, the same group reported a total of 12 instances--one a month \nin the United States of America--of people desecrating and burning \nflags. The source: The Citizens Flag Alliance that supports this.\n  So to suggest that the United States is somehow facing a rash of this \ndisgusting conduct just isn't true. In fact, it rarely, if ever, \nhappens.\n  So why would we change the handiwork and fine contribution to America \nof Thomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers? I think there is more to \nthe story than what we heard from one of the Senators who came before \nus a few moments ago. I wonder if there are things which we might be \nconsidering on the floor of the Senate of more importance to the people \nof this country.\n  Is changing the Constitution because 4 people desecrated American \nflags this year more important than finding a way to help 1 million \nAmericans who lost their health insurance over the last 12 months? Is \ndebating this amendment how Congress should be spending its time?\n  When we debated the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I \ncited a Gallup poll from April. They went to 1,000 Americans and they \nasked them the following question: What do you think is the most \nimportant problem facing this country today--1,000 people across our \nNation. Gay marriage--the subject of the constitutional amendment which \nwas defeated and part of the Republican agenda 2 weeks ago--ranked 33rd \non the list of important issues facing America in this recent poll.\n  But wait a minute. What about flag burning? When you ask 1,000 people \nacross America the most important problem facing this country today, \nwhere did it show up on the list of American priorities? It didn't. \nAmericans cited 42 different issues as pressing priorities for America, \nbut banning flag-burning was nowhere to be found.\n  Last week a poll was taken by none other than Fox News. Even though \nthey often fail in their self-proclaimed effort to be fair and \nbalanced, they asked 900 registered voters around the country this \nquestion: Which one of the following issues do you think should be the \ntop priority for Congress to work on this summer? This is Fox, my \nfriends, Fox News. They asked 900 voters, and here are the choices they \ngave them: Iraq, immigration, gas prices, same-sex marriage, and flag-\nburning. What did our friends at Fox News discover? What percent of \nDemocrats said flag-burning should be the top priority of Congress? \nZero.\n  In the halls of Fox News, I am sure they said, of course you wouldn't \nexpect the Democrats to be patriotic enough to understand that flag-\nburning is a top priority. No wonder none of the Democrats in our 900-\nperson poll identified flag-burning as a top issue.\n  But wait. What percentage of Republicans said flag-burning should be \nthe top priority of Congress? Zero. That was the single issue that \nunited Democrats and Republicans. When they looked at the big issues \nthat we could consider, Democrats and Republicans agreed this did not \nbelong on the list.\n  But it is on the list of the Republican majority in this Senate, and \nwe are going to spend a week on it. We are going to spend a week on it, \ninstead of talking about energy policy in America and bringing down the \ncost of gasoline for families and businesses and farmers. We are going \nto spend a week debating this amendment, which the American people have \nnot even identified as a serious priority or a serious problem, instead \nof dealing with health care in America. We are going to spend an entire \nweek debating this, instead of addressing the issue of global warming, \nwhich is a threat not only to our generation, but generations to come.\n  This amendment is truly a solution in search of a problem. Why are we \ndebating it again? We know the answer. We are here because the White \nHouse and the congressional Republican leadership are nervous about the \nupcoming elections. They want to exploit Americans' patriotism for \ntheir gain in November.\n  It is the same thing with the gay marriage amendment. It wasn't a \npriority for America; it is a priority for Karl Rove and the Republican \nstrategists.\n\n  The real issue here isn't the protection of the flag, it is the \nprotection of the Republican majority. We are not setting out to \nprotect Old Glory; we are setting out to protect old politicians. That \nis what this is about.\n  Sadly, Republican leaders are forcing this debate so they can accuse \nsome who disagree with them of being unpatriotic and un-American. You \nheard it last week, didn't you? Republicans came to the floor and \naccused Democrats who wanted to start the withdrawal of troops from \nIraq of wanting to cut and run. Cut and run, cut and run, over and over \nagain, from the Republican side--this chest-thumping, bring them on, we \nare loyal to the President at any cost, rhetoric coming forth every \nsingle day on the Republican side of the aisle. Then GEN Casey pulled \nthe rug out from under them. And by the end of the week, he took the \nsame position as the Democrats had with their amendment before the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So this week the Republicans are going to come back and say that \nthose who won't vote for this flag-burning amendment are somehow \nunpatriotic and un-American. I think the American people are a lot \nsmarter than that. I think they are going to see this for the political \nploy that it is.\n  I don't say this very often, but when it comes to changing our \nConstitution to ban flag-burning, I agree with Supreme Court Justice \nAntonin Scalia. Justice Scalia, arguably the most conservative member \nof the Supreme Court, was part of the majority who voted to strike down \nthe statute that was previously written to ban flag-burning in 1989. He \nsaid in speeches that it made him ``furious'' not to be able to put \nthat defendant who burned that flag in that case--whom he described as \na ``bearded, scruffy, sandal-wearing guy burning the American flag''--\nin jail. But in Justice Scalia's words:\n\n       I was handcuffed. I couldn't help it. That is my \n     understanding of the first amendment. I can't do the nasty \n     things I'd like to do.\n\n  Like Justice Scalia and most Americans, I am deeply and personally \noffended by the desecration of our flag. I think burning the flag is a \nform of protest that is crude and contemptible. But being contemptible \nand stupid is not unconstitutional in America.\n  I think we should show a little humility around here when it comes to \nchanging the Constitution. So many of my colleagues are anxious to take \na roller to a Rembrandt. Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights, \nMembers of Congress have proposed more than 11,000 amendments to our \nConstitution. We have passed only 17, and one of these was Prohibition, \nwhich we later learned was a political mistake and was repealed.\n  Why are amendments to the Constitution so rare? Because throughout \nour history, Congress has always understood that we should change our\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\nConstitution only under the most extraordinary circumstances. We should \namend it only when it is absolutely essential. It is a sacred document. \nIt is part of what defines us as America. To reach in and change Thomas \nJefferson's Bill of Rights on the floor of the U.S. Senate should be an \nhistoric moment and every Member should take pause before they do it.\n  The flag-burning amendment fails the test. As the Washington Post put \nit recently in an editorial:\n\n       Members of Congress who would protect the flag thus do it \n     far greater damage than a few miscreants with matches.\n\n  That is not just my opinion; it is shared by a lot of people. Colin \nPowell, a man who has given his life to America, in military service at \nthe highest levels, here is what he said about this flag-burning \namendment:\n\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment of State legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous. I would not amend that \n     great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The \n     flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.\n\n  General Colin L. Powell.\n  Steve Chapman writes for the Chicago Tribune, and here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       If there is anything American conservatives should revere, \n     it's the U.S. Constitution, a timeless work of political \n     genius. Having provided the foundation for one of the freest \n     societies and most durable democracies on Earth, it shouldn't \n     be altered lightly or often.\n\n  Charles Fried is a leading conservative scholar who served as \nSolicitor General of the United States under President Reagan. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       The First Amendment to the United States Constitution has \n     served us since 1791 through wars, including a civil war, and \n     crises of every sort without the need for amendment. It is an \n     icon of our freedom. To amend it now comes close to \n     vandalism.\n\n  These are the words of Charles Fried:\n\n       Totalitarian countries fear dissenters sufficiently to \n     suppress their protests. A free Nation relies on having the \n     better argument.\n\n  Incidentally, if we were to pass this constitutional amendment, which \nSenator Hatch and others have brought to the floor, we would join ranks \nwith only three other nations on Earth that ban flag-burning, and that \nroster of nations include the following: Cuba, China, and Iran. Oh, \nyes, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\n  If this amendment were to pass, it would be the first time since \n1978--almost 30 years--that both Houses of Congress passed a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I recently read a book review in the New York Times. It was about \nanother subject, but there was a quote in there that I think is so \napropos. Francis Lieber was a 19th century political philosopher and \nauthor of America's modern laws of war. He cautioned against weakening \nour Constitution during times of war when inflamed passions can make \nrash solutions seem reasonable. Listen to what Francis Lieber said, and \nreflect on what we are doing:\n\n       It requires the power of the Almighty and a whole century \n     to grow an oak tree; but only a pair of arms, an ax and an \n     hour or two to cut it down.\n\n  The Bill of Rights has served this Nation since 1791, and with one \nswift blow of this ax, we are going to chop into the first amendment.\n  I can understand why veterans, in particular, are offended by the \ndesecration of the flag. They went to battle and risked their lives \nunder the red, white, and blue. The current leadership of the American \nLegion, whom I respect very much and work with on many veterans' \nissues, supports this amendment. I respect them for their service to \nAmerica and our national security. But, with all due respect, there are \nmany veterans who disagree.\n  Keith Kreul is an Army veteran and past national commander of the \nAmerican Legion. Listen to what he wrote in an editorial for the Leader \nNewspapers in Lyndhurst, NJ when the Congress considered this amendment \nin 1998. Here is what he said.\n\n       Our Nation was not founded on devotion to symbolic idols, \n     but on principles, beliefs and ideals expressed in the \n     Constitution and its Bill of Rights. American veterans who \n     protected our banner in battle have not done so to protect a \n     ``golden calf.'' Instead, they carried the banner forward \n     with reverence for what it represents--our beliefs and \n     freedom for all. Therein lies the beauty of our flag.\n\n  So says the former National Commander of the American Legion, Keith \nKreul.\n  Robert Williams was a bomber pilot in World War II with the legendary \n332nd Fighter Group, better known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Listen to \nwhat he wrote in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper when this \namendment came up a few years ago:\n\n       Our unit would never have existed had it not been for the \n     long tradition of--and respect for--lawful protest in our \n     country. . . .\n\n  This Tuskegee Airman wrote:\n\n       I cringe when I see Congress preparing to pass a \n     constitutional amendment that would rewrite the First \n     Amendment--for the first time ever--to ban a form of protest. \n     It is particularly hard for me as an American war veteran \n     [Mr. Williams said] to see this action taken in the name of \n     patriotism.\n       For while we as a country view our flag as the very essence \n     of patriotism, it is in reality a symbol of that spirit. And \n     if the proposed flag desecration amendment wins final \n     approval, our flag will become a symbol without substance.\n\n  Mr. Williams went on to say:\n\n       Don't get me wrong. No one endorses the idea of burning the \n     flag or desecrating it in any way. It is to me a very \n     repugnant concept. But I find more threatening the idea that \n     we would change the Constitution every time some American \n     came up with a new repugnant way to protest.\n\n  And then there is John Glenn. What can you say about John Glenn, a \nfighter pilot in two wars, one of our premier astronauts, a great \nUnited States Senator, a marine with such a great record of public \nservice? He risked his life so many times for this country. He flew \nunder that flag so many times. Here is what he wrote in testimony to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in 2004:\n\n       Like most Americans I have very, very strong feelings about \n     our flag. Like most Americans, I have a gut reaction in \n     opposition to anyone who would dare to demean, deface, or \n     desecrate the flag of the United States. But also, like most \n     Americans, I am concerned about any effort to amend the \n     Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n       I have watched as those who expressed qualms or doubts or \n     reservations about this amendment run the risk of being \n     smeared, of being labeled as unpatriotic or as a friend of \n     flag burners. . . . Many of us feel unconformable talking \n     about issues that involve such private and personal emotions. \n     We do not wear our emotions on our sleeves, especially when \n     it comes to how we feel about the flag and about patriotism. \n     We do not parade around those things that are sacred to us.\n\n  John Glenn said he was speaking out against the flag burning \namendment because ``it would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved \nthe symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at fundamental freedoms \nthemselves.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The flag is the Nation's most powerful and emotional \n     symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most \n     revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the \n     freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the \n     freedoms themselves.\n\n  He is right. Our freedoms are dearer than their symbols. S.J. Res. 12 \nis overly vague and filled with potential loopholes. What do the words \n``flag desecration'' mean? If someone took a flag and wrote on it, is \nthat desecration? Here is an instance where the President of the United \nStates, when he was walking through a ropeline, was handed an American \nflag and asked to sign it. I do not believe that is desecration of the \nflag. I don't think anyone would argue that question. But this \namendment is not clear as to where you would draw a line. As gifted as \nmy colleagues may be who have brought this amendment to the floor, I am \nafraid the language they brought is not going to stand the test of \ntime. Will we prosecute people for wearing star-spangled bathing suits \nat the beach? How about a T-shirt that fashions the flag into a peace \nsign? Would we put people into jail for sitting on an American flag \nblanket at a Fourth of July picnic? Wiping their mouth with a flag \nnapkin?\n  Instead of signing a name on a flag, what if someone wrote ``death to \nAmerica''? Is that now desecration? The symbol of the American flag is \nused to sell everything from cars to cupcakes. Should those ads be \nillegal?\n  One of the most haunting images from Hurricane Katrina was the photo \nof a frail, elderly African-American woman waiting for help with a \nblanket that looked like an American flag wrapped on her shoulders. Is \nthat desecration? I don't think so.\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\n  Would we outlaw only future acts? Could a person be arrested for \npossessing a flag quilt that has been in the family for generations? \nDon't the police in America have more important things to do? How many \nhours would future Congresses spend trying to define what this \namendment says?\n  There is a better way. A number of us are coming together on a \nbipartisan basis to propose a criminal statute that makes it clear that \nwhen someone damages the U.S. flag with intent to incite or produce \nimminent violence, when someone burns a flag to intentionally threaten \nor intimidate a person, when someone steals a flag that belongs to the \nFederal Government and destroys it, when someone steals a flag and \ndestroys it on Federal land--all of these are specific acts that we \nwould criminalize. That does not rise to the level of a constitutional \namendment, but it says that we believe, on a bipartisan basis, the flag \nshould be treated differently. The flag does deserve special respect. \nThis narrowly tailored solution corrects the mistakes of the statute \nCongress passed in 1989 and the Supreme Court struck down a year later. \nThat statute was too broad. This new proposal is specific and clear.\n  One of the celebrity supporters of the flag amendment is Rick Monday. \nI bring him up because he was a Chicago Cubs outfielder, and I am \nhonored to represent the State of Illinois where there are many Cubs \nfans. He played for the Cubs from 1972 to 1976 and was well known and \nwell liked.\n  Everyone respects Rick Monday's act of courage 30 years ago at a \nbaseball game at Dodgers Stadium when he ran after two people who were \nabout to light an American flag on fire. He grabbed the flag away just \nas it was about to be burned.\n\n  But I agree with an editorial published last week in the Chicago Sun-\nTimes, which said the following:\n\n       Our appreciation of [Rick] Monday was not diminished by his \n     appearance last week at a rally for the proposed flag \n     desecration amendment--an event at which he exhibited the \n     rescued flag, which was presented to him by the Dodgers. But \n     however heartfelt this gesture was, it was wrongheaded in \n     lending support to a manufactured cause with no real value \n     except a political one, the equivalent of throwing red meat \n     on the table.\n\n  Tommy Lasorda is a great baseball manager, and I follow baseball. The \nlast time this amendment came up, Senator Hatch brought Tommy Lasorda \nin to testify. Tommy Lasorda recalled the incident; he was the manager \nof the Dodgers on the day it occurred, and Tommy Lasorda was emotional \nabout these people trying to burn the flag and Rick Monday running to \nits rescue.\n  I asked Tommy Lasorda this question: Did they televise those two guys \njumping out of the stands and burning the flag on the field?\n  He said, ``No.'' I said, ``Why not?''\n  ``You televise that sort of thing,'' Tommy Lasorda said, ``and it \nencourages it.''\n  So what would be the effect of calling for a constitutional amendment \non the floor of the Senate to ban an act that occurs so rarely in the \nUnited States? My fear is that it would only encourage people to \nconsider that sort of thing. We would put a spotlight on it instead of \nsaying it is only happening two or three times a year, it certainly is \nnot a national epidemic deserving of a constitutional amendment.\n  This flag amendment is all about the next election so that people who \nvote against it can be labeled as unpatriotic and un-American. There \nare better ways to show our commitment to our Constitution and our flag \nand our veterans. How about health care for our veterans? How about \nmaking sure we keep our promises to those who return from battle, that \nwe keep our promises to them that they be given medical care and \nhousing and the education they were promised? I wish the people pushing \nthis flag desecration amendment so hard would spend their energy on \nissues far more tangible to our Nation's veterans, such as health care.\n  Earlier this year, the President submitted his budget. He proposed to \nshortchange our veterans when it comes to their health. The President's \nbudget would force more than 50,000 Illinois veterans, many of whom are \nlow income, to pay more for their health care. Their monthly \nprescription drug costs would double.\n  The American Legion, one of the most zealous advocates for the flag \nburning amendment, recently issued an action alert letter and said they \nare very concerned about the underfunding of the VA. I salute the \nAmerican Legion. I hope they will channel more energy into helping our \nveterans than into changing our Bill of Rights.\n  The commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Jim Mueller, \nsaid this about President Bush's fiscal year 2007 budget:\n\n       The proposal to increase military retiree healthcare \n     premiums is absolutely unacceptable. . . .I urge Congress to \n     ensure that those serving in uniform and those who served \n     faithfully for many years are not forgotten in the budget \n     process.\n\n  Hats off to the VFW and the American Legion for speaking out for \nveterans. Channel that energy into making sure that veterans get a fair \nshake instead of watching a week go by on the floor of the Senate where \nwe debate this unnecessary constitutional amendment.\n  Giving the veterans a flag amendment is not substitute for health \ncare.\n  Flag burning does disturb some veterans. Another way of showing \nrespect for our veterans is to protect the sanctity of their funerals. \nI am going to be offering an amendment tomorrow to do just that.\n  By now, many Americans have heard of the disgraceful and hateful \nactions of one man named Fred Phelps. Mr. Phelps calls himself a \nminister, a religious minister. But his gospel seems to begin and end \nwith hatred and intolerance. About 15 years ago, this Mr. Phelps and a \nsmall band of his followers began picketing funerals of people who have \ndied of HIV/AIDS. They have reportedly picketed 22,000 funerals.\n  When their vile acts of hatred and bigotry stop generating the \npublicity they seek, they looked for new targets. They began to stage \nprotests at the funerals of our brave young men and women who have \ngiven their lives fighting for America in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the \npast year, these so-called Christians, these hate-mongers, who would \nuse the Bible as their shield, have protested at more than 100 military \nfunerals.\n  They claim the deaths of American Armed Forces, if you can believe \nthis--they claim the deaths of American soldiers are God's punishment \nfor Americans' tolerance of gays and lesbians. That is an affront to \ncivilized behavior. There may well be a special place in the afterlife \nfor people like Mr. Phelps, but there is no place for his brand of \nhatred at veterans' funerals in this life.\n  Last month, Congress passed and the President signed into law the \nRespect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which prohibits their \ndemonstrations at or around our national cemeteries. Tomorrow, I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to this measure--a statutory amendment not \na constitutional amendment--to expand that previous law so it applies \nto the funerals of all veterans, whether they are buried in a national \ncemetery, a church cemetery, or anywhere else.\n  My amendment will also prohibit protests at funeral homes, houses of \nworship, and other locations where deceased veterans are honored and \nburied. We can honor our veterans and protect their loved ones from \nthis intrusion on their grief without weakening our Constitution and \nthe freedoms for which veterans fought.\n  I hope my colleagues join me. I will offer my proposal as an \namendment to the Bennett/Clinton amendment to this underlying bill so \nwe can, in one amendment, criminalize the burning and defacing of the \nflag and also protect military funerals from Mr. Phelps and others like \nhim who would bring great disrespect at the funerals of our soldiers \nwho deserve the highest respect.\n  I have been very careful in writing this amendment to make sure it \nfollows the previous law, so there will be no successful constitutional \nchallenges in that regard.\n  I am also considering an amendment which I think is long overdue. It \nwould ban the consideration of constitutional amendments in election \nyears. We have seen too darned much politicking with the Constitution \nin this Chamber this month.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist 49 in 1788 that the U.S. \nConstitution should be amended only on ``great and extraordinary \noccasions.'' It appears now that biennial elections are great\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nand extraordinary occasions in the minds of the Republican leadership \nof the Senate. Madison warned of the ``danger of disturbing the public \ntranquility by interesting too strongly the public passions'' through \nfrequent constitutional amendments. Over 11,000 proposed constitutional \namendments have been introduced in Congress, including 66 during the \ncurrent 109th Congress.\n  Over the past three decades, the number of proposed constitutional \namendments considered on the Senate floor has increased dramatically. \nWhen in doubt here, amend the Constitution: from two amendments between \n1973 and 1983, to five amendments between 1983 and 1993, nine \namendments between 1993 and 2003, to four already in this 3-year cycle \nsince 2003.\n  There appears to be a trend toward considering constitutional \namendments on the Senate floor during even-numbered years which, \ncoincidentally, happen to be election years.\n  Constitutional amendments should be considered by Congress without \npoliticization. We should consider these for the serious suggestions \nthat they are, instead of electioneering, and that is what has happened \ntoo often on the floor of the Senate.\n  Americans' reverence for the flag does not have to be coerced or \npoliced. It is something we feel in our bones. When it comes to the \nBill of Rights, I trust Thomas Jefferson a lot more than Karl Rove. I \nbelieve the words of Thomas Jefferson have endured. I believe the \npolitical tactics of Mr. Rove and the Republican Party will not endure \nwhen it comes to using the Constitution for political purposes.\n\n  Remember what happened after September 11? Remember all the American \nflags that suddenly appeared? Stores sold out of flags. In a time of \nnational trauma and grief, these flags were our comfort and our \nstrength. They were a visible symbol of our unity and our faith that \nAmerica would endure. Our Nation had suffered a terrible loss, but the \nAmerican flag waved proudly.\n  Sadly, in the 5 years since then, with our Nation at war, there are \nthose who seek to pit us one against the other for political reasons. \nNow they want to use our flag as a wedge issue in this election.\n  This political effort to ``brand'' the flag as belonging to one party \ncauses some to feel sad and disillusioned. Bill Moyers, the journalist, \nthinker, and former Presidential adviser, was among many who felt \ntroubled by the effort to redefine respect for the flag as a partisan \nissue.\n  Last year, Bill Moyers made a speech about freedom in America in \nwhich he talked about the flag. He offered some profound words of \nwisdom that are worth reflecting upon today. He said the following:\n\n       I wore my flag tonight. First time. Until now I haven't \n     thought it necessary to display a little metallic icon of \n     patriotism for everyone to see. It was enough to vote, pay my \n     taxes, perform my civic duties, speak my mind, and do my best \n     to raise our kids to be good Americans.\n       Sometimes I would offer a small prayer of gratitude that I \n     had been born in a country whose institutions sustained me, \n     whose armed forces protected me, and whose ideals inspired \n     me; I offered my heart's affections in return. It no more \n     occurred to me to flaunt the flag on my chest than it did to \n     pin my mother's picture on my lapel to prove her son's love. \n     Mother knew where I stood; so does my country. I even tuck a \n     valentine in my tax returns on April 15.\n       So what's this doing here? Well, I put it on to take it \n     back. The flag's been hijacked and turned into a logo--the \n     trademark of a monopoly on patriotism. On those Sunday \n     morning talk shows, official chests appear adorned with the \n     flag as if it is the good housekeeping seal of approval. \n     During the State of the Union, did you notice Bush and Cheney \n     wearing the flag? How come? No administration's patriotism is \n     ever in doubt, only its policies. And the flag bestows no \n     immunity from error. When I see flags sprouting on official \n     lapels, I think of the time in China when I saw Mao's little \n     red book on every official's desk, omnipresent and unread.\n\n  I think Bill Moyers had it right. The flag amendment should not be \nused as a proxy for patriotism.\n  I respect our flag as the symbol of the freedom granted to us by the \nBill of Rights, and it is painful for me to see it burned or otherwise \ndefiled. I strongly believe that flag burning is an insensitive and \nshameful act, but I believe that it would be destructive to amend the \nBill of Rights for the first time in our nation's history and restrict \nthe precious freedoms ensured by the first amendment, simply to address \nan act which occurs in America only a few times a year.\n  The real test of our belief in the Bill of Rights--the real test of \nour patriotism--is when we rise in defense of the rights of those whose \nviews we disagree with or even despise. The right to free speech is a \nbedrock of our democracy. Amending our Constitution's Bill of Rights \nwould be a strike against the very freedoms for which the flag stands \nand for which so many Americans have given their lives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 12, \nthe proposal to amend our Constitution to return to Congress the \nauthority to legislate on the issue of flag desecration. Like my \ncolleagues, I do not take lightly the concept of amending our \nConstitution, but in this area, a runaway judiciary has left us no \nchoice.\n  No other emblem is as synonymous or representative of our Nation as \nthe American flag. No other image depicts as readily the freedoms and \nideals our men and women in uniform have battled for. Americans proudly \nfly our flag to demonstrate their love for our country and for their \nneighbors. Schoolchildren have been pledging allegiance to it every \nmorning for decades. The American flag has been flown in times of \nbattle, of victory, and of national tragedy. It is the most recognized \nsymbol of freedom and democracy in the world.\n  Our flag should be protected from those who would desecrate it and \ndemonstrate a basic lack of respect for our national heritage. At the \nvery least, decisions about whether and how to protect our flag should \nbe made by the legislative branch, not the unelected judiciary.\n  The proposal before us today would not immediately ban flag \ndesecration, as its opponents would lead you to believe. Rather, it \nwould return the power to legislate on the issue to Congress and the \nStates, where it belongs. This constitutional amendment will restore \nthe legislative authority to protect our flag to the legislative \nbranch.\n  I will be voting in favor of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in doing the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, during the week of June 19 through June 25, \nnationwide we celebrate in observance of Juneteenth Independence Day. \nAlthough passage of the 13th amendment in January 1865, legally \nabolished slavery, many African-Americans remained in servitude due to \nthe slow dissemination of this news across the country. It was not \nuntil June 19, 1865, that Union troops reached Galveston, TX, and \nemancipated the last of the slaves. Since that time, over 130 years \nago, the descendants of slaves have observed this anniversary of \nemancipation as a remembrance of one of the most tragic periods of our \nNation's history. The suffering, degradation and brutality of slavery \ncannot be repaired, but the memory can serve to ensure that no such \ninhumanity is ever perpetrated again on American soil.\n  It is appropriate and necessary that we, as a nation, recognize \nJuneteenth and use this day to reflect upon how far we have come and \nhow far we still have to go. While it was on this historic day in 1865 \nthat slaves were finally freed of the onerous yoke of slavery, the same \ncannot be said about the burden of pervasive racial oppression and \nsecond-class citizenship, which would not be eradicated in earnest \nuntil 100 years later through the civil rights movement of the 1960s. \nAlthough we have made tremendous progress in eliminating discrimination \nand creating equal opportunities over the years, the American dream \ncontinues to elude the grasp of many Americans.\n  I would like to reflect on the courageous and revolutionary leaders \nwho\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\npioneered the Civil Rights Movement and bridged the gap between \nemancipation in 1865 and equality in the 1960s. It seems only \nappropriate to begin with the person who first proposed to commemorate \nthe achievements of former slaves and their descendants: Dr. Carter G. \nWoodson. A son of former slaves and a man who rose from the coal mines \nof West Virginia to the summit of academic achievement, Dr. Woodson's \nstory is considered one of the most inspiring and instructive stories \nin African-American history.\n  Writer, editor, and lecturer Lerone Bennett tells us his story: ``At \n17, the young man who was called by history to reveal Black history was \nan untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching himself the fundamentals \nof English and arithmetic, he entered high school and mastered the \nfour-year curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of \na year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \nand studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then \nwent on to the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor's \nand master's degrees, and to Harvard University, where he became the \nsecond Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is history--\nBlack history.''\n  In 1926, Dr. Woodson founded African-American history month: a time \nto recognize the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, \ndignity, faith, and conviction, who strived for the betterment of a \nnation once lacking in humanity toward them.\n  So it is in the spirit and vision of Dr. Woodson that I pay tribute \nto three courageous and inspiring African-Americans who played \nsignificant roles in addressing American injustice and inequality.\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth and Mrs. Rosa Parks, two women \nfrom my State, and the venerable Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., are \nindelibly etched in the chronicles of the history of this great Nation, \nand they are also widely viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement and a groundbreaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan honored her with the dedication of the \nSojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, \nMI, on September 25, 1999.\n  Truth lived in Washington, DC, for several years, helping slaves who \nhad fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. \nShe returned to Battle Creek in 1875 and remained there until her death \nin 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most troubling \nissues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions is that her \nwords continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted authorizing the President of \nthe United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the late \nMrs. Rosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this fitting tribute to Mrs. \nParks, the gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate \nthe humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her \npersonal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and \nrespect by us all.\n  Fifty-one years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Mrs. Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people but the \nentire world. The boycott that Mrs. Parks initiated was the beginning \nof an American revolution that elevated the status of African-Americans \nnationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day \nhave a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin \nLuther King, Jr.\n  Perhaps more than any other single person, it was Dr. King--with his \nvisionary leadership and inspiring rhetorical skills--who can be \nconsidered the driving force behind the 1960s civil rights movement.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and \nequality for all. We still however have work to do. In the names of \nRosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Carter G. Woodson, Martin Luther King, \nJr., and many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the \nstruggle for human rights.\n  I am happy to join with my colleague, Senator Barack Obama, in \ncommemorating Juneteenth Independence Day with the submission of S. \nCon. Res. 42. This resolution recognizes the end of slavery and reminds \nus to never forget even the worst aspects of our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6488-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6488-S6489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JEROME HOLMES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four letters \nwritten in support of the nomination of Jerome Holmes to the Tenth \nCircuit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       State Capitol Building,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 19, 2006.\n     Re recommendation of Jerome A. Holmes, U.S. Court of Appeals \n         for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: As Governor of the State of Oklahoma, \n     and as a former Chair of the State Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, I have had a lot of experience in the selection of \n     judges. In our modified Missouri system of appointment of \n     judges, the Governor plays a key role when judicial vacancies \n     occur. Not only does the Governor appoint members to the \n     Judicial Nominating Commission, but he or she also is \n     forwarded the final three names of judicial applicants for \n     gubernatorial selection. I take this responsibility very \n     seriously, and I have personally intervewed every single \n     candidate forwarded to me.\n       I have come to know and respect Mr. Jerome Holmes, a \n     nominee for the Tenth Circuit vacancy created by the \n     retirement of my friend, Judge Stephanie Seymour. Jerome is a \n     highly qualified candidate, a superb lawyer with a reputation \n     for fairness, ethics and integrity. Indeed, I recently \n     appointed his former supervisor, Judge Arlene Johnson, to our \n     court of last resort on criminal matters, the Oklahoma Court \n     of Criminal Appeals. When Arlene was Chief of the Criminal \n     Division of the U.S. Attorney's office in the Western \n     District of Oklahoma, Jerome was her chief deputy. Their \n     division was considered a model division of the U.S. \n     Attorney's office. Jerome handled this difficult task with \n     competence and honor, and he was part of the prosecution team \n     that brought charges against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma \n     City federal building bombing.\n       I have also come to know Jerome on a personal basis through \n     the Oklahoma Symposium, a sort of ``think tank'' gathering of \n     top Oklahomans that meets formally once a year, and \n     informally in small groups from time to time. It is an honor \n     to be invited to join the Symposium, and Jerome was among the \n     first to be invited for membership.\n       Jerome is uniquely qualified for this position. He served \n     as a law clerk for Federal District Judge Wayne Alley and \n     then for the then-Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, the honorable Judge William Holloway. Jerome then \n     practiced for several years in civil litigation before \n     devoting himself for eleven years to the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office in Oklahoma City. For several months, he has been \n     practicing at Crowe & Dunlevy, one of the largest and most \n     respected law firms in Oklahoma. In short, I do not think you \n     could have a candidate more highly qualified and regarded \n     than Jerome Holmes.\n       I hope you will see fit to appoint this remarkably talented \n     young man to this important position. I know of the Tenth \n     Circuit, as well, because my cousin, Judge Robert Henry, will \n     become the Chief Judge of that Circuit in 2008. I know he \n     shares my high regard for Jerome, as he has told me of \n     Jerome's excellent professional appearances before that \n     court.\n       I continue, Senator, to appreciate the very important work \n     that you do. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be \n     of service, or, of course, if you should come to Oklahoma.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Brad Henry,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Ryan, Whaley & Coldiron,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 21, 2006.\n     Re nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I am writing in \n     support of the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes for the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n       I am a lifelong Democrat. For six years I was fortunate to \n     work on the United States Senate staff of Senator David Boren \n     and the Senate Agriculture Committee. During this time I met \n     Senator Leahy and personally witnessed his leadership as a \n     committee chairman. I was the Democratic nominee for\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\n     an Oklahoma congressional race in 1994. I later became a \n     federal prosecutor and eventually served as the United States \n     Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, first through \n     appointment by Attorney General Janet Reno and then through \n     nomination by President Clinton.\n       I have known Jerome Holmes for over ten years through our \n     work together in the United States Attorney's Office and now \n     in private practice. I believe his intellect, experience and \n     character make him an excellent choice for a position on the \n     appellate court. I saw these qualities firsthand as Jerome \n     carried out his many responsibilities as a prosecutor. One of \n     the most important duties he performed was that of the \n     office's legal ethics and professional responsibility \n     counselor. Jerome acted ably in this capacity during a time \n     of heightened scrutiny for federal prosecutors following the \n     passage of the Hyde Act and the McDade Amendment. Since both \n     of you are former prosecutors, I trust that you can \n     appreciate the degree of confidence in Jerome's abilities and \n     integrity that were required in order to be given such an \n     assignment by me and other United States Attorneys.\n       Jerome's nomination has apparently triggered concern from \n     groups that have focused on his writings on affirmative \n     action. In this regard. I can offer three observations. \n     First, I have known Jerome to be open-minded and respectful \n     of different views. More importantly. I know Jerome to be \n     respectful of the role of the courts, as opposed to the role \n     of the advocates, and I believe this understanding to be \n     partly the result of his three years of service as a law \n     clerk for federal appellate and district judges. Finally. as \n     noted above. I know Jerome to be a person of unwavering \n     integrity. Therefore, when Jerome states under oath that he \n     will put his personal views aside and follow the law. I \n     believe he will do just that.\n       I hope these observations are helpful as you consider \n     Jerome's nomination. which I hope you will act upon \n     favorably. I respectfully request that this letter be made \n     part of the committee record regarding his nomination. If I \n     can be further assistance or if you or your staff have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel G. Webber. Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Oklahoma City, OK,\n\n                                                    June 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I am writing in reference \n     to the nomination of the Honorable Mr. Jerome A. Holmes, \n     Esq.'s judicial appointment. I appreciate the concern that \n     has been expressed about his nomination based upon his \n     writings and positions on affirmative action. In all honesty \n     I stand in a position that is contrary to the interpreted and \n     most likely actual personal stance of Mr. Holmes, yet my \n     relationship with him moved me to write and to express my \n     support for him.\n       I have known Mr. Holmes for many years and believe that he \n     does have a high regard for the views of those who maybe \n     different from his own. That in and of itself is enough for \n     me to believe that he would ``hear'' fairly. In addition, Mr. \n     Holmes has displayed a level of integrity in all his dealings \n     that I have been aware and has shown in our personal \n     conversation willingness to listen and respect differing \n     views. I trust Mr. Holmes and so in light of our differences \n     I support his nomination.\n       I do realize the responsibility that is upon me as a \n     Pastor, Community Leader and a concerned citizen. This is no \n     light matter for me, indeed it is with much prayer and \n     struggle that I searched out the right words to convey the \n     right tone to reinforce my message. As a member of the NAACP, \n     Urban League and many other organizations that fight for the \n     rights of minorities, I am moved to ask your continued \n     approval of this nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             George E.

Arlen Specter, Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member,\n     U.S. Senate, Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Distinguished Senators: It is truly an honor to offer \n     this Letter of Recommendation for your consideration on \n     behalf of Jerome Holmes, a nominee for the 10th Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n       I have known Jerome Holmes for several years, both \n     professionally and personally, as I am also a member of the \n     Oklahoma Bar Association. I know him to be a person of \n     Integrity and Character and I have always appreciated Mr. \n     Holmes' fairness in our dealings. What's more, I have \n     witnessed Mr. Holmes' efforts in our local community to \n     improve the lives of those around us; all people regardless \n     of where they live, what they look like or how much money \n     they have. He has an altruistic spirit that makes him a \n     standout in this world.\n       I serve Oklahoma County as one of three elected County \n     Commissioners, am a proud Democrat and consider Jerome Holmes \n     to be a principled leader who demonstrates mutual respect for \n     all people. In particular, he is respectful of views that \n     differ from his own and he enjoys tremendous bipartisan \n     support and respect.\n       If I can provide any further information or perspective, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                         Jim Roth,\n     County Commissioner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6489-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAFE AND TIMELY PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Safe \nand Timely Placement of Children Act was passed during the wrap-up \nsession on Friday, June 23, 2006. I have worked with Senators DeWine \nand Domenici on this issue for several years to help foster children to \nbe placed with adoptive parents or family across State lines.\n  Currently it can take twice or three times as long for a child to be \nplaced in a home, if that home happens to be in another State. This is \nsad, and it needs to be fixed.\n  The House bill, identical to our Senate legislation, will help fix \nthis process and help these children. It provides a mix of incentives \nand timeframes for States to achieve the safe and timely placement of \nchildren between States.\n  This legislation was part of the WE CARE Kids Act, and it should help \nto deliver on the promises made in the Adoption and Safe Families Act \nof 1997 which stated that geographic barriers should not delay or deny \nadoptions. When a child leaves foster care and goes out of State, half \nof the time the child is being adopted and gaining a permanent home. In \nabout 20 percent of the cases, a child is being placed with a relative. \nThese are good, permanent options for children, and it should not take \ntwice as long to achieve such a placement.\n  In my view, this complements and builds upon actions by many States \nto update the 1960 Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to add specific timeframes and to \nprovide Federal incentives to achieve the goal set in 1997 of reducing \nand eliminating geographic barriers.\n  As technology has vastly improved and more families seek to open \ntheir hearts and homes to children in foster care, we need improved \nregulations and policies to serve such families. This legislation is \npart of the DeWine-Rockefeller bill, called the We Care Kids Act. \nThanks to the leadership of Chairman Grassley, the major provisions of \nWe Care Kids Act were included in the reconciliation package to invest \nin court training and data to help judges have insight and the \ninformation needed to care for the vulnerable children in foster care. \nBut action could not be taken to improve interstate case planning \nwithin the reconciliation bill. In 2004, similar legislation passed the \nHouse of Representatives, and now it will finally become law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6489-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6489-S6490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROBERT J. RUCH\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor LTC Robert J. \nRuch, District Commander, Philadelphia District, U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers on the occasion of his Change of Command Ceremony which will \ntake place on Friday, July 10, 2006. At that time, Lieutenant Colonel \nRuch will pass command of the Philadelphia District to LTC Gwen E. \nBaker after providing the State of Delaware and the region with 2 years \nof honorable and meritorious service in carrying out his duties.\n  As the 53rd Philadelphia District Engineer, LTC Robert J. Ruch has \ncommanded a 500-person engineering organization since 2004 that \nprovides national, economic, and environmental security in the heart of \nthe Northeast Corridor. His responsibilities have included dredging \nwaterways for navigation, protecting communities from flooding and \ncoastal storms, responding to natural and declared disasters, \nregulating construction in the Nation's waters and wetlands, \nremediation of environmental hazards, restoring ecosystems, building \nfacilities for the Army and Air Force, and providing engineering, \ncontracting and project management services for other government \nagencies upon request.\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n  Established in 1866, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Philadelphia \nDistrict encompasses the 13,000-square-mile Delaware River Basin and \nthe Atlantic coast from New Jersey's Manasquan Inlet to the Delaware-\nMaryland line. Within its boundaries are more than 8 million people in \neastern Pennsylvania, western and southern New Jersey, most of \nDelaware, New York's Catskills region and part of northeastern \nMaryland. It also includes two State capitals--Trenton, NJ, and Dover, \nDE--and the Delaware River ports complex from Philadelphia and Camden, \nNJ, to Wilmington, DE.\n  Just in the First State alone, Lieutenant Colonel Ruch's \naccomplishments during his 2-year tour of duty have been impressive. \nThey include completion of major storm damage reduction projects at \nRehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach and Fenwick Island, considerable progress \non a new $70 million air freight terminal complex at Dover Air Force \nBase, partnership in a promising program to restore oyster populations \nin the Delaware Bay, commencement of a long-awaited project to reduce \nflood damages in the town of Elsmere, development of a trail concept \nplan to provide recreational opportunities along the Chesapeake and \nDelaware Canal, and even removal of an old abandoned shipwreck from the \nhistoric Christina River--not to mention a host of other successful \nprojects in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, or the fact that all \nthis was carried out while many of his Philadelphia district employees \nwere deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq or helping out down south after \nthe Nation's worst-ever hurricane season.\n  Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers in \n1986, Lieutenant Colonel Ruch began his military career with the 7th \nEngineer Battalion, 5th Infantry Division, Mechanized, at Fort Polk, \nLA, as a platoon leader and company executive officer. Follow-on \nassignments included liaison officer and company commander with the 2nd \nEngineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Castle, Republic of \nKorea, and the Live Fire Engineer Trainer for the National Training \nCenter at Fort Irwin, CA. He then worked as an operations officer in \nthe Pittsburgh District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, before moving on \nto Fort Riley, KS, as S3 of the 1st Engineer Battalion, and then of the \n937th Engineer Group, Combat. And just before coming to Philadelphia, \nLieutenant Colonel Ruch served with Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers \nEurope, Belgium, as the senior staff officer for NATO Infrastructure in \nCrisis Response Operations dealing with operations in Afghanistan and \nin the Balkans.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ruch holds a bachelor of science in geo-\nenvironmental science from Shippensburg University and a master's in \nengineering management from St. Martin's College. He is a graduate of \nthe Engineer Officer Basic and Advanced Courses and of the U.S. Army \nCommand and General Staff College. His military decorations include the \nDefense Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Meritorious Service Medal, \nfour oak leaf clusters, the Army Commendation Medal, three oak leaf \nclusters, the Army Achievement Medal and the Army Superior Unit Award.\n  After turning over the command of the Philadelphia District to LTC \nGwen Baker on July 7, 2006, Lieutenant Colonel Ruch will move on to \nFort Hood, TX, as division engineer of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division.\n  I rise today to congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Ruch for a \ndistinguished career and to offer my special thanks for his enthusiasm, \ncompetence and effectiveness in serving the State of Delaware and the \nGreater Philadelphia Region.\n  We will miss him in the Delaware Valley and on the Delmarva \nPeninsula. We wish him and his family all the best in the years to \ncome, including, as we say in the Navy, ``Fair winds and a following \nsea.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6490-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PALDEN GYATSO\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President today, in honor of the International \nDay in Support of Victims of Torture, one of my Minnesota constituents, \nMichael Pittman, has asked that I recognize Tibetan monk Palden Gyatso.\n  Palden Gyatso was born in a Tibetan village in 1922 and became a \nBuddhist monk by age 10. In 1959, during the Chinese invasion and \noccupation of Tibet, Mr. Gyatso was jailed for protesting along with \nthousands of religious Tibetans. Mr. Gyatso spent more than 30 years of \nhis life in prisons and labor camps, where he was a victim to religious \nand class oppression. He was tortured by various methods, which \nincluded being beaten with a club ridden with nails, shocked by an \nelectric probe, which scarred his tongue and caused his teeth to fall \nout, whipped while being forced to pull an iron plow, and starved.\n  Despite these inhumane conditions and cruel tortures, Palden Gyatso \nwas able to survive with remarkable courage and resilience. During his \ntorture sessions, he would practice a technique he learned while \nstudying at a Buddhist monastery, the practice of tonglen, which is a \nmethod for connecting with suffering and awakening compassion. He would \nreceive the anger and hatred of his torturer and would exchange it with \nlove and compassion.\n  During his imprisonment, Palden Gyatso drew inspiration from elder \nprisoners, who told him that if he were ever to escape, he should take \naction to stop the torture. He has done exactly that: He has traveled \nto Europe and North America over 25 times and has written a book to \ntell his story. He has also testified before the U.N. Commission on \nHuman Rights in Geneva and before the U.S. Congress.\n  Palden Gyatso's testimony helped secure passage of the International \nReligious Freedom Act of 1998, which was sponsored by Representative \nFrank Wolf and Senator Joseph Lieberman and Don Nickles, and was signed \ninto law by President Clinton. Palden Gyatso was also awarded the 1998 \nJohn Humphrey Freedom Award of the International Centre for Human \nRights and Democratic Development.\n  The courage and dedication to freedom which Palden Gyatso has \ndemonstrated serve as a powerful inspiration to everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6490-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6490-S6491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BG JAMES D. HITTLE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, during most of our lives, we \nencounter an individual who lived a remarkably fine personal and \nprofessional life. Such is the case of BG James D. Hittle, USMCR, whose \nanniversary of his death, June 15, recently passed. General Hittle's \ndeath received very little press coverage at the time, and I would like \nto share with my colleagues what this man achieved in his life time in \nthe words of a former Commandant of the Marine Corps, GEN P.X. Kelley, \nUSMC (Ret.)\n  I ask that the eulogy given by General Kelley be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n             A Tribute to BGen James D. Hittle, USMC (Ret)\n\n                  (By Gen Paul X. Kelley, USMC (Ret))\n\n       BGen James Donald Hittle--devout Christian--great \n     American--Marine officer--gentleman and gentle man--loving \n     husband--caring father--always a friend indeed!\n       Commissioned a Marine second lieutenant in 1937, Don Hittle \n     was a ``plank owner'' when MajGen Holland Smith activated the \n     1st Marine Division for World War II--was G-4 for the 3d \n     Marine Division under MajGen Graves Erskine on Guam and at \n     Iwo Jima--and after the war commanded 2d Battalion, 7th \n     Marines in the occupation of North China.\n       After serving his Corps for 23 years, Don Hittle's future \n     life could easily qualify him as a quintessential \n     ``Renaissance Man.''\n       He was Director of National Security and Foreign Affairs \n     for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, syndicated columnist for \n     Copley News Service, commentator for Mutual Broadcasting \n     System, Special Counsel for both the Senate and House Armed \n     Services Committees, a founder and Director of the DC \n     National Bank, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower \n     and Reserve Affairs, Senior Vice President for Pan American \n     Airways, consultant to the President of the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation, advisor to several Secretaries of the \n     Navy and Commandants of the Marine Corps--and the list goes \n     on and on and on.\n       Col Don Hittle came into my life during the summer of 1956 \n     when MajGen Jim Riseley dragged me kicking and screaming from \n     a cushy tour in what was then the Territory of Hawaii to the \n     labyrinthian corridors of Headquarters Marine Corps. As many \n     of those here today will recall, this was the long, hot \n     summer of Ribbon Creek, and Don Hittle was Legislative \n     Assistant to Randolph McCall Pate, our 21st Commandant. I was \n     a young eager, starry-eyed captain, very naive in the arcane \n     world at the Seat of Government--but I was soon to learn. My \n     first lesson was negative one--that\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n     a junior officer should never ask the Legislative Assistant \n     to the Commandant for a description of his duties and \n     responsibilities. With that said, I did notice that every \n     time Col Hittle came charging into Gen Riseley's office he \n     closed the door behind him. While I readily admit to not \n     being a ``rocket scientist,'' I did surmise that there were \n     some ``big time'' discussions underway. But, as the saying \n     goes: ``Nothing succeeds quite like success.'' I was soon to \n     learn that by working closely with the Congress, where \n     Members and their staffs knew him, respected him, and trusted \n     him, Don Hittle had effectively minimized the repercussions \n     from Ribbon Creek. One senior Member from the House of \n     Representatives was heard to say: ``Don Hittle is the best \n     damned Legislative Assistant the Marine Corps has ever had.''\n       One could go on for hours, perhaps days, about Don's myriad \n     contributions to his country and his Corps. As an example, I \n     could tell you how he more than any other saved the Army Navy \n     Club from extinction. Senator John Warner, who is here with \n     us today, could tell you that when he was Secretary of the \n     Navy he never had a more imaginative and dedicated Assistant \n     Secretary. Joe Bartlett, the former House Reading Clerk and a \n     retired Marine Corps general, could tell you how Don Hittle \n     was responsible for the creation of the dynamic Congressional \n     Marine Club. Incidentally, Jim Lawrence, who is also with us \n     today, once said of this organization: ``Congress created the \n     Marine Corps--Congress has sustained the Marine Corps--\n     Congress had mandated the mission of the Marine Corps--\n     through this organization we are now bonded to each other \n     forever.''\n       In the end, however, all of his many other contributions to \n     his country and to his beloved Corps pale by comparison to \n     what he accomplished as a member of the renowned ``Chowder \n     Society,'' that elite group of brilliant Marine officers who, \n     in the aftermath of World War II when the very life of our \n     Corps was threatened, ensured that our existence, our roles, \n     and our missions were written into law. Don's critical role \n     in the survival of his Corps was best described by Gen \n     Merrill Twining when he inscribed his book ``No Bended \n     Knee.'' ``To: Don Hittle, Who saved our Corps.'' There can \n     be no doubt that the Corps we have today, with three \n     active divisions and wings written into law, owes an \n     enormous debt of gratitude to BGen James D. Hittle, USMC \n     (Ret).\n       Isn't it ironic to remember that 55 years ago certain \n     groups, whose objectives were inimical to the survival of our \n     Corps, were attempting to relegate us into insignificance. \n     Today, with a lion's share of the credit for making it \n     possible going to Don Hittle, we have just heard that Jim \n     Jones, our 32d Commandant, is soon to be the Supreme Allied \n     Commander in Europe. Our congratulations go to Jim--his Corps \n     is very proud--Don Hittle is very proud!\n       Several years after my retirement, Don asked me to join him \n     for lunch at his Army Navy Club. His purpose was to ask if I \n     would give his eulogy. I was honored beyond belief, but did \n     not look forward to the day when it would become a reality.\n       Before closing, let me share with you a story that Joe \n     Bartlett told me last week.\n       Jinny and Joe are members of a Bible class at their church. \n     As a gesture of their love and caring for those who are \n     terminally ill, the class prepares an audio tape for their \n     listening. On one side they include the patient's favorite \n     hymns, and, on the other, a medley of their favorite tunes. \n     During Don's last days with us--a time when he was under \n     heavy sedation--Joe swears that Don's body stiffened to \n     attention every time ``The Marine's Hymn'' was played.\n       In closing, let me remind you that Don lived by two simple \n     words--words which have given inspiration to our Corps for \n     over 200 years--Semper Fidelis--always faithful.\n       Don Hittle was always:\n       Semper Fidelis to his God.\n       Semper Fidelis to his country.\n       Semper Fidelis to his family.\n       Semper Fidelis to his Corps.\n       And, Semper Fidelis to his fellow man.\n       In Don's memory, then, let us share these meaningful words \n     with each other as we leave this holy place--and let us pray \n     that one day we can live in a world where all of its citizens \n     are Semper Fidelis to each other. Don Hittle would like \n     that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6491-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING BISHOP WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity \ntoday to recognize Bishop Preston Warren Williams II, a man of faith \nand conviction and a leader in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. \nI am privileged to extend my congratulations to Bishop Williams as he \nassumes the role of president of the Council of Bishops. This role \nrequires an extraordinary person, one of both strength and distinction, \nand the AME Church has found one in Bishop Williams. Bishop Williams, \nalong with his wife Mother Wilma Delores Webb-Williams as Episcopal \nSupervisor, have been dedicated public servants and tireless advocates \nfor at-risk youth of the 7th district. I am confident that Bishop \nWilliams' leadership will enrich the entire AME community.\n  The AME Church has an unwavering commitment to its members and should \nbe commended for its special mission to strengthen the community by \nencouraging and supporting children. While leading the 7th District, \nBishop Williams built a partnership for at-risk youth, helped lobby for \na teen mentoring program, and put in place services to provide for \nchildren in poverty.\n  When Bishop Williams served at the 17th District AME in Central \nAfrica, membership grew by over 100,000, eventually resulting in the \ncreation of a 20th District. Fittingly, Bishop Williams used his power \nand influence to bring people together and inspire hope in that part of \nthe world.\n  His dedication to faith and community extends beyond the church into \nacademia. As chairman of Allen University in Columbia, SC, and member \nof the board of Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, Bishop \nWilliams brings his passion and fearless leadership to our students. \nBishop Williams is a spiritual leader, an activist, community leader, \nhusband and mentor. I join with others in lauding his service, \nintegrity, and vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6491-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6491-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6491-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSMITTING LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE \n          UNITED STATES-OMAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA)--PM 53\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to \nimplement the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This FTA \nenhances our bilateral relationship with a strategic friend and ally in \nthe Middle East region. The FTA will benefit the people of the United \nStates and Oman, illustrating for other developing countries the \nadvantages of open markets and increased trade.\n  In negotiating this FTA, my Administration was guided by the \nobjectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. Congressional approval of \nthis FTA will mark another important step towards creating a Middle \nEast Free Trade Area. Like our FTA with Bahrain that the Congress \napproved in December 2005, and our FTA with Morocco that was approved \nin July 2004, this FTA offers another important opportunity to \nencourage economic reform in a moderate Muslim nation. Oman is leading \nthe pursuit of social and economic reforms in the region, including by \nselling state-owned businesses, encouraging foreign investment \nconnected to broad-based development, and providing better protection \nfor women and workers. It is strongly in our national interest to \nembrace these reforms and do what we can to encourage them.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to designate Sandoval County, Valencia County, and \nTorrance County, New Mexico as the new Southwest Border High Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Area counties; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nsignificantly help my home State of New Mexico fight the war on drugs.\n  New Mexico has many serious drug problems. The proximity of my home \nState to Mexico makes it a convenient\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\ncorridor for traffickers who smuggle narcotics into the United States. \nIn a June 22 Albuquerque Journal article entitled ``N.M. Says It's \nMaking Progress Against Meth Labs,'' State Police Sergeant Eric Burnham \nwas quoted as saying, ``We've made it much tougher for them to get \ntheir main ingredients, and we've made it difficult to sustain large \noperations here in New Mexico . . . But methamphetamine use has stayed \nthe same or even risen. Large quantities are coming in from Mexico--\nthey're being smuggled in and sold for cheap.'' In additional to our \nserious meth problems in New Mexico, cocaine seizures are on the rise, \nMexican marijuana is prevalent, and Mexican black tar heroin is \navailable throughout my home State.\n  However, New Mexico also has a significant tool in the war on drugs--\nthe Southwest border high-intensity drug trafficking area, HIDTA. In \n1988, Congress established the HIDTA Program. In New Mexico, there are \ncurrently 13 counties that participate in the Southwest border HIDTA, \nwith the missions of reducing drug availability through task forces \naimed at disrupting or dismantling international and domestic drug \ntrafficking organizations and helping coordinate drug trafficking \ninvestigative efforts among Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Despite these efforts, drug abuse continues to affect many in my \nState, particularly in the Albuquerque Metropolitan area. The Southwest \nborder HIDTA tells me that in this area, investigative links between \nnarcotic trafficking groups are established frequently, often between \nBernalillo County and surrounding counties that are not part of the \nSouthwest border HIDTA and therefore don't have access to HIDTA tools \nand resources. The legislation I am filing today would rectify this \nsituation by making the three surrounding counties, Sandoval, Torrance, \nand Valencia, part of the Southwest border HIDTA.\n  Mr. President, high-intensity drug trafficking areas have done a \ngreat deal in the war on drugs in the past 18 years. With the bill I am \nintroducing today, HIDTA will be able to do even more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING \n                   AREA.\n\n       The Southwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n     for the State of New Mexico under the High Intensity Drug \n     Trafficking Areas Program of the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy shall include Sandoval County, Valencia \n     County, and Torrance County, New Mexico.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 3568. A bill to protect information relating to consumers, to \nrequire notice of security breaches, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague \non the Banking Committee, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, to \nintroduce legislation that I believe is of great importance to our \neconomy and to American consumers. This legislation, The Data Security \nAct of 2006, will help protect individuals and businesses from the \ncrimes of identity theft and account fraud, which are increasing at an \nalarming rate. These crimes impose higher costs on every consumer and \nbusiness and can be financially debilitating to individuals whose \npersonal information is stolen.\n  We are now living in the Information Age. Information drives our \neconomy, from the design and production phase of new products or \nservices to payment and delivery. Information technology and electronic \nnetworks have brought conveniences and efficiencies to both producers \nand consumers in our economy. Producers can better focus their products \nand services to potential customers, and consumers get the products \nthey want with multiple payment options. Technology and, specifically, \ninformation technology makes this process ever more convenient and \nefficient.\n  All of the conveniences and efficiencies of the information age which \nbenefit our evolving economy and its consumers have also brought new \nchallenges. Criminals have also entered the information age and are now \ntargeting and using information technology to steal from many of us.\n  Information databases and electronic information networks that \ncontain sensitive personal information and sensitive financial account \ninformation are increasingly targets of sophisticated hackers, \norganized crime rings, identity thieves, and other criminals. When an \nindividual has his identity or account information stolen from one of \nthese sources and criminals use his or her legitimate name and credit \nhistory to create fraudulent accounts, or fraudulently access an \nexisting account, by the time it is discovered, it is often too late to \nprevent that consumer from the need to invest significant time and \neffort to clear his or her name. These crimes also impose significant \ncosts on financial institutions which are often liable for the loss of \nfunds from the fraud. These costs are then passed on to all consumers \nthrough higher prices. We need to do more to prevent this type of fraud \nfrom happening in the first instance.\n  Currently, we are only partially protecting consumers from account \nfraud and identity theft. Criminals have shown they know how to exploit \nany weakness in information databases and networks, so we must do more \nto protect this information regardless of where it is located. Most of \nthe recent data security breaches have occurred outside of financial \ninstitutions.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to protect \nthe security and confidentiality of customer information. The Federal \nbanking agencies have issued guidance under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \nrequiring banks to investigate and provide notices to customers of \nbreaches of data security involving customer information that could \nlead to account fraud or identity theft. Even with GLB and the \nassociated regulations and guidance that have been implemented, many \ndatabases and information networks continue to be vulnerable because \nFederal law generally does not require entities that are not financial \ninstitutions to protect the security and confidentiality of sensitive \ninformation relating to consumers, or to investigate and provide \nnotices to consumers of breaches that may lead to account fraud or \nidentity theft.\n\n  I recognize that many States have enacted security breach \nnotification statutes in an effort to protect their citizens and I \ncommend them for their efforts, but these statutes impose different and \nsometimes conflicting requirements, thereby providing consumers with \nuneven protection and subjecting businesses to multiple and confusing \nstandards.\n  Our credit granting system and financial payments system is a \nnational one and not a state based system. Consumers generally benefit \ngreatly because of our national system. Because of that fact, I believe \nwe need a national uniform system governing data security and security \nbreach notification for financial institutions and other entities that \nmaintain or communicate financial account information or personally \nidentifiable information that could be used by identity thieves.\n  The standards established as a result of the guidance issued by the \nFederal banking agencies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provide an \nappropriate model for Federal data security and security breach \nnotification requirements and is, therefore, the model for the Data \nSecurity Act of 2006.\n  The Data Security Act of 2006 will provide a uniform national \nstandard for data security and breach notification. Sensitive personal \nand account information must be protected, and in the event where that \nprotection is breached and there is a risk to the individual of \nidentity theft or account fraud, that individual must be notified so \nthat he or she can take the appropriate steps to protect him or her \nself.\n  I encourage my colleagues to c1ose}y review this legislation and I \nhope we can act quickly here in the Senate to pass the Data Security \nAct of 2006. I thank my friend from Delaware, Senator Carper, for \njoining with me today to introduce this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\n  S. 3569. A bill to implement the United States-Oman Free Trade \nAgreement, to the Committee on Finance pursuant to section 2103(b)3 of \nPublic Law 107-210.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with \nSenator Dorgan the Restitution for Victims of Crime Act of 2006.\n  This bill is needed to recover some of the mounting uncollected \nFederal criminal debt. The Federal Government is collecting just \npennies on each dollar of Federal criminal debt that is owed. In my \nhome State of Iowa for fiscal year 2005, for example, the Justice \nDepartment has an outstanding balance of nearly $82 million in \nuncollected criminal debt. Compared to other districts, Iowa's northern \nand southern districts have relatively small outstanding balances. \nNationwide, over $41 billion remains outstanding.\n  The Restitution for Victims of Crime Act improves the procedures used \nto collect restitution. It also provides the authority to preserve \nassets to satisfy restitution orders. This bill gives our Federal \ncriminal justice system the channels they need to not only successfully \nprosecute criminals but to recover the debts owed.\n  Both the Justice Department and the victims' rights community support \nthis bill and recognize that it will significantly improve the current \ncollection system.\n  This is an important bill and I am glad to join my good friend from \nNorth Dakota in introducing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6495-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 105--COMMENDING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA \n FOR ITS RENEWED COMMITMENT TO THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending matter \nbefore us, S.J. Res. 12 which would amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. There are only seventeen words in the amendment: The \nCongress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nflag of the United States. These seventeen words have great \nsignificance.\n  I hold dear the great genius of our wonderful Constitution. I have \ncarried this tattered copy with me every day for as long as I have been \na Member of this body. It was given to me by my seatmate here, the \nsenior Senator Bryd from West Virginia. I treasure this copy of that \ndocument for many reasons, not the least of which is because it was \ngiven to me by Senator Byrd, but also because I find myself referring \nto it almost on a daily basis.\n  This copy includes not only the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, \nbut also the Declaration of Independence. It is a part of my daily \nwardrobe, be it weekends or during the week here. It is a reminder of \nhow fortunate we are to live in a country that has, as its founding \ndocument, a set of words, language, that not only speaks to the hopes \nand dreams of all Americans, but even beyond the borders of this \ncountry, because the Founders, the Framers of the Constitution, spoke \nof eternal truths in this document.\n  While the language applies to only those who live in this country, \ntheir words have, of course, inspired millions of other people all \nacross the globe. It is not uncommon to read the constitutions of \ndeveloping countries and find literally verbatim the language in our \nown U.S. Constitution. This is a great tribute to not only the Framers \nbut to those who came after them. Those that have upheld, supported, \nand defended--as millions of Americans have, some with the ultimate \nsacrifice--their lives, to protect and defend this country and the \nprinciples and ideals on which it was founded. The Constitution has \nsustained itself now for the more than 200 years. Giving us the power \nto be free and independent people.\n  So this great genius of our Constitution enshrines in it the words of \nthe eternal aspirations of humanity. I believe that Alexander Hamilton \nlaid out a framework for constitutional amendments and how we ought to \nthink of this remarkable document that serves as the basis of all that \nwe believe and hold dear when he said:\n\n       The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, \n     among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as \n     with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature, by the \n     hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or \n     obscured by mortal power.\n\n  It is a rather beautiful quotation that I think captures what many of \nus believe to be the case when we talk about our Constitution, talking \nabout the hand of divinity itself helping scribe these words, that it \nis ``not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty records'' \nbut rather ``written, as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human \nnature.''\n  So it is important, when we consider this document and particularly \nthe Bill of Rights, which speak to our personal freedoms, that we \nconsider all and any proposal to challenge the words included in those \n10 amendments.\n  There have been over 11,000 attempts in the last 200 years to amend \nour Constitution. Throughout the years, there have been only a handful \nof those proposals that have actually been adopted, usually when there \nwas a described constitutional crisis before us. We did so to extend \nthe right to vote to women and we did so to abolish slavery.\n  These are just two examples throughout our history when we have found \nit appropriate and proper to amend the Constitution, but always when we \nfelt there was an underlying principle dealing with basic fundamental \nrights.\n  Now, we all know that the horrible act of flag burning does occur. We \nhave all seen the visions on television describing some group in some \ncountry or another that decides it is going to burn the American flag. \nWe all know how we feel when we see that. But, of course, all my \ncolleagues know--and I am sure the overwhelming majority of American \ncitizens know--we can not change their behavior by altering the \nConstitution. As annoying as it is, as troubling as it is, and how I \nknow we all react to it, we can not affect those particular acts of \ndesecration.\n  Today we are talking about these acts that occur in this country. Let \nme quickly say I think it is worthy to try to come up with some \nlanguage statutorily to deal with this issue. But my hope is my \ncolleagues, regardless of political persuasion, would think long and \nhard about what we are about to do here; and that is, to change the \nConstitution.\n  A proposal similar to this one was offered in 1989, again in 1990, in \n1995, and in the year 2000. In every single case, the proposals have \nbeen rejected. I do not question any of my colleagues over their dismay \nand horror in watching our flag be desecrated. Yet, in every single \ninstance, we have found it appropriate to reject an amendment to the \nConstitution. I would hope that would be the case again today.\n  Mr. President, I fly the American flag every day at my home in \nConnecticut when I am there. I take great pride in doing so. In fact, \nmy neighbors can always tell when I am home. I live in a house, an old \nschoolhouse built in 1853. It was the successor schoolhouse to where \nNathan Hale taught in Connecticut. The Nathan Hale Schoolhouse is about \n150 yards from where I live in Connecticut. When that one-room \nschoolhouse became too small in the 1850s, they built a two-room \nschoolhouse that served the neighborhood where I live in East Haddam, \nCT, for almost 100 years until the 1940s. I bought that schoolhouse \nabout 25 years ago, and it has been my family's home for a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  My neighbors always know when I am home because I fly the American \nflag from that old schoolhouse. I take great pride in doing so. I don't \njust do it on Memorial Day or the Fourth of July or other national \nholidays, but every single day I am home. As a way of expressing my \naffection for what that flag means, what it stands for, and what it has \nmeant to generation after generation of people in our great country.\n\n  I will not take a back seat to anyone in my reverence for the flag, \nhow important it is and what it means. But I also believe it is \nimportant to be a patriot, a true patriot, where we not only defend our \nflag but we also defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. That \nis really what is at risk here today, when we talk about this \nresolution. It is not so much the flag that is at risk but our Bill of \nRights, if we attack this document because the passions of some get \naroused over the acts of those who would desecrate our flag. That \nreally is the issue before us.\n  Let us have a statutory law but let us not attack this wonderful Bill \nof Rights of ours. The proposed amendment is made up of 17 words, 17 \nwords that would dramatically alter the importance of the Bill of \nRights and diminish the freedoms provided by that document. I don't \ndoubt the patriotism of any Member of this Chamber. I strongly believe \nwe all love our country. We love our Constitution. We love our flag. In \nmy view, desecration of the flag, as a symbol of our freedom, the \nConstitution, and our democracy, is deplorable and should not be \ntolerated. It\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\ngoes without saying that every Member of Congress and the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans consider flag burning to be offensive and \nabhorrent. That is to state the obvious. The question is not whether we \ndeplore the desecration of the American flag but whether we are in some \nway going to desecrate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. To \ntruly honor our Nation and the people who have given their lives for \nit, we must not only protect our flag but the principles of freedom and \njustice that it stands for.\n  I have often said when students ask me about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights and what it means, the first amendment of the Bill of \nRights, which incorporates freedom of speech, really tests whether each \nand every one of us is willing to defend someone who would say \nsomething or do something we might find abhorrent. It is not whether we \nare willing to stand up and defend someone who says something we agree \nwith but, rather, whether we understand the principles our Founders and \nFramers intended when they wrote the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights, that we are willing to protect and defend the right of someone \nto say something that we totally disagree with and that we find \noffensive and abhorrent. That is the true test, not whether we are \nwilling to stand up and applaud what someone says but whether our \ninstincts are to deplore what they say but defend their right to say \nit. That is really what the first amendment is all about when freedom \nof speech is being invoked.\n  Our Founding Fathers cautioned us to avoid situations like the one we \nare in today. James Madison advised that amendments to the Constitution \nshould be limited to ``great and extraordinary occasions.'' \nRegrettably, some have not heeded Madison's cautionary words. Since \n1789 when the Congress first convened, there have been over 11,000 \nproposals to amend the Constitution of the United States. Over sixty \nhave been offered in this Congress alone. But the majority of our \nNation's leaders have taken the words of Madison to heart, and they \nhave not allowed this document to be altered. Since the ratification of \nthe Bill of Rights, only 17 amendments have been successful. Moreover, \ndespite all of the trials that this country has been through, no \nCongress has ever felt so compelled to doctor the Bill of Rights. It is \nremarkable when you consider the trials and tribulations we have been \nthrough.\n  The act of burning our flag is unacceptable and condemnable. But the \nreality is that it is exceedingly rare as well. I did my best to find \nthe reported incidences of flag burning throughout our history. I went \nback and examined as many possible cases as I could. We have found less \nthan 200 cases since our Nation's founding and only a handful \ndocumented in the last few years. Where is the constitutional crisis? \nWhere is the epidemic? Less than two hundred cases in more than 200 \nyears. Yet I would suspect that if we end up adopting this \nconstitutional amendment and amend the Bill of Rights, there will be \nthose, as the Senator from Illinois pointed out, who will consistently \ntry to press against the envelope of the language of these 17 words to \nprohibit desecration of the flag.\n  With all the other issues we need to grapple with, such as health \ncare, education, the quality of life of our military men and women, and \nwhether we ought to be doing more to increase the opportunities of \npeople in this country. With all of the legitimate debates that ought \nto occur, it is shocking that we are taking several days of the \nSenate's time to debate an amendment to the Constitution where there is \nhardly any incidence or examples of a problem today. As I said, there \nhave been less than 200 cases of flag desecration in more than 200 \nyears. Clearly, there is no extraordinary occasion, in my view, such \nthat Madison spoke of warranting ratification of this amendment. We \nmight feel disgusted by the act of flag burning, but we are clearly not \nfaced, by any estimate, with a constitutional crisis.\n  Proponents of this amendment say that tolerating even one burned flag \nis equivalent to acquiescence of such an act. I totally disagree. Our \nNation is strong enough to tolerate a few errant acts, and this \nstrength is the source of our democracy's greatness. It is the ability \nand willingness to tolerate acts like that on occasion that makes us a \nstronger and better people. Supporters of this amendment may believe \nthis vote is a test of one's patriotism or love of country. On the \ncontrary, the true measure of our faithfulness to the flag is our \nfidelity to the principles of freedom and justice that it represents. \nThat is the ultimate test of one's patriotism.\n\n  I would associate myself with the comments of a former colleague of \nours, Bob Kerrey, Senator from Nebraska, who today is president of a \nfine university in New York. He is also a Medal of Honor winner for \nservices as a Navy SEAL in Vietnam. I recall when this amendment was \nbefore us on several previous occasions, he would stand up and talk \nabout what it meant for him to lose a limb in the uniform of our \ncountry defending our Nation, talking about how important it was to \ndefend the Constitution. He articulated his opposition to this \nparticular proposal in a recent Washington Post editorial in relation \nto September 11th with the following statement:\n\n       Real patriotism cannot be coerced. Our freedom to speak was \n     attacked--not our flag. The former, not the latter, needs the \n     protection of our Constitution and our laws.\n\n  There is no question in my mind that our flag will continue to serve \nas a symbol of our Nation's history--our founding principles of \nfreedom, liberty, and justice--long after the conclusion of this debate \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Our former colleague, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, who served this \nNation as a combat pilot in Korea, an astronaut, and as a colleague of \nours in this body, put it very well:\n\n       There is one way to weaken the fabric of your country, and \n     it is not through a few misguided souls burning our flag. It \n     is by retreating from the principles that the flag stands \n     for. And that will do more damage to the fabric of our Nation \n     than 1,000 torched flags could ever do.\n\n  I believe history and future generations will judge us harshly, as \nthey should, if we permitted those who would defile our flag to also \ndefile our future and to defile the Bill of Rights. Let us leave the \nConstitution unsullied by proposals such as this which would needlessly \nrestrict our liberties as a people.\n  I will repeat again: The great genius of our Constitution is that it \nenshrines in word the eternal aspirations of humanity. We may try to \namend it, but if we do so in a manner at odds with those aspirations, \nthen we act at our peril and in folly.\n  I repeat Alexander Hamilton's quote:\n\n       The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, \n     among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as \n     with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature, by the \n     hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or \n     obscured by mortal power.\n\n  In our quest to protect the flag, we must be careful not to undermine \nthe principles that it stands for. Attacking the Bill of Rights, a \ndocument that has never been changed--not one comma, not one semicolon, \nnot one word, since its ratification in 1791--undermines those \nprinciples. This is a time to bring our Nation together to focus on the \nimportant challenges we face today. We must face them as a nation, not \nas individuals, if we are going to prevail.\n  At best, this amendment is another political stunt, I am afraid, \naimed at dividing our Nation, inflaming the passions of our \nconstituencies, make one party angry at another, one group of citizens \nangry at another. What worthwhile result has ever emerged from that \nkind of anger? What good has ever flowed from the passions provoked by \nappealing to the worst instincts in people? I have never seen a single \nbenefit that has occurred as a result of that effort.\n  Once again, we find ourselves inflaming passions over an issue that \nis nonexistent, the ``constitutional crisis'' of flag-burning. It is \njust not there. This would be a profound deviation from our past and \nchip away at our freedoms and liberties that we are working so hard to \nprotect.\n  Every generation is challenged with the responsibility of seeing to \nit that future generations will have the opportunities and benefits of \nour country. Those benefits and those opportunities flow very directly \nfrom the Constitution of the United States and, most particularly, from \nthe Bill of Rights. I hope that we will be careful about this. We are \nnot owners of this document, the Constitution; we are merely stewards \nof this document. We are charged\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nwith the responsibility during our tenure, on our watch, however long \nor brief it is, to see to it that these principles will be passed on to \ncoming generations. To start fooling with them unnecessarily, I think, \nputs this document and what it stands for at risk.\n  I hope our colleagues, when the vote occurs on this, will find it in \ntheir hearts and good conscience to leave the Bill of Rights alone. \nThis is not a time that it needs to be amended.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/26/senate-section/article/S6498-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
