Mr. President, I thank our visiting chaplain, the Rev. \nKenneth L. Harrington, for giving the opening prayer this morning, and \nChaplain Black who joined me to make this possible.\n  Rev. Ken Harrington is the popular and beloved, respected and well-\ncredentialed pastor of Hope United Church of Christ in Alexandria, my \nchurch away from home. Ken is a graduate of the State University of New \nYork, Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, and the Seminary \nof Drew University in New Jersey.\n  Hope Church has been my church away from home for three decades. It \nwas my good fortune to be invited to the church many years ago by my \nlate and cherished friend, Mahina Bailey, and his dear wife, Linda. \nMahina was a Hawaiian born in Hawaii, who spent his adult life here.\n  Over the years, I have gone to many services at Hope and have always \nbeen uplifted by the sermons, and since 2000, by the inspiring sermons \ndelivered by Reverend Harrington. Hope Church is a family-friendly \nchurch, dedicated to teaching the values of tolerance and inclusivity.\n  You can actually see this reflected on the diverse faces of its \ncongregation, the result no doubt of the sincerity of its message of \ninclusivity. The diversity of its congregation is so much like mine at \nhome. Together with inspirational sermons come seeds for thought to be \nthought through and digested, and practiced in daily life. Foremost \namong these thoughts, in my mind, is how we can make this a better \nworld for all of us.\n  I think this is particularly true for Members of Congress in whom a \ngreat trust has been placed by our constituents.\n  As we go through on a daily basis to achieve the greatest good for \nthe greatest number, and have succeeded for the most part but been \nfrustrated at times on issues so dear and right in our hearts, it is \ngood to open our daily session with a prayer and have the spiritual \nsupport and guidance of a divine being, to each from his or her own \nfaith.\n  To end on a lighter note with a ray of optimism for the passage of \nbills that are near and dear to our hearts, let me say that with all \nthe seriousness that the mission of a church involves, intertwined in \nits spiritual voyage are social programs. One of Hope's most popular \nsocial events is its annual luau, complete with Hawaiian food and \nentertainment.\n  An oversold event every year where congregants and friends thank the \nLord for his bounty.\n  Reverend Harrington, thank you for being here this morning and thank \nyou for your stewardship of Hope United Church of Christ.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S1959-6", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning following the leader time we \nwill proceed to consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 4, which is a \ndisapproval resolution relating to a Department of Agriculture rule \nregarding Canadian cattle. The agreement reached last night provides \nfor up to 3 hours of debate on the resolution prior to a vote. We hope \nto be able to yield back some of that debate time and vote earlier so \nwe can resume consideration of the bankruptcy bill for further \nprogress.\n  Last night's order also allows for two more stacked votes on \nbankruptcy-related amendments; therefore, we will have three votes \ntoday, sometime around noon, depending on the amount of time consumed \nfor the disapproval resolution. In other words, we hope as much of that \ncan be yielded back as possible after debate on the resolution.\n  Once those votes are completed, I expect the Senate will stay on the \nbankruptcy bill through the day and possibly into the evening. We will \ncontinue to have votes this afternoon and into the evening as necessary \nto move toward passage of this bill. We have made great progress on the \nbill thus far. We had five amendments yesterday. We look forward to \nmany amendments today so we can bring this very soon to a resolution. \nBy the end of today, I hope we will have some indication as to when we \ncan complete the bankruptcy legislation.\n  Members should plan their day today around what will be a very busy \nsession today in that although we will be in session in all likelihood \ntomorrow, we will not be having rollcall votes tomorrow. We have a lot \nof work to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S1960-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1960-S1961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a brief statement on an issue that \nis receiving a lot of attention, a lot of work, and a lot of \nengagement, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, by the \nPresident of the United States and, indeed, all across America. It is \non Social Security.\n  When the 109th Congress convened, I stated that our mission in this \nCongress over the next 2 years would be to govern with meaningful \nsolutions. Working together, both sides of the aisle, we made a fast \nstart, very effective start, confirming the President's Cabinet and \nenacting, 2 weeks ago, class action legislation. We are making good \nprogress on the bankruptcy legislation, as I just mentioned, and very \nsoon we will be turning our attention to writing the Government's \nspending blueprint for the coming year; that is, governing with \nmeaningful solutions.\n  Congress, at the same time that activity is going on in the Chamber, \nis tackling many problems and will be tackling these problems in the \nweeks and months ahead, including Social Security, which we are engaged \non in this body every day, whether it is working in our own caucuses or \nconference or in committees.\n  Social Security, a critically important, great program which does \nserve as the cornerstone of support for senior citizens, now faces \nchallenges that threaten its long-term stability and well-being. The \nfacts are there. The facts are crystal clear. They are grounded in \ndemographics that were defined two generations ago. Those demographics \ncannot be changed.\n  What the facts lead to is that in 3 years, the baby boomers arrive on \nthe Social Security rolls. That will begin an almost 30-year period \nwhere we will have a doubling of the number of seniors compared to what \nit is today--up to 77 million Americans who will begin to collect those \nSocial Security benefits.\n\n  Second, we all know we have fewer and fewer workers paying into the \nsystem, also driven by demographics. Forty years ago we had 16 people \npaying in for every retiree. Today we have three people paying in for \nevery retiree. In 20 or 30 years, we will only have two paying into the \nsystem. Those facts cannot be changed.\n  With this President, this Congress, the 109th Congress, is facing \nthis challenge. The challenge is to fix Social Security for seniors and \nfor near-retirees and for that next generation. We need to do it, and \nwe will do it this year--this year--and not next year. We are working \ntoward that goal.\n  In just the past 2 months, the majority has worked aggressively and \nthoroughly to fully understand the nature of the problem. We have \nworked hard to begin to engage the American people in a dialog about \nthe program. In town meetings all across the country, we have put some \nof the best minds at work to create solutions. That activity is \nunderway.\n  We talked about this repeatedly in our own conferences. We have \ninteracted with administration officials. We have interacted with \nleading experts on the Social Security system. Our Members are hard at \nwork to fix the underlying problems. That is the heart of the challenge \nin this 70-year-old program we will address this year.\n  So far, I report to the Senate and my colleagues that together with \nthe President we agree that retirees and near-retirees who entered the \nsystem before the scope of this problem became so large will not see \nbenefit changes. The retirees or near-retirees will see no benefit \nchanges.\n  Second, together with the President, we agree that we must harness \nthe power of the market and give younger Americans the choice-- it is \nvoluntary--to give them the choice of personal retirement accounts \nwhose rate of growth--therefore, we know, ultimately, the rate of \nbenefits--will grow faster than traditional Social Security.\n\n  Third, together, with the President, we agree that all ideas should \nbe on the table. It is too early for people to be drawing rigid lines \nin the sand. Thus, we encourage people to continue the discussion, the \ndebate, the understanding of the issue, and the nature of the problem.\n  Fourth, together, with the President, we agree that we should act \nthis year and not put it off to the future.\n  For those who insist there is no problem, I simply say, look at the \nfacts. As people increasingly look at the facts--and we are seeing the \nresponse around the country--people see the problem is real, that it is \nsignificant, and that it is growing.\n  For those who say we do not need any action, well, if you have a \nproblem that is growing, it is much easier to act now, to take some \nmedicine to cure the problem, than to have some radical surgery in the \nfuture.\n  We need to test the ideas with regard to the scope of the problem and \nthe ideas for solutions in that crucible of public debate. We need to \nput them to a vote. We must let the people ultimately judge.\n  I say all this so people will know that our majority is hard at work, \nevery day, on this vital issue. In consultation with the administration \nand the House of Representatives, we will continue to bring before the \nSenate meaningful solutions that will make a difference in the lives of \nour seniors. The assurances of Social Security should be guaranteed. To \nbe able to guarantee those assurances, we must diagnose the problem, \nand then we must act. We must govern with meaningful solutions, and \nthat is exactly what this Congress will do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Iowa seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with the permission of the Senator from \nGeorgia, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the resolution that \ncomes before us disapproving the actions of the Department of \nAgriculture on the importation of Canadian beef into the United States. \nBut in doing so, I do not denigrate the efforts that are being made to \nhave a debate on a legitimate public policy issue, but to put it in \ncontext.\n  First, from the standpoint of my chairmanship of the Senate Finance \nCommittee with jurisdiction over international trade, I think this is \nsomething for which we have developed policies over the last couple \ndecades, where we have worked very hard to see that several rights can \nbe preserved.\n  One, probably basic to this debate, is obviously the sovereign right \nof any country to make sure that it does not in any way allow products \ninto the country that would in any way hurt the health and safety of \nthe consumers of that particular country. I think every trade agreement \ntakes that into consideration.\n  Within the last 10 or 15 years, we have worked very hard and have \nincluded in our trade agreements rules concerning sanitary and \nphytosanitary measures. These rules require that science, as opposed to \npolitical science, be the basis upon which we base decisions as to \nwhether a product is safe to enter the U.S. market.\n  So I hope during this debate that we keep in mind that we do have \ncommitments to rely on science when making determinations as to whether \nproducts are safe. Hopefully, each country respects that. Particularly \nthe United States, being a leader in the rule of law in international \ntrade, ought to do that. But we expect every country that comes under \nthe WTO to do exactly the same, and the same holds with other trade \nagreements. We also, of course, reserve the right to make sure our food \nis safe.\n\n  For the debate we are in now, I hope we remember that if it had not \nbeen for mad cow disease in Canada, there would never be any such \ndiscussion before the Senate because over a long period of time we had \nimports of beef from Canada, and we have been exporting our red meat \nand other food products to Canada. So if we had not had mad cow disease \nin Canada, then we would not be debating this issue.\n  So when it gets to the issue of whether mad cow disease is an issue \nwith Canadian beef coming into the country, then let's remember that \ndecision ought to be made strictly on the sound science of whether that \nmeat is safe. If we are going to make a political decision in place of \na scientific decision as to whether Canadian beef should come into the \ncountry, then, of course, our purity in international trade is going to \nbe questioned by other countries.\n  The second point is that, during this very same period of time when \nwe have been having this problem with Canada as to whether their meat \nis safe to come into the country, we have also been trying to negotiate \nwith the Japanese because we had one mad cow case and the Japanese and \nother countries are not taking our beef. We have been working over the \nlast several months to get Japan to take our beef based upon the \nprinciple that we are following the sanitary and phytosanitary rules, \non a scientific basis, for making sure our meat is safe for the \nJapanese consumers. We do not want to get ourselves into a position \nwhere we are going to ignore the science of the safety of meat in \nCanada versus--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will finish one sentence, if I \ncould.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield the Senator an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We do not want to get ourselves in a position of having \nthe Japanese say to us our meat is not safe even though it is shown to \nbe safe based on sound science. Since we want our beef to go to Japan \nbecause it is safe, then, obviously, if meat is safe coming in from \nCanada, it has to be received as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S1961-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1961-S1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE \n DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RELATING TO RISK ZONES FOR INTRODUCTION OF \n                    BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 4, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 4) providing for \n     congressional disapproval of the rule submitted by the \n     Department of Agriculture under chapter 8 of title 5, United \n     States Code, relating to risk zones for introduction of \n     bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be up to \n3 hours for debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \nresolution and in support of the rule as proposed by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. I do this, first of all, with great \nappreciation of the efforts of my colleagues to bring this resolution \nforward. But I must encourage my colleagues to vote against this \nresolution.\n  This is not the time to pull the plug on a rulemaking process that is \nrooted in the best available science and, instead, to be guided by the \nconcerns that seem to be less about science than about trade \nadvantages.\n  The illustrious chairman of the Finance Committee went into great \ndetail about the trade issues and the fact that the rule change is \nbased on sound science. That is a lot of what I want to talk about \ninitially this morning.\n  First, I think we need to understand exactly what the resolution \nseeks to disapprove of today. On January 4, 2005, the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture published its final rule regarding further reopening of \nthe U.S. border for beef imports from Canada. This rule designates \nCanada as the first ``minimal-risk region'' for bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy, otherwise known as BSE. I will not try that long word \nagain. We are going to call it BSE. It is due to become effective on \nthis Monday, March 7, 2005. The original rule would have allowed bone-\nin beef from cattle of any age and live cattle under 30 months of age.\n\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted two rounds of public \ncomment and received over 3,300 comments on the proposed rule. Over a \nperiod of months, USDA considered these comments, and responses were \npublished with the final rule. The final rule establishes criteria for \ngeographic regions to be recognized as presenting minimal risk of \nintroducing BSE into the United States.\n  USDA utilized the OIE, which is the International Office of \nEpizootics, the international body that deals with animal diseases \nworldwide. Again, this will be referred to as the OIE. The USDA \nutilized the OIE guidelines, which recommend the use of risk assessment \nto manage human as well as animal health risks of BSE, as a basis in \ndeveloping final regulations defining Canada as a minimal-risk country.\n  The final rule places Canada in the minimal-risk category and defines \nthe requirements that must be met for the import of certain ruminants \nand ruminant products from Canada. Under the USDA definition, a \nminimal-risk region can include a region in which animals have been \ndiagnosed with BSE but where sufficient risk mitigation measures are in \nplace to reduce the likelihood of the disease's introduction into the \nUnited States.\n  On January 2, 2005, Canada confirmed its second domestic case of BSE, \nand a third case 9 days later. The USDA sent a technical team to Canada \non January 24, 2005, to investigate Canada's adherence to the ruminant, \nruminant feed ban. The results of that investigation were favorable, \nfinding that the Canadian inspection program and overall compliance to \nthe feed ban were good. The technical team's epidemiological report \ninvestigating possible links of the positive animals is still pending.\n  In response to this, on February 9, 2005, Secretary Johanns announced \nUSDA would delay the implementation of that part of the rule allowing \nfor older bone-in beef--that is beef in excess of 30 months old--\nbecause the technical team's investigation in Canada would not be \ncomplete by March 7.\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n  The current rule now allows imports from Canada of bone-in beef and \nlive cattle under 30 months of age intended for immediate slaughter.\n  On January 24 of this year, USDA sent a team to Canada to assess the \nadequacy of Canada's current ruminant feed ban, as previously stated. \nOn February 25, USDA published their report, and in this report USDA \nstated:\n\n       [T]he inspection team found that Canada has a robust \n     inspection program, that overall compliance with the feed ban \n     is good, and that the feed ban is reducing the risk of \n     transmission of BSE in the Canadian cattle population.\n\n  Furthermore, the report notes the obvious fact that:\n\n       [T]he Canadian feed ban is not substantially different than \n     the U.S. feed ban.\n\n  Those who want to seriously question the adequacy of the Canadian BSE \ncontrols should keep in mind that Canada almost perfectly mirrors the \ncontrols in place in the United States. The controls for BSE in the \nUnited States are sufficient and, according to all the data available, \nthe similar controls in Canada are also sufficient.\n  We should keep in mind also that the question regarding Canadian beef \nand cattle imports is not a food safety issue. I repeat, it is not a \nfood safety issue. It is an animal health issue. That is what we are \ntalking about today.\n  BSE is not spread by contact between people or animals. Safeguards \nare in place in both the United States and Canada to ensure that no \npotentially infectious material would ever make it into the human food \nsupply, period.\n  Internationally accepted science maintains that the removal of \ncertain specified risk materials that contain the prions that cause BSE \neliminates the disease's infectivity. Canada has adopted SRM removal \nrequirements that are virtually identical to current U.S. regulations.\n  In addition, while the Canadians do not view tonsils in cattle under \n30 months as SRMs, the U.S. requires that all meat exported from Canada \nto the United States have the tonsils removed pursuant to U.S. \nregulations.\n  Finally, the Food Safety Inspection Service, FSIS, has audited a \nnumber of Canadian plants and found them to be in compliance with U.S. \nBSE requirements, including SRM and small intestine and tonsil removal.\n  Since all potentially infectious materials are removed from every \nanimal old enough to theoretically exhibit the disease, both in the \nUnited States and Canada, it should be clear that this is an animal \nhealth debate only. We are all committed to maintaining the highest \nstandards of human health protection. We have those already today, and \nwe will still have those standards after this rule takes effect.\n  Regarding the issue of animal health, the OIE has affirmed that \nCanadian BSE control efforts have resulted in a very low risk of BSE in \ntheir cattle herd. The best available science in both Canada and the \nUnited States tells us that the safeguards in place are protecting \nanimal health also. USDA-APHIS has conducted multiple investigations \ninto Canada's ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban compliance since the May \n2003 border closure, and all scientific, risk-based evidence has \npointed to resuming beef and cattle trade with Canada.\n  They have concluded that the Canadian ruminant feed ban, which took \neffect simultaneously with our own feed ban, is effective in preventing \nthe introduction and amplification of BSE in both Canadian and U.S. \ncattle herds. We can choose to go down the road of trade protection or \nwe can continue to trust the best science available. I encourage us to \nstick with sound consensus science.\n  On January 17 of this year, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association \nsent a delegation of producers and scientists to Canada to evaluate the \neffectiveness of that country's BSE control efforts. The National \nCattlemen's Beef Association is the largest beef producer organization \nin the United States, representing both beef producers as well as \nprocessors. The outcome of the NCBA review published on February 2 \naffirms their confidence that the Canadian BSE safeguards are adequate.\n  Regarding the Canadian feed ban, the NCBA Delegation concluded:\n\n       The Canadian feed industry appears to be in compliance with \n     its feed ban, based on visual inspections and multiple annual \n     audit reports.\n\n  They also concluded that Canada's BSE surveillance and proposed \nimport requirements related to animal health were sufficient to protect \nthe U.S. cattle herd, if the border with Canada is opened even further.\n  While we would never want to formulate U.S. policy merely based on \nthe practices of another country, it is instructive to note that \ndomestically produced beef consumption in Canada is up, not down. It is \nclear that Canadians are not shipping beef to us that they don't choose \nto eat themselves.\n  In 2003, the last year for which numbers are available, Canadian beef \nconsumption increased 5 percent to 31 pounds per person per year. \nIndications are that consumption in 2004 will be just as strong if not \nstronger. We can be confident that the beef exports from Canada \npresently underway and the ones proposed by USDA's rule don't \nconstitute dumping unwanted product in our market but are composed of \nthe same beef that Canadian consumers recognize as wholesome and are \nbuying in increasing quantities.\n  In the past, a large percentage of Canadian cattle came to the U.S. \nprocessing plants for further value-added processing and to provide \nsufficient livestock numbers to keep in business many U.S. plants near \nthe northern border. Since the closure of the U.S. border to Canadian \nbeef, the Canadian processing capacity increased by 22 percent in 2004 \nalone.\n  This means that those processing jobs and all the added carcass value \nare now increasingly in Canada and no longer in the United States. This \nmay have especially significant impact on U.S. processors in the \nPacific Northwest who have relied on Canadian cattle to keep their \nplants open. In recent months, several U.S. companies have announced \nthat they are suspending operations or reducing hours of operation due \nto the tightening cattle supplies and lack of an export market. If we \nkeep our border closed to Canadian-slaughtered cattle and bone-in \ncarcasses, then their meat will still come to the United States as \nboneless cuts because that is already happening with or without this \nrule. But the added value and jobs that could be in the United States \nwill increasingly be kept in Canada.\n  Agricultural trade is vital to maintaining a robust agricultural \neconomy in the United States. The future of agriculture in this \ncountry, the future of ranching depends upon our ability to export the \nfinest quality of agricultural product of anybody in the world. As the \nworld's largest trading partner, we must base our trade decisions on \nsound science. We have the most to lose when nontariff trade barriers \nare enacted.\n  USDA has made resumption of international trade in U.S. beef a high \npriority. The United States and Japan have held consultations and \nagreed that the trade in beef between the two countries should resume \ngiven certain conditions and modalities. We have to remember that our \nbeef exporting trade with Japan has been discontinued due to the fact \nthat we found one cow in the United States with BSE, although it turns \nout that cow originated in Canada and came into the United States.\n\n  Japan is one of our largest markets, and it is a critical market for \nus to reopen. USDA is in the midst of negotiations today for the \nreopening of that market. Taiwan has also agreed in principle to resume \nimports of U.S. beef and beef products. Removal of restrictions by some \nof our major Asian trading partners is on the horizon.\n  In 2003, we exported $1.3 billion worth of beef products to Japan, \n$814 million worth of beef to South Korea, and $331 million to Canada. \nIn 2004, after the one BSE positive cow was found in Washington State, \nwe exported essentially zero dollars' worth of beef products to Japan \nand South Korea and $98 million worth of beef to Canada. These \ncountries are aware of our rulemaking and are watching how we address \nthis issue with Canada. We have a huge stake in seeing worldwide trade \nin beef resume on the basis of sound science rather than on trade \nprotectionism.\n  Make no mistake, we are sending a very powerful message today with \nour actions on this resolution to all of our trading partners. For \ncountries prohibiting beef imports from the United States, whether we \ncontinue to adhere\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nto sound science in our dealings with Canada could influence their \nfuture actions toward our beef. Canada has met our minimal risk \nstandards, and we must adhere to the policy dictates of sound science \nor face others using arbitrary standards toward us.\n  Currently, there is a suit filed in U.S. district court in Billings, \nMT, challenging USDA's BSE minimal risk region rule. Yesterday, after a \nhearing, a temporary injunction was granted staying the implementation \nof the final rule and ordering the two parties to sit down and agree to \na schedule for a trial which must take place in the short term because \nof this being a temporary injunction. At this point in time it would be \nwise to allow the court proceeding to play out. It would be premature \nto pass this resolution and interfere with the operations of that \ncourt. We can always come back after the judicial proceedings are \nfinished and express our disapproval. It is appropriate for us to allow \nthe third branch of Government to finish their review of this rule, and \nwe should not usurp the judiciary on this matter.\n  In summary, according to the best science available in our hands \ntoday, further opening of the U.S. border to Canadian bone-in beef and \ncattle under 30 months of age does not pose a serious threat to the \nU.S. beef herd. It certainly does not increase the risk of human BSE \nexposure. Recent evaluations of the Canadian cattle industry by the \nNCBA indicate that there is not a wall of cattle that will flood into \nthe U.S. market from Canada should this rule go into effect.\n  The Canadian Government, USDA, and the NCBA have all reviewed the \nCanadian BSE safeguards and found them sufficiently robust and \nprotective for trade to be expanded as this rule proposes. Beef \nexported from Canada has to meet the same science-based standards that \nhave been successfully protecting our consumers and beef producers for \nmany years.\n  It has been stated before--and I repeat--that Americans are blessed \nwith the most abundant, affordable, and safest food supply in the \nworld. The action we take today will not make our food supply safer. It \nmerely enforces and encourages the actions of those who would restrict \ntrade with measures not related to sound science.\n  I encourage my colleagues to say yes to sound science by saying no to \nthis resolution today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. I respect the chairman of the committee, but on \nthis issue we have a profound difference. Let me alert my colleagues \nand their staffs who are watching, this is going to be a consequential \nvote. We are only spending 3 hours on this issue this morning because \nwe are operating under special procedures. But let every colleague of \nmine understand: They are going to be responsible for the votes they \ncast today. The risk that is being run here is significant.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what happened in Europe when mad cow \ndisease got loose on their continent. One hundred forty-eight people \ndied in England alone. Nearly 5 million head of livestock were \nslaughtered in that country. They found 183,000 head that were \ninfected, and they believe there were 2 million head of livestock \ninfected in England alone that they were not able to complete tests on \nbecause of the magnitude of the crisis.\n  This vote may be critically important to the health of consumers and \nto the health of an entire industry. Make no mistake. When the question \nis science, that is precisely what this debate is about. Is, in fact, \nscience being used by our neighbors to the north or are they simply \nputting regulations on the books that are not enforced?\n  The record is clear and the facts will demonstrate conclusively, \nCanada is not enforcing their own regulations that are based on sound \nscience. But if you don't enforce the regulations, if you don't do the \ninspections, what does it mean? What does it mean to have on the books \nregulations that are based on sound science if they are not enforced?\n  I introduced S.J. Res. 4 on February 14 pursuant to the Congressional \nReview Act. It is a resolution to disapprove of the final rule produced \nby USDA that designates Canada as a minimal risk region for BSE or mad \ncow disease.\n  Let's review the facts. Canada already has four known cases of mad \ncow disease. That is not speculation. That is not based on some \nwondering about what is happening in Canada. That is based on facts, \nfour known cases. In addition, they have one case of a cow imported \nfrom England positively tested for mad cow disease. So this is not some \ntheoretical discussion we are having today. They have mad cow disease. \nIt is demonstrated.\n  Now the question is, Should we run the risk of opening our border to \nlivestock imports from Canada when the evidence, I believe, \ndemonstrates clearly they are not enforcing their regulations to reduce \nthe risk to them and to us?\n  I am taking this action because opening our border to Canadian cattle \nand expanded beef product imports at this time is risky and, I believe, \npremature. Allowing the USDA rule to go forward could have very serious \nconsequences for the human and animal health in this country.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. It has never been my intent to keep the \nborder with Canada closed on a permanent basis. Over the last several \nweeks, I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have \nraised concerns about this rule. Unfortunately, those concerns have \nfallen on deaf ears. The Secretary of Agriculture has refused to \nwithdraw the rule so sensible modifications could be made. This has \nleft us with no option, other than this process, to stop a bad rule \nfrom becoming effective on March 7.\n  We all know a judge has issued an injunction against the rule, but \nnone of us can know when the judge might withdraw his injunction. Our \nobligation and our responsibility is clear. This rule can go forward on \nMarch 7 absent our action. Reopening the border under the conditions \nprovided in the rule poses, I believe, grave safety risks for our \nconsumers, serious economic risks for the U.S. cattle industry, and it \ncomplicates our efforts to reopen export markets.\n  BSE is an extremely dangerous disease. As I indicated earlier, after \nit was first identified in England in 1986, England suffered nearly 150 \ndeaths from this disease. Nearly 5 million head of livestock were \nslaughtered. Around the world, additional human deaths from Creutzfeld-\nJacobs disease have been linked to BSE. So we must be very cautious \nbefore we consider opening our border to imports from a country known \nto have BSE.\n  Again, this is not a matter of speculation. We know they have mad cow \ndisease in that country. Since the European outbreak, scientists from \naround the world have been engaged in efforts to learn more about the \ndisease. They have developed methods to test, control, and eradicate \nBSE. Through the international organization for animal health, known as \nthe OIE, experts have designed science-based standards for the safe \ntrade of beef products and live cattle from countries that have, or may \nhave, BSE.\n  In particular, because BSE is transmitted through livestock feed \ncontaminated with animal protein containing BSE, it is critical that \ncountries adopt measures to ensure that animal protein and other \nspecified risk materials are not present in cattle feed. That is what \nis so important to understand here. This is a matter of what is in the \nfeed that the cattle are eating. The OIE guidelines require a ban on \ncattle feed containing meat and bone meal from cattle be in effect for \n8 years as the primary means to reduce the likelihood of BSE infecting \ncattle.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA does not appear to have followed OIE \nguidelines in developing its rules. Canada's ban went into effect in \nAugust of 1997; that is less than 8 years ago. Even then, the Canadian \nrules allowed for potential BSE contaminants that were in the feed \nmanufacturing and marketing system. Unfortunately, the way the \nCanadians put their rule into effect, it allowed potential BSE \ncontaminants to work their way through the industry. Moreover, with \nrespect to Canada, USDA has not done a thorough evaluation to ensure \nthat Canada's cattle feed is not contaminated with animal proteins.\n  The U.S. has appropriately blocked cattle imports from Canada since \nCanada confirmed its first case of BSE in\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nMay of 2003. Concerns were only heightened when BSE was confirmed in a \ndairy cow of Canadian origin in Washington State in December of 2003. \nThis case resulted in many important U.S. trading partners banning the \nimportation of U.S. cattle and beef, a situation that continues today.\n  Let me make this clear. When our friends say we have to open our \nborder so others will open their borders to us, you have it backwards. \nThe reason other countries have closed their borders to our exports is \nbecause of their concern about our allowing imports from Canada, when \nthey have known cases of BSE, and when it is quite clear that Canada is \nnot enforcing their regulations to prevent additional outbreaks of this \nserious disease.\n  So it is very important that we and USDA move slowly, cautiously, and \ndeliberately, and evaluate all possible risks before reopening our \nborder to Canadian cattle. But the USDA rule doesn't do this. In \nparticular, Canada has not effectively implemented measures to contain \nand control BSE for 8 years, as required by the OIE. Moreover, USDA has \napplied a very loose and flexible interpretation to the specific \nrecommendations developed by the OIE.\n  In fact, it appears that Canada has not dedicated the necessary \nresources for enforcement and compliance within a large part of its \nfeed manufacturing industry. Colleagues, staffs who are listening, hear \nthis well. There are nearly 25,000 noncommercial, on-farm feed mills in \nCanada that produce about 50 percent of Canada's livestock feed. Canada \nhas inspected only 3 percent of these facilities over the last 3 years. \nThis is a gaping hole in their compliance program.\n  Let me repeat for anybody who missed it the first time. In Canada, \nthere are 25,000 on-farm feed mills that are producing feed. Only 3 \npercent have been inspected in the last 3 years. Are we going to bet \nthe lives of American consumers, bet the economic strength of an entire \nindustry on that kind of a review regime? Is that what we are going to \ndo today? I hope not.\n  Since USDA announced its final rule designating Canada as a minimum-\nrisk region for BSE, Canada has confirmed two additional BSE cases. Let \nme repeat that. Since USDA proclaimed Canada to be minimal risk, two \nmore cases of mad cow disease have been discovered. The most recent one \nis particularly disturbing, because it involves a cow born several \nmonths after Canada implemented its ban on animal proteins in cattle \nfeed. Again, let me repeat that. The most recent case of mad cow \ndisease in Canada is in a cow that was born after Canada implemented \nits ban on animal proteins in cattle feed. Let's connect the dots. Four \ncases of mad cow disease in Canada and an additional one of a cow \nimported to Canada from Britain. Half of the Canadian feed industry has \nbeen inspected in only 3 percent of the cases over the last 3 years. \nThe most recent cow discovered with the disease was discovered after \nthe Canadian ban on animal proteins in cattle feed was put forward.\n  What does this tell us? I believe it tells us the Canadian ban has \nbeen ineffective. It is not just my belief; we have evidence from \nCanada's own inspection service. Let's put up the first chart, if we \ncould. This is from the Vancouver Sun, December 16, final edition:\n\n       Secret tests reveal cattle feed contaminated by animal \n     parts: Mad cow fears spark review of ``vegetable-only'' \n     livestock feeds.\n\n  It says that according to internal Canadian Food Inspection Agency \ndocuments--obtained by the newspaper through the Access to Information \nAct--70 feed samples labeled as vegetable-only were tested by the \nagency between January and March of 2004. Of those, 41, or 59 percent, \nwere found to contain undeclared animal materials.\n  This is the risk being run if this border is open to Canadian cattle \non March 7 of this year. We know what happened in Europe. In England \nalone, 146 people died. Nearly 5 million head of livestock were \nslaughtered. Canada has 4 known cases of mad cow disease, and their own \ninspection service finds that in 59 percent of the cases where they \nhave done testing, material that was not supposed to be present was \npresent--the very material that can lead to the disease. Are we going \nto run the risk of allowing that to come into the United States?\n  On February 2, 2005, 1 month ago, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency \nfinally issued a report concerning these very serious charges. Of 65 \nCanadian samples that received further testing, 54 cases containing \nanimal protein were determined to be proteins that were not prohibited. \nThat is good news. Unfortunately, in 11 cases, or 17 percent, Canada \ncould not rule out the presence of prohibited material.\n  Since October 2003, our own Food and Drug Administration has issued \n19 import alerts concerning imported Canadian feed products that are \ncontaminated with illegal animal proteins. Eight of these import alerts \nagainst Canadian livestock feed manufacturers are still in force.\n  I am getting very able assistance by my colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Roberts. That is high-class help.\n  Let me repeat this because it is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand. Since October of 2003, our own FDA has issued 19 import \nalerts concerning Canadian feed products contaminated with illegal \nanimal protein. Eight of those import alerts are still in force. Here \nthey are: Muscle tissue in feed, where it is not supposed to be; muscle \ntissue and blood material in feed, where it is not supposed to be; May \n10, 2004, muscle tissue and blood material in feed, where it is not \nsupposed to be; February 5, 2005, mammalian bone and bovine hair in \nfeed; October 28, 2003, suspect muscle tissue and unidentified animal \nhairs; April 6, 2004, blood and bone material present.\n  These alerts--every single one of them--are still in force today. Are \nwe going to run the risk here of opening this border before we can be \nconfident that Canada is enforcing their own regulations?\n  Finally, Canada has recently implemented new rules to further \nrestrict the use of animal protein in livestock feed, as well as in \nfertilizer.\n  Listen to this: Canada's own justification for tightening its \nregulations is to reduce the potential for the cross-contamination of \nlivestock feed products and fertilizers with animal protein that might \ncontain the BSE prions. To me this suggests clearly that even Canadian \nofficials are concerned that the enforcement and compliance with \nexisting regulations may be inadequate.\n  As I noted in a letter I sent with Senator Harkin, Senator Johnson, \nand Senator Salazar to the Secretary of Agriculture, there is concern \nthat not enough time has elapsed to be certain that Canada's education, \nsurveillance, and testing measures are truly indicative of their level \nof BSE risk.\n  The bottom line is this: Canada has not achieved the necessary level \nof compliance to justify designating it as a minimal risk region. Their \nfailure to enforce their own BSE measures could have serious \nconsequences if USDA proceeds to reopen the border.\n  What is the risk? First and foremost, it could create potential \ndangers for consumers in this country. The Consumer Federation of \nAmerica has registered concern about the ramifications for consumer \nhealth and safety if the border reopened and support this resolution. \nThey said:\n\n       The Department of Agriculture's rule to open the border to \n     Canadian cattle and cattle products under 30 months of age is \n     decidedly less stringent than the international standards put \n     forth by the [IOE].\n       . . . [I]t is important that USDA reconsider its push to \n     open the Canadian border and reexamine the risks that such an \n     action may pose to the U.S. consumers.\n\n  It is not just the consumer groups that are concerned. Agricultural \ngroups are concerned as well because this would not only pose a danger \nto our consumers but to an entire industry.\n  The National Farmers Union and R-CALF USA have expressed strong \nsupport for the resolution because of their concern about ensuring the \ncontinued safety and integrity of our domestic cattle industry. This is \nwhat the Farmers Union has said:\n\n       . . . National Farmers Union President . . . issued the \n     following statement.\n       ``We believe it is inappropriate to proceed with reopening \n     the border at this time given Canada's most recent \n     discoveries of BSE positive cattle and the uncertainty of how \n     many additional cases will be detected.\n       I urge members of the United States Senate to support and \n     cosponsor this important resolution.''\n\n  R-CALF USA said:\n\n       United States cattle producers should not be excluded from \n     protections afforded by the more rigorous science-based BSE \n     standards\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\n     recognized throughout the world as necessary to effectively \n     manage the human health and animal health risks associated \n     with BSE.\n\n  Our major export markets have remained closed to U.S. beef exports, \neven though there has been no indigenous case of BSE in the United \nStates. Compared to 2003, our beef product exports are off by over 82 \npercent. Let's connect the dots. We have four cases of BSE, mad cow, \nproven in Canada. We have none in the United States. And yet countries \nwe export to have remained closed to us. Why? Because of the risk they \nsee from Canadian cattle coming into our market and being then further \nshipped to them.\n  Here is what has happened to our U.S. beef exports: in 2003, $3.2 \nbillion, down to under $600 million in 2004. Prior to the discovery of \nBSE in Canada, Canada's total live product and beef product exports to \nthe U.S. amounted to over $2.2 billion. In 2004, their exports to the \nUnited States were cut in half, $1.2 billion.\n  U.S. ranchers and our cattle industry have suffered greater trade \nlosses in our overseas markets than Canada has experienced because of \nU.S. limitations on their sales. In fact, our losses have been twice as \nbig as theirs.\n  I believe that reopening the border now before we have reached \nagreement on reopening our export markets will only give our trade \npartners a further excuse to delay reopening these critical markets for \nU.S. producers.\n  We heard earlier a reference to the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, which, prior to the new cases of BSE in Canada, supported \nreopening the border. They have recently adopted a new policy. It \nrequires 11 conditions to be met before we designate Canada as a \nminimum-risk region. Of those conditions, only three will be met under \nthe current rule.\n  Let's be clear, the National Cattlemen's Association has outlined 11 \nspecific items that need to be met. Only three of them have been under \nthe rule. And it is not just a national issue. My State perhaps has as \nmuch at stake as any. The North Dakota State Legislature recently \npassed a resolution urging that our border with Canada remain closed \nfor live cattle and beef product trade. My legislature is \noverwhelmingly Republican--overwhelmingly. They adopted this resolution \noverwhelmingly, saying keep this border closed until you can assure us \nand assure our people that it is safe. They have made a determination \nthat nobody can give that assurance today.\n\n  The recent announcement by Secretary Johanns to restrict the \nimportation of Canadian beef products to those from cattle under 30 \nmonths of age is a step in the right direction; however, the \nannouncement does not address the unresolved concerns about Canada's \ncompliance with its own feed regulations.\n  It was my hope that our new Secretary would withdraw the proposal to \nresume trade when he learned of these serious issues. But it now \nappears that the only way to stop this rule is for Congress to block \nit. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  At the very least, we ought to delay this rule from being put into \neffect until we have a better sense of what is happening in Canada. \nThere is an investigation ongoing. Why ever would we decide to go \nforward and open this border before our own investigation is complete?\n  Let me conclude as I began by saying to my colleagues, this is a \nconsequential vote. None of us know precisely how great the risk is. \nWhat we can say with some certainty is there is risk, and the \nconsequences of a failure to get this right could be enormous. I hope \nmy colleagues think very carefully about this vote.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I rise today in opposition to the joint resolution that has been \nbrought forward by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. This is \na great ``while I'' speech. While I share the Senator's concern, while \nI share his sense of frustration, while I share his sense of making \nsure that our beef is safe from BSE, I cannot support the resolution.\n  I am from Dodge City, KS. This is a town that began during the cattle \ndrives of the Wild West days and which still bases much of its economy \non the beef industry. You cannot have anybody more interested, more \nvitally concerned about the beef industry than this Member. In fact, \nthe number of cattle in Ford County, where Dodge City is located, far \noutnumbers the citizens of the county. I used to say they were in a lot \nhappier mood.\n  Not only is the beef industry king in Ford County, Dodge City, \nsouthwest Kansas, and the State of Kansas, it is a huge industry \nrepresenting over $5 billion in annual revenues. We are a State with \n6.65 million head of cattle compared to a human population of 2.6 \nmillion. Cattle represented 62 percent of the 2003 Kansas agriculture \ncash receipts, and the processing industry alone employs over 18,700 \nKansans. We rank in the top three of virtually every major beef \nstatistic. There are few issues as important to the people of Kansas as \nthe issue of how we handle actions that are related to BSE.\n  Prior to the discovery of BSE in the United States in December 2003, \nKansas was one of the top exporters of beef to the Japanese market. \nSince that fateful day in December of 2003, Kansas and U.S. beef \nproducers have been locked out of the Japanese market.\n  We should not still be locked out of that market by taking action \nlike we may do as of today on this vote. The international science--I \nmean international science in every country concerned--says our cattle \nunder 30 months of age are safe and not at risk for BSE. Yet we have \nagreed to not send meat from any animals under 20 months of age to \nJapan. Still that market remains closed to the United States.\n  The market is not closed because of scientific concerns. It remains \nclosed because of internal Japanese politics, and that is a fact. But \nwe are moving forward, and I am hopeful that by continued pressure from \nthe administration--from the President, the Secretary of State, \neverybody who has been in contact with the Japanese Government, and \nthis Congress, many Members of Congress--we can somehow reopen that \nmarket, we can expedite that process.\n  But today, be careful what you ask for. We will take a giant step \nbackward in our efforts to reopen markets to Japan--or, for that \nmatter, anywhere--if we vote to approve this resolution. The same \ninternational science and guidelines that say that U.S. beef and \nanimals under 30 months of age are safe also say that the beef and \nanimals in Canada under 30 months are safe as well. That is the \ninternational standard. That is the sound science standard.\n  If we vote today to approve this resolution, the United States will \nbe taking the same actions as the Japanese. I am not going to say it is \nbased on politics. I know all of the concerns of my colleagues who are \nup on the northern border and the long history of those disputes. But \nwe are going to be basing our decision on those concerns instead of \nsound science. I fear it will have both short-term and long-term \nramifications. In the near term, it will undoubtedly set us back in our \nefforts to reopen the Japanese export market.\n\n  How can we argue that they are not basing their decisions on sound \nscience if we cast a vote that is not based on the same sound science? \nWe have staffers today meeting, Agriculture Committee staffers, under \nthe direction of the distinguished chairman, with ambassadors from \nJapan. If we vote on this today, why meet? What kind of progress could \nwe possibly make? Long term, how can our negotiators in this Congress \nargue in the international arena that all agricultural issues--not just \nthis issue--including biotech crops, beef hormones, food safety, and \nany number of other issues should be based on sound science if we \nourselves vote on the concerns of individuals?\n  I have heard some Members talk about they are going to vote for this \nbecause they worry about the lumber that is coming in from Canada. Are \nwe about to open a trade war? I am concerned about that. But this is \nnot the way to approach it.\n  I understand the concerns of many of our producers and of my \ncolleagues who support this resolution. Senator\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nConrad--I affectionately call him the agriculture program policy chart \nman because he has, at last count, 4,153 charts he has brought to the \nfloor since I have had the privilege of serving here--is really a \nchampion explaining rudimentary agriculture program policy, not only to \ncolleagues but to all who watch these proceedings.\n  So I understand his concern. I did oppose the entry of beef from \nanimals over 30 months of age because it did not make any sense to \nallow that beef in the United States if we would not allow any cattle \nover 30 months due to safety concerns. That is a given.\n  The international science and guidelines are clear on this issue. \nAnimals under 30 months and meat from those animals is safe. If we vote \nfor this resolution today, we will turn our back on the longstanding \nU.S. position in all international trade negotiations. We are going to \nhurt our efforts to reopen the Japanese market. We will be setting a \nvery dangerous precedent for future trade policy battles, and Lord \nknows we are going to have those with the WTO ruling brought by Brazil.\n  We have too much at risk to base this decision, no matter how \ndifficult it may be, no matter how strong our feelings may be, on the \npolitics and the passion of the moment. The long-term future of the \nU.S. beef industry may very well turn on this action we take today. I \nfear that this vote in favor of this resolution will send a negative \nmessage that will come back to haunt us on this issue and many other \nagriculture trade matters for years to come. I do not think we can \nallow that to happen. So I respectfully disagree with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and I urge the defeat of this resolution.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nKansas. He is my friend. I profoundly disagree with him about the \nconclusion. I think the risks run the opposite way. We want Japan to \nopen their market to us? Then we better be able to assure them that our \nmarket and our supplies are safe. I believe the evidence is \noverwhelming that Canada is not enforcing their own regulations. Their \nown tests show it. They are not our tests. Their tests show they are \nnot enforcing the regulations.\n  I remind my colleagues of the consequences of a failure to get this \nright. In England, 146 people died. Almost 5 million head were \nslaughtered. There are four known cases of mad cow in Canada today, and \nan additional case of a cow imported from England. And we are going to \nopen our border on March 7, when the Canadians' own testing agency \nshows that in 59 percent of the cases animal matter is present where it \nis not supposed to be? Is that what we are going to do? I hope not.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his leadership on this crucial issue before the Senate today.\n  I rise to speak on an issue of enormous significance to consumers, \nproducers, and ranchers in my home State of South Dakota and all across \nAmerica. The U.S. border is scheduled to be thrown open on March 7, \n2005, to Canadian live cattle and other assorted bovine products. While \nthe rule was modified to ensure that live cattle and beef imports come \nfrom animals under 30 months of age, which is a modestly helpful \nadjustment, I retain profound concerns about the lack of scientific \nbasis for the decision to throw open the border and feel that the \ntiming of this administration decision could not possibly be worse for \nconsumers and producers alike.\n  We have seen four instances of BSE in cattle of Canadian origin, \nwhile the United States has not experienced even one indigenous case. \nIn fact, two of these cases were detected after the Department of \nAgriculture released their final rule. I think those numbers become \neven more troubling when we compare the annual slaughter populations or \ntotal animals slaughtered in that time frame.\n  There is an overwhelming difference when our neighbors to the north \nslaughter roughly less than 10 percent of the U.S. slaughter population \nand yet they have all of the indigenous BSE. I am concerned that the \nDepartment of Agriculture's rule is not based all on sound science, and \nI agree, science ought to be the determining factor.\n  The USDA has chosen instead to adopt weaker standards in their final \nrule. Animals entering the United States will not and cannot be tested \nfor BSE and there are no safeguards available to United States \nproducers to relieve the effect of the millions of Canadian cattle \nlined up at our border.\n\n  The final rule establishes minimal-risk regions for BSE and \nrecognizes Canada as a minimal-risk region. However, that rule fails to \nrecognize the internationally accepted standards set forth by the OIE, \nor World Organization for Animal Health, for minimal-risk regions, \nwhich are the only recognized standards that are accepted on a \nworldwide basis.\n  Transmission of BSE is, in fact, still unclear and uncertain. \nMaintaining segregation of the Canadian and American herds to the \nlargest extent possible is the only scientifically sound approach, and \nUSDA's final rule only seeks to mix these cattle populations.\n  The Bush administration and a Japanese Government panel have \ndiscussed certain parameters for importation of American beef. Namely, \nimported products would be from animals age verified at under 20 months \nof age and adhere to a certain grade of meat. These criteria were set \nbecause of Japanese consumer concerns. I fail to see how allowing the \nimportation of Canadian cattle and products from cattle under 30 months \nof age into the United States, 10 months older than American beef that \ncould be potentially exported to Japan, can possibly be beneficial for \nregaining consumer confidence in Japan or for maintaining consumer \nconfidence in the United States.\n  At one point, we were exporting about 10 percent of our beef to \nforeign nations, the Japanese being the largest buyer of American beef \nabroad. The Japanese, because of their own experiences with mad cow \ndisease and human disease in that nation, are understandably very \nconcerned that if they buy beef from another country, they want that \nbeef to, in fact, come from a non-BSE country. It is the United States \nthat jeopardizes our export market by throwing open the doors to a huge \ntidal wave of Canadian animals into the United States, mixing the whole \nherds together and then selling that export product or attempting to \nsell that without being able to identify whether we are, in fact, \nselling Canadian product or American product to the Japanese or anyone \nelse. It is no wonder that throwing open this border is going to \nfurther jeopardize what is already a difficult circumstance for \nAmerican exporters.\n  Then for American producers, they wind up with a double whammy. The \nCanadian import into the United States is roughly equivalent to about \n10 percent of our herd, while we lose and further jeopardize an export \nmarket that had been 10 percent of our herd. That is a 20-percent swing \njeopardizing consumer confidence in the United States and having the \npotential to have devastatingly negative consequences for livestock \nproducers in America.\n  I think the time is overdue, and USDA should spend more time being \nconcerned about American livestock producers and a little less time \nbeing concerned about the viability of Canadian livestock producers, \ngiven the kind of public health and the export consequences this \nopening the border will entail.\n  We lost a $1.7 billion export market when Japan shut their borders, \nand what we need is consistent leadership and guidance from the USDA \nthat recognizes we ought to abide by internationally accepted standards \nfor minimal risk and that a premature opening of that Canadian border \nnot only will serve to undermine consumer confidence in America but \nwill further jeopardize our export market abroad. I believe the \nJapanese and other countries would love to buy American beef, but they \nwant to know it is American beef that they are buying and not beef that \nhas simply been funneled through our country from BSE-infected nations.\n  USDA's decision is not only an economic threat for the viability of \nour rural communities, but it is also a consumer choice issue. Consumer \ngroups\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nhave repeatedly voiced concern over this final rule. USDA is \naccountable and obligated to ensure that our consumers and ranchers are \nprotected, which means keeping our borders closed for now. USDA has not \nbeen working for American consumers, ranchers, and producers with this \nfinal rule.\n  There are several steps that should be taken before the Department of \nAgriculture should even consider opening our border with Canada, and \ncountry-of-origin labeling is one of those steps. I have long advocated \na mandatory country-of-origin labeling program. The administration \ndelayed COOL for 2 years during closed-door consideration of the 2004 \nOmnibus appropriations measure. A mandatory country-of-origin labeling \nprogram for beef is now not scheduled to be implemented until September \n30, 2006. Yet, even lacking that ability of consumers to make knowing \nchoices about the origins of the meat they serve their family, USDA \nwould open the borders to a cattle population that poses a significant \nrisk without even ensuring consumer choice in the grocery store aisle \nto buy American beef. I introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure \nthat Canadian beef and cattle could not come across the border until \ncountry-of-origin labeling is implemented because that is simply the \nright thing to do, and I am pleased that we have bipartisan support for \nthat measure.\n\n  Because USDA insists on plowing ahead with an outrageously ill-timed \ndecision, congressional action is required and we have a congressional \nresolution of disapproval to consider. An ample number of my Senate \ncolleagues felt this opening the border rule should be set aside and \nchose to sign their names on the petition to do so. The vote on this \nresolution is an opportunity to stop a flawed course of action, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this resolution of disapproval. It is \ncrucial that USDA act in a responsible manner and revoke the final rule \nimmediately.\n  I am hopeful the administration will recognize the message this body \nwill send today about the severity and the urgency of this situation. \nWe need America to side with the best science on the Canadian border. \nWe need America to be prudent relative to the enormous risk to both the \nlivestock economy and the public health in America and the jeopardy of \nopening the border to our potential export market for beef.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nresolution of disapproval and to send a strong bipartisan message to \nUSDA and to the White House to reverse course, to allow greater time \nfor the best science to determine what in fact is happening in Canada \nrelative to BSE, relative to their feed regime, and to give us an \nopportunity to be assured we are not endangering either our economy or \nthe public health in the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, who by profession is a veterinarian and \ncertainly has, in addition to legislative knowledge, professional \nknowledge about this issue, Mr. Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding 20 minutes. As the Senator mentioned, animals have been an \nimportant part of my life. I grew up on a cattle ranch and I have \ndedicated my life to animals and animal diseases.\n  I rise today to tell my colleagues that I do not believe the policy \nthat is now being proposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is \nrisky, I do not think it is premature, and I think if we want to \nprotect our cattlemen, we must pursue a policy of opening our borders \nof free trade. Colorado is one State that has historically benefited \nfrom the cattle industry and today it remains an important part of our \neconomy.\n  I will respond to a few specific points that were mentioned by my \ncolleague on the other side. I will talk briefly about the people who \nbecame ill as a result of the BSE prion. It is a form of protein, \nmodified virus, in Europe. The diet of Europeans is markedly different \nthan the American diet in the fact that they view brains and spinal \ncord tissue as a delicacy. Here in the United States and in Canada, as \na part of our processing of meat, we discard our central nervous system \ntissue, so it does not get into the food supply. We have rigorous \nenforcement in the United States. Canada has rigorous enforcement. As \nlate as February 22, we had a group of scientists go to Canada, and \nthey reported back to us that the enforcement of the rules and \nregulations in Canada was very robust, as it is here in the United \nStates.\n\n  But I think the most important thing we learned from the outbreak in \nEurope, and what we have learned with time, is that the prion, the \norganism that causes mad cow disease, occurs as a result of ruminant \nupon ruminant. By using that terminology, I mean that there are food \nsupplements that are developed from animals, mostly ruminants, that \nthen are fed back, either calcium or phosphorus, to the animal. When \nthat happens that provides a vehicle for the transmission of the prion, \nthe infectious organism. It doesn't transmit directly animal to animal \nby live contact or by human to animal by live contact. It is passed in \nthe food supply when you have a ruminant supplement from another \nruminant being fed.\n  Finally, of the three or four cases that we have in Canada, three of \nthose actually were before the provisions were put in place by Canada \nand the United States to prevent the consumption of ruminant-on-\nruminant feeds--except for one case. But that one case occurred very \nclose to 1997. As a result of more rigorous efforts by both Canada and \nthe United States, I believe beef is a good product, and I plan on \neating beef. I do not hesitate for one moment talking to my colleagues \nabout how good I think beef is and how we should not be overly \nconcerned about the health effects of beef in our diet.\n  The closure of our Canadian border has cost Greeley County, CO, which \nis one of the largest agricultural-producing counties in the United \nStates, alone, $250 million to $300 million over the past year from \ndiminished economic activity due to declining production at one single \nmeatpacking facility. This is a result of the Canadian border closure. \nTotally, the economic impact of the border closure throughout the \nUnited States is $3 billion. The border with Canada should be open \nbased on sound, scientific principles that ensure the integrity and \nsafety of the U.S. cattle food supply.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture approach to these discussions has \nbeen rational and science based. Sound science is critical because it \nseparates fact from myth and ignores mad cow hysterics. Television \npictures of seizure-stricken cows are intended to draw viewers but do \nnot represent the truth behind the image.\n  Five other Senators joined me in April of last year in support of the \nimmediate reopening of the Canadian border following these principles. \nJoining me on a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative were Senators \nBen Nelson, Senator Campbell, Senator Murkowski, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Brownback.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     Wayne Allard,\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Robert Zoellick,\n     Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Zoellick: The purpose of this letter is to \n     bring to your attention our concerns relating to the present \n     economic and trade situation facing the U.S. beef industry as \n     a result of the Canadian border closure. We ask for your \n     assistance to facilitate the immediate reopening of the \n     border to trade in live cattle, based on sound scientific \n     principles that will ensure the integrity and safety of the \n     U.S. cattle inventory and the American food supply.\n       Since the discovery of BSE in North America, the U.S. beef \n     industry is confronting the most significant challenge in its \n     105-year history. The economic impact of the border closure \n     has escalated over the past year and the industry is now at a \n     point where difficult decisions are being made to protect \n     long-term job stability. For example, beef processing plants \n     across the country have had to reduce hours significantly to \n     absorb the increasing pressure of the current situation, \n     resulting in job loss and reductions in worker's take home \n     pay. To date, the industry has suffered over a 12 percent \n     reduction in U.S. fed cattle\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\n     being processed for the domestic and international market \n     place, at an estimated $12 billion loss to the economy and \n     impacting over 80,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n       As recently demonstrated by the Harvard Center for Risk \n     Analysis (HCRA), there is no body of scientific evidence \n     indicating that there is any potential risk to the American \n     consumer in allowing live Canadian cattle under the age of 30 \n     months to enter the U.S. marketplace destined for fattening \n     or slaughter. Toward this end, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture's (USDA) proposed rule to amend its BSE \n     regulations to allow the United States to import live cattle \n     less than 30 months of age from Canada harmonizes the health \n     interests of the American public with the international trade \n     interests of the United States, provided that it is \n     implemented based on sound scientific principles that will \n     ensure the integrity and safety of the U.S. cattle inventory \n     and the American food supply. By encouraging more practical, \n     science-based guidelines relevant to BSE risk management, \n     USDA's proposed rule will help restore the U.S. beef \n     industry's ability to remain competitive in an increasingly \n     global marketplace and protect long-term job stability in the \n     United States.\n       While the United States cannot unilaterally open trade \n     borders with Japan, Korea and other key trade partners, USDA \n     can act expeditiously with respect to reestablishing live \n     cattle trade with our North American trading partners. We \n     hope that actions can be expedited toward this end as well as \n     with our other trade partners to remove scientifically \n     unjustified barriers to trade.\n       We appreciate the attention and efforts that you have given \n     this serious matter to date and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you to ensure that adequate and science based \n     protections are in place to ensure open and free trade while \n     also protecting the health and safety of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne Allard,\n       United States Senator.\n     Lisa Murkowski,\n       United States Senator.\n     Orrin Hatch,\n       United States Senator.\n     Ben Nelson,\n       United States Senator.\n     Sam Brownback,\n       United States Senator.\n     Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n       United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. The USDA Minimal Risk Region rule should be implemented \nbecause it is grounded in solid, sound science and will help end a \nsituation that has wreaked havoc on beef trade for too long. It will \nprotect the integrity of the human supply system and stabilize \nagricultural trade.\n  Canada meets the requirements of a minimal risk region, based upon a \nnumber of its actions. It has prohibited specific risk material in \nhuman food, as we do here in the United States. It placed import \nrestrictions sufficient to minimize exposures to BSE. It has built and \nstructured surveillance for BSE at levels to meet or exceed \ninternational guidelines, as we do here. And it has enacted a ruminant-\nto-ruminant feed ban. Finally, the appropriate epidemiological \ninvestigations, risk assessment, and risk mitigation measures have been \nimposed.\n  Opening the border with Canada will help restore the beef industry's \nability to remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace and \nprotect long-term job stability in the United States.\n  I have a chart that reflects Canadian beef exports. If we look over \nhere to 2003 when the mad cow disease began to impact Canada, we can \nsee, obviously, that there was a reduction in billions of pounds of \ncarcass weight that was exported from Canada. But here we are moving \nfrom 2004. Not all the figures are in, but they are indicating we are \ngoing to get a pretty steep climb back in exports from Canada. And \nbased on projections for 2005, exports from Canada are going to reach a \nhistoric high, despite the fact they have had mad cow disease in \nCanada.\n  These facts come from a reputable analyst, analyzing firm based in \nDenver, CO, that traditionally cattlemen have relied on to analyze beef \nmarkets throughout the country.\n  Let's look at the chart for U.S. beef imports from Canada. Obviously, \nin 2003 we saw a reduction in the amount of beef imports from Canada. \nAgain, this is a million pounds of carcass weight over time. What we \nsee in 2004 is that the imports from Canada have exceeded an all-time \nhigh, despite the fact that we have mad cow disease.\n  The point is, we are importing Canadian beef at record levels. We \nneed to change that policy because processors are moving their plants \nto Canada. More and more people are going into the Canadian beef \nbusiness. As a result, we are at risk of losing our own market share of \nbeef.\n  The Greeley Tribune published an editorial stating that the United \nStates must open its border with Canada. The Tribune is published in \nGreeley, CO, Colorado's most productive agricultural county.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Greeley Tribune, Mar. 1, 2005]\n\n  Open Canada to U.S. Beef Salazar Must Follow Allard's Example With \n                                 Japan\n\n       U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard is to be commended for his letter to \n     the Japanese ambassador last week demanding that the Japanese \n     government reopen its market to U.S. beef products.\n       Allard was joined by almost 20 other senators in the letter \n     that was hand-delivered to Ambassador Ryozo Kato by Secretary \n     of Agriculture Mike Johanns, who expressed his appreciation \n     to Allard in taking the initiative to address the issue.\n       In his letter, Allard--a Republican from Loveland and \n     Colorado's senior senator--noted that since the only \n     confirmed case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow \n     disease) in the United States, the U.S. government has worked \n     diligently to take the necessary steps to earn the confidence \n     of the Japanese public, in many respects exceeding \n     internationally established scientific requirements. Yet the \n     Japanese government has continued to drag its collective feet \n     in reopening the border.\n       Allard hinted, rather strongly, that Congress could be \n     forced to take retaliatory actions on Japanese imports--which \n     exceed $118 billion annually--while expressing hope that step \n     would not have to be taken.\n       Colorado's freshman senator, Ken Salazar, was one of the \n     others who signed the letter.\n       But at the same time, Salazar has joined eight other \n     Democratic senators who signed a resolution of disapproval of \n     the USDA's proposal to reopen the Canadian border to imports \n     into the United States of live cattle starting this month. \n     Salazar cited safety and accountability as key concerns on \n     that move.\n       Salazar should reconsider that position.\n       The Canadian border is already open. Boxes of Canadian \n     beef--beef from the same cattle that are currently being \n     stopped at the border--are flowing into the United States, \n     resulting in a tidy profit for Canadian processors. If \n     science says that beef is safe, then so are the cattle which \n     are producing it.\n       Economists have estimated that in the first four months the \n     border was open to Canadian beef. Weld County lost about $100 \n     million from diminished economic activity due to the \n     declining production levels at the Greeley beef-packing plant \n     of Swift & Co. alone. That does not include Fort Morgan's \n     Cargill plant.\n       So keeping the border closed to live cattle is contributing \n     to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs to Canada, which continues to \n     expand its processing industry to handle all its cattle, \n     while the U.S. beef-processing industry shrinks--running \n     about 10 percent below pre-ban averages. The jobs moving to \n     Canada are not likely to return.\n       Industry officials have determined that re-opening the \n     border will not flood the U.S. market because the Canadian \n     market is relatively current. Those Canadian processors have \n     been running six days a week around the clock to process \n     their cattle, then sell the beef in the United States or in \n     the markets where they compete with U.S. beef.\n       During his campaign, Salazar said he intended to put his \n     constituents ahead of party politics. yet in this case, he \n     sides with primarily Democratic legislators against the Bush \n     Administration.\n       This position, being pushed by senators without major beef-\n     processing plants, puts Salazar at odds with the best \n     interests of his constituents and his own state. He needs to \n     put science and the people who helped send him to Washington \n     ahead of politics.\n       We urge the new senator to follow Allard's lead with the \n     Japanese and call for the U.S. border to be opened to live \n     Canadian cattle.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Many of the supporters of the Resolution of Disapproval \nargue that because of U.S. policies, U.S. corporations are outsourcing \njobs. The border closure has allowed Canada to grow its beef industry \nand increase its slaughter capacity, making Canada into a global \ncompetitor. While U.S. jobs are lost because of an unfair trade policy \nthat allows cheap Canadian meat into the United States, they are being \nreplaced in Canada as it bolsters its beef industry. Estimates will \nshow that Canada will have the industry capacity to replace U.S. beef \nby May of 2005. Supporters of this resolution support the outsourcing \nof U.S. jobs.\n  During the past several years, Canada's annual cattle slaughter has \nbeen 3.2 to 3.3 million head. This is equivalent to about 65,000 head \nof cattle slaughtered per week. In 2004, Canadian slaughter was about \n30 percent larger than during 2003. In 2005, Canadian cattle slaughter \ncapacity is expected to\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nincrease to about 95,000 head per week. Canada is expanding available \nslaughter capacity in the country so it can be less reliant on the U.S. \nmarket to process animals. Reliance on the U.S. market will continue, \nbut Canada will compete effectively against the United States in the \nworld marketplace.\n  According to the Canadian Meat Council, since May 2003, the Canadian \nbeef industry has increased its daily beef capacity by more than 30 \npercent. The additional Canadian slaughter capacity that is available, \nor planned, will allow the Canadian beef industry to increase cattle \nslaughter totals by about 25 percent from 2004 to 2007.\n  Thanks to the border closure, thousands of U.S. workers have been \nlaid off or have had their operations suspended. In Greeley, CO, \nlocated in the State's largest agricultural county, nearly 1,000 \nworkers lost their jobs thanks to the closure.\n  Weekly cattle harvests in Canada are up 14 percent, from 72,000 to \n82,000 over the past year, and are expected to rise to 95,000 per week \nby mid-2005, a 25-percent increase over pre-BSE levels. The jobs that \ngo with that increased production probably will never return to the \nUnited States.\n  Prior to May of 2003, cattle imports from Canada accounted for \napproximately 4 percent of the U.S. production capacity. A number of \nthese animals were also a part of the U.S.-Canadian Northwest Cattle \nFeeder Initiative. By allowing them to increase production capacity, we \nthreaten U.S. production and marketing.\n  The average number of imported Canadian cattle for all purposes, \nbetween 1970 and 2003, is 795,563 head per year. The highest level of \ncattle imports was 1.68 million in 2002, and the lowest was 245,000 in \n1986. The Minimal Risk Region rule requires animals to be imported \nexclusively for slaughter. Dairy, stocker, or other livestock segments \nare prohibited from importing animals for breeding or other purposes.\n  Frankly, the Canadian border is already open. Boxed beef is coming \nacross the border from Canada in record numbers, numbers higher than \nthey were before BSE was discovered in Canada, creating a public policy \nwindfall for those companies with processing facilities in Canada while \npunishing those in the United States. U.S. beef imports from Canada set \na record in 2004, approaching 1.2 billion pounds, a 12-percent increase \nover 2002 levels. During 2005, beef imports from Canada are expected to \ntotal 1.2 to 1.3 billion pounds.\n  Increased Canadian packing capacity is expected to increase beef \nproduction to more than 3.7 billion pounds in 2005 and exceed 4 billion \npounds in 2007.\n  The unfair public policy is best illustrated in the following \nexample. Canadian packers can buy a cow for about $17 per hundredweight \nand sell the processing-grade beef for about $123. He can also buy a \nfed steer or heifer at about $67 per hundredweight and sell the meat \nfor about $132.\n  In the United States a cow will cost a packer about $55 per \nhundredweight, and the beef would sell for about $125. The fed steer or \nheifer would cost about $85 per hundredweight, and the beef would sell \nfor about $135.\n  This imbalance has led, in part, to the layoff of thousands of people \nin the processing industry across our Nation. Eventually it will affect \nthe cattlemen because our markets will be less available for those who \nhave live fat cattle.\n  The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis has stated there is no body of \nscientific evidence indicating there is any potential risk to the \nAmerican consumer in allowing live Canadian cattle under the age of 30 \nmonths to enter the U.S. marketplace destined for fattening or \nslaughter.\n  I have picked up, as a result of my colleague from North Dakota \nmentioning the Colorado cattlemen's position--I do have a list of the \nrequirements they are requiring. I have read down through those, and \nthose provisions are being met in the United States, and they are being \nmet in Canada. We have just made a call to the National Cattlemen's \nAssociation, and they have indicated to us that they support the \nposition of opposing this resolution. So they understand that the rules \nand regulations that are being proposed by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture do protect the American consumer. They do protect, in the \nlong run, the future of the cattle industry.\n  I just wanted to call that to the attention of the Members here, and \nI also want to again refer to my State of Colorado. There are a lot of \nStates that have their economies built upon beef. In Colorado, on \nexports in general we have about $154 million in trade. We export $97 \nmillion. Most of that is in the beef side. We have $51 million of beef \nthat is exported. We import about $97 million. Some of it is live \ncattle, but a good percentage of it is breads and pastries and cakes \nand vegetables.\n  If we do not address this problem, we are going to have a profound \nimpact, in a negative way, on the Colorado beef industry and, \nthroughout the country.\n  Canada is one of our most important trading partners. Agriculture is \na fundamental component of U.S. trade. If we cannot rationally restore \nthe beef and cattle trade with our most important trading partner, I \nask the question: How will we ever restore trade on a global scale?\n  Some 20 Members of the Senate have joined me in sending a letter to \nthe Japanese Ambassador asking him to reduce his import restrictions on \nbeef from the United States. If we don't--and the other countries \nthroughout the world are watching--what we are doing here?\n  If we don't use good science and if we don't use good sound policy, \nit is going to have a prolonged impact on our trade policies throughout \nthe world, particularly as it applies to the livestock industry.\n  From what I understand, USDA appears to support the policies of the \nWorld Health Trade Organization. In fact, I think it exceeds what is \nrecommended by the World Health Organization. I think Canada has the \nsame policies, and I think they exceed what is required by the World \nHealth Organization. We are setting the standard for the world.\n  I feel comfortable in having beef for dinner. When I am asked the \nquestion, What's for dinner? I am not going to hesitate to say beef, \nbecause I think we have a quality product in this country. I think what \nis happening in Canada is comparable to what is happening in the United \nStates. I think they are working hard to bring the regulations and \nrules into compliance with what we have here.\n  We received a report a week or so ago from a group of scientists who \nvisited Canada, saying they have a robust effort in their rules and \nregulations, just as we have a robust effort in this country.\n  Again, when asked the question, What is for dinner? my answer is \nbeef.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Colorado, that in the Conrad family, when asked, What is for \ndinner? beef is often the answer.\n  But that is not the question. The question is, Are we going to keep \nthe beef supply safe? The evidence is overwhelming that Canada is not \nenforcing their own regulations. Their own testing shows they have \nright now four cases of mad cow identified in Canada.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the better part of wisdom is for us \nnot to open this border in a premature way. The risk is too great to \nour people and to our industry. The Senator cites the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association. I met with my representative of the \nNational Cattlemen in my State. They urged me to proceed. They urged me \nto go to a vote. They urged me to try to carry the vote.\n  When I look at what the National Cattlemen said, here it is. They put \nout 11 conditions that need to be met before the border is opened, and \nonly 3 of them have been met. I would be glad at a later point to go \nright through the 11 conditions they said should be met. We can go \nright to the eight that are clearly not met. This border should not be \nopened until these 11 conditions have been met.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have apparently resolved what everybody \nis going to have for dinner. Apparently it is beef. We haven't resolved \nwho is going to stand on the floor of the Senate this morning and \nsupport our farmers and ranchers who produce that beef. That is the \nquestion--not what we are eating for dinner. Who is going to stand for \nthe farmers and ranchers on this issue?\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\n  It took a nanosecond to hear that we are protectionist this morning. \nEvery thoughtful discussion turns into a thoughtless discussion in a \nnanosecond around here when it deals with trade, because instantly the \nsubject of protection comes up and the word ``protectionism'' is used. \nGod forbid that someone should be accused in this Chamber of the Senate \nof standing up to protect the economic interests of this country. It \nhappens precious few times.\n  But let me be somebody who says, if that is the charge, I plead \nguilty. I want to protect our economic interests. I don't want to build \nwalls around this country. I believe expanded trade is helpful. But I \nalso want to stand up for the economic interest of this country when it \nis at stake.\n  Let me say one other thing, as I have been listening here. Let us \nstop walking hat in hand to the Japanese and asking for favors. Let us \nstop killing another tree to send one more letter to the Japanese. Last \nyear, they had a $74 billion trade surplus with us. Because we had one \nCanadian cow found in the State of Washington with BSE, the Japanese \ndon't want to eat American beef.\n  Now we have people who say somehow the Japanese will be more \nconfident to eat American beef, if we allow Canadian cattle to come \ninto this country--cattle from a country where investigations have \nshown that the feed supply has prohibited animal materials. My \ncolleague Senator Conrad described it. In December, the Vancouver Sun \nreported that officials from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency found \nprohibited animal materials in 141 of 70 samples. Of the feed that was \ntested, 58 percent was found to have had prohibited animal materials.\n\n  So somehow you are going to give the Japanese confidence by allowing \nCanadian cattle to come into this country on the heels of four examples \nof mad cow disease in Canada? I don't think so.\n  I know there is a lot of passion about this issue. Canada is a great \nbig, old, wonderful country with great neighbors. They are a wonderful \nneighbor of ours. We share thousands of miles of common border. I am \nheartbroken for the Canadian ranchers. I know it must be tough for \nthem. I wish them no ill will at all. I regret that they have found \nexamples of mad cow disease in Canada. But they have.\n  Our responsibility is to stand up for the interests of American \nproducers, American farmers, and ranchers. That is our job.\n  Listen. You all read the papers last summer. The President was going \nto go to Canada. The speculation last summer was that in discussions \nwith Canada there would be a promise that border would be opened after \nthe election. We all read that--not once, several times. Sure enough, \nthe election comes and goes, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture \ndecides that the border has to be opened. Canada meets every test.\n  It turns out they don't meet every test. It turns out this is not \nabout sound science. This is about let us pretend. Frankly, some say \nlet us pretend that everything is fine; that there is rigorous testing \nin Canada; that the testing meets all the requirements; that there is \nno difficulty, no problems; and, if we allow under the conditions set \nby the United States Department of Agriculture the import of beef and \nlive animals from Canada, somehow things will turn out fine for us. \nBut, of course, that is not the case. We know that is not the case.\n  My colleague Senator Conrad offers this Chamber this morning an \nopportunity to cast a vote on this issue. I know we have already heard \nabout protectionism, and we have heard this is tough on packing \ncompanies, which is another part of this, obviously. But the question \nfor the Congress is, Will it stand up for the interests of American \nproducers? Will it be something that will make it harder to get into \ninternational export markets once again with our beef?\n  I think that it is time--long past the time--for this Congress to \ncast a vote in support of America's interests here, in support of our \ncountry's interests, and our producers' interests.\n  I can think of dozens of debates on the floor of the Senate where in \nevery circumstance where you talk about the interests of American \nproducers, somehow foreign policy is overwhelming. All of this \nmishmash, this soft-headed nonsense, of course, comes from the State \nDepartment, and from all those in this Chamber who stand up on cue and \nsay, Yes, sir, yes, sir, we certainly don't want to be accused of \nprotectionism when it comes to economic interests. Let us find a high \nboard, and dive right off that old high board.\n  On this issue, Senator Conrad says he is not ready to dive, nor am I, \nnor I think are many in this Chamber ready to simply decide the \neconomic interests of this country, the interests of farmers and \nranchers, are to be sacrificed in this circumstance.\n\n  A few days before Christmas of 2003, the one instance of BSE, or mad \ncow disease, was discovered in this country. It wasn't an American cow; \nit was a Canadian cow sent to this country from Canada. The \nconsequences of that are dramatic, and they have been significant. But, \nmy colleague, as I listened to his opening statement today, described \nconsequences far more severe than that in Europe.\n  We ought to move with some caution here and with some concern. We \nought to move reasonably slowly to make sure we know what we are doing. \nBut that has not been the case with USDA. And, in part, it is because \nthe packing companies are putting on the pressure. It is partly, I \nthink, because the President went to Canada last summer and made some \nrepresentations. In part, it is because they say they are meeting all \nthese tests. But my colleague Senator Conrad has taken the mask off all \nof that.\n  How does one describe a response to what my colleague Senator Conrad \nhas said, my colleague Senator Johnson has said, and what I have said--\nthat the tests in Canada as reported by the Canadian news and by the \nCanadian Food Inspection Agency found prohibited animal materials in 58 \npercent of the cattle feed tested?\n  I have not heard one person respond to that. Is there a response? If \nso, I would be happy to yield to someone to offer me a response. Is \nthere anyone here who wants to respond to the proposition that 58 \npercent of the feed that has been tested, as reported in Canada, had \nanimal parts in it? Is there no response? Doesn't it matter? Don't we \ncare? Or, is this the case where we should ignore the evidence and \ndecide that we came to the Chamber with our own preconceived \nconditions, opinions, and our own desire to support the President and \nUSDA, and we have to vote that way?\n  Although I am not going to be on the floor for the entire debate, I \nhope at some point someone might respond to that proposition.\n  Evidence is a pretty difficult thing sometimes. The evidence here is \ncompelling and clear. We have people saying that Canada meets all the \ntests, and then we have the evidence. They don't.\n  When my colleague Senator Byrd one day was speaking on the floor, he \nsaid that the caterpillar, the squirrel, and the eagle, seeing the \nEarth from exactly the same spot, saw it differently. The caterpillar \nclimbs on a clump of grass, and says, I can see the world. And on the \nexact same spot, the squirrel climbs the tree and says, I see the \nworld. And at exactly the same spot, the eagle flies overhead, and \nsays, I see the world. All three look at the same spot and see \ndifferent things. It happens.\n  But you can't look at the spot Senator Conrad asks you to look at \ntoday and see something different. You can't. The demonstration of that \nis there is no answer to the proposition that the feed testing in \nCanada is woefully inadequate. And if you believe that--and apparently \nyou do, because nobody is contesting that--then opening that border at \nthis point, in my judgment, compromises the interests of farmers and \nranchers in this country.\n  Why on Earth would we decide to do that? In whose interest are we \nhere serving? Why would we decide to put someone else's interest first?\n  There is nothing to be ashamed of, in my judgment, for standing up \nfor this country's interest for a change. Perhaps once, just once \ntoday, on this vote we will see evidence of an interest of doing that \nhere in the Senate.\n  Let me conclude one more time by saying this is not about \n``protectionism.'' That is the kind of nonsense thrown around in every \ntrade debate. But it is about protecting America's economic interests. \nThat is what we come to the Senate to do. My hope is\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nwhen we finally cast this vote, we will have done so this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee for allowing me this time.\n  I rise today as cochairman of the beef caucus to speak against Senate \nJoint Resolution 4, which seeks to condemn the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture plan to reopen the Canadian border to live cattle.\n  I concur with the sentiments already expressed by the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee and the distinguished agriculturalist from \nKansas, Senator Roberts. I also learned a great deal from the \nprofessional testimony of our Senator, Dr. Allard, from Colorado, about \nthe safety and about the science that goes into the decision made by \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I note also that this past week, a group of our scientists who \nvisited Canada said their system of protecting the food supply and the \nbeef was robust and certainly could be counted on. As a member of the \nagriculture posse, I have heard Secretary Johanns, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, describe the steps they were taking to ensure our beef \nsupply is protected.\n  We just heard a defense of protectionism. Let me define what \nprotectionism is. Protectionism is, in my view, the use of scare \ntactics, the use of unsound scientific information, in an attempt to \nprotect our markets. In this case, I believe sound science dictates it \nis time to open the border. Were it not so, I would not be rising today \nin support of the Department of Agriculture.\n  The fact remains, as Senator Allard has pointed out, not only is this \nnot based on sound science, the impact of the beef ban has been to \ncreate a feeding and slaughter operation in Canada, which is moving the \nproduction facilities and jobs out of the United States and into \nCanada, potentially putting a very harmful impact on our ability to \nraise, slaughter, and produce the beef we eat in the United States. \nYes, beef is what was for dinner last night. Tonight it will be my \ndinner, and it will continue to be.\n  Every Member of this body and our constituents back home expect the \nU.S. Government to work to ensure we have the safest food supply \npossible. That is why we hire scientists. That is why we hire \nveterinarians. That is why we devote efforts to make sure it is safe. \nUnfortunately, all too often, the United States takes the abundance and \nsafety of our food supply for granted. When we are faced with \nchallenges to these expectations, like reports of BSE or mad cow \ndisease in our cattle or our immediate neighbor's, the floodgates of \ndemagoguery from so-called consumer advocates are opened, every mother \nis frightened into believing she may be jeopardizing her family at the \nnext meal she serves, and markets react.\n  Statistics and science say the likelihood of you, me, or our children \nat home eating a BSE-tainted burger or steak not cooked hot enough to \nkill the pathogen is, on an order of magnitude, less of a threat than \nmany of the other risks we accept in our everyday lives, such as \ndriving our children to school and back.\n  The alarmism and subsequent waves of fear of BSE threats are seen as \nopportunities by many of our trading partners who seek to find any \nexcuse to erect trade barriers to our products. These foreign buyers \nignore the science, statistics, and history. The U.S. position in the \nworld market is based on the very sound principle that good science \nshould and must prevail. Whether our trade representatives are \nnegotiating exports of genetically enhanced rice or soybeans, meat \nproduced using the most advanced commercial technologies, or as we \nnegotiate reopening of the Japanese beef markets to our own production, \nsound science is the best negotiating tool we have against the Luddites \nand naysayers in our potential foreign markets.\n  We cannot fall prey to the wonderful exuberance of populism in \nprotecting our markets with false or pseudoscience-based claims while \nexpecting the world to accept the products of U.S. farmers who feed the \nworld largely due to our use of the latest technologies.\n  The Agriculture Department's amended final rule on resumption of beef \nand live cattle trade with Canada was developed based on the best \nscience at hand and with broad input from the cattle industry. The \namended rule restricts imports of beef animals older than 30 months. \nAlso, Canada, as I said earlier, has implemented appropriate BSE \nprevention standards similar to our stringent domestic firewalls. As I \nsaid earlier, this has been confirmed by our scientists who have \nvisited and inspected the operations in Canada. This includes the \nbanning of all ruminant to ruminant feed and effective enforcement. \nThis alone will drastically reduce further contamination in the \nCanadian beef herds. Sound science should prevail here and in all of \nour trade negotiations.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take the opportunity to encourage the \nUSDA, our trade representatives in Japan, to apply sound science and to \ncontinue the move to reopening markets in Japan to our beef exports. \nRecently, I joined with several of my colleagues who also spoke today \nsending a letter to the Ambassador to Japan saying we would not stand \nfor pseudoscience-based protectionism preventing the export of U.S. \nbeef to Japan.\n  This past week, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of \nthe Japanese Diet, the legislative body of Japan. I told them of our \ninterest in providing beef to the consumers of Japan. They assured me \nthat American beef is a very high priority for those Japanese \nconsumers. We said, OK, they want it, we have shown it is going to be \nsafe, it is time to open your markets and provide a significant export \nopportunity which will serve and reward the U.S. cattle producers.\n  I hope we will reject this resolution and allow sound science to \nrule.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 503 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding the \ntime.\n  I join today with him and others in the Senate in support of this \nresolution. I hoped it would not come to this, that we could achieve a \nresult, an outcome short of having to have this debate in the Senate. \nHowever, I have to say I wholeheartedly agree with the premise of this \nresolution; that is, that the rule in question is wrong. It is wrong \ntiming.\n  Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in South Dakota. The cattle \nindustry, the livestock industry, is the biggest component of that. \nThis industry has an enormous impact on the economy, the gross domestic \nproduct in my State. In fact, as noted earlier today by another \nspeaker, we have probably five or six times the number of cattle than \nwe have people in South Dakota.\n  Growing up on the Plains of western South Dakota, I have witnessed \nfirsthand the incredible work ethic of our livestock producers, the \nwillingness to go out during calving season and fight the elements and \nconditions, and to work to nurture the herds and bring them to the \nmarketplace, to go through the weather we have to deal with in South \nDakota on an ongoing yearly basis, and to haul water and to haul feed \nto those herds, to get them to where they can take them to the \nmarketplace.\n  As a member of the House Ag Committee when we were debating the 2002 \nfarm bill, I advocated and fought on behalf of country-of-origin \nlabeling because I believe it is important that American consumers know \nwhere their products are coming from. It was included in the 2002 farm \nbill.\n  More recently, in the last year or so, this body and the House \nadopted legislation that would delay the implementation of country-of-\norigin labeling, which is unfortunate because I think it would alter \nand change the dimensions of the debate we are having here today.\n  So I come here today to speak in support of this resolution, and I do \nso knowing full well that as a three-term Member of the House, I come \nhere with a record supporting free trade. I supported trade promotion \nauthority for both President Clinton and President Bush because I \nbelieve our leaders in this country need to have the authority to go \nout there and make the best\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\npossible deals for our agricultural industry and other industries in \nour country, always reserving the right to vote against those trade \nagreements if I do not believe they are in the best interests of \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I do not harbor any ill will toward Canada. Canada has been an \nimportant trading partner in the past and will continue to be in the \nfuture. I am hopeful that when this is all said and done we will be \nable to restore that relationship. But, frankly, this issue is not \nabout protectionism. It is about safety. It is about science. It is \nabout making sure that America's consumers have a safe supply of beef \nproducts in this country, and also that those that we do business with \noverseas, our trading partners, are fully confident in the exports we \nsend their way.\n  I believe exports are important to America. They are important to \nagriculture. In this country today, one in every three rows of corn \ngoes to the export markets. We would like to see more of it going into \nethanol. I hope it will. But the reality is, we depend heavily upon \nexport markets for the success and prosperity of American agriculture.\n  So I supported increasing trade opportunities for our producers. But \nthe fact is, we have not been able, at this point, I believe, to \nprovide the level of confidence and assurance to the American consumer \nand to producers in this country that, in fact, the Canadians are \ntaking the steps necessary to ensure that their herds are 100 percent \nin compliance with the ruminant feed ban.\n  My first official act, after being sworn in as a Senator, was to ask \nthe President to delay the opening of the border beyond March 7. I have \ninsisted that decision to open the border be based, first, on two \nprerequisites: sound science and a return of our foreign cattle export \nmarkets--namely, the Pacific rim. This has not been answered.\n  USDA's own risk assessment in 2002 states the Canadian feed mills \nwere not--were not--100 percent complying with the feed ban. The \nborders should not be open until that allegation is fully investigated \nand it is confirmed that the ban is being properly enforced. The most \nrecent assessment completed by the USDA team this year concluded that \nthe feed ban is reducing the risk of transmission of BSE in the \nCanadian cattle population. That is not 100 percent. Cattle imports \nfrom Canada should not be accepted until we can be sure feed mills are \n100 percent compliant. American consumers need to be assured the meat \nthey are buying at local supermarkets is safe before the border opens, \nnot after, and American cattle producers need to be assured that live \ncattle coming from Canada are BSE free.\n  As I said earlier, another important aspect is regaining the Asian \ncattle export market. If the trade with these countries is not resumed \nand the border is opened, South Dakota ranchers will be competing \nagainst Canadian cattle without the benefit of exporting our cattle to \nother countries. Since being sworn in as Senator, I have been in \nongoing discussions with the USDA and Secretary Johanns trying to find \na way to resolve this border issue. I cosponsored legislation to modify \nthe rule to allow only beef products from animals under 30 months of \nage. In response to that, the USDA then modified their rule to do just \nthat. I appreciate the Secretary's and the administration's work on \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has spoken for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have to yield, but I simply close by \nsaying, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to send a \nstrong message to our producers and consumers that we are going to \nsupport making sure that the feed ban is being complied with, and we \nare going to work hard to make sure our export markets are open before \nthis rule is implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding some time to me so I can respond to a number of issues that \nhave been brought up.\n  First of all, I would like to say that the information we have on the \nfood contents is older information. The newest information we have is \nfrom a group of scientists that went to Canada to check on their rules \nand regulations, on their enforcement. These scientists reported back \nto us on about February 22 of this year, saying that the rules and \nregulations are being enforced robustly in Canada. That includes the \nruminant on ruminant food regulation where you prevent the consumption \nof ruminant byproducts by other ruminants. I have confidence in these \ntrained scientists who know what they are looking for and have given us \nthe most recent report on what is happening as far as the food on food \nregulation.\n  I would also like to go over some of the positions by the Colorado \nCattlemen Association as well as the National Beef Association. They \nsupport a minimal-risk region classification, and they support it on \nthe following conditions:\n  No beef or beef products will be imported into the U.S. from cattle \nover 30 months of age. That is in place.\n  All imported feeder cattle must be harvested previous to 30 months of \nage, and the verification processes must be implemented to track and \nvalidate harvest age and location. They are doing that with earmarkings \nas well as brands.\n  All cattle direct to harvest must be 30 months of age or younger. \nThat is being done. It is a provision in the rules and regulations.\n  Minimal-risk regions must meet all processing techniques and \nregulations relating to BSE as set out by the U.S. That is what those \nscientists were reporting to us as of the 22nd of February.\n  Adherence and implementation of a U.S. equivalent ruminant to \nruminant feed ban. That is a requirement. That is what the scientists \nreport back, that they are complying with the rules and regulations, \nand we should not have a concern about it.\n  And then:\n\n       The Colorado Cattlemen's Association is committed to \n     normalizing global trade based on [good] science that \n     protects the health of the beef industry.\n\n  And they express that:\n\n       Once our concerns have been adequately addressed, CCA will \n     reconsider our position on opening the Canadian border.\n\n  The Colorado Cattlemen Association currently supports the minimal-\nrisk region rules that have been put out by the Ag, and the Colorado \nFarm Bureau currently supports the Canadian reopening. The Colorado \nLivestock Association supports the reopening, and the National \nCattlemen's Association, which is headquartered in Colorado, supports \nthe Department of Agriculture's provision on minimal risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me make a couple quick points. It is \ntrue we had an investigation group go to Canada. Here is what they \nfound. They went to seven feed mill operations in Canada. In six of the \nseven, they found one or more unsatisfactory task ratings. In two of \nthe seven, they found serious failures to ensure prohibited material \ndid not enter the food chain. More seriously, the assessment found that \nonly 3 percent of Canada's on-farm feed manufacturers have been \ninspected at least once over the last 3 years.\n  Now we are talking about 25,000 on-farm feed operations. These mills \nrepresent one-half of Canadian livestock feed production. Only 3 \npercent have been investigated, were checked in the last 3 years.\n  My friends, we are talking about risk. What are the consequences of \nfailure? In England, 146 people died. In England, they had to slaughter \n5 million head.\n  In Europe, these were the headlines, week after week: ``French \nFarmers in Grip of BSE Panic.'' ``World of Europe Suffering for UK \nErrors.'' ``Mad Cow Disease Kills 500 Dairy Cattle Every Week.'' \n``Slaughter to Prevent Disease on Continent.''\n  There were 6 million heads slaughtered. We are talking about \nsubstantial risk to our industry, to our consumers. Let's be cautious. \nLet's not open the border before we are confident Canada is actually \nenforcing the regulations\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nthey have on their books. The evidence is very clear that they are not.\n  Mr. President, I yield Senator Thomas 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have had a good discussion. I am glad \nwe have. There are a number of parts to it, of course. We have talked a \nlot about the safety issue, which is key, and to be confident in the \nthings that we have asked Canada to do. We had a hearing with the \nSecretary some time back. He had his scientists there with him, and \nthey were not certain they had done all the things that they might do. \nBut I think the key is the matter of opening the markets for us.\n  Our markets for beef have grown in the last number of years. It has \nbeen one of the most important things that we have had to export. Most \nof that growth has been in the Pacific Rim--Asia, Japan, Korea. Of \ncourse, now that is closed. Regardless of what you say about how well \nthe Canadians have done, that market is still closed, and it is closed \nbecause of Canadian activity or lack of it. That is really the key that \nwe have to look forward to.\n  I am certainly for trade. As a matter of fact, I am chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Trade of the Finance Committee. We need to do that. But \nI am reluctant to see us open this one until we have some arrangement \nto open Canada and Korea.\n  You say: Well, this is unfair to Canada. Nevertheless, that is where \nthe problems all came from. That is where the cows came from, the mad \ncow disease, not the U.S. They came from Canada, and the difficulty has \narisen there.\n  So I guess I just simply want to emphasize that we can talk all we \nwant to, as my friend from Colorado has, about what has been done \nthere. The fact is, we still haven't got our market back. We had good \nexports. We don't have them now. I am not as concerned about the \nprocessors being able to move up to Canada. The cows are here, \nactually, and that is where they are going to be. So I won't take more \ntime because I know there are many others who need and want to talk.\n  I hope we can keep in mind that all we are asking is that we have \nmore of an opportunity to deal with opening the markets in Japan, \nopening the markets in Korea, before we open the market in Canada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this resolution. \nI wish it didn't have to come to this. Maybe it is just an exercise, in \nlight of a Federal judge ruling yesterday, when some of the stockmen in \nmy State have chosen to settle this in court rather than what they can \nget through the policy of Congress.\n  I reluctantly rise in support of this because I wish that USDA would \nhave listened to those of us who have been saying for two months that \nthis rule has some problems. I want to say up front that I appreciate \nthe new Secretary of Agriculture Johanns's work on this issue. We met \nwith him. He came down and talked to us. He got thrown in on this with \na cold hand, and I know he has been working tirelessly to try to \nrespond to everybody's concerns. Then it comes down to the point where \nyou come to the fork in the road that everybody's concerns cannot be \nfully addressed. I thank him for doing the right thing and restricting \nthe eligible beef cattle to under 30 months old. I feel strongly about \nthat. I appreciate his action. I think when we said we are not going to \ntake products or cattle over 30 months into this country, that was a \nprudent move.\n  But there are still lingering concerns. Whenever this whole thing \nbroke out in 2003, I think I was the only one who stood up and said: \nThey have a feed problem because, No. 1, it started with an Angus cow \nin Alberta, and then the second cow was the Holstein cow that we found \nin the State of Washington. Then of the two after that, you had one \nAngus cow, two dairy cows, and one Charolais cow. So we know we don't \nhave a genetic problem.\n  In this ban, we have to be very careful of another unintended \nconsequence because there is a great exchange of breeding cattle and \nseed stock production that crosses that border both ways. So we have to \nhave some way to deal with that. The Department of Agriculture is \naddressing that situation, too. But it hadn't got there yet.\n  I said from the get-go, it is the feed. And every number that we see \ncoming out of Canada, and even the report of our USDA team does not \ndraw the conclusion that Canada has not really gotten serious about \nchecking feed, livestock, or cattle feed, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or \nacross the whole country as far as that goes.\n  That is where we all have a little bit of a problem. Consumer \nconfidence in beef has never been as good as it is right now. It is \nbecause we have taken certain steps to make sure that the safety of the \nfood is utmost because losing consumer confidence would be much more \ncostly than anything that we could do.\n  So, yes, I eat beef. Obviously, I have eaten quite a lot of it. I \nhave never missed a meal, nor do I plan to.\n  So when we talk about those things that are based on science--and my \nfriend from Colorado, who has points in this debate, is right on \ntarget--we have to face the reality of what is best for the cowman. \nBecause in my State, unlike Colorado, we don't have a predominance of \nprocessors. We don't even have a lot of feed cattle, but we have cow-\ncalf producers and we deal in older cattle, especially at this time of \nthe year. And, of course, we sell yearlings and feeder calves. Some of \nthose calves will go to Canada under Canada's new rules. That was a \npositive step.\n  But if we back off and take a look at this and let the facts come to \nthe top and we consider those facts, we will make better decisions not \nonly for our cattle people but also the consumers of this country. Even \nwhen we got the report of the USDA's team back from Canada, we were on \nbreak and had little time to look at that report and make a decision: \nAre they doing what they are supposed to do in order to protect their \nown livestock people? That is what Canada did. They let their own \npeople down--when you don't enforce the rules of the 1997 ban of \ncertain ingredients in cattle feed.\n  So what we are saying right now, is that this action furthers the \nprotection of two of the most important economies that we have in this \ncountry, and that is our consuming public and our cow-calf producers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, since the floor manager is not here, I \nyield myself 5 minutes to respond further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to emphasize again how very \nimportant it is that we proceed on this matter using good scientific \nevidence. I appreciate the statement that was made by the Senator from \nMontana. He is right in many regards that we need to be sure that we \nuse good science. I feel good about the enforcement of the rules and \nregulations based on the visit by scientists who just reported back in \nFebruary. It is the most recent report that we have on the enforcement \nof the rules and regulations in Canada. They are very competent \nscientists, very dedicated scientists. And what they reported back to \nus is valid.\n  From a trade standpoint, we need to do something for our cattlemen. I \nbelieve strongly that what we need to do for the cattleman is get the \nborders opened because we are importing Canadian beef today. It is \nboxed beef. The reason that is coming in is because our plants can't \neconomically make it. They are having to pay high prices for beef. They \nonly have a limited supply of beef, and so they are not up to capacity. \nIn the meantime, the processing plants, the beef that they are getting \nis lower cost beef. And then they are putting that on the world market. \nThey are importing that into the United States.\n  The result is that we see an expansion of the beef industry in \nCanada. They have got plans to build more processing plants. They are \nin the process right now of building more processing plants.\n  That means there are going to be more people raising cattle in \nCanada. That means if our processors here don't make it like the one in \nColorado, we\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nlose our local markets. We lose an opportunity for our cattlemen to \nreadily get their beef to market. That costs in shrinkage and extra \ntransportation costs, particularly when we look at the cost of gasoline \nand diesel fuel. So this is a problem that needs to be resolved \nquickly.\n  We need to move forward with the guidelines that were laid out. By \nthe way, the principles laid out in the guidelines have been used by \nthe cattle industry in this country to control livestock disease, which \nalso affects humans. The principles are laid out here, things like \nbrucellosis. We know in cattle country what that is all about. We have \nStates classified as brucellosis-free, and there are those having \nproblems with that. The movement of cattle back and forth begins with \naddressing brucellosis in those States. Using those principles, we have \nbeen able to reduce the incidence of brucellosis in this country. It \nworks. They are the same principles we are using on BSE and asking for \nCanada and the world organizations to apply, where we take minimal-risk \ncountries, such as Canada and the United States, and apply those \nprovisions in a good, scientific way.\n  That is only part of it. The other part is that during the process \nyou don't increase the risk by handling the processes improperly. No. \n1, you don't want to circulate the food and feed it back to the cows, \nthe byproducts. That is a policy that has been adopted here and in \nCanada, and it is something we have learned since the outbreak in the \nEuropean Community.\n  So, again, I also compliment Secretary of Agriculture Johanns for his \nefforts in trying to protect the beef industry and to use good science. \nHe comes from Nebraska. That is a big beef State, as are many of the \nother States. But the important thing is to recognize that free trade \nis a benefit of agriculture. It has benefited particularly the beef \nindustry. We want to make sure we get the border open, and we need to \nuse good science in opening it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Salazar.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan \nresolution to disapprove the opening of the Canadian border. My \nposition on this is clear. Until we resolve comprehensively the \nunderlying issues comprehensively in the interest of health and safety \nin support of our family farms and ranchers, we should keep the border \nclosed.\n  Today, I speak on behalf of those men and women who are on farms and \nranches across America, whose livelihood depends on being able to have \na quality livestock industry in place in their States. I join \norganizations such as the Colorado Cattlemen's Association which said \nit is not now time for us to lift the ban on Canadian imports.\n  I have spoken with Secretary Johanns about this issue. I have told \nhim that I am for the lifting of the Canadian ban at the appropriate \ntime. For me, that means we are not yet ready to do it because there \nare too many questions that still have to be answered prior to getting \nto that decision.\n  Many of the questions we have asked Secretary Johanns and the \nDepartment of Agriculture are questions to which we have not received \nany answers at this point in time: How many inspectors will we have at \nthe border as the million, more or less, cattle from Canada start \ncoming across the Canadian border and flooding the markets in our \nNation? How many cattle will they actually check as they come across \nthe border? How will they determine which of those cattle are 30 months \nor less of age?\n  I have been around cattle for most of my life, and I can tell you it \nis difficult to tell which cows or cattle are more than 30 months of \nage, or more than 3 or 3\\1/2\\ years. My father might have been able to \ntell us that. When you are talking about that kind of prediction, we \ndon't have an answer from the Department of Agriculture.\n\n  How will the entire BSE risk mitigation system be documented? What \nare the segregating procedures for the processing of cattle in Canada \nat this point? How are we integrating the efforts in trying to deal \nwith the BSE issue and opening up markets in South Korea and Japan with \nthe efforts that we are dealing with now in Canada? Those are very \nserious questions that will impact the American farmer and rancher for \na long time to come.\n  It seems to me it is a very reasonable request that many of us have \nmade to Secretary Johanns--that there ought to be a delay in the \nopening of the Canadian border until we can have faith that these \nquestions that have been appropriately asked by the ranchers and \nfarmers of America are answered.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to join in approval of the \nresolution. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is not often that persons speaking on \nthe opposing side of the issue on the floor yield time to someone who \nmight disagree with them. So I am thankful to the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Chambliss, for being so accommodating.\n  Yesterday, a judge in Montana said there remains a question of \nconcern as it relates to the science that we hope is well underway in \nCanada. You have certainly heard my colleagues from Montana and others \nargue that is a legitimate concern. Senator Conrad has made that point \ntime and time again. It is fair for us to err on the side of science. \nThat is where we ought to be. That is where our industry is. That is \nwhere we ought to demand of the Canadian industry.\n  Our industry people have been north of the border and they have seen \nthe tremendous progress that has been made. Our Secretary of \nAgriculture has recognized that progress and, in part, premised his \nrule on that basis. At the same time, I am one of those who remains \nskeptical. I think we have to ensure that we cannot take another hit in \nour agricultural economy. In 2003, May, Canada, boom. And then in \nDecember, along came the cow in the lower 48 that stole Christmas. She \nwasn't green, she was black and white and she pulled the rug out from \nunder the industry just for a moment in time.\n  Our Secretary of Agriculture effectively stepped in and talked our \nindustry and the consuming public into stability again. Why? Because \nthe cow had come from Canada. We have had our act together in the lower \n48 for a good long while, prohibiting the incorporation of animal \nprotein into the feed supply. We have played by the rules, and they \nhave been sustainable, scientific rules, which has assured the American \nconsumer safe, high-quality beef.\n  But when Canada sneezed and we got the cold, our trading partners \nbacked away. In that backing away, we lost a billion-dollar Japanese \nmarket. I have been one saying to my industry in Idaho that I am going \nto work to force the Canadians to get their act together, while at the \nsame time we are going to assure that we open the Japanese market. Our \nPresident has put pressure openly and personally on the Japanese, as \nhas our Vice President and Secretary of State. It is unique and \nunusual, but it demonstrates the importance of the livestock and cattle \nindustry to this administration and to our country for them to say to \nthe Japanese: Get your act together. We are clean; you know it; you see \nour science. We are doing the right thing.\n  Yet the Japanese push back. I cannot in good conscience open a border \nthat brings greater numbers to the lower 48 when the science remains \nquestionable and we have not resumed the Pacific rim markets that are \nextremely valuable to the livestock industry.\n  The new Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary Johanns, has been to the \nHill. We have talked with him. He is doing the right things. We sent a \nletter to him in opposition. He backed away for a time. He is pushing \nthe science, and he will continue to do so. But I do believe that a \nMarch 7 implementation is premature.\n  I trust that the judge looking at the evidence in Montana yesterday \nhas the same concerns that are being reflected by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and certainly by this Senator and many of us firsthand.\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\n  Actions do produce reactions. There are consequences to our action. \nThe Senator from Colorado has been concerned about the displacement of \nthe packing industry and what it will do, and it is having an impact. I \nam tremendously concerned that if we do not continue this aggressive \npressure, we could lose capacity in the lower 48 as the Canadian \nindustry begins to extend its ability into packing of their livestock \nproducts.\n  Today, in good conscience, I cannot nor will I oppose S.J. Res. 4. I \nbelieve we are sending an extremely valuable message to all of the \nmarkets involved, including the Canadians. The Canadians do not get it. \nThey see NAFTA as a one-way road. We have been fighting them for 4 \nyears on timber. They do not get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 5 minutes yielded to \nhim.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized for an additional minute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  The Canadians do not get it in timber and are still rope-a-doping us. \nThe Senator from Montana is in the Chamber. He and I have partnered in \ntrying to get them to get their act together on timber. They do not \nplay the game well when it is one-way traffic. They are doing the same \nthing in potatoes, and my potato farmers in Idaho are understanding the \nconsequence of losing markets.\n  Those are the real problems. To our Canadian friends: Listen up. Get \nyour act together in Canada. Play by the rules in NAFTA and resume and \nremain the good friends and trading partners we have always been. But \nwe will not dislocate economies in the lower 48 for the benefit of \neconomic gain in Canada. That is not equality, and that is not the fair \ntrade that we are looking at.\n  Let's make sure the science is right. We cannot allow another hit on \nthe livestock industry of the lower 48.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana. If he asks \nfor additional time, I will be happy to extend it to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota. This \nis obviously an extremely important matter because it affects the \nconsumption of one of the most valuable staples in the American diet, \nand that is meat. It also affects the livelihood of so many Americans, \nthe cattle ranchers, and other producers of meat and red meat products \nin the United States.\n  Agriculture is our No. 1 industry in Montana, so this is an extremely \nimportant matter. We also very much want people in the United States \nand around the world to be confident that the beef produced in the \nUnited States is free of BSE and is the best beef in the world.\n  Now is not the time to open the border to receive Canadian beef down \nto the United States. There may be a time--I hope there is a time--in \nthe not too distant future when we can do that. I think the North \nAmerican market makes sense, where beef can be eventually traded freely \nbetween the United States and Canada. After all, we are so close in so \nmany ways. We have the same heritage, the same language. The Canadians \nand Americans are very similar in their outlook on life, with same \nvalues, so forth.\n  But we in the United States are a little concerned--many of us are--\nwith the direction the U.S. Department of Agriculture has taken on this \nmatter; that is, the Department has been quite secretive, that the \nDepartment, in announcing its first rule to open the border for \nCanadian beef, did not tell us something they knew at that time. What \nis that? They knew at that time that BSE was just discovered in Canada.\n  It turned out even after USDA made their announcement of the rule, \nanother case of BSE was found in Canada. There have been several cases \nof BSE found in Canada. The one case of BSE found in the United States \nwas a Canadian cow, recently imported from Canada. So we are rightfully \na little concerned. We are concerned because we want to make sure that \nthe beef produced in both the United States and Canada meets the \nhighest standards.\n  We have pretty good standards in the United States now to protect \nagainst BSE. Probably the best evidence is, to my knowledge, no BSE has \nbeen reported south of the border in Native American cattle. I think \nthere are four cases involving Canadian cattle.\n  The Canadians are clearly concerned about their production; they are \nclearly concerned about their consumers. The Canadian people want the \nvery best beef. They think their beef is the best beef in the world, \njust like we think our beef is the best beef in the world. That is \nfine. Now is not the time to open the border. We have too many \nquestions that are not yet answered.\n  One is the new science, new research is going on with BSE which USDA \nis not incorporating at all in its final rule; that is, the rule that \nis the subject of this resolution. Even with that, we know that our \nbeef is safe. There is no BSE found in the United States, but it \nprobably makes sense for that new research to be incorporated in the \nfinal rule so we are all better assured we have the best beef that we \nwant our consumers to have.\n  This is also important with respect to one of our major trading \npartners, and that is Japan. About 10 percent of American beef \nproduction is exported overseas. About 37 percent of those exports \ngenerally go to Japan. But Japan just said, no, and they closed their \nborders to American beef. It is because of that Canadian cow which had \nBSE that was found in the United States.\n  Many times many of us have been over to Japan talking with the \nJapanese, saying our beef is safe; there is no BSE reported in United \nStates cows. Because BSE has been discovered in Japan in the last \nseveral years, the Japanese are very sensitive to the dangers, the \nhideous dangers of BSE.\n  I ask the USDA to withdraw this rule. I ask the USDA to make the best \nuse of the new research that is available. There is an evidentiary \nhearing coming up soon because a judge in Montana ruled the border \nshould be closed. With regard to that investigative hearing the judge \nhas ordered, now is the time to take a long hard look at this issue and \nto be transparent, to open up to the public, open up to cattle \nproducers, open up to beef packers who have been denied thus far the \napplication of their comments as the Department makes its final \ndetermination.\n  Now is just not the time. I hope there will be a later time. Now is \nnot it.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of S.J. Res. 4, \nwhich invokes the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's minimal risk rule. I wanted to explain to \nmy colleagues and my constituents my reason for doing so.\n  I understand that the use of the Congressional Review Act is rare. \nCongress has successfully used it only once in 2001, and its use should \nnot be undertaken lightly. The Congressional Review Act permitting \nthese rule disapproval resolutions became law in 1996. Although I \nunderstand from floor debate today the President intends to veto this \nresolution if it reaches his desk, if the Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Conrad, were successful, the result of his actions would be to \noverturn the minimal risk rule and prohibit USDA from issuing another \nsimilar rule unless Congress authorizes the agency to act.\n  I believe adopting this rule at this time is not the right action for \nour Nation's consumers and our country's beef industry. As Secretary \nJohanns stated during his confirmation hearing, reestablishing trade to \nJapan and other countries is our No. 1 priority. This goal will only be \nachieved when we prove that we have implemented and enforced dependable \nBSE firewalls.\n  Though Canada may have taken action to eliminate some loopholes in \nits feed ban, and is considering additional rules to ban specialized \nrisk materials or SRMs from animal feed, we should not open our borders \nuntil these additional firewalls are in place. And we should be doing \nmore to ensure that our feed is not contaminated by similar loopholes \nin the United States.\n  Existing loopholes in the 1997 ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban continue \nto\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\npose a risk that ruminant materials may find their way into cattle \nfeed.\n  Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration promised to close \nthese loopholes and stated that it had reached a preliminary conclusion \nlast July to remove SRM from all animal feed, the agency has failed to \nact.\n  Therefore, to address this issue, I have introduced legislation \nentitled the Animal Feed Protection Act of 2005, S.73, which would ban \nSRMs from being used in any animal feed. This would eliminate the \npossibility that ruminant materials are knowingly or accidentally fed \nto cattle.\n  Banning SRMs from all animal feed is an important step we can take to \nfully ensure the safety of ruminant feed, and I hope that the Senate's \nvote today will encourage our Government and the Canadian Government to \nact more swiftly on this issue.\n  Some will argue that I should be convinced by the report APHIS \nreleased at the end of February stating that Canada's feed ban \ncompliance is good. I am not convinced.\n  On January 24, 2005, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, sent a team of technical \nexperts to Canada to assess Canada's current feed ban and feed \ninspection program. The APHIS investigation was initiated in response \nto Canada's latest case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, which \ncame just days after the USDA published its ``Minimal Risk Rule'' in \nthe Federal Register on January 4, 2005.\n  The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the \ncontrol measures put in place by the Canadian Government are achieving \ncompliance with regard to these regulations. This was a serious \ninvestigation. Canada's latest BSE case, reported on January 11, 2005, \nwas particularly alarming because it was discovered in a cow under 7 \nyears of age and was thus born after implementation of the 1997 \nruminant-to-ruminant feed ban.\n  On January 12, 2005, I sent a letter to Secretary Veneman and then-\nGovernor Johanns, requesting that the audit being conducted by APHIS \ninspectors be given time for a full and fair analysis. The final APHIS \nreport of last week largely repeats information USDA released as part \nof its risk assessment supporting the minimal risk rule in January. \nThis Senator asked for a full look, if 2 weeks of Canadian inspections \nyielded compelling evidence that the Canadian feed ban was being fully \nenforced, this report misses the mark.\n  I strongly believe that all consumers deserve reassurance that \nCanadian rendering facilities, feed mills, and ranchers are in \ncompliance with Canada's feed regulations. As you know, the ruminant \nfeed ban has been determined to be arguably the most important BSE risk \nmitigation measure to protect animal health.\n  The APHIS report states that ``Canada has a robust inspection \nprogram, that overall compliance with the feed ban is good and that the \nfeed ban is reducing the risk of transmission of bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy in the Canadian cattle population.''\n  It is not clear what ``good'' compliance means. We must provide our \ntrading partners, such as Japan and South Korea, stronger assurances \nthan those provided in this APHIS report.\n  We must provide them proof that we have done everything possible to \ncontrol and eradicate this deadly disease as we work to reestablish the \ntrust of their consumers and access to their markets.\n  It is very important that USDA systematically evaluate all possible \nrisks before reopening the border to Canadian cattle. I do not believe \nthat USDA has completed this level of evaluation.\n  Therefore, I will be asking the National Academy of Sciences to \nreview the APHIS findings. They should assess whether every aspect \ncritical to evaluating feed regulations and compliance has been \naddressed in this report or if additional analyses and inspections are \nneeded.\n  The American public must be assured that Canadian cattle will not \nincrease the risk of BSE in the U.S. Until the American public has been \nassured, beyond a shadow of doubt, that the Canadians are in full \ncompliance with feed regulations it is prudent that we delay moving \nforward on reopening the border until this assurance has been made.\n  The question of what will be best for the U.S. beef industry with \nrespect to reopening the border to Canada is complex. And deciding how \nbest to proceed is not an easy decision to make or an easy step to \ntake.\n  Segments of the U.S. beef industry are clearly divided on this issue \nand not in agreement regarding what is best for the future of the U.S. \nbeef industry. This is due in most part because this rule has affected \nindustry segments in vastly different ways.\n  Although some regions of the U.S. have been hit harder than others, I \nknow we all agree that as a nation, reestablishing the export markets \nand international market share that the U.S. beef industry once held, \nis our No. 1 priority. With that common goal in mind, we must use basic \ncommon sense and delay going forward with the implementation of this \nrule at this time.\n  Therefore, in the interest of reestablishing the trust of our trading \npartners and preserving the confidence of the American people, I will \nbe voting in favor of this resolution and would urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the resolution of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota disapproving the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nminimal risk rule allowing expanded trade in cattle and beef products \nfrom Canada. I take this opportunity to explain my reasons for doing \nso.\n  It is critical we restore beef and cattle trade with our trading \npartners, but we must do it right. Unfortunately, USDA's rule is flawed \nin several respects that need to be addressed. To the credit of our new \nSecretary of Agriculture, he swiftly recognized at least one of these \nsignificant shortcomings, and delayed USDA's proposal to allow shipment \nof Canadian beef from cattle over 30 months of age into the United \nStates. USDA's ill-considered approach would have resulted in \nsignificant economic hardships for many U.S. beef packers, particularly \nthose that slaughter culled dairy cows as their primary business. \nSecretary Johanns recognized this, and I commend him for his quick \nresponse.\n  Further recognizing the shortcomings of USDA's rule, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Montana has granted the Ranchers-\nCattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America's, R-CALF, \nrequest for a preliminary injunction barring USDA's minimal risk rule \nfrom taking effect. This is the second time that USDA has lost in court \non this issue.\n  While we still await the judge's rationale for this decision, I \nbelieve the unfortunate reality is that USDA has largely dug its own \nhole by failing to follow U.S. legal procedure and scientific \nguidelines in its rule for further reopening U.S. markets to Canadian \ncattle and beef. Sadly, it is U.S. producers and processors that bear \nthe brunt of USDA's failings.\n  I have been concerned that USDA's final minimal risk rule strays from \nthe World Animal Health Organization's--OIE--scientific guidelines in \nimportant respects. Specifically, USDA has crafted minimal risk \ncriteria that are weaker than OIE standards specify. For instance, \nUSDA's rule does not spell out what is required to have an effective \nruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, an effective BSE surveillance plan, or \nrequire a compulsory reporting and investigation system. In fact, USDA \nseems to have purposefully dropped elements of the OIE guidelines that \nmight have required the United States to classify Canada as a moderate \nrisk country for BSE instead of minimal risk.\n  At a hearing of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \non these issues, USDA attempted to explain these discrepancies by \nstating that there are redundancies among the several types of measures \nagainst BSE, and therefore if a country is weaker in one measure it \nmight compensate in another measure. However, in the case of Canada, \nUSDA has failed to set forth what measures Canada might be stronger in \nthat warrant allowing slippage in others.\n  I am fully aware that these concerns about Canada are relevant to our \nsystems here in the United States for preventing and detecting the \nincidence of BSE. Since we first discovered BSE in this country, I have \nquestioned the efficacy of both our restrictions on feeding ruminant \nbyproducts and our BSE surveillance plan. I do not believe\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nthere are grave problems that threaten human health, but I do believe \nthere are areas where we need improvement, such as enforcement of our \nfeed rules and the effectiveness of our surveillance efforts.\n  Ultimately, we need to come to a common agreement with our beef and \ncattle trading partners regarding an acceptable framework for \nclassifying a country's risk of BSE. If USDA designates a minimal risk \nregion for trading that does not stand up to the scientific principles \nthat are established by OIE, we will hinder those efforts to reopen \nmarkets.\n  It is a sadly ironic footnote to this debate that, were USDA to \ncorrect the deficiencies in its rule, it would not prevent any of the \nCanadian cattle or beef products that USDA has proposed to allow from \nentering the United States. It would simply necessitate that some \nadditional safeguards be put into place.\n  Unfortunately, USDA has turned a deaf ear to these valid concerns \nabout the rule, and that is why we find ourselves here today. I hope \nUSDA is listening to today's debate and will take these concerns more \nseriously. Our objective today is not to shut down trade indefinitely \nbut, rather, to obtain the needed changes in the rule to facilitate the \nrestoration of safe trade in cattle and beef products with countries \nthat have experienced BSE. And that includes reopening now-closed \nmarkets for U.S. beef exports.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me be very clear about this. I feel \npassionately about competition and concentration-based issues.\n  Last Congress I introduced the Packer Ban, the Transparency Act, \nwhich requires packers to purchase pigs and cattle for slaughter from \nthe cash market daily, the 20-10 bill, which limits any packer which \nowns more than 20 million head of pigs to slaughtering less than 10 \nmillion vertically integrated pigs, and a bill to eliminate mandatory \narbitration clauses from production contracts, similar to legislation \nwe passed for car dealers.\n  I feel strongly that we need to empower producers through legislation \nbased on leveling the playing field, but this resolution is not how we \nshould accomplish that goal.\n  By supporting this resolution we are taking a protectionist position \ninstead of encouraging free trade. We might delay the importation of \n900,000 feeders, but ultimately we are potentially putting our entire \nexport market at risk, including the Japanese market.\n  In the world we lead by example, and if our example is tied to the \nprecautionary nature of this resolution, expect the world to \npotentially follow suit.\n  The decision by USDA to re-open the border has been construed as a \n``rush to judgment''. That could not be further from the truth.\n  The truth of the matter is that we have an obligation to look at the \nscience of the issue and if the science dictates, we should re-open the \nborder. That is where we are today. If someone this morning can \ndemonstrate to me that the science USDA has relied on is faulty, I \nwould be the first person to say we should not move forward, but \nscience must dictate our course, not political will.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 4 that \nwould disapprove the administration's regulations that would \nreestablish trade with Canada for live cattle under 30 months of age.\n  As a doctor, I fully appreciate our responsibility to protect the \nAmerican public's health and safety by making sure our food supply is \nsecure.\n  At the outset of the bovine spongiform encephalophathy, BSE, scare in \nDecember 2003, the former Secretary of Agriculture Ann Venaman worked \ntirelessly to address this public health concern. That work has \ncontinued under the new Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns.\n  Based on the information I have seen, I believe multiple safeguards \nare in place today both in Canada and the United States to protect \nhuman and animal health. Based on a U.S. investigative team that has \nexamined Canada's compliance with a feed ban, based on a strong \nCanadian surveillance system testing cattle most likely to have had \nBSE, and, based on a ban on cattle imports into Canada from countries \nthat have had widespread BSE, all reasonable efforts appear to have \nbeen taken at this time to minimize the risk of Canadian beef imports \ninto the United States.\n  Sound science must be a basis to governing our trade relations around \nthe globe. I believe that such science has been applied here and that \nthe administration's regulations on Canadian beef import should \nproceed.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Colorado 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, questions were raised earlier about the \naccuracy of dentition; in other words, looking at the eruption of teeth \nto identify when the animal is 30 months old. That is pretty exact \nscience. It is very reliable; not to say maybe one or two cows will \nslip through that are off a month or two. That is why the 30-month \nperiod was selected, because this is a disease of slow onset, and when \nthey are under 30 months, we ordinarily do not have to worry about \nthem.\n  Let us suppose somebody has some concerns about an animal that may be \ninfected with BSE coming across a border. What happens is there are \ncertain rules and regulations where one transfers from Canadian \nregulation over to American regulation. We only have certain points of \nentry into the United States, and when that animal comes into the \nUnited States, it is very adequately marked. They have ear tags and \nthey are branded so that if something should happen to the ear tags, \nthey still have the brand on the animal.\n  The only thing that can happen to that animal is it moves into an \napproved feedlot, it is isolated in that feedlot, for the purpose of \nslaughter. So that animal then is processed for slaughter. In the \nprocessing procedure, all of the central nervous system tissue--the \nbrain, spinal cord--is discarded. It is not used for consumption. If \nthere is a temperature on that animal, it is not slaughtered.\n  So when one takes into consideration the final steps of the process, \nthey can understand I do not hesitate to suggest that people ought to \neat beef. Our beef is safe and the beef processed in this country is \nsafe.\n  I have a letter dated March 3. It was sent to me and is from Jim \nMcAdams, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. He \nstates flatly that this resolution should be opposed for the following \nreasons, and he gives six reasons. He says this resolution should be \nopposed and in its place would urge the Senate to support an effort to \nopen the Japanese, South Korean, and additional markets for U.S. cattle \nproducers.\n  I thank those 19 Senators who joined me in writing a letter to the \nJapanese Ambassador to open their markets to American beef.\n  Mr. McAdams states that the failure to open these markets has cost \nthe U.S. cattle producers $175 per head and a cumulative loss of nearly \n$5 billion in income. We need the full attention of the Senate to act \non this issue, not to act to block science-based trade policies.\n  Then No. 2 states:\n\n       The resolution supports blocking a science and risk-based \n     analysis and phasing in opening of the Canadian borders. This \n     action does meet the real needs of U.S. cattle producers, as \n     it will give excuses for other countries to block our \n     exports.\n\n  Point No. 3 in the letter opposing the resolution:\n\n       The resolution should be opposed and in its place, we urge \n     the Senate to support action to ensure the Canadian \n     government eliminates their blue tongue and anaplasmosis \n     trade barriers for all classes of U.S. cattle exports to \n     Canada.\n\n  Think about that.\n\n       The resolution will allow maintaining the status quo with \n     Canada further accelerating the shift of the packing, \n     processing capacity, and jobs from the U.S. to Canada, and \n     hurting U.S. cattle producers.\n       The resolution ignores the fact that beef is safe. Analysis \n     of the reports by industry and government clearly indicate \n     that Canada, just like the U.S., has taken the necessary \n     steps to ensure that their beef is safe. This\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\n     resolution perpetuates fear mongering over nonexistent safety \n     concerns and misrepresents well-documented science doing a \n     disservice to the cattle industry and U.S. consumers.\n       The USDA has already addressed prior producer concerns of \n     this rule, to the extent that USDA has withdrawn the section \n     of the final rule regarding beef from animals over thirty \n     months.\n       We urge you to vote NO on this resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the issue before this body is as clear as \nit can be. This is going to be a consequential vote, make no mistake \nabout it. This may be a vote that Members look back on and, if they \nvote against this resolution, they may deeply regret that in the \nfuture, because if, God forbid, additional mad cow cases come in from \nCanada, and that awful disease spreads in America, the consequences to \nthis country could be enormous.\n  We all know what happened in Europe. It is not a matter of \nspeculation. In England, 146 people died. Nearly 5 million head were \nslaughtered in England alone.\n  Let us connect the dots. In Canada, we know there are four confirmed \ncases of mad cow disease from cattle raised in that country. In \naddition, there is one case of a confirmed BSE positive cow, mad cow, \nthat was imported from England. That is five cases. The most recent was \na cow born after Canada supposedly put in the protections. The \nCanadians' own inspection service found that in 59 percent of the cases \nwhere they tested, animal matter was found where it was not supposed to \nbe. That is what heightens the risk of mad cow disease.\n  Some of those cases, in fairness, have now been resolved. Seventeen \npercent of the cases have not been. In Canada, there are 25,000 feed-\nproducing entities on farms. They produce half of all the feed in \nCanada. Only 3 percent have been checked in the last 3 years. There are \nfour known cases of mad cow in Canada. There should be no rush to open \nthis border in the face of that evidence. The risk to this country, the \nrisk to human life, and the risk to this industry is simply too great.\n  My colleague talks about the National Cattlemen's position. This is \nwhat they have said with respect to opening the border. They said there \nare 11 conditions that should be met, and 8 of them have clearly not \nbeen met. I do not know if they have changed their position \nsubsequently, but this is what they outlined, and 8 of these 11 \npositions have not been met.\n  In my own State, the cattlemen have told me to go forward with this \nresolution. My own State legislature, overwhelmingly Republican, has \noverwhelmingly approved a resolution asking us to keep this border \nclosed until we can have greater confidence that Canada is enforcing \ntheir own regulations.\n  This is a consequential vote. The potential risk to this country is \nenormous. Anybody who is betting that Canada is enforcing their \nregulations is making a bet that I do not think stands much scrutiny.\n  I will end as I began, at least in this part of the debate. When the \nCanadian media used the Information Act in their country to look at \nwhat the Canadian testing authority themselves had found, they looked \nat 70 tests conducted by the Canadian agency, and they found in 59 \npercent of the cases, animal matter was present where it was not \nsupposed to be. This is a risk that is not worth taking. The \nconsequences could be far too grave for the American people and the \nAmerican economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nas in morning business and that Senator Dole be recognized for 5 \nminutes, Senator Martinez for 5 minutes, Senator Allard for 3 minutes, \nand myself for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Dole, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Allard \nare printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                       order of procedure--s. 256\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nin relation to the Dayton and Nelson amendments, which were to follow \nimmediately after the vote on S.J. Res. 4, now be set to occur at 2 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I further ask unanimous consent that at 12:50 the \nSenate proceed to a vote on adoption of the pending resolution with the \ntime equally divided between Senators Chambliss and Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I may very briefly sum up, I hope my \ncolleagues will give careful consideration to this vote. This vote \nwould disapprove the ruling from the USDA that the border with Canada \nshould be opened on March 7.\n  I say respectfully that this runs a risk which we should not take. It \nis very clear from all of the evidence that Canada is not enforcing the \nregulations upon which USDA relied in recommending that the border be \nopened. The consequences to our country could be serious and dramatic.\n  Let me close by reminding my colleagues that when mad cow disease got \nloose in England, 146 people died, and nearly 5 million head of \nlivestock were slaughtered. We cannot and we should not run the risk of \nprematurely opening our border when we know there are four confirmed \ncases of mad cow disease in Canada, and when we know from the \nCanadians' own inspection service that in nearly 60 percent of the \ncases, animal matter was found where it should not have been.\n  This is a consequential vote. I hope my colleagues will take it \nseriously. We ought to at least buy time until further investigations \nare made to assure us that the risk of mad cow disease coming into this \ncountry has been reduced in as significant a way as is possible.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, again I thank my colleague from North \nDakota for bringing up this issue. I know it is of critical importance, \nas do a number of Members of this body. But I must remind folks that as \nwe have gone through the debate here today, we have heard time and time \nagain from those who are opposed to this resolution that this is an \nissue not of emotion but an issue of sound science. All of the sound \nscience says that the Secretary of Agriculture has made the correct \ndecision and that the border should be opened with Canada for the \nimportation of beef and cattle under 30 months of age.\n  I want to remind our folks, too, that as you think about how you are \ngoing to vote, know and understand that once again the checks and \nbalances system we have in our Constitution is at work on this issue. \nThere was a court decision yesterday. A temporary restraining order was \nissued relative to the further reopening of the border on Monday. That \ndecision will be decided on the merits after a full hearing from both \nsides. In this body we have heard contradictory statements. There an \nimpartial judge will make a decision based upon his findings relative \nto the facts in the case.\n  This is not a health issue. It is not a health risk to human beings \nif the border is reopened. This is an issue of animal safety. It should \nbe based upon sound science.\n  Let me read two things.\n  First of all, I have a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture dated \nMarch 3, 2005, and I want to read two sentences from the letter.\n  First, the Secretary says:\n\n       If Canadian beef and cattle posed a risk to U.S. human or \n     animal health, USDA would never have proposed reopening the \n     border. Science must be the touchstone governing our trade \n     relations and guiding our actions.\n\n  Continued closure of the Canadian border is not justified by the best \nscientific understanding of BSE risks.\n  Lastly, let me read a Statement of Administration Policy dated March \n3, 2005, from the Executive Office of the President of the United \nStates, Office of Management and Budget, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. \n     Res. 4, a resolution to disapprove the rule submitted by the \n     United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) with respect \n     to establishing minimal risk regions and reopening the \n     Canadian border for beef and cattle imports. USDA's rule is \n     the product of a multi-year, deliberative, transparent, and \n     science-based process to ensure that human and animal health \n     are fully protected. S.J. Res. 4, which would prevent the \n     reopening of our Canadian border, would cause continued \n     serious economic disruption of the U.S. beef and cattle \n     industry, undermine U.S. efforts to ensure that international \n     trade standards are based on science, and impede ongoing U.S. \n     efforts to reopen foreign markets now closed to U.S. beef \n     exports. If S.J. Res. 4 were presented to the President, he \n     would veto the bill.\n\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 56 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say quickly in response, no court can \nrelieve the responsibilities of this vote from our Members. Every \nMember is going to be responsible for the vote we cast. When my \ncolleague says this is not a health issue, I respectfully disagree. \nThis is profoundly a health issue. If mad cow disease is ever unleashed \nin this country, God forbid, we will find out what an acute health \nissue it is.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. It is the prudent, \ncareful, and cautious thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 19 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Feingold\n     Inouye\n      \n  The joint resolution (S.J.

The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton. Basically, he \nhas offered an amendment to create a Federal usury law. While I \nunderstand and appreciate the good intentions of my colleague, I cannot \nsupport what amounts to Federal price controls. This is a mode of \nregulation from a bygone day.\n  Price controls are a failed experiment that often hurt those who they \nare intended to help. Even if the price control envisioned in this \namendment was never triggered, it would set a very bad precedent.\n  Credit underwriting is the assessment of the risk. Interest rates are \nintended to reflect the risk of a particular credit. They have to.\n  While I appreciate my colleague's concerns, I fear that his amendment \nwill result in credit becoming less accessible to more Americans. \nMarket forces are the best regulator of prices. As chairman of the \nBanking Committee, which has jurisdiction over consumer credit and \nprice controls, I must oppose this amendment and encourage my \ncolleagues to do so. We are going to have some hearings on similar \nmatters in the Banking Committee, and I hope Senator Dayton would work \nwith us in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to underscore the statement just \nmade by the chairman of the Banking Committee. This issue embraced in \nthis amendment is very far-reaching. There have been no hearings on it. \nThe chairman has indicated he intends to do some hearings on issues \nrelating to the matter that is before us. It does not seem to me to be \na wise or prudent course to consider what would, in effect, be a very \nmajor legislative step in the absence of appropriate consideration by \nthe committee of jurisdiction; therefore, I intend to also oppose this \namendment, primarily on those grounds.\n  The substance is a complicated issue, and in any event it is very \nclear it needs to be very carefully examined and considered. I do not \nthink that has occurred in this instance, and I hope my colleagues \nwould perceive the matter in the same way.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 44\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide for \n                an increase in the Federal minimum wage)\n\n        At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                     TITLE __--FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE\n\n     SEC. __01.

Mr. President, this amendment will increase the minimum \nwage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour over roughly a 2-year period. \nMy friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, will offer his own \nminimum wage amendment, and he will do so later on in the afternoon. We \nintend to debate this and vote on it, subject to the agreements of the \nleaders, probably late Monday afternoon, and we will take the \nopportunity during Monday afternoon to get into greater details. Both \nSenator Santorum and I have agreed that we would each make a brief \npresentation on this item at this time.\n  We have not seen an increase in the minimum wage for 8 years. At the \npresent time, the minimum wage has fallen to the second lowest level in \nthe last 45 years. Since 1938, the minimum wage has been increased on \neight different occasions. On most of those occasions it has been with \nbipartisan support. Republicans have recognized that we ought to treat \npeople fairly and decently, and those at the lower level of the \neconomic ladder ought to be able to have a livable wage. President \nEisenhower felt that way, President Ford felt that way, and the first \nPresident Bush felt that way. We are asking the Senate to join us in \ngoing back to having the minimum wage at least increase to a reasonable \nlevel.\n  Now, who are the minimum wage earners? The minimum wage earners are \nmen and women of dignity. Even though they get paid at a minimum wage, \nthey work hard, they take a sense of pride in what they achieve, and \nthey do a hard day's work. More often than not, they not only have one \njob, but they have two jobs and sometimes even three jobs.\n  What sort of jobs do the minimum wage workers have? First, many of \nthem are teachers' aides in our school systems, working with the young \nstudents of America. Many others are working in our nursing homes, \nlooking after the parents who were part of the ``greatest generation,'' \nmen and women who sacrificed for their own children, men and women who \nbrought this country through the Great Depression. These are men and \nwomen of dignity who take a sense of pride in their work.\n  Beyond that, who are they? This is basically a women's issue because \nthe great majority of the millions of people who would benefit from \nthis minimum wage increase are women. It is a children's issue because \na one-third of those women have children. So it is a women's issue and \nit is a children's issue. It is also a civil rights issue because many \nwho earn the minimum wage are men and women of color. So it is a family \nissue, a women's issue, a children's issue, a civil rights issue, and, \nmost of all, it is a fairness issue. Americans understand fairness. \nWhat they understand is anyone who will work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks \nof the year, should not have to live in poverty in the United States of \nAmerica. That is what this issue is all about. That is what the vote \nwill be on, on Monday next, whether we are going to say to millions of \nour fellow citizens that they will not have to live in poverty, \nalthough they will still be earning below the poverty rate.\n\n  What the amendment will do is the following. It is the equivalent of \n2 years of childcare. It will provide full tuition for a child in a \ncommunity college, or a year-and-a-half of heat and electricity, or \nmore than a year of groceries, or more than 9 months of rent.\n  This might not sound like very much to the Members of this body who \nhave seen their pay increase seven times since we have last increased \nthe minimum wage. But we ought to be able to say here and now that we \nwill join the traditions of an Eisenhower, a Ford, and the first \nPresident Bush, Democrat and Republican Presidents alike, and say those \nworking Americans who work at some of toughest and most difficult jobs, \nmen and women of pride and dignity, ought to be paid a fair wage. That \nis what this amendment is about. We look forward to a further debate \nwhen we have the opportunity to do so on Monday next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending amendments to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The amendment is at the desk. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 42.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To limit the exemption for asset protection trusts)\n\n        On page 205, between lines 16 and 17, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 332. ASSET PROTECTION TRUSTS.\n\n       Section 548 of title 11, United States Code, as amended by \n     this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(e) The trustee may avoid a transfer of an interest of \n     the debtor in property made by an individual debtor within 10 \n     years before the date of the filing of the petition to an \n     asset protection trust if the amount of the transfer or the \n     aggregate amount of all transfers to the trust or to similar \n     trusts within such 10-year period exceeds $125,000, to the \n     extent that debtor has a beneficial interest in the trust and \n     the debtor's beneficial interest in the trust does not become \n     property of the estate by reason of section 541(c)(2). For \n     purposes of this subsection, a fund or account of the kind \n     specified in section 522(d)(12) is not an asset protection \n     trust.''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. This amendment \ncloses the so-called millionaires loophole. If any of you happened to \nread yesterday's New York Times, there is in existing law a hidden \nloophole which basically says if you are a millionaire and want to file \na certain trust in one of five States, you can hide all your money even \nthough you declare bankruptcy. So the irony is, in this bill, while we \nare talking about people who make $35,000 or $40,000 or $45,000 and we \nwant to make sure they do not abuse bankruptcy, the law allows this \nabuse of bankruptcy.\n  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which I \nam introducing along with my colleagues Senators Durbin, Feinstein, and \nBingaman, and I believe Senator Clinton as well, will close this \nloophole.\n  You do not have to be a resident of these five States, but you can be \na millionaire or billionaire and stash away assets: mansions, racing \ncars, yachts, investments, in a special trust, and you can hold onto \nthat windfall after bankruptcy. That is not fair. We will debate the \namendment later this afternoon. I want to notify my colleagues and \nplace it in order on the floor.\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\n  The amendment has been read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is now in order so I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One of the concerns many of us had in this bill is the \ninterest of fairness. I think fairness ought to be standard for any \npiece of legislation. As it is currently before us, we will have those \nwho will be able, with their homestead exemption, to preserve \nhomesteads valued at millions and millions of dollars and, on the other \nside, individuals will lose completely all of their savings because \nthey will lose their homes. There is no fairness there.\n  The Senator from New York is pointing out in another area the issue \nof fairness. Those who have resources and have wealth and have the \ncontacts will be able to shelter their resources while basically \nmiddle-income working families, the working poor who are trying to get \nby and have seen an explosion of different costs, on housing, on health \ncare, on tuition, will be buried.\n  This will be another dramatic example where those who have it will be \nable to preserve it and those who have been struggling will lose it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. He is exactly on point. It is \noutrageous that someone worth millions or billions of dollars can \ndeclare bankruptcy and then shield their assets in this trust so they \ndo not come before the bankruptcy court. The Senator, my friend from \nMassachusetts, is exactly right; we are talking about people who make \n$45,000 and we are going after them, yet we are allowing millionaires \nand billionaires to use this loophole. Of course, it is not all \nmillionaires and billionaires, it is a small number who go into \nbankruptcy and who abuse it. We can close it. We will debate this \namendment later this afternoon, but let us hope that we do not have a \nlockstep, let's vote ``no'' on everything. It would be hypocritical to \nsay we have to close abuses on middle-income people and not close \nabuses on the very wealthy.\n  I will be happy to continue to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will ask a final question. A third of all the \nbankruptcies are among those who are earning below the poverty line. \nDoes the Senator think they will be able to take advantage of this \nloophole?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would say to my colleague from Massachusetts, they \ncan't even afford the lawyer to write the first page of the trust that \nthese others can. Again, the question answers itself. What is good for \nthe goose is good for the gander. What is good for someone below the \npoverty line certainly ought to be good for millionaires and \nbillionaires who want to abuse the bankruptcy process.\n  I yield the floor in deference to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 44\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I understand I only have a couple of \nminutes, so I will be very brief. I want to speak on the issue of \nminimum wage. I know the Senator from Massachusetts has offered this \namendment on the minimum wage to this package. I will be opposing the \nKennedy amendment and will be offering an alternate to this amendment. \nBut let me explain first why I oppose the Kennedy amendment.\n  First, it doesn't belong on this bill. Even the amendment I will \noffer as an alternative does not belong on the bill. I have spoken to \nSenator Kennedy and others about what I believe is the appropriate \nplace for this discussion. That is the welfare reform bill. It will be \na bill that will come here and have a lot of amendments and it focuses \non how we help those who are transitioning from welfare to work, how we \nhelp them and give them the support they need to be able to have work \nthat pays well enough for them to get out of poverty. I think this \ndiscussion fits best, and I would argue has the better chance of \nactually ending up in a final bill and being sent to the President, on \nthe welfare bill as opposed to here, which I think everyone recognizes \nis a bill that has been worked on for years and years and years.\n  We have a bill that has bipartisan support, with the hope of trying \nto get this to the President at a propitious time. So I would make the \nargument, No. 1, first and foremost I would oppose the Kennedy \namendment on that ground.\n  Second, I suggest----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question on that part?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I only have about 1 minute and I am happy to yield to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for a brief question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I offered the amendment on the TANF bill last year and \nthe bill was pulled because it was offered as an amendment. So that is \npart of our frustration.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I respect the Senator from Massachusetts. I think there \nis a little different environment. I think there is a broad group who \nwill deal with the reauthorization of welfare and deal with that and \nget a bill passed and sent to Congress this year, and you will \ncertainly have my support trying to get that done in a fashion that I \nbelieve reinstates work requirements, which have fallen off because of \nthe drop in the welfare rolls across America.\n  The second reason I oppose the Kennedy amendment is because the \nincrease is too dramatic at this point. We are talking about an over $2 \nincrease, over a 40-percent increase in the minimum wage. While I do \nsupport a modest proposal, something about half that amount, I think \nthat is the wise thing to do in this economy, which is not to put a \njolt of that nature into what is already a concern about inflation. To \nbe able to put that kind of minimum wage increase in I think would fuel \ninflationary fears. It would have strong negative repercussions in our \neconomy, broadly.\n  While I do understand the need now that it has been almost 8 years \nwithout a minimum wage increase, I think what I will be offering is a \nmodest one that comports with and will fit within this economy. We do \nsome things to address the issue of small businesses, which the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts does not do.\n  We don't want to disproportionally affect those poor communities, or \nhurt the small business neighborhood store or cleaners or whatever the \ncase may be that is trying to make ends meet by putting this kind of \nincreased cost on them as high as the Kennedy amendment would be, or \neven as high as what I would suggest, without some sort of relief to \ncompensate very small businesses. I think that would be unwise and it \nwould hurt the community. We want to help by providing more resources. \nIncreasing the minimum wage does not help those small businesses in \nthat community. I think it would have a bad, overall negative effect on \nthe very poor communities of our society.\n  I see my time is up. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2 p.m. \nhaving arrived, there will be 4 minutes equally divided on debate in \nrelation to amendment No. 31.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this legislation is entitled ``The \nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act.'' \nUnfortunately, there is actually very little consumer protection in it.\n  My amendment would add some much needed consumer protections to the \nbill and end one of the principal abuses that drives people into \nbankruptcy--exorbitant interest rates.\n  My amendment would limit the maximum annual interest rate that could \nbe charged to any consumer by any creditor to 30 percent. Thirty \npercent is still a very high interest rate--far too high, in my view.\n  Inflation is currently running around 2 percent. The interest rate on \n3-month Treasury bills is 2.75 percent. The prime lending rate is 5.5 \npercent. So 30 percent is exorbitantly high, but it is much less than \nthe 384 percent that is being charged by money centers in Minnesota, or \nthe 535-percent annual interest rate charged by centers in Wisconsin, \nor the 1,095-percent interest rate being charged by the County Bank of \nRehoboth Beach in Delaware. That is not just predatory lending, that is \n``terroristic'' lending.\n  My amendment would apply to any rate of interest charged by any \ncreditor to any borrower for any purpose. However, it would not preempt \nany State,\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nlocal, or private restriction that imposes a lower rate of interest.\n  For example, 21 States, which include my home State of Minnesota, cap \ninterest rates for credit cards. Minnesota's ceiling is 18 percent. \nThat would still apply. Yet when money centers operate in Minnesota at \n384 percent interest, that limit would be 30 percent.\n  Again, under my amendment, whenever a creditor is limited to a lower \ninterest rate, that lower rate would apply. Whenever there is no \ninterest cap, or wherever that cap is higher than this amendment's 30-\npercent limit, then this 30-percent annual interest rate would apply.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It has the support of \nthe Consumer Federation of America, the National Association of \nConsumer Advocates, and the U.S. PIRG.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just say a few words about why this \namendment is not a good amendment and one that should be voted down.\n  This would cap the interest rate for consumer credit extensions at 30 \npercent in this country, and, frankly, would preempt many States' usury \nlaws unless the State has a lower interest rate.\n  In other words, preemption of State laws is something we sought to \navoid in this bill. We have refused to do so in the homestead \nprovisions, so there is no reason to touch the State usury laws as \nwell.\n  There is no dispute that lending agencies are already heavily \nregulated. We have already restricted usury rates on first-lien loans. \nAdditionally, special usury provisions in the National Bank Act and \nFederal Deposit Act preempt State usury laws for national State banks.\n  We did not preempt these State laws haphazardly as we would do today \nby passing the Dayton amendment.\n  I believe we should stick with the bill as written. We have taken \nthis into consideration. We have worked long and hard over 8 years to \nget this right. And, frankly, I think this amendment is an \ninappropriate amendment and should be voted down.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote it down.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 24, nays 74, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 20 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--24\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n\n                                NAYS--74\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Feingold\n     Inouye\n       \n  The amendment (No. 31) was rejected.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided for debate in relation to amendment No. 37.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is one exception the \nSenate should consider to this bankruptcy bill in filing bankruptcy, \nand that is when someone incurs debts due to no fault of their own. \nWhen someone incurs debts through no fault of their own because their \nidentity has been stolen and they are forced to go into bankruptcy, why \nshould we force them not to take chapter 7 in bankruptcy, instead to go \nthrough chapter 13?\n  If you don't think identity theft and bankruptcy therefrom is a \nproblem, look at the top consumer complaints of the Federal Trade \nCommission and notice 39 percent are identity theft. Don't think you \nare immune from identity theft. Did you hear the news on Friday night \nthat Bank of America has had the records of 1.2 million Federal \nemployees stolen, including 60 Senators in this Chamber? You are \npotential victims, including this Senator. I am on the list. So why \nshould we not hear the pleas of people all across the land?\n  A story from Florida where identity was stolen, they ran up $40,000. \nThey can't pay that off. Another case in New York, a friend stole \nidentity and ran up $300,000. The person had no choice but go into \nbankruptcy. Surely this is an example of an exception to this bill that \nwe should make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Nelson \namendment, although I commend the Senator from Florida in his work on \nthis issue of identity theft. This amendment is written so broadly, it \nactually invites fraud despite its well-intentioned purposes. I \nunderstand there will be several hearings on the issue of identity \ntheft, and I look forward to working with my friend from Florida and my \nother colleagues to find a solution. But for now, this is written so \nbroadly that I think it actually invites fraud. I hope my colleagues \nwill oppose the amendment because it would cause a lot of difficulty on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Does the Senator realize that in my amendment \nanyone who incurs less than $20,000 of debt as a result of identity \ntheft would not be eligible to become an exception under the bankruptcy \nbill?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do. But it is written so broadly that anybody who claims \nthey have been defrauded, whether they have or have not, qualifies \nunder your amendment. That is way too broad under this bill. I am happy \nto work with the distinguished Senator, and we will see what we can do \nlater in this Congress. I hope everybody will vote down this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n37.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I did not quite understand the last \nportion of the unanimous consent request. I understand Senator Byrd \nshall be recognized for 10 minutes, and then what transpires?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then we move to the Durbin amendment, with a vote at \n3:25.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is Senator Byrd will take 10 minutes. I \nhave no objection to the vote at 3:25, but I ask unanimous consent that \nthe request be modified and I be recognized following Senator Byrd's \ncomments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan be \nrecognized at the conclusion of Senator Byrd's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator \nMcConnell and also my own leadership for the kindness in arranging for \nme to speak at this time.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 515 and \nS. 514 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are dealing with the bankruptcy bill. I \nam going to send an amendment to the desk.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 45\n\n       (Purpose: To establish a special committee of the Senate to \n     investigate the awarding and carrying out of contracts to \n     conduct activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and to fight the \n     war on terrorism)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), for himself and \n     Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 45.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.''\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send that amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Durbin, who joins me as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The bankruptcy reform bill on the floor of the Senate today \nostensibly deals with the subject of those who would attempt to cheat \nwith respect to filing bankruptcy. We have had a lot of discussion on \nthe floor about the abuse of bankruptcy. There is no question about \nthat; there is some of that. It is called cheating. But there is \nanother form of cheating going on now to which very little attention is \npaid, and my amendment attempts to deal with it.\n  I am going to put up a chart that shows $2 million dollars on a \ntable, in a room somewhere in Iraq. These are Americans holding this \ncash. This cash is to be deposited in a plastic bag to pay contractors \nin Iraq. The contractors are told ``bring a bag and we will fill your \nbag with cash.'' That is the way you pay bills over there.\n  This particular picture was given to us by this gentleman here, who \nwas working in Iraq. He said it was like the Wild West; just bring your \nbag and fill it with cash.\n  His testimony, which we heard at a hearing of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, followed the testimony of others that we have received about \nthe massive waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting that has been going \nin Iraq. The American taxpayers are taking it on the chin, but none of \nthe authorizing committees of jurisdiction in the U.S. Senate are \nholding hearings about this.\n  Well, the Democratic Policy Committee has held some oversight \nhearings. The testimony at the hearings is absolutely devastating.\n  Halliburton charges for 42,000 meals to be served in a day to \nAmerican soldiers. It is determined, however, that the company is only \nserving 14,000 meals a day. So they are charging the taxpayer for \n42,000 meals to be served to soldiers when in fact they are only \nserving 14,000 meals.\n  We hear about the payment of $7,500 a month to lease SUV vehicles. We \nhear about the ordering of 50,000 pounds of nails, that turn out to be \nof the wrong size, and just get dumped by the side of the road. We hear \nabout $40 to $45 a case for soda pop.\n  A senior manager from the Defense Department, who used to be in \ncharge of providing fuel for vehicles in war zones, testified that \nHalliburton was charging $1 more per gallon for gasoline than they \nshould have. There are overcharges adding up to $61 million on that \nissue alone.\n  One fellow came to a DPC hearing and he held up towels. He worked for \na subsidiary of Halliburton. He ordered towels because the soldiers \nneeded the towels and they got a requisition order. Guess what. KBR, \nHalliburton's subsidiary, charged nearly double the cost of regular \ntowels because they insisted on having the KBR logo embroidered on the \ntowels. So the U.S. taxpayer gets soaked because the company wants \ntheir logo on the towels. It is extraordinary what is happening here, \nand nobody seems to care that much.\n  We heard of contractors that were driving $85,000 brand new trucks in \nthe country of Iraq, and whenever they had flat tires or a plugged fuel \nlines, they abandoned the vehicles and just bought new ones. The \nAmerican taxpayer is paying for all of that, and nobody seems to care.\n  Well, in the years of 1940 and 1941, Harry Truman, as we were about \nto enter World War II, got into his car and drove around this country \ntouring air bases and military installations. He came back and \nsuggested a special committee be impaneled in Congress. That committee \nbecame known as the Truman Committee, and was active for several years. \nThey saved, by today's accounts, somewhere close to $15 billion by \nexposing waste, fraud, and abuse. That was a Democratic Senator working \nat a time when there was a Democrat in the White House. He didn't care \nwhether anyone was embarrassed. On behalf of the American taxpayer, he \ninsisted that we get to the bottom of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I offer today an amendment that would establish a special bipartisan \ncommittee of the Senate on war, reconstruction, and contracting. Four \nmembers of the committee would be selected from the majority and three \nmembers from the minority. It would have subpoena power, and it would \nput a magnifying glass on the massive amounts of money being wasted, \nbeing abused, and in some cases simply being defrauded from the \nAmerican taxpayer. We owe it to the American taxpayers to do this.\n  We have pending right now before this body another request for $82 \nbillion. Most of that is to provide resources for the soldiers, not all \nof it but most of it. In addition to that, there is some $15 billion to \nthis yet unspent for the reconstruction of Iraq. That is American \ntaxpayers' money which is in the pipeline.\n  You hear about all of this waste, fraud, abuse, and the \nwhistleblowers, and then you ask, Who is minding the store? Who is \nlooking after all this?\n  Another witness testified at the hearing we held recently about a \ncompany\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\nthat went to Iraq. Two guys went to Iraq with no experience and no \nmoney. They just showed up. They wanted to be a contracting company. \nGuess what. They won a contract, all right. They had delivered to them \n$2 million in cash, and they were suddenly a security contractor at the \nairport. Then their employees turned whistleblowers on them. They said \nthe company was taking forklifts, repainting them, and selling them \nback, and setting up front companies offshore so they could buy and \nsell at overinflated charges. A couple of employees turned \nwhistleblowers and they were threatened to be killed for doing it. That \ncompany, I am told, got over $100 million in contracting in the country \nof Iraq.\n  One final point: Do you know that when the allegation was made that \nthis contractor was ripping off the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nwhich was a U.S. creation and represented us in Iraq, the U.S. Justice \nDepartment failed to intervene under the False Claims Act because they \nsaid defrauding the Coalition Provisional Authority is not the same as \ndefrauding the American taxpayer. There is something fundamentally \nwrong with that. This amendment would address that as well, by \nspecifying that the investigation called for in this amendment should \ninclude the Coalition Provisional Authority spending.\n  I have the amendment at the desk. I said I offered it on behalf of my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, and myself, and I hope others as we move \nalong. I understand this is not strictly a bankruptcy amendment, but we \nmust waste no more time to establish a committee by which there is real \noversight in the matter of contracting abuses that waste billions of \ndollars of the American taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Actually, the question will be very easy to answer. But for \nthe moment, I must say to the very distinguished Senator that this is \none Senator who is not at all surprised at what he found. I can \nremember when we had Mr. Bremer before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to be heard. I asked him, after a while during which he \ndelivered testimony and answered questions, if he would be able to \nremain or come back before the committee for some additional \nquestions--meaning the same day--if the chairman should ask him to do \nso. His answer was, ``I am too busy.''\n  I came back to our caucus on that day, and I believe he came to the \ncaucus at the same time. I told this to my caucus while Mr. Bremer was \nthere. It was a shocking thing to me--an individual claiming he is too \nbusy, and yet he is asking for quite a great amount of money to be \nappropriated, $2 billion.\n  I am not at all surprised at this. I believe as time goes on we will \nfind more and more of these kinds of stories. I congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator on the excellent work he is doing in bringing \nthese things to light.\n  Now the question: Will the distinguished Senator add me as a \ncosponsor to his amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I see the hour of 3:25 has arrived. I believe by a previous order we \nhave other business. I appreciate the opportunity to offer my \namendment, and hopefully we will have a vote on it at some point in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 38\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 22 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Feingold\n     Inouye\n      \n  The amendment (No. 38) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit the use of \n any information in any consumer report by any credit card issuer that \nis unrelated to the transactions and experience of the card issuer with \n   the consumer to increase the annual percentage rate applicable to \n        credit extended to the consumer, and for other purposes)\n\n        At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON USE OF CONSUMER REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 604(d) of the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681b(d)) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(d) Limitation on Use of Consumer Report.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A credit card issuer may not use any \n     negative information contained in a consumer report to \n     increase any annual percentage rate applicable to a credit \n     card account, or to remove or increase any introductory \n     annual percentage rate of interest applicable to such \n     account, for any reason other than an action or omission of \n     the card holder that is directly related to such account.\n       ``(2) Notice to consumer.--The limitation under paragraph \n     (1) on the use by a credit card issuer of information in a \n     consumer report shall be clearly and conspicuously described \n     to the consumer by the credit card issuer in any disclosure \n     or statement required to be made to the consumer under this \n     title.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--Section \n     604(a)(3)(F)(ii) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1681b(a)(3)(F)(ii)) is amended by inserting ``subject to \n     subsection (d),'' before ``to review''.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I offer my amendment because I want to \naddress a practice in the credit card industry. Basically, what happens \nwith some card companies--and not all of them, certainly--is they make \nit a practice to look at their cardholders' credit reports on a monthly \nbasis. When they find that the cardholder has a late payment maybe on a \nutility bill, or a car note, or whatever the case may be, they will \nactually raise the interest rate on the cardholder, even though they \nmay have made every credit card payment on time. They use that as a \njustification to raise the interest rate on the cardholder.\n  I think that is an unfair practice. It is fraught with all kinds of \nproblems, including the problem that many of these credit reports \ncontain errors. I\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\nhave certainly been subject to those. I am sure almost every Senator in \nthis Chamber has been subject to an error on their credit report at one \ntime or another. The credit card companies don't take that into \nconsideration. They will routinely increase interest rates. I think it \nis an unfair business practice.\n  We are talking about bankruptcy. We all know that one of the main \nreasons people get into financial trouble is because they have credit \ncards. Sometimes they abuse them. Sometimes the interest rate is so \nhigh that it creates great difficulty on our citizens.\n  I think this amendment is important. I think it is one we can \ncertainly justify, and I think it is one that, if people take a look at \nit, they would think this is a bad industry practice and this is a way \nto, hopefully, decrease the number of bankruptcies and the number of \nfamilies in America who get into financial trouble, if some of these \nhidden methods of increasing interest rates are taken away.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 48\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support a \ntechnical amendment, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 48.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase bankruptcy filing fees to pay for the additional \nduties of United States trustees and the new bankruptcy judges added by \n                               this Act)\n\n       On page 194, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 195, line 22, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 325.

Mr. President, this amendment, as I have noted, makes a \ntechnical correction to ensure that the bill does not violate our \nbudget laws. It has come to my attention that the bankruptcy bill could \ndraw a potential point of order because of two provisions in S. 256.\n  The first provision is section 1223 of the bill, which authorizes the \ncreation of 28 new bankruptcy judgeships. According to the CBO's most \nrecent cost estimates for S. 256, these new judges will account for $45 \nmillion in direct Federal spending over a 10-year period. Specifically, \nthe mandatory spending would be earmarked for the judges' pay and \nbenefits.\n  The second provision subject to this amendment, section 325, \naddresses the filing fees for bankruptcy and amounts that are directed \nto a trust fund that compensates bankruptcy trustees. Under current \npractice, a percentage of bankruptcy filing fees paid by a debtor is \nallocated to a trust fund that compensates bankruptcy trustees, while \nthe remaining percentage of the filing fee is paid into the Treasury \nand counted as Federal revenue.\n  Section 325 of the bill, however, will now increase the allocation \npercentages from the filing fees that are directed to the trust fund. \nBut because the bill's percentage increase will result in a \ncorresponding decrease of Federal revenue, CBO has reported this \nprovision will result in a net revenue loss for the Treasury. \nSpecifically, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the revenue \nloss at $226 million over 5 years, $456 million over 10 years.\n  After reviewing this matter with the Budget Committee, we are \nproposing through this amendment to offset the direct spending from the \njudgeships and revenue losses from the section 325 percentage by \nincreasing the bankruptcy filing fees in chapters 11 and 7.\n  The amendment also tries to limit revenue losses by sunsetting after \n2 years the increased allocation percentage measure in sections 325(b) \nand 325 (c). By doing so, we estimate that the bill will provide \nsufficient offsets to cover the potential budgetary problems facing \nthis bill.\n  Specifically, the amount of the increased filing fees that is greater \nthan the amount that would have been collected, but for this \nlegislation, is earmarked towards the payment of salaries and benefits \nfor the judges. The remaining amounts from the increased filing fees \nare also used to offset the Federal revenue loss caused by section 325 \nfor the 2 years that the provision stays in existence. I believe this \namendment represents the best way of creating offsets within the bill. \nIt will obviate the need to strike the bankruptcy judgeships provision \naltogether and, most importantly, allow this bill to survive a \npotential budget point of order.\n  To the extent there are concerns that the increase in bankruptcy \nfiling fees will make it more difficult for financially strapped \ndebtors to use chapter 7, let me remind my colleagues that I pushed for \nan amendment in committee during the 105th Congress to give bankruptcy \ncourts the discretion to waive filing fees for lower income debtors. \nThe committee accepted that amendment and it is now embodied in section \n418 of the bill.\n  This amendment removes a significant procedural obstacle that could \njeopardize the prospect of this bill's passage in the Senate. As such, \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  What this all boils down to is we need new bankruptcy judges. We have \nto pay their salaries and their health benefits, and we do not want to \nrun afoul of the budget laws which would strike down the entire bill \nunless we got 60 votes.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this is the bankruptcy reform bill. It is \nabout 500 pages long. If I went to Illinois and asked the people I \nrepresent what they think we should do when it comes to bankruptcy, I \nam virtually certain that the first thing they would say to me is, you \nhave to do something about these horrible corporate bankruptcies, \nEnron, WorldCom, and the list goes on, and the abuses which these \nofficers and CEOs have demonstrated as heads of these corporations, the \nfact that because they were feathering their own beds when their \ncompanies went bankrupt, hurting shareholders, hurting employees, \nhurting investors in pension plans, and hurting retirees.\n  I think my constituents in Illinois are right. When it comes to \nbankruptcy, that is the scandal in America. We read about it every day. \nThere is another criminal trial. Somebody is on trial because of \ncorporate malfeasance that lead to bankruptcy. It is going on right \nnow.\n  When one takes a look at this 500-page bill, how many pages in this \nbill address corporate bankruptcies? Five. Ninety-nine percent of this \nbill hardly relate to corporations at all. Ninety-nine percent relates \nto individuals and families who, through no fault of their own, in most \ncircumstances, are crushed by debt and go to bankruptcy court. Ninety-\nnine percent of this bill relates to bankruptcies of people who have a \nmedical diagnosis they never anticipated and end up in treatment \nincurring medical expenses that their health insurance does not cover. \nThat is almost half of the cases in bankruptcy court.\n  So this bill is designed to make the bankruptcy process more \ndifficult for those individuals and families to get out from under \ntheir debt. That is what this is about. So that at the end of the day, \nwhen we pass this legislation--and surely we will--the credit card \ncompanies and the banks will end up keeping people in debt longer. So \nthat people facing a crushing debt, when all is said and done, will not \nbe able to walk out of that court, having been declared bankrupt, and \nstart their lives again. That is what this bill addresses.\n  My amendment goes to the 5 pages about corporate bankruptcy. I \nbelieve this: If we are going to hold Americans and families to a high \nmoral standard, if we are going to say to them that before they go into \na bankruptcy court, pay their bills and prove to the court that they \ncannot pay their bills before we let them off the hook, if we are going \nto say that it is immoral and unjust for someone to go into a \nbankruptcy court and ask to be declared bankrupt and leave their bills \nand assets behind, if they, in fact, can pay, then fair enough.\n  But my amendment says, if we are talking about justice and high moral \nstandards, should we not also talk about these corporate CEOs and \ninsiders? Should they not be held to a high moral standard? Should they \nnot be held to the standard of justice? Sadly, this bill does not do \nit.\n  When a corporation files for bankruptcy, their workers are left \nstanding at the back of the line behind all the other creditors. Many \nof them lose their retirement savings, health care benefits and \nopportunities to get back to work and back on their feet.\n  The story of Bethlehem Steel Corporation is a good illustration. \nAfter years of decline in the steel industry, Bethlehem Steel dissolved \nin January of last year. Along with the end of Bethlehem Steel, 95,000 \nretired steelworker employees, who literally helped build America, lost \nthe health care benefits they were promised. These are workers who, at \nthe expense of their own health, went to work every day, played by the \nrules, paid into their pension plans, anticipated their health care, \nand yet because of the bankruptcy of Bethlehem Steel they were\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\nleft unprotected. They lost their pension. They lost their benefits. \nThey have nothing.\n  The problem is not limited to just steel companies. WorldCom, a \ntelecommunications company; Adelphia, a cable company; PG and Enron, \nenergy companies; Conseco, an insurance company; Financial Corporation \nof America and HomeFed, banks; United Airlines, U.S. Airways, TWA, all \nin the transportation business; Texaco, K-Mart, Polaroid, household \nnames. These are some of the once great corporate giants that ended up \nin bankruptcy. They employed hundreds of thousands of Americans, but \nonce the companies filed for bankruptcy, their employees were left with \nnowhere to turn.\n  This bankruptcy bill does not even talk about those bankruptcies and \nthose employees and the problems that they face.\n  Many of the companies that filed for bankruptcy over the past few \nyears are also associated with world-class scandals: Global Crossing, \nWorldCom, Adelphia, and, of course, the grand-daddy of them all, Enron. \nThose corporate giant names are synonomous with corruption, \nmalfeasance, and greed; they are synonomous, from my point of view, \nwith immoral corporate conduct and unjust treatment of their \nshareholders, workers, and retirees.\n  It is even more painful to think that while the workers and retirees \nof these scandal-tainted companies were left with little more than \ntheir dignity, the corporate executives and the insiders escaped with \ntheir treasures.\n  When companies are headed for bankruptcy, the corporate insiders know \nit is going to happen long before the worker out in the plant, and that \nis especially true when these same insiders are cooking the books. They \nknow where the corporate loot is hidden, and they are going to get \ntheir hands on it when they can.\n  One might say that as soon as he saw the tip of the iceberg far ahead \nof the ship, the captain of the Titanic sneaked out on the deck, jumped \nin the lifeboat, went overboard with food, water, and life-vests, and \nleft everybody else behind. That is what happened. Bon Voyage!\n  Let me describe a case study of the worst: Enron. This is the poster \nchild for corporate corruption.\n  Enron of Houston, TX. During the 1990s, Enron was the envy of every \nexecutive in corporate America: creative, aggressive, growing fast, \nmoney coming in hand over fist, Fortune 500's top 10 list of assets \nwith close to $100 billion, and doing business in far-flung reaches of \ncommerce.\n  By the year 2000, Enron stock had increased in value by 1,700 percent \nsince its first shares were issued in the 1980s. It had 21,000 \nemployees in the United States and all around the world.\n  But not everything was coming up roses for Enron. Behind the glass \nwalls of the corporate skyscraper in Houston, something very opaque was \ngoing on.\n  Listen to these famous names: Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andrew Fastow. \nThe company's top three executives obviously realized their \nastronomical success was not based on reality or truth. It was based on \nhype, speculation, and deceit. It was all smoke and mirrors.\n  Wall Street analysts later were forced to admit that they made out-\nof-control valuations of this company based on the puffery of these \ncorporate bandits. All the while, these executives cooked up ingenious \nschemes to move assets on and off the books, create phony partnerships, \noffshore accounts, and so-called ``special purpose entities.''\n  These were just corporate accounting tools designed to move around \nassets on paper. Why would they do that if they had nothing to hide? \nKen Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and others at Enron were \nundeniably the masters of manipulation.\n  We talk in this bankruptcy bill about what we are going to do with \npeople who are abusing the bankruptcy court. This bill addresses the \nwaitress with a second part-time job who is a single mother raising a \ncouple of children who just was diagnosed with breast cancer and ends \nup with medical treatment and bills she cannot pay. She is forced \nfinally to go to bankruptcy court.\n  This bill says, we are going to take care of her. In this bill we \nwill give her a long list of things to do to prove that she is not \ntaking advantage of the bankruptcy court.\n  But when it comes to these smoothies--Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and \nAndrew Fastow at Enron, and other corporations--this bill is silent. We \nare for morality when it comes to working families. Obviously, we are \nnot for morality when it comes to these corporate cheats.\n  They kept the perception up at Enron that they were making money even \nwhen they were not, but eventually it fell apart.\n  On October 16, 2001, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $618 \nmillion and shareholder equity loss of $1.2 billion. The date October \n16, 2001, is important. A week later, on October 22, the Securities and \nExchange Commission announced an inquiry into the company.\n  On November 8, 2001, Enron filed an amendment to its financial report \nrevising its income back 4 years to 1997, 4 years of lies, it turns \nout, once they were caught. They came forward and disclosed $586 \nmillion in losses, and obviously investor confidence and their stock \nvalues cratered.\n  The next day Ken Lay entered into a deal with Dynergy Corp. to sell \nEnron for $10 billion, in a desperate attempt by him to keep that \ncompany afloat. A few days later he was forced to admit that Enron was \nnot worth the amount he wanted to sell it for.\n  Naturally the deal with Dynergy was called off, and on December 2, \n2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy.\n  Let me tell you what happened to two groups of Enron employees during \nthe last few weeks of the company's solvency.\n  Here is Mr. Lay. Everybody knows his face now. CEO Ken Lay is the man \nwho made over $200 million from Enron stock, and $19 million in \nbonuses. Other executives in the Enron Corporation received bonuses as \nhigh as $5 million. While that was going on, while the company was \nheading toward a bankruptcy, there were over 5,000 employees who lost \ntheir jobs and thousands more who lost millions in retirement savings.\n  Our bill goes after the employees who lost their jobs. Our bill goes \nafter the employees who lost their health care. Our bill goes after \nretirees who ended up penniless and were forced into bankruptcy court. \nWe are going to get real tough on them.\n  But how about Mr. Lay? What price is he going to pay for his \nmisconduct? In this bill, no price at all. Everyone knows about Ken \nLay's extravagance.\n  I won't venture to assert whether Ken Lay had any actual insight or \nknowledge which he took advantage of insider information as he made \nsales of stock he held in Enron. Those are decisions for a judge and \njury.\n  But what is certain is that Ken Lay pocketed $81.5 million in loan \nadvances from his company while Enron was cascading toward bankruptcy--\n$81.5 million for this man who couldn't run his company correctly. All \ntold, he received over $200 million in Enron stock and $19 million in \nbonuses.\n  During the same time Jeff Skilling raked in $66.9 million.\n  The board of directors was sharing in these good times as well. \nSixteen members of the corporate board made a combined total of $164 \nmillion, just on selling shares they had in the company. If you add all \nthe other corporate insiders and executives at Enron with the corporate \ndirectors and all the amounts they pilfered from the company from 1998 \nto 2001, the grand total comes to well over $1 billion.\n  Now let's see how the employees at Enron fared.\n  There is an old country song by Jerry Reed called, ``She Got the \nGoldmine, I Got the Shaft.'' It could be the theme song for Enron \nworkers.\n  Of the 21,000 people worldwide who worked for Enron, 12,200 were \nenrolled in their pension plan. Over 60 percent of the assets in the \nplan invested in Enron stock and all of Enron's matching contributions \nwent into company stock as well. But the Enron stock, which once sold \nas high as $90 during its heyday, became worthless. The workers' losses \nwere aggravated during the course of the weeks when they were locked \nout of the pension plans and could not even sell the stock as the value \nof the stock was cratering.\n  Under Federal law, companies are not allowed to let their employees \nwithdraw their investment while the company switches pension plan \nadministrators. And wouldn't you know it,\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nEnron chose to switch their plan administrator on October 16, 2001.\n  Remember that date? That's the very same date I mentioned earlier, \nwhen they announced they were writing off more than $1 billion in \ncharges to their books. This meant that thousands of employees sat by \nhelplessly and watched their retirement plan literally disappear before \ntheir eyes.\n  On October 18, 2001, while Enron workers were frozen out of amending \ntheir pension plan, the stock price was down to $32 a share. By the \ntime the hurricane blew over and they finally could get to their funds, \nEnron stock value plummeted to 26 cents per share. Needless to say, the \ncompany went into bankruptcy. The employees at Enron could do nothing \nbut sit by and watch their savings melt away during that time.\n  Thousands of these employees lost their jobs as a result of the Enron \nbankruptcy. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were forced into bankruptcy \nthemselves. But during the months and years that led up to this \ndisaster, 29 Enron insiders and top execs walked away with over $1 \nbillion.\n  I have talked to some of these Enron executives. There is no good \nexplanation. Sadly, this legislation on bankruptcy we are discussing \ntoday will not hold them accountable.\n  Let me give another case study: Polaroid. This is a company that many \nof the people in Congress from Massachusetts know all about. It filed \nfor chapter 11 protection on October 12, 2001, just a couple of months \nbefore Enron did.\n  Let me show you the chart on Polaroid. CEO Gary DiCamillo ran the \ncompany into the ground but received $1.7 million. Other executives got \n$4.5 million. Over 6,000 employees lost health and life insurance, and \nthousands lost severance pay. Forced to invest 8 percent of their pay \nin company stock, they lost their retirement savings, too.\n  So these corporate insiders--whether Enron or Polaroid or WorldCom or \nothers--were lining their own pockets, taking money out of the company \ndestined for bankruptcy, and the ultimate losers were the employees and \nthe retirees.\n  The amendment which I sent to the desk is an attempt to level the \nplaying field for employees, pensioners, and others who find themselves \nshut out of court when companies they work for file for bankruptcy.\n  There are two provisions in this amendment to protect employees of \nbankrupt companies.\n  First, my amendment would address fraudulent transfers made by \ncorporate insiders, all those huge payouts and loans and bonuses and \ntransactions that went to these corporate executives as the company was \nheaded to bankruptcy, these are payouts that exceed anyone's sense of \nwhat is reasonable compensation. Under my amendment, those payouts will \nhave to be scrutinized by the bankruptcy court.\n  Think about that for a minute. These executives were being rewarded \nwith millions, sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars out of \ncorporations headed for bankruptcy.\n  Most of the time, you are rewarded with a bonus for a good job. They \nare being rewarded as their company is heading into debt and eventually \ndisbanding. So they know what is going on. They are grabbing the money \nbefore they hit bankruptcy court. The money they grab out of the \ncorporation is at the expense of people who loaned money to the \ncorporation, especially at the expense of their workers and retirees. \nThey end up taking the money that otherwise would have gone into the \npension funds and putting it in their own pockets.\n  My amendment gives the bankruptcy court the tools to investigate and \ntreat these fishy, self-serving deals Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling and \nAndrew Fastow and others at Enron cut for themselves. It gives the \njudge the power to review questionable insider transfers. That is only \nreasonable.\n  It includes a fair and workable formula for what the court can \ndetermine might be excessive.\n  It also extends the period of time a bankruptcy court can go back and \nrecapture the assets of these executives, a 4-year reachback instead of \nthe 1 year allowed under current law and the 2 years proposed in this \nbill.\n  As I described in the Enron example, some of the most outrageous \ntransactions by the Enron executives took place 3 or 4 years before the \ncompany filed bankruptcy, so this bill would not even touch them. This \nbill lets those corporate insiders end up in their mansions with \nhundreds of millions of dollars squirreled away at the expense of the \nretirees who lost their pensions and their health care. By recapturing \nthese assets, this provision would make more money available for \nemployees and retirees and act as a deterrent to future corporate \nexecutives seeking the same sort of sweetheart deal.\n  But this is not all about Enron. Let me give you other examples in \nthe headlines today.\n  WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers. He took $366 million in personal loans \nand his contract called for a $1.5 million yearly pension. Not bad. Mr. \nEbbers ought to be proud. His skills and talents as CEO took his \ncompany, WorldCom, into the record books as the largest bankruptcy in \nthe history of the United States. While he is grabbing all of the money \nout of the corporation, it is sinking like a rock.\n  John Jenkins, the former president of Global Crossing. He took more \nthan $1 million in pension benefits--something called ``transitional \nassistance,'' consulting fees, and other benefits, as his company was \nspiraling downward.\n  Let us take a look at Kmart and its CEO, Chuck Conaway. As Kmart was \nfalling apart, eventually becoming the largest American retailer to \nfile bankruptcy, Mr. Conaway received a $9 million golden parachute. \nAbout one-half of it was a severance package. But his former employer \ndecided to give him a little break as he left this bankrupt \ncorporation. A $5 million loan was forgiven. Talk about a Blue Light \nSpecial at Kmart, this one takes the cake.\n  John Rigas of Adelphia Communications took about $1 million per month \nfrom the company while he and others used it as their personal piggy \nbank. According to the indictment from the U.S. Attorney, the Rigas \nfamily used company loans to buy Adelphia shares and engage in insider \ntransactions between Adelphia and other companies controlled by the \nRigas family. Here is one example of how they fared. Rigas and his sons \nused $2.3 billion in off-balance-sheet loans from the company to build \nthemselves a private 18-hole golf course at the cost of $13 million. \nNot bad for a cable guy. He raided his corporation for $2.3 billion at \nthe expense of shareholders and retirees.\n  What does this bill do to that kind of corporate bandit? Nothing. \nThis bill focuses on the employees who lost their jobs. This bill \nfocuses on the retirees who lost their health care and their pension. \nThis bill makes it tough for them.\n  This is inspired by our feeling that we need more morality and \njustice in our bankruptcy courts. But wouldn't you start at the top? \nWouldn't you start with the biggest thieves in the business--the people \nwho broke a record when it comes to bankruptcy and raiding these \ncorporations?\n  These insiders knew what they were doing. They saw their companies \ngoing down, and they grabbed everything they could get their hands on. \nThey canceled their workers' pension plans and benefits.\n  My amendment says we would go back 4 years before the bankruptcy to \nrecover that money and put it in the hands of creditors, employees, and \nretirees.\n  The second part of my amendment directly helps employees of these \ncompanies with some relief in bankruptcy court. This gives them a place \nin line as creditors that they currently don't have.\n  The amendment gives them a priority unsecured claim in bankruptcy for \nthe value of company stock which was held for their benefit in an \nemployee pension plan, unless the plan beneficiary had the option to \ninvest the assets in some other way.\n  Under current law, these retirees who ended up with the short end of \nthe stick in these retirement plans have nowhere to turn. They are not \neven in line in priority for these claims. My amendment would fix that.\n  The amendment determines the value of these claims to be measured by \nthe market value of the stock at the time it was contributed to the \nplan.\n  In other words, the employee who was not at fault in the collapse of \nhis employer corporation ought to have a fair claim for the fair value \nof his contribution to his pension plan as it was\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nvalued when he made that contribution. That's only fair.\n  My amendment is simple, yet necessary. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of the support of the groups behind this \namendment--the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the National \nConsumer Law Center, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, \nConsumer Action, AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, United Steel Workers of \nAmerica, and the American Federation of Teachers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have their letters of support printed in \nthe Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The bankruptcy-reform bill currently before \n     the Senate will result in severe injustice to thousands of \n     workers and consumers and we urge you to oppose it. The \n     Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of \n     2005 (S. 256) is basically unchanged from the version drafted \n     by the financial services industry in the mid-1990s, It \n     remains a one-sided attempt to favor creditor interests at \n     the expense of working families who have suffered the loss of \n     a job, high medical bills, and other unforeseen financial \n     emergencies. Senators Rockefeller, Kennedy, Durbin and \n     Feingold will offer amendments to improve this bill, and we \n     urge you to support them.\n       Supporters of S. 256 suggest that the current system is \n     riddled with ``high rollers'' who are gaming the system to \n     get out of paying their fair share. To the contrary, studies \n     suggest that 90% of these filing for bankruptcy do so because \n     of circumstances largely outside their control. In recent \n     years, business failures and mass layoffs resulting from \n     corporate fraud have lead to innumerable individual \n     bankruptcies, Rather than correcting deficiencies in current \n     law that fail to protect workers in these circumstances, the \n     bill places new burdens on working families when they are \n     most vulnerable.\n       We strongly support Senator Rockefeller's amendment to \n     raise the current wage priority cap from $4,950 to $15,000 \n     because the amounts owed to workers frequently exceed the per \n     employee cap. Senator Rockefeller's amendment would also \n     eliminate arbitrary payment rules that prevent workers from \n     collecting compensation owned to them by a bankrupt employer. \n     Importantly, Senator Rockefeller's amendment will compensate \n     workers who lose retiree health benefits by requiring \n     bankrupt companies to provide cash payments for replacement \n     coverage.\n       The AFL-CIO also urges you to support amendments that will \n     he offered by Senator Kennedy to protect low-income families \n     from means testing and unnecessary paperwork and to protect \n     workers who declare bankruptcy after becoming unemployed \n     because of outsourcing or a mass layoff.\n       We also support Senator Feingold's amendment to remove \n     provisions that impose substantial new requirements on small \n     businesses attempting to reorganize under Chapter II. There \n     is no justification for increasing the hurdles that small \n     businesses already face in trying to survive financial \n     distress.\n       Finally, we urge you to support amendments that will be \n     offered by Senator Durbin to restrain bankrupt employers from \n     rewarding corporate insiders and other senior managers with \n     large bonuses and excessive perks at the same time that their \n     employees suffer economic devastation from the loss of a job \n     or their savings in a company 401(k).\n       In sum, S. 256 is an unnecessarily harsh and one-sided bill \n     that will penalize countless working Americans facing \n     financial crises beyond their control. The AFL-CIO strongly \n     urges you to support the above-mentioned amendments to this \n     deeply flawed bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The undersigned national consumer \n     organizations applaud you for offering amendments to the \n     Senate bankruptcy bill (S. 256) that would better protect \n     employees and retirees in the event of a corporate \n     bankruptcy. The inclusion of these amendments will bring \n     much-needed balance to a harsh and one-sided bill that would \n     harm many families that have suffered genuine financial \n     misfortune.\n       The raft of corporate scandals in the last few years has \n     exposed many flaws in a system of market oversight that used \n     to be the envy of the world. Many investors lost faith in our \n     markets, tens of thousands of employees lost their jobs and \n     workers and retirees have lost significant portions of their \n     pension plans.\n       It is essential that Congress take a comprehensive approach \n     to reform. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act to reform corporate \n     accounting practices took an important first step. It is \n     bringing much needed improvements to the quality and \n     independence of the audits of public companies and help to \n     restore investor confidence. But this law was never intended \n     to give employees and retirees more power to combat the \n     tactics of corporate officers who systematically loot their \n     corporations and line their pockets, even as their companies' \n     financial position starts to deteriorate. To do that, one \n     must change corporate bankruptcy laws.\n       These amendments will help employees and retirees prevent \n     corporate officers from pillaging their earnings and \n     retirement savings in two of important ways:\n       It increases the power of bankruptcy judges to nullify \n     fraudulent transfers of benefits and money by corporate \n     officers, and to examine off-book transactions. This will \n     increase the ability of employees to recover assets that have \n     been stripped.\n       It increases the ability of employees to recover the value \n     of company stock, when the stock was purchased because \n     employees were not allowed to choose other investment \n     options.\n       These amendments are the important ``next step'' in \n     reforming our corporate accountability laws. It is being \n     introduced at a time when Congress is poised to pass a \n     personal bankruptcy law that will make it more difficult for \n     moderate-income individuals who have been harmed by economic \n     disruption, corporate scandals and personal misfortune to get \n     a financial fresh start. We commend you for focusing on the \n     kind of bankruptcy reform that will help, not hurt, \n     employees, retirees and working families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Travis B. Plunkett,\n       Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Programs Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     Susanna Montezemolo,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Linda Sherry,\n       Editorial Director, Consumer Action.\n     John Rao,\n       Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, these groups and their members know what \nhappened with these companies.\n  I am troubled by the fact that the Senate has spent this entire week \ntalking about bankruptcy abuse and making it tough for families trying \nto pay medical bills, making this process more difficult for the \nguardsmen and reservists who were activated to go overseas to serve our \ncountry only to lose their business at home and face bankruptcy when \nthey return.\n  There is nothing in this bill to help them. There is nothing in this \nbill to help them with medical bills.\n  Senator Kennedy was here on the floor yesterday. He had an extreme \nsuggestion, a radical idea. Senator Kennedy said, if you lose \neverything because of medical bills, we are going to protect your \nlittle home--$150,000 worth of your home--so that when it is all said \nand done, as sick as you may be, you will at least have a home. But \nthat proposal was rejected. I am not sure of the vote on that \namendment, 58-39, somewhere in that range but a partisan vote. Everyone \non this side--virtually everyone--voted against it.\n  According to that vote, we can't help those people. They have to face \nthe reality. They have to face up to the fact they won't have a home to \ngo to when it is all over.\n  But what about the mansions these CEOs go to, the millions of dollars \nthey have drained out of these corporations for their own personal \nbenefit to buy mansions, to buy golf courses, to create a lifestyle \nwith $30,000 shower curtains? Are we going to hold them accountable for \nraiding these corporations and driving them into bankruptcy? The answer \nis no. Not a word in this bill holds them accountable.\n  I urge my colleagues. If you can work up a rage over the possibility \nthat someone with medical bills that are overwhelming goes to \nbankruptcy court seeking relief from their debts, can you work up a \nlittle bit of discomfort over these CEOs and bandits of the major \ncorporations? Can you bring yourselves to say maybe we will hold them \naccountable, too, for their misconduct?\n  It would be a new day in this Senate, a grand departure from the \ndebate as it has gone down at this point. We have never come close to \nthis yet. I haven't heard a word yet from the other side--not a word on \nthis floor by the supporters of this bankruptcy bill about these \ncorporate bankruptcies and what they have done to hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of unsuspecting investors, workers, and \nretirees.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n  The Durbin amendment will give my colleagues a chance to do something \nabout it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 49\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation that we have before us \ncracks down unfairly on large numbers of hard-working families that are \nin dire financial straits because of a sudden serious illness or \nbecause their loved ones are fighting in Iraq. Yet, this bill blatantly \nignores the real abuses in our bankruptcy laws: the corporate abuses \nthat have become epidemic in recent years. It is the worst corporate \nmisconduct since before the Great Depression.\n  Some of these companies were brought down by outright criminal \nactivities. Many more of them were driven into bankruptcy by the greed \nand mismanagement of a small group of reckless insiders who ignored \ntheir responsibility to their employees and their stockholders alike.\n  Current law on corporate bankruptcy is grossly inadequate in dealing \nwith these problems. Often, the very insiders whose misconduct brought \nthe company down do very well in bankruptcy. The people who suffer the \nmost are the innocent victims, the employees, the retirees.\n  Increasingly, the bankruptcy court has become a place where corporate \nexecutives go to get permission to line their own pockets and break \ntheir promise to their workers and retirees. That kind of abuse is \nterribly wrong, and it is our responsibility to prevent it.\n  Instead, we are considering a 500-page bankruptcy bill that virtually \nignores this issue. It does nothing to address the corporate looting by \nhigh-level insiders. It does nothing to protect a company's workforce \nfrom losing their jobs, their health care, and their pensions. This \nbill should not move forward until those glaring omissions are \ncorrected, and the Durbin amendment is the way to do it.\n  Take a close look at the examples of executives in some of America's \nlargest corporations, and see how lavishly they benefitted while their \ncompanies went into bankruptcy. Top executives made sure they were well \nprovided for at the company's expense. Yet, loyal employees and their \nfamilies were left to struggle on their own.\n  A major corporation in Massachusetts, Polaroid, filed for bankruptcy \nin 2001. In the months leading up to the company's filing, $1.7 million \nin incentive payments were made to its chief executive officer on top \nof his $840,000 salary. The company also received the approval of the \nbankruptcy court to make $1.5 million in payments to senior managers to \nkeep them on board. And these managers collectively received an \nadditional $3 million when the company's assets were sold.\n  Yet, just days before Polaroid filed for bankruptcy, it canceled the \nhealth and life insurance benefits for more than 6,000 retirees. It \nalso canceled the health insurance coverage for workers with long-term \ndisabilities, and halted the severance benefits for thousands of \nworkers who had recently been laid off.\n  Polaroid employees had been required to contribute to the company's \nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan. When the company failed, their \nretirement savings were virtually all wiped out.\n  The loss was devastating for workers like Karl Farmer, a Polaroid \nengineer in Massachusetts for more than 30 years. He had been required, \nas had other Polaroid employees, to pay 8 percent of his pay into the \ncompany's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. At its peak, this stock was \nworth over $200,000. But after the company declared bankruptcy, the \nstock was worthless. And he also lost his severance pay and medical \nbenefits.\n  Or take Betty Moss of Smryna, GA. Betty and her husband retired and \nwere traveling across the country in their camper when they learned \nthat Polaroid had stopped her severance pay and that they had lost her \nhealth insurance and life insurance. Because of the fall in Polaroid \nstock, her retirement savings plunged from $160,000 to only a few \nhundred dollars.\n  The loss of health insurance and life insurance benefits was \nparticularly devastating for long-term disabled workers. With their \ndisabilities, they cannot go back to work, and they have no way to \nobtain other insurance coverage.\n  Sally Ferrari of Saugus, MA, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease \nafter working for Polaroid for 20 years. In recent years, she required \nround-the-clock care. Yet, Polaroid cut off her health care benefits in \nbankruptcy, which meant that her husband had to stay at work full time \nuntil he recently passed away in order to provide medical coverage for \nhis wife.\n  I also have letters from other employees.\n\n       This letter is from David Maniscalco. He was injured while \n     working for Polaroid. Now he is unable to work, and his \n     medical bills are consuming his family's savings and his \n     retirement because Polaroid took away total health care \n     coverage. He points out:\n       After Polaroid declared bankruptcy, they terminated all the \n     people on long term disability, and terminated all of our \n     Medical, Life and Dental Insurance. I wear a fiberglass back \n     brace and sleep in a hospital bed and am not able to work. My \n     wife changed jobs in order to have medical insurance for \n     herself. And I am on Medicare and a secondary insurance. The \n     cost to us is $895.00 a month for medical insurance alone. \n     The problem is, we're using our retirement money to help with \n     the cost of our medical insurance.\n\n  Here you have the corporate officials well taken care of, and the \nloyal employees were notified with less than 24 hours. And this is how \nthey end up. How? Because they go to bankruptcy court. Does this bill \ndo anything about protecting those individuals? Absolutely zero. \nAbsolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\n  We have here a letter from Elaine Johnson. She lost a lung to cancer. \nWhen Polaroid went into bankruptcy, she lost her health insurance, too. \nShe writes:\n\n       When Polaroid declared bankruptcy, I lost my life \n     insurance, medical and dental insurance. Because of my \n     disability, I'm unable to get other insurance and another \n     job.\n\n  Once you have these serious illnesses, it is virtually impossible to \never get your health insurance again. I have a son who had osteosarcoma \nat 12 years old. He, as an individual--he is 43 years old--cannot get a \nhealth insurance policy today no matter what he is prepared to pay for \nit, unless he goes into some kind of group. Why? Because he had cancer \nat one particular time.\n  Here you have individuals who have disabilities who are tied into \ntheir company's program. The company has made a commitment to them. And \nthen what happens? At the time they go into bankruptcy court, one of \nthe first things that happens is the corporate officials free \nthemselves from the obligations to pay the employees' health insurance, \nand they are left out in the cold.\n  The list goes on. Polaroid employees, like Betsy Williams of Waltham, \nMA, were financially devastated by the loss of medical and health care \nbenefits. Betsy was with Polaroid for 28 years, and she thought, when \nshe came down with lupus, her company's disability, health and life \ninsurance would cover her. She writes:\n\n       When I received an unsigned letter from Polaroid \n     Corporation in July of 2002 stating that I (along with other \n     employees on Long Term Disability) would be terminated by the \n     company and my medical, dental and life insurance benefits \n     would end, I was shocked and dismayed. Unable to work because \n     of my disabilities, my husband (who is also disabled) and I \n     are forced to pay approximately $1,125/month for a Medicare \n     Health plan and an additional $400-$500/month for \n     prescription co-payments, supplies, etc.; no available dental \n     plan, and I was only able to get 50% of my life insurance at \n     an exorbitant rate. We now have two mortgages; our groceries \n     are bought with a credit card; and we are holding on \n     financially by a thread.\n\n  There it is. That is the person who is going to get burned with this \nbill. That is the person who is going to be marched in. That is the \nperson who is going to be required to pay $10, $15, $20 a week, $80 a \nmonth on into the future under this bill. But do we do anything about \nthe corporate executives? Absolutely nothing.\n  And the list goes on. These are hard-working people who were crushed \nwhen\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nPolaroid cut their benefits. Yet, while they suffered, Polaroid \nexecutives filled their pockets to overflowing.\n  When the chief financial officer left, she got a $600,000 pension. \nRecently, she received $1 million in severance pay from Royal Dutch/\nShell Company, even though she left under a cloud of scandal. And \nPolaroid's former president is now the president and CEO of one of the \ncountry's largest staff outsourcing companies. He plans to take the \ncompany public soon and will reap enormous profits.\n  Enron, as my friend and colleague, the Senator from Illinois, pointed \nout, is another flagrant example of massive company looting while \nemployees lost everything. Enron executives cashed out more than $1 \nbillion of company stock when they knew the company was in trouble. And \njust before the company declared bankruptcy, its top executives were \npaid bonuses as high as $5 million each to stay on.\n  Enron workers, however, were forced to hold their company stock until \nthe age of 50. They were subject to blackout periods that executives \nwere not.\n  They lost a total of $1 billion in retirement savings. Thousands of \nthem lost their jobs. Thousands lost their health insurance. Thousands \nof them will be dragged into bankruptcy court under this particular \nlegislation.\n  Yet we have WorldCom, another shameful case. Bernie Ebbers is on \ntrial for corporate fraud. I don't know how many Americans read the \nnewspapers yesterday, but Bernie Ebbers is on trial. He received \nmillions of dollars in personal loans from the company and was \noriginally granted a pension worth $1.5 million a year. This week he \ndenied knowing anything about the biggest accounting fraud in history. \n``I don't know about technology. I don't know about financing. I don't \nknow about accounting,'' he claimed.\n  What about those people I just mentioned who worked for Polaroid all \ntheir lives and because of the bankruptcy lost their health insurance, \ndo you think they will be able to give those kinds of answers? Not \nunder this bill.\n  Ordinary Americans will not have this defense when they are facing \nbankruptcy. Countless WorldCom employees who honestly knew nothing \nabout the fraud wound up losing their jobs and their retirement.\n  Another example is the popular retailer Kmart. As Kmart was teetering \non the edge of bankruptcy, the company bought two new corporate jets. \nOnce it finally went into bankruptcy, CEO Chuck Conaway was given a $9 \nmillion golden parachute. Meanwhile 57,000 Kmart workers lost their \njobs, and the company closed 600 stores.\n  Abuses like these have made the headlines, but this bankruptcy bill \ndoesn't deal with them. It comes down hard on those families who have \ncritical health bills, families who are touched by cancer and heart and \nstroke, families who have children with disabilities. It comes down \nhard on those individuals and lets these people off free. And we call \nthat fair? Take away their homes if they live in 40-odd States, but let \nthem keep millionaire homes in Texas and Florida. And they do nothing \nabout it, the proponents of this bill, nothing. Call that fair? Call \nthis bill fair?\n  We know what it is. It is making the various bankruptcy courts the \ncollection agencies for the credit card companies. Mr. American \nTaxpayer, you are going to be paying for more bankruptcy judges and \nstaff and buildings because there are going to be so many more people \nwho are going to be thrown into bankruptcy. The fastest growing group \nof bankruptcy filers is the elderly, individuals fifty-five and older, \nwho are being hit with increased medical costs. As I mentioned the \nother day, they are seeing increased premiums on Medicare--wait until \nthey get their new prescription drug program and start paying the costs \nfor that, which is an inadequate program that has special provisions in \nit that have giveaways to the HMOs and to the prescription drug \ncompanies. They are just going to end up paying more and more, Mr. \nAmerican Taxpayer, to support these courts of bankruptcy, and they are \ngoing to squeeze our fellow citizens out all the more. Meanwhile other \npeople are getting $9 million golden parachutes.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment will stop the travesty of high-level \ncorporate insiders walking away with millions of dollars in bankruptcy \nwhile workers and retirees are left emptyhanded. This amendment will \nstrengthen the ability of bankruptcy courts to invalidate fraudulent \ntransfers by corporate insiders. The current legislation does zero, \nnothing. The proponents of this legislation have opposed this effort by \nthe Senator from Illinois. This amendment will strengthen the ability \nof bankruptcy courts to invalidate fraudulent transfers. Currently the \ncourt can only compel the return of money improperly taken out of the \ncompany in the preceding year. In many instances the looting has taken \nplace over a number of years, and the court has no authority to go \nafter those lost assets. This amendment will allow bankruptcy judges to \nreach back as far as 4 years to recover corporate assets.\n  It also empowers the court to review and set aside the excess benefit \ntransfers made to corporate management while the company was insolvent \nor which contributed to the company's insolvency. These sweetheart \ndeals often take the form of huge bonuses, golden parachutes, and other \npayments to corporate executives before the public learns that the \ncompany is in trouble. Such payments violate the most basic principle \nof fiduciary duty, and the bankruptcy court should have the power to \ncorrect these wrongs. Every dollar recovered from these outrageous \ninside deals is another dollar that will be there to compensate \nworkers, retirees, and other creditors.\n  Finally, our amendment--I welcome the opportunity to cosponsor it \nwith the Senator from Illinois--will give a priority claim in \nbankruptcy to employees who are forced to invest their retirement \nsavings in employer stock.\n  Polaroid workers lost their retirement because they were required to \ninvest 8 percent of their pay in their company as a condition of \nholding their jobs. Workers at Enron were also forced to keep their \ncompany stock until the age of 50 and subject to blackout periods \nduring which they couldn't sell their stock, but the company executives \ncould. Under current bankruptcy law, workers have no way to recover \nfrom these losses. They deserve a chance to recover some of what they \nlost. This amendment will provide it.\n  The issue is simple fairness. We learned even yesterday about the new \nloophole, about trusts that are going to be created so those \nindividuals who may go into bankruptcy and who have resources can go \nout and hire a lawyer and shelter their income from any kind of \nbankruptcy court. But the average worker can't do that. The average \nworker out there working a lifetime for a company and then dismissed, \nthe company then goes into bankruptcy, can't do that.\n  They can't hold onto their homes like so many of the wealthiest \nindividuals in our country. In Florida they will be able to do it, but \nthey won't be able to do it in most of the other States. In Texas they \ncan do it, but not in most of the other States. Yet here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate, the Senate refused, absolutely refused to show any \nconsideration to home ownership for people who have worked hard all of \ntheir lives, just having $150,000 in equity.\n  This issue is about fairness. If a corporation has gone into \nbankruptcy, those who ran the ship aground certainly should be not be \nenriched at the very time those who depend on the company for their \nlivelihood are driven into poverty. Yet that is what happens all too \noften in corporate bankruptcy today. Any bankruptcy bill which fails to \naddress these critical issues is a cruel hoax on the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment, recognizing \nthat bankruptcy reform has to apply to corporations, too.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment No. 42 \nand will call for the yeas and nays on my amendment at the appropriate \ntime.\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak to my amendment to the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act to close an ugly loophole \nthat protects millionaires, while at the same time this bill will \npunish, among others, veterans' families and sick people with mountains \nof medical bills.\n  The front page of yesterday's business section in the New York Times \nran a story on a shocking loophole in bankruptcy law that is a windfall \nfor the wealthy, called the millionaire's loophole. Let me read to you \na little bit about it. I am going to read from the New York Times here. \nThe headline is:\n\n       Proposed law in bankruptcy has loophole; wealthy could \n     shield many assets in trust.\n       The bankruptcy legislation being debated by the Senate is \n     intended to make it harder for people to walk away from their \n     credit card and other debts. But legal specialists say the \n     proposed law leaves open an increasingly popular loophole \n     that lets wealthy people protect substantial assets from \n     creditors, even after filing for bankruptcy.\n\n  Here is the problem. In five States--Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, Rhode \nIsland and Utah--millionaires and even billionaires can stash away \ntheir assets--whether it be a mansion, racing car, a yacht, or any kind \nof financial asset or investment, or even a suitcase filled with cash--\nin a special kind of trust, so that they can hold on to that windfall \neven after filing for bankruptcy. When they file for bankruptcy, these \nwealthy people, creditors would not be able to reach anything in those \ntrusts. So here you have wealthy people filing for bankruptcy and yet \nhaving huge amounts of assets protected in a little trust hidden away.\n  The bill tries to address the infamous homestead exemption by \nattaching a $125,000 ceiling to it. But it doesn't matter. A \nmillionaire doesn't need a home to protect his or her assets. All they \nneed is a good lawyer, a pencil, paper, and one of these trusts.\n  As one legal expert said: With this loophole, the wealthy won't need \nto buy houses in Florida or Texas to keep their millions. So if anyone \nis manipulating the system, it is these guys. By the way, you don't \nhave to be in these five States. All you have to do is file the trust \nin one of these States. My great State of New York, I am happy to say, \nis blessed with many millionaires. We hope there are more of them. But \nthey should not be allowed to file in Delaware, or Utah, or Alaska a \ntrust that allows them to declare bankruptcy and yet keep their assets. \nIt is a basic way for wealthy people to not pay their debts.\n  We have heard a lot in this bill about people who gamble profligately \nand waste their money and declare bankruptcy. That is an abuse that the \nbill should, in my judgment, close. But then why are we continuing to \nallow it to remain in the law? It is not this bill that does it; it is \nin the law. But as we close those methods of using bankruptcy \nabusively, how can we leave this one open? This ``million dollar \nbankruptcy baby'' deserves an Oscar for the best legal loophole for the \nwealthy. This millionaire's loophole is so bad that it must be knocked \nout before this fight is over. There is no question that, without this \namendment, the bankruptcy laws will continue to make it easier for \nmillionaires to keep their millions than for poor people to simply stay \nafloat.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join me in \nthat amendment. I know there seems to be some kind of edict that you \ncannot vote for any amendment. Can we please make an exception for this \none? I am sure just about everybody agrees with us. I am joined in this \namendment by my colleagues Senators Bingaman, Durbin, Feinstein, and \nClinton; they have cosponsored the amendment. This amendment closes \nthis millionaire's loophole by forcing those who seek to use these \ntrusts to cheat. It only allows them to protect as much as $125,000 in \nassets in these trusts and not a penny more. In other words, it makes \nit analogous to what we do for homes in the homestead exemption in this \nbill.\n\n  Again, if we don't want wealthy people to be able to hide their \nassets in their homes and escape the rigors of the bankruptcy law, why \nwould we allow them to do that in trusts? To clarify, the amendment \ndoesn't adversely affect retirees who have saved for a lifetime to \nbuild a retirement nest egg. The solution is straightforward. It is \nwritten in the spirit of the bill. In fact, when looking at statements \nmade by some of this bill's greatest champions, you would think they \nwould have no problem accepting this amendment in the bill.\n  The bill's sponsor is a good man. I am now on his committee. He is \nknown as having a great deal of integrity. Well, here is what Senator \nGrassley said about the bill. This was in one of his State's local \npapers: Filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy, he said, ``was not intended to \nbe a convenient financial planning tool where deadbeats can get out of \npaying their debts scot-free, while honest Americans who play by the \nrules have to foot the bill.''\n  I agree with that statement. This amendment fits the words of Senator \nGrassley exactly. Why would we not include this amendment in the bill? \nThat is the essence of the amendment we have. Deadbeats exist in all \ntax brackets. There are some middle-class deadbeats. There are some \npoor deadbeats, of course. What about the wealthy deadbeats? Why are \nthey treated differently than everybody else?\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle, because of this \ngrand edict ``don't vote for any amendment,'' don't end up protecting \nwealthy deadbeats from the same punishment they are doling out to those \nwho are not so financially fortunate.\n  I have listened to my Republican friends and their concerns about the \nabuse of our bankruptcy system by gamblers, hustlers, and cheaters. I \nhave listened for a number of years, and I share those concerns. But I \nhope my colleagues will come to the floor to vote for this amendment \nthat will end the egregious millionaire's loophole. Make no mistake \nabout it, I am not against millionaires and billionaires. I think it is \ngreat when an American achieves success and makes a lot of money. But \ndon't declare bankruptcy and hide your assets and shed your debts. The \npeople who should least be able to do this are the wealthy.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment, which will end the \negregious millionaire's loophole. We cannot let a few bad apple \nmillionaires evade the system by cutting and running on their debts. \nThis bill, I am afraid, of course, doesn't go after just the bad \napples. That is an issue my colleague from Massachusetts has been ably \ntaking up on the floor, as have many other of my colleagues. It \nactually labels the whole bushel of bankruptcy filers rotten.\n  I wish the bill made more of a distinction between those who are \nabusive, who gamble, or who are profligate and try to shake off their \ndebt, and those who have run into real hardship because they are in the \nmilitary or because they have health care problems. The bill makes no \ndistinction between those two groups and that is wrong. We need to make \nsure the bill targets the Nation's cheats and not its cheated. I urge \nmy colleagues to close the millionaire's loophole by voting for this \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nNew York, Senator Schumer, in offering an amendment which would address \na serious loophole in the bankruptcy bill we are now considering it \nallows rich debtors to unfairly shield assets from their creditors.\n  In recent years a number of financial and bankruptcy planners have \ntaken advantage of the law of a few States to create what is called an \n``asset protection trust.'' These trusts are basically mechanisms for \nrich people to keep money despite declaring bankruptcy. They are \nunfair, and violate the basic principle of this underlying legislation \nthat bankruptcy should be used judiciously to deal with the economic \nreality that sometimes people cannot pay their debts, but to prevent \nabuse of the system.\n  This loophole is an example of where the law, if not changed, \npermits, or even encourages, such abuse.\n  The amendment is simple: It sets an upper limit on the amount of \nmoney that can be shielded in these asset protection trusts, capping \nthe amount at $125,000. This amount parallels the limit placed on the \nsimilar ``homestead exemption'' elsewhere in the bill. The homestead \nexemption allows some assets to be protected from creditors in \nbankruptcy where they are in the form a residential home.\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n  The bottom line: Wealthy people will be able to preserve only \n$125,000 in an asset protection trust.\n  This amount, $125,000, is not a small sum. It is more than enough to \nensure that the debtor is not left destitute. But I believe it is a \nreasonable amount. It is deliberately based on the now-accepted \n$125,000 limit for the homestead exemption, which will also remain \navailable to a debtor.\n  Yesterday the New York Times, in an article entitled Proposed Law on \nBankruptcy Has Loophole detailed the potential problem in this bill. \nThe article quotes Professor Elena Marty-Nelson, a law professor at \nNova Southeastern University in Florida, who states:\n\n       [i]f the bankruptcy legislation currently [before the \n     Senate] gets enacted, debtors won't need to buy houses in \n     Florida and Texas to keep their millions [t]he millionare's \n     loophole that is the results of these trusts needs to be \n     closed.\n\n  Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School is also quoted in \nthe article. She notes that:\n\n       [t]his is just a way for rich folks to be able to slip \n     through the noose on bankruptcy and, of course, the double \n     irony for her is that the proponents of this bill keep \n     pressing it as designed to eliminate abuse.\n\n  I unanimously consent that the full text of the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 2005]\n\n                Proposed Law on Bankruptcy Has Loophole\n\n                        (By Gretchen Morgenson)\n\n       The bankruptcy legislation being debated by the Senate is \n     intended to make it harder for people to walk away from their \n     credit card and other debts. But legal specialists say the \n     proposed law leaves open an increasingly popular loophole \n     that lets wealthy people protect substantial assets from \n     creditors even after filing for bankruptcy.\n       The loophole involves the use of so-called asset protection \n     trusts. For years, wealthy people looking to keep their money \n     out of the reach of domestic creditors have set up these \n     trusts offshore. But since 1997, lawmakers in five states--\n     Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, Rhode Island and Utah--have passed \n     legislation exempting assets held domestically in such trusts \n     from the federal bankruptcy code. People who want to \n     establish trusts do not have to reside the five states; they \n     need only set their trust up through an institution in one of \n     them.\n       ``If the bankruptcy legislation currently being rushed \n     through the Senate gets enacted, debtors won't need to buy \n     houses in Florida or Texas to keep their millions,'' said \n     Elena Marty-Nelson, a law professor at Nova Southeastern \n     University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., referring to generous \n     homestead exemptions in those states. ``The millionaire's \n     loophole that is the result of these trusts needs to be \n     closed.''\n       Yesterday in Washington, Republicans in the Senate beat \n     back the first in a series of Democratic amendments aimed at \n     softening the effects of the bankruptcy bill on military \n     personnel, and the majority leader of the House vowed to get \n     quick approval of the bill if the Senate did not \n     significantly alter it.\n       ``We will grab hold of it just like we did class action if \n     it is a good and clean bankruptcy reform bill,'' said \n     Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, referring to \n     the quick action the House took last month on a measure \n     limiting class-action lawsuits.\n       The Senate bill is favored by banks, credit card companies \n     and retailers, who say it is now too easy for consumers to \n     erase their debts through bankruptcy. It is almost identical \n     to previous versions that have been introduced in Congress, \n     unsuccessfully, since 1998. Perhaps because the current bill \n     was written so long ago, some legal authorities say, it does \n     not address the new state laws that have allowed asset \n     protection trusts to flourish.\n       ``This is just a way for rich folks to be able to slip \n     through the noose on bankruptcy, and, of course, the double \n     irony here is that the proponents of this bill keep pressing \n     it as designed to eliminate abuse,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a \n     law professor at Harvard Law School. ``Yet when provisions \n     that permit real abuse by rich people are pointed out, the \n     bill's proponents look the other way.''\n       Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is the \n     main sponsor of the bankruptcy bill. His press secretary, \n     Beth Levine, said the senator's staff was unaware of the \n     trusts and the loophole for the wealthy that they \n     represented. ``The senator is always open to suggestions for \n     closing these loopholes,'' she said.\n       Money held in asset protection trusts can elude creditors \n     because federal bankruptcy law exempts assets governed by \n     ``applicable nonbankruptcy law.'' Intended to preserve rights \n     to property under state law, the exemption makes it difficult \n     for creditors to get hold of assets that they would not be \n     able to seize through a nonbankruptcy proceeding in state \n     court.\n       Asset protection trusts have become increasingly popular in \n     recent years among physicians, who fear large medical \n     malpractice awards, and corporate executives, whose assets \n     are at greater peril now because of new laws. The Sarbanes-\n     Oxley legislation, for example, requires chief executives and \n     chief financial officers to certify that their companies' \n     financial statements are accurate; anyone who knowingly \n     certifies false numbers can be fined up to $5 million. In \n     addition, under Sarbanes-Oxley, executives may have to \n     reimburse their companies for bonuses or other incentive \n     compensation they received if their company's financial \n     reports have to be restated in later years. ``Given all the \n     notoriety of what we're seeing today, from HealthSouth to \n     WorldCom, there is probably more of an impetus for executives \n     to consider going this route,'' said Scott E. Blakeley, a \n     lawyer at Blakeley & Blakeley in Irvine, Calif. ``And yet in \n     the bankruptcy bill, this topic is not touched.''\n       While it is difficult to quantify how much money is sitting \n     in domestic asset protection trusts, their popularity is \n     undeniable, bankruptcy specialists said. ``I've heard figures \n     for foreign asset protection trusts and those probably are in \n     the billions,'' said Adam J. Hirsch, a law professor at \n     Florida State University. ``I haven't seen any figures for \n     domestic asset protection trusts, but they could very well be \n     the same.''\n       Current federal bankruptcy law protects assets held in a \n     type of trust, known as a spendthrift trust, traditionally \n     set up by one family member to benefit another. But current \n     law does not protect the assets of people who set up \n     spendthrift trusts to benefit themselves. And the law limits \n     the purposes of the trusts that qualify for exemption. \n     Retirement planning or paying for education are two approved \n     purposes for such trusts. By contrast, domestic asset \n     protection trusts can be set up by the same people who plan \n     to benefit from them. In addition, there are no caps on the \n     dollar amount of assets they can hold and no restrictions on \n     their purpose, Ms. Marty-Nelson said. One limitation is that \n     the trusts cannot be set up by people who are already \n     insolvent.\n       The states that allow these trusts do so to attract the \n     significant money management and trustee fees that accompany \n     them, Mr. Hirsch said. ``It's what is known in the parlance \n     of legal policy analysis as a race to the bottom,'' he said.\n       The authors of the Delaware law, for example, noted when it \n     was passed in 1997 that it was meant to ``maintain Delaware's \n     role as the most favored jurisdiction for the establishment \n     of trusts.''\n       In some ways, asset protection trusts are similar to the \n     homestead exemption that keeps homes in Florida, Texas and \n     other states out of the reach of creditors. But the \n     bankruptcy law now under consideration limits this exemption \n     to $125,000 for those who purchased the home within 40 months \n     of their bankruptcy filing or for those who have committed \n     securities fraud.\n       Ms. Marty-Nelson said the bankruptcy bill should at least \n     apply such a cap to domestic asset protection trusts. Better \n     yet, she said, the bill should exclude these trusts from the \n     federal exemption altogether.\n       ``Congress can and should close this huge loophole,'' she \n     said.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe it is critical that we appropriately reform \nour bankruptcy system, and I applaud the efforts of Senator Grassley \nand others to do that. But it is important that we ensure that, \nwherever possible, loopholes subject to abuse are closed. This is just \nsuch a loophole. I hope that my colleagues will join me and Senator \nSchumer in closing this one.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the most disturbing thing about this \nsupposed ``bankruptcy reform'' is the utter lack of fairness and \nbalance in the legislation. It gets tough on working families who are \nfacing financial hardship due to a health crisis, a job loss caused by \na plant closing, or a military call up to active duty. The laws of \nbankruptcy are being changed to wrest every last dollar out of these \nunfortunate families in order to further enrich the credit card \ncompanies.\n  However, the authors of this legislation look the other way when it \ncomes. to closing millionaire's loopholes and ending corporate abuse. \nThe bill fails to deal effectively with the unlimited homestead \nexemptions in a few States which allow the rich to hold on to their \nmulti-million dollar mansions while middle class families in other \nStates lose their modest homes. And, the bill totally fails to address \nthe shocking abuse of millionaires hiding their assets in so-called \n``asset protection trusts,'' placing them completely beyond the reach \nof creditors. They can hold on to their wealth merely by signing a \npaper placing title their bank accounts, stocks, bonds, and other \nholdings in the name of a trust. The wealthy debtors don't even have to \nchange their residences or put all of their money into a country estate \nin Florida or Texas. All they need to do is file a trust document in \none of the five States that allow this subterfuge. They do not have to \nrelinquish control over their property and it can continue to be used \nto support their extravagant lifestyle.\n  Unfortunately, average families facing bankruptcy don't have large \nbank\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\naccounts and stock portfolios so they cannot take advantage of this \nloophole. Most couldn't even afford to hire a lawyer to set up the \ntrust. However, that's all right because the asset protection trust \nscam was not designed for them. It was designed to protect millionaire \ndeadbeats, people who ran their companies into the ground leaving their \ncreditors and their former employees holding the bag. It was designed \nto protect those who took the money and ran.\n  Somehow the authors of this bill, after eight years of studying the \nbankruptcy code in search of ways to tighten the law so that more \npeople would be held accountable for their debts--somehow they \noverlooked this loophole. I wonder how they could have missed this one. \nI guess they were just too busy finding ways to make working families \npay a few more dollars to the credit card companies.\n  Fortunately, the New York Times did expose this outrageous loophole \nand Senator Schumer has offered an amendment to close it. It will \nempower the bankruptcy court to reach out and pull the assets in these \nabusive trusts back into the bankruptcy, using those assets to help pay \ncreditors. The vote on this amendment will be a real test of the \nsincerity of those who say their goal is to hold debtors more \naccountable for the money they owe. I would hope that same desire to \nenforce personal responsibility applies to the millionaire deadbeat who \nhides his assets as well as the working family struggling to survive.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the Schumer amendment. This is \nan issue that just needs more time for us to determine whether there is \nan abuse that needs to be addressed. We need to ensure that this \namendment doesn't have unintended consequences. For instance, it \ndoesn't define the term ``asset protection trust'' and therefore we \naren't even sure what we are being asked to vote on. Further, it not \nonly covers asset protection trusts, but also covers ``similar \ntrusts.'' Until we have had time to really understand whether this is a \nloophole, and if it is, how to close it in a way that doesn't harm \ninnocent third parties.\n  In addition, this issue is even more complex because it implicates 50 \ndifferent State laws. We don't know enough at this point about how it \nworks. This would override at least some State laws, like the homestead \ncap would. I think it is important to look at this issue, have a \nhearing and consult with senators whose States might be uniquely \naffected. Be sure, however, that my opposition to this amendment \ndoesn't mean that I will not ultimately find that this issue needs to \nbe addressed at some future date. I think that all the work we have \ndone on this bill, the compromises we have reached should not be \ndisrupted by this last-minute proposal that has not been well thought \nout.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to a series of stacked votes in relation to the following \namendments: Schumer amendment No. 42 and Rockefeller amendment No. 24; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes; that the second vote be limited to 10 minutes in length; and \nthat there be 1 minute on each side to explain these amendments prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 48\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending Specter amendment No. 48 be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 48) was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nSchumer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Without objection, time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 42 offered by the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr McCONNELL.

Mr. President, let me announce to all Members that \nfollowing the next vote we will vote in relation to the Durbin \namendment No. 49. We will have an explanation of 2 minutes equally \ndivided. Both of these votes are going to be 10 minutes. We are going \nto enforce the time on this vote. Everybody please stay in the Chamber \nat the convenience of all Members so we can finish this vote and the \nnext vote within 10 minutes each, particularly this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote on the Rockefeller amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment is critical to making \ncorporate bankruptcies fairer to the people who have worked in those \ncorporations and toiled during the course of their lives and expect, \nreasonably, at end of their service, to have something to show for it.\n  My amendment does three things.\n  First, it allows employees to recover up to $15,000 in backpay or \nother compensation that is owed them.\n  Second, my amendment would eliminate the accrual time period for \ncalculation of priority claims. And, if we do not eliminate the accrual \nperiod, then increasing wage priority in the bill is meaningless.\n  Finally, my amendment would provide at least some compensation to \nretirees whose promised health insurance has been taken away.\n  Under my proposal, each retiree would be entitled to payment equal to \nthe cost of purchasing comparable health insurance for a period of 18 \nmonths.\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n  I encourage the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the great union leader, John L. Lewis, spoke \nof those who sup at labor's table and who have been sheltered in \nlabor's house.\n  That image thrives in West Virginia, where children are raised to \nbelieve that the fruits of their labor ought to yield a decent wage and \ncomfortable living. Many work long hours, concerned less about titles \nand honors than providing for their families in the present and \nsecuring their retirement in old age.\n  They devote themselves to their labors and take pride in their work \nand their employer. These workers are committed, hard-working \nindividuals who contribute much and ask for nothing more than simple \nfairness. And so imagine how they are made to feel--the anguish, \nfrustration, and betrayal they are made to feel--when they learn the \npension they worked for, the health benefits they labored for, the \nsecurity they toiled for, has vanished.\n  That is what is happening in West Virginia to an alarming degree. \nSpecial Metals, Horizon Natural Resources, Weirton Steel, Wheeling-\nPitt, Kaiser Aluminum--all have filed for bankruptcy, endangering the \nhealth and pension benefits of workers and retirees.\n  I scold not those who have sought to protect their employees but \nthose scoundrels who have used bankruptcy to abandon their obligations.\n  It is shattering to those workers and retirees affected. It cripples \ntheir faith in the moral values of an honest day's work for an honest \nday's pay. It's terrifying for retirees who cannot begin new careers. \nThese independent, proud men and women fear becoming a burden to their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I understand how they are made to feel, and I seek to help them, as I \nalways have sought to help them. I support the Rockefeller amendment, \nand I commend my colleague for his endeavors in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment would provide a nearly \nfourfold increase in claim amounts and strike the time period. That \nmeans it would be much harder to confirm a plan under Chapter 11. It \nwill cost us jobs, because the debtor companies would not be able to \nsurvive the bankruptcy process.\n  My colleague from the Finance Committee is concerned about the co-\nprovisions. Rest assured, they are bad. We all know how many \ncompromises have been made on this bill. This amendment would undo \nyears of hard work.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

EFFECT OF DISCHARGE.\n\n       Section 524 of title 11, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (g)(1), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C)(i) Congress finds that--\n       ``(I) the vermiculite ore mined and milled in Libby, \n     Montana, was contaminated by high levels of asbestos, \n     particularly tremolite asbestos;\n       ``(II) the vermiculite mining and milling processes \n     released thousands of pounds of asbestos-contaminated dust \n     into the air around Libby, Montana, every day, exposing mine \n     workers and Libby residents to high levels of asbestos over a \n     prolonged period of time;\n       ``(III) the responsible party has known for over 50 years \n     that there are severe health risks associated with prolonged \n     exposure to asbestos, including higher incidences of asbestos \n     related disease such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and \n     mesothelioma;\n       ``(IV) the responsible party was aware of accumulating \n     asbestos pollution in Libby, Montana, but failed to take any \n     corrective action for decades, and once corrective action was \n     taken, it was inadequate to protect workers and residents and \n     asbestos-contaminated vermiculite dust continued to be \n     released into the air in and around Libby, Montana, until the \n     early 1990s when the vermiculite mining and milling process \n     was finally halted;\n       ``(V) current and former residents of Libby, Montana, and \n     former vermiculite mine workers from the Libby mine suffer \n     from asbestos related diseases at a rate 40 to 60 times the \n     national average, and they suffer from the rare and deadly \n     asbestos-caused cancer, mesothelioma, at a rate 100 times the \n     national average;\n       ``(VI) the State of Montana and the town of Libby, Montana, \n     face an immediate and severe health care crisis because--\n       ``(aa) many sick current and former residents and workers \n     who have been diagnosed with asbestos-related exposure or \n     disease cannot access private health insurance;\n       ``(bb) the costs to the community and State government \n     related to providing health coverage for uninsured sick \n     residents and former mine workers are creating significant \n     pressures on the State's medicaid program and threaten the \n     viability of other community businesses;\n       ``(cc) asbestos-related disease can have a long latency \n     period;

and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Sessions, on the floor yesterday, \ncriticized Elizabeth Warren's study on bankruptcies, and the high \npercentage of bankruptcy filers who file because of significant debt \nrelated to illness and medical costs, uses.\n  Senator Sessions cited a U.S. Trustee Program ``survey'' from 2002 \nthat looked into medical costs as a factor in bankruptcy. He argued \nthat ``only slightly more than 5 percent of unsecured debt reported in \nthose cases was medically related;'' ``54 percent of the cases listed \nno medical debts whatsoever. I want to repeat that,'' he said.\n  He also said that ``they found that 90 percent of the cases that did \nhave medical debts reported debts of less than $5,000.''\n  Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee last month \nwhich pointed out many of the problems with this U.S. Trustee Program \n``survey'':\n  The survey underreported both the breadth and impact of medical \nbankruptcies because of the way it was conducted.\n  U.S. trustee's sample was limited only to chapter 7 cases and omitted \nchapter 13 cases. Families filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 have \nan annual median income of $19,000. Therefore, the average medical debt \nidentified by the U.S. trustee--the average is $5,000 for those with \nmedical debt--is quite substantial for those families trying to cope \nwith medical problems. Mr. President, $5,000 in medical debt is more \nthan 25 percent of the annual income for that family.\n  The petition data used by the Office of the U.S. Trustee does not \ninclude any medically related debts charged onto credit cards such as \nprescription medications, doctors visits, rehabilitation treatments, \nmedical supplies, hospital bills, or even second mortgages that people \nhave put on their homes to pay off hospital bills and other medical \nexpenses, or cash advances, bank overdrafts or payday loans that people \nhave incurred to pay for medical services when they are delivered or to \npay medical bills that are outstanding. If any of these bills were paid \nby being charged on a credit card, then the trustee's survey would not \ninclude them in its figures.\n  For these and other reasons, the petition data gathered by the U.S. \nTrustee Program provides very little information about medical \nbankruptcy. This is why it is so important to survey the\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\ndebtors themselves in order to collect accurate data, the way the \nHarvard study actually did.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a very heavy heart. And I \nknow the devastation and deep sadness I feel are shared by many in the \nCapitol, in Washington, and throughout America. For with the passing of \nformer Congresswoman Tillie Fowler, America has lost one of her most \naccomplished and dedicated public servants, and I have lost one of my \nmost precious friends.\n  Tillie's remarkable record of public service is well known to many of \nmy colleagues. It began over three decades ago, when she worked as a \nlegislative staff member here on Capitol Hill. Her talents soon \nattracted the attention of Virginia Knauer, Special Assistant to the \nPresident for Consumer Affairs. It was there that Tillie and I worked \nside by side and bonded as lifelong friends.\n  Following her marriage, she and her beloved husband, Buck, moved to \nFlorida, where they would raise two wonderful daughters--Tillie Anne, \nand my goddaughter, Elizabeth. Tillie also devoted her talents and her \nenormous energy to her community as a volunteer serving in numerous \nleadership positions. She was President of the Jacksonville City \nCouncil--the first woman ever to hold that position, and the first \nRepublican to preside over the council in more than a century. This, \ndespite the fact that the Council consisted of 16 Democrats and only 3 \nRepublicans. Clearly, Tillie's intelligence, integrity, and leadership \nskills were respected across party lines.\n  In 1992, Tillie ran for the United States House of Representatives. \nHer popularity was so great that the incumbent Congressman decided to \nretire rather than run against her.\n  As those who served with her know, Tillie quickly earned a reputation \nas one of the hardest working and most effective Members of Congress. \nShe was recognized as one of the 1 most thoughtful and visionary \nmembers of the House Armed Services Committee, and the 8 years she \nspent in the halls of the Capitol were full of accomplishments.\n  She became the highest ranking woman on either side of Capitol Hill, \nwhen her colleagues selected her as Vice Chair of the Republican \nConference.\n  Term-limiting herself, she retired from Congress, but not from public \nservice. Time and again she was called on by our Nation's leaders to \nserve in important and sensitive assignments. Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld named her Chair--the first female Chair--of the Defense Policy \nBoard Advisory Committee, and he appointed her to lead the seven member \npanel created by Congress to review misconduct allegations at the Air \nForce Academy. He turned to her again for a blue-ribbon panel to \nprovide independent professional advice on Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison.\n  Tillie Fowler was a role model of what a servant of the public should \nbe. And she was the finest friend that one could have. Loyal and \ncaring, she was like a sister to me--always there, always reaching out, \nalways searching for ways in which she could help.\n  Poet Robert Frost wrote: ``As dawn goes down to day; Nothing gold can \nstay.'' Tillie was pure gold. She will live forever in my heart.\n  Bob and I send our strongest support, our love, our prayers to \nTillie's family.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nNorth Carolina to speak about our great loss, the loss of a great \nfriend, the passing of Congresswoman Tillie Fowler of Jacksonville. \nTillie was taken from us suddenly yesterday, passing from this Earth to \na better life, and we are sad and shocked by this terrific loss that \nthe State and the Nation has suffered.\n  In every way, Tillie was a great lady. She had such a unique \ncombination of strengths that she has been referred to as a ``steel \nmagnolia.'' She was ever gracious and kind and a gentle soul, but at \nthe same time she was firm in her convictions. Even though Tillie had \nleft the House of Representatives, people in the highest levels of \nGovernment, as pointed out by my colleague from North Carolina, \ncontinually sought her advice and counsel.\n  Most recently she had served on the Defense Policy Board Advisory \nCommittee, which provides counsel to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld on \npolicy and strategy.\n  I relied often on her sound judgment and advice. Most recently we \nwere talking about the Mayport Naval Base in Florida and the USS \nKennedy, and what the Florida delegation should do in order to ensure \nthe long-term viability of Mayport. She was an instrumental adviser to \nGovernor Jeb Bush on the BRAC and BRAC process.\n  Tillie was a great friend and personal counselor to me. It was only \nabout this time a year ago that she and I were standing near the St. \nJohn's River in Jacksonville and she announced her support for my \ncandidacy for the Senate. I am so grateful for her support, and so \nproud to have had the faith of Tillie Fowler in my candidacy. Her \nwisdom will be missed, but her legacy is firmly in place.\n  Tillie Fowler began her life as a public servant shortly after \nearning her law degree from Emory University. She came to Washington to \nwork for 3 years as a legislative assistant to Representative Robert \nStephens of Georgia, and shortly thereafter she went to work at the \nNixon White House in the Office of Consumer Affairs.\n  At the White House, Tillie made one of her dearest lifelong friends, \nour colleague Senator Elizabeth Dole. Tillie and her husband Buck even \nnamed one of their daughters Elizabeth in honor of that wonderful \nfriendship. Tillie looked to Elizabeth Dole as a role model for working \nwomen, as someone who could be strong without being hard edged, and she \nfollowed that example of success. I extend to my colleague my deepest \ncondolences on the loss of your good and dear friend.\n  After her tenure at the White House, she and Buck moved back to \nJacksonville, FL, where they settled down to raise a family. She became \nactive in a number of community organizations including the American \nRed Cross and the Jacksonville Junior League. She eventually ran for \nthe city council in the 1980s, and served for 7 years, the last year as \ncouncil president. She was the first female, and the first Republican, \nto serve as the president of the Jacksonville city council.\n  In 1992 Tillie Fowler became Congresswoman Tillie Fowler and quickly \nrose to be one of the top ranking women in the House of \nRepresentatives. She became vice chairwoman of the House Republican \nConference and, for 6 years, chief deputy whip. Congresswoman Fowler \nserved on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on \nTransportation as well. Both committees allowed her to become a \nsuccessful advocate for the city of Jacksonville and for the State of \nFlorida. But I think Tillie will always be remembered for her great \ngrasp of defense policy, her impassioned advocacy on behalf of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  In the year 2000, Congresswoman Fowler voluntarily stepped down to \nhonor a pledge she had made to self-limit and return to private life. \nWithout a doubt, the most important legacy left behind by our friend \nTillie Fowler is her family--her husband Buck, and their two daughters \nElizabeth and Tillie.\n  Our hearts are with you. Our thoughts and prayers go out to you \nduring this difficult time.\n  We will miss her greatly and may God bless her.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am saddened by the passing of Tillie \nFowler. My wife and I had the privilege of traveling with her overseas, \nand I found her to be a wonderful person.\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nTillie Fowler had a sparkle in her eye, and she had a warm way about \nher. We enjoyed her company. I think everybody who dealt with her \nrespected Tillie Fowler's intelligence, her compassion, and her serious \ninterest in making good policy for the country. I respected her \ncontribution to her State and to our country. My wife and I commented \nmany times after that trip what a delightful time we had with Tillie \nFowler. We express our condolences to the family as well.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I join my colleague from North Carolina in \nexpressing my condolences to the family, and express how much I \nrespected Tillie Fowler.\n  I had an opportunity to say hello to her a little over a week ago. \nShe was so happy and vibrant. Her sudden passing was very much a shock \nto me. It reminds all of us just how fragile life can be.\n  I had an opportunity to get to know Tillie Fowler when I served in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives with her. She was a wonderful person \nand highly respected in the House of Representatives. I do not recall \none person in the whole body, whether they opposed or supported her, \nwho had cross words to say to Tillie Fowler. She was always well \nprepared, always courteous, and always somebody you admired when you \nserved with her and got to know her.\n  I worked closely with her on a number of defense issues because that \nwas her life's love. I had a chance to get to know her more closely \nwhen we had an issue in Colorado with the Air Force Academy. As you may \nrecall, when we set up a commission, which she chaired, it was called \nthe Fowler Commission.\n  I reflect on the type of respect she garnered from everybody who was \naround her. When we put her on that commission, we knew she would do a \ngood job. We named the commission after her because of the respect we \nhad for her. It was a difficult task. She did it with honor. She was \nvery hard working and pursued it vigorously. She did a great job.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing my condolences to the family, and \nexpress how much we all loved her. We will miss her. May God bless.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I know I will be joined by the \nPresiding Officer in the shock and sadness that exists because of the \nloss of Tillie Fowler.\n  Tillie was a friend of mine long before I ever got involved in \npolitics. I have lived in Georgia for 37 years. You can't live in \nGeorgia without knowing the Kidd family. Tillie grew up in \nMilledgeville, GA. Her dad, Culver Kidd, was a longtime State senator, \nknown as ``the silver fox.'' He was quite a gentlemen and quite a \nlegend in his own time in Georgia politics.\n  Tillie was a great mentor to me during my 8 years in the House, as I \nknow she was to the Presiding Officer. As I told her husband Buck last \nnight, I fought many battles with her. Of all the people I was \nassociated with in the House and in this body, there was nobody I would \nrather have had in that foxhole with me when I was fighting a battle \nthan Tillie Fowler. She was a great lady who exemplified everything \nthat is good about the Congress, and she will be dearly missed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S1998-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1998-S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MINORITY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on Tuesday morning just past, we had \nour usual Democratic Senate caucus lunch. We discuss lots of things at \nthose lunch meetings. But we were all struck by an appeal from our \ndearly beloved colleague Senator Robert C. Byrd, whom I consider a dear \nfriend of long standing. I have been here over 20 years. When he rose \nto encourage all of us to resist subverting existing Senate rules to \nbypass an important process which permitted the minority in the Senate \nto challenge the Senate Republican majority to run roughshod over the \nrights of the minority, to exercise longstanding rules that permitted \nthem a voice, Senator Byrd pleaded with us, not as a Democrat, not as a \npartisan, but as citizens and Senators, to fight to preserve the rights \nof a minority by being able to use a tactic called a filibuster as a \nmeans of protection for the minority.\n  We have to remember that in the recent elections for President, 57 \nmillion people voted for John Kerry, and they were a minority. This \nSenate decides to ignore those voices and concerns of a minority of \nthat size?\n  The Senators who voted against cloture recently represented 19 \nmillion more constituents than the majority. Can that be constructed as \na tyranny of the minority when the Senators who were against cloture \nrepresented 19 million people more than the majority who wanted \ncloture? Tyranny of the minority. Outrageous.\n  Senator Byrd pleaded with Members to remind our Republican colleagues \nthat such a rules change could once be at their expense, that their \nconstituents could be deprived of their appropriate rights to a voice \nin legislative or executive matters.\n  I offer these comments as a prelude to remarks I am about to make. We \nhave seen some ugly personal attacks recently by the Republican Party \nagainst our Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid. He was called an \nobstructionist. He was referred to in sarcastic and insulting terms, as \nwell as our former majority leader, Senator Robert C. Byrd, and \nDemocratic Party chairman Howard Dean.\n  The other side cannot beat us with the strength of their ideas. They \nare resorting to the same tactics they used against Senator Daschle--\npersonal attacks on family members and attacks on character. This is \nshameless behavior.\n  Not too long ago we had an election in Georgia in which Max Cleland, \na former Senator, a triple amputee, was portrayed as being soft on \ndefense. He was being portrayed as a coward when it came to defending \nour country. He lost three limbs, two legs and an arm, in the defense \nof his Nation. And they succeeded with these shameless tactics.\n  We see a continuation of that. It has to stop. Whenever they are \nshort of ideas, they are long on insults, with shameless name-calling.\n  Yesterday, a group calling itself the Republican Jewish Coalition \nattacked Senator Byrd over a historical reference he made on Hitler's \nrise to power in Germany. It was not an anti-Semitic remark. I resent \nthe fact they are raising that kind of an insinuation. I am proud of my \nAmerica. I am proud of my citizenship and the duty I served my country \nwith when I wore a uniform and that I serve my country with now. I am \nalso proud of my Jewish heritage. I resent it when any group steps up \nto use the shameless insinuations and challenges and insults being put \nforward.\n  Senator Byrd is known by everyone in this Chamber and people who have \nserved for many years past as a great historian. He uses lessons from \nhistory to teach. On Tuesday just past, Senator Byrd at our luncheon \nissued a stern warning before we do anything irresponsible such as \nchanging longstanding Senate rules with this notorious nuclear option \nwhich says reduce the numbers needed to object to something the \nmajority has proposed.\n  That is the structure of democracy. Minority voices are to be heard. \nWe say it in our Constitution. We say it in our courtrooms. It does not \nmatter where.\n  Senator Byrd's warning came in the form of a lesson of history. He \nsimply said that when you change the rules, you change the laws to suit \nyour convenience, you are engaged in a tyranny. As the saying goes, \nthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n  Senator Byrd talked about how a threatened filibuster in this Senate \ndefeated FDR's plan to pack the Supreme Court. We are talking about a \nDemocratic President. That was an option that was available according \nto the rules that the minority could use. Senator Byrd reminded the \nSenate the other day how in Germany Adolf Hitler twisted the Reichstag \nto pass his enabling act, the act that removed the obstructions that \nwere blocking Hitler's plans. It was a historical lesson we should pay \nattention to. But now, Senator Byrd's words are being twisted by this \ngroup.\n  To show some of the shameless tactics they are using, look at this \npicture. It shows masked men, obviously suicide bombers, with a child \nstrapped with explosives and suggesting that Democrats are responsible \nfor this kind of a condition. It is an outrage. We will not stand \nsilent when the Republican National Committee encourages this\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nkind of behavior. That is how they beat Max Cleland, and that is how \nthey beat Senator Daschle. We are not going to let them win without \ntelling the American people this is a shameful kind of tactic. They \nhave no scruples when they do something like this.\n  No one is suggesting the Republicans are a disloyal party or that \nthey have a particular hate design to their association. But when any \ngroup associated with the party suggests that suicide bombers are \nsomething that Democrats encourage, to trifle with the loss of life \nthat occurred in Israel, and now we see it in Baghdad--how do we feel \nabout our soldiers serving so bravely and gallantly in Iraq, losing \ntheir lives? How do we feel about the Iraqis who lost over 100 of their \ncitizens in one day in a suicide bomb attack? We feel terrible.\n  As a consequence, when something like this, something as scurrilous \nas this is used, we will condemn it. We are proud of Senator Byrd. He \nhas served this country nobly for many years. Did we disagree with him \non some things? Absolutely. We disagree with each other on many \noccasions. That is what our responsibility is, to disagree when we \nthink something is wrong.\n  I hope this group will not continue this insinuation that Democrats \nare disloyal, that Democrats would stand for suicide bombers who kill \nnot only Israelis, who kill our soldiers. Is that what they want to say \nabout Democrats? Perhaps a look in the mirror by people at the top of \nthe administration to examine their own military service and see if \nthey were there to protect the rights of our people.\n  Use a tactic like this? It cannot work, it shouldn't work, and it \nwon't work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S1999-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MAX M.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a soldier who has \nfallen in service to his country in Iraq. SSG Eric Steffeney of the \n18th Ordnance Company died on the 23rd of February near Tuz, Iraq, when \nan undetected explosive detonated while he cleared the road of \nlandmines. He was 28 years old and is survived by his mother, Annette, \nhis father, Gary, his wife, Theresa, and their three children, \nBenjamin, Caitlin, and Dennis.\n  Staff Sergeant Steffeney grew up in Waterloo, IA, where he attended \nWest High School. He graduated from high school early and enlisted in \nthe Army when he was 17 years old. Initially serving as a paratrooper, \nStaff Sergeant Steffeney eventually joined the Army's bomb squad \nbecause he thought it would be more challenging. He was finishing his \nsecond tour of duty when he was killed.\n  Staff Sergeant Steffeney was described as a quiet, loyal, and \nresponsible man who was a good soldier and an all-American boy. Indeed, \nit is the dedicated and courageous people such as SSG Eric Steffeney \nwho embody the ideals of this great country best and, through the way \nthey lived and gave their lives, keep her people standing proud and \nstrong. I ask all of my colleagues to remember with pride and \nappreciation this soldier. I give my condolences to the family and \nfriends of Staff Sergeant Steffeney who have felt this loss most \ndeeply. I offer my most sincere gratitude and respect to SSG Eric \nSteffeney. This country is forever indebted to him and his colleagues \nfor the sacrifices they have made to uphold the ideals which we \ntreasure most as Americans.\n\n\n                   staff sergeant william t. robbins\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, Today, I rise to honor the life of SSG \nWilliam Robbins. At home in Arkansas, he was, above all else, a loving \nfamily man who devoted himself entirely to his wife and his children. \nOn the front lines of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he was a dedicated \nsoldier who bravely fought to bring security and stability to a nation \ntorn apart by war.\n  Staff Sergeant Robbins was born and raised in the small, southern \nMissouri town of Poplar Bluff. He spent his childhood, as many children \ndo, playing with his friends with whom he shared a love for the \noutdoors. From an early age, he knew he wanted to be a soldier, and \nregardless of where he was or what he did, that thought was never far \nfrom his mind.\n  In 1990, he moved to Arkansas and settled in the North Little Rock \narea. It was there he met the love of his life, his future wife \nKimberly, and together they would raise two beautiful daughters, 5-\nyear-old Tristan Ellis, and Abigail, who was less than a year old. It \nwas clear to those who knew him best that his family was his pride and \njoy and he cherished every minute he spent with them. This fun-loving \nsoul had a special affinity for children and at family gatherings was \noften found with the youngest of the group, playing games and bringing \nsmiles to everyone's faces.\n  In the Arkansas National Guard, SSG Robbins worked full-time as \nadministrative sergeant at the Guard's armory in Beebe. Last year, he \nwas one of only about a dozen soldiers from the armory mobilized for \nduty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. It would prove to be a bittersweet \ntime for the Robbins family; just as the family welcomed home William's \nmother Janice, a major in the Army Reserves returning from a deployment \nin Germany, they bid him farewell with prayers of a safe return.\n  Staff Sergeant Robbins' deployment was the first in his 11-year \nservice in the Arkansas National Guard. While in Iraq, he was attached \nto the 206th Field Artillery Battalion of the 39th Infantry Brigade, \nand was selected to work in a military advisory capacity with the Iraqi \nNational Guard. As American forces sought to transition more of their \nsecurity and stabilization responsibilities to the Iraqi people, SSG \nRobbins advised and trained these civilian volunteers on infantry \ntactics as well as the fundamental aspects of being a soldier.\n  Last fall, SSG Robbins took his military leave and was able to return \nhome for a short time. It was a much-needed reprieve from the dangers \nof Iraq and offered him the opportunity to return to the place he \ncalled home and spend time with the people he cared for most. It also \noffered him the opportunity to explain to Tristan, who was simply too \nyoung to fully understand, why her father had been away and when he \nwould be back for good. As best he could, he explained to her the \ncircumstances of his absence and even the possibility that he may not \nreturn. He was once a young man with a parent in the military and could \nrelate to the lack of comprehension children often have in these \nsituations. Relying on this perspective, as well as the natural gift he \nhad always shown in relating to children, Tristan's father was able to \nprovide her with some much needed comfort and understanding.\n  Along with many of the soldiers from the 39th, SSG Robbins' mission \nwas soon coming to an end and he was to scheduled to return to Arkansas \nin late March or April. Upon his return, he was looking forward to a \nnew job with the Arkansas National Guard at Camp Robinson's Regional \nTraining Institute in North Little Rock. Even more so, he was looking \nforward to being reunited with his family. When he spoke with Kimberly, \nhe reminded her how very much he loved her and couldn't wait to come \nhome. When he spoke with Tristan, he told her how much he looked \nforward to seeing her again so he could take her in his arms and swing \nher like an airplane.\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\n  Tragically, he passed away on February 10 from a gunshot wound at his \nhome base at Camp Taji. While the loss for Kimberly and her family will \nbe felt deeply, they have found some solace knowing that his last days \nwere spent doing what he wanted to do, helping people. In the days \nfollowing his death, it was clear to his family the impact he had on \neach of their lives. It was also quickly apparent that although he was \nno longer with them, his presence would always be felt; whether it was \nthe devotion and thoughtfulness evident in the basket of chocolates and \nValentine's Day card he sent Kimberly just before his death, the spirit \nembodied in the eyes of Abigail who turned 1 year old on February 23, \nor the courage that Tristan, thanks to her father, has shown in trying \nto understand what has happened. They are lasting examples of not only \nthe remarkable way he led his life, but more importantly, are a \ntestament to the kind of man he was.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of William \nRobbins, and to all those who knew and loved him. His 31 years with us \nwere far too short, but his legacy of love and service to his Nation \nwill remain with us forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On October 2, 2004, Daniel Fetty was brutally beaten to death.

Mr. President, this week is National Peace Corps Week. \nIt is with great pleasure that I send my congratulations to the Peace \nCorps volunteers serving throughout the world as we celebrate the Peace \nCorps' 44th year of service.\n  Currently, more than 7,700 volunteers are answering the call to serve \nin 72 countries around the world. It is a list that is growing. In an \nhistoric agreement focused on science and technology, the Peace Corps \nentered Mexico last year. And over 20 other countries have expressed \ninterest in establishing a partnership with the Peace Corps.\n  Peace Corps volunteers have made a 27-month commitment to serve \noverseas typically in undeveloped or rural areas devoid of many modern \nnecessities such as sanitation, transportation, and electricity. They \nwork to achieve the first goal of the Peace Corps: training and \neducating people around the world. Volunteers are serving as teachers, \nbusiness advisors, information technology consultants, agricultural \nworkers, and as HIV/AIDS educators. Today over 3,100 Peace Corps \nvolunteers are helping to implement President Bush's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief.\n  Even as they work on their projects to help those in the countries \nthey serve, Peace Corps volunteers become America's unofficial \n``ambassadors'' of goodwill, fulfilling the Peace Corps' second goal of \nhelping to promote a better understanding of America. In the words of \nformer U.S. Ambassador Tibor Nagy: ``During my long overseas service, I \nconsistently met two categories of people who were highly favorable \ntoward our country: those who had close contact with Peace Corps \nvolunteers, and those who had studied in the U.S.'' These kinds of \npublic diplomacy efforts are more important today than ever.\n  What's more, Peace Corps volunteers' unofficial ``ambassador'' duties \ndo not conclude when they return home to the United States. Rather, \nthey set about completing the third goal of the Peace Corps by \npromoting a better understanding of other countries here in America. In \nthis way, Peace Corps volunteers give back much to their communities \nhere at home.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, \nand Narcotics Affairs, it is my desire to continue to assist in the \ngrowth of Peace Corps, and the well-being of its volunteers. As the \nPeace Corps continues to expand, I believe it is necessary to provide \nthis agency the resources it needs to continue to ensure volunteer \nsafety, productivity, and satisfaction. And I applaud efforts by the \nPeace Corps to further diversity our volunteers.\n  It is my pleasure to recognize 223 Minnesota volunteers who right now \nare serving our Nation around the globe in countries from Albania to \nUzbekistan. I would also like to recognize the over 5,000 returned \nPeace Corps volunteers who have already represented Minnesota and the \nUnited States abroad. Finally, I am happy to join with all past and \npresent Peace Corps volunteers as we celebrate Peace Corps Week 2005, \nFebruary 28-March 6.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of the Peace Corps during National Peace Corps Week--\nFebruary 28 through March 6.\n  For 44 years, the Peace Corps has engaged in meaningful work and made \ninnumerable contributions to both America and the countries served by \nCorps members. Today, more than 2,700 Peace Corps volunteers are \nworking to train men and women in 72 countries to provide for their own \nneeds, as well as to promote mutual understanding between Americans and \nother cultures.\n  It gives me great pride to know that the Peace Corps and the people \nof Wisconsin have a strong relationship. Right now, there are 289 Peace \nCorps volunteers from Wisconsin, including 137 volunteers from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison--more volunteers than any other \nuniversity in the Nation. The State of Wisconsin can also be proud that \nthe university served as a training ground for many groups bound for \nservice in the early years of the Peace Corps.\n  To better illustrate the work that Wisconsinites do for the Peace \nCorps, I would like to share this story of great accomplishment. In \nAugust 2004, for the first time, the Peace Corps honored returned \nvolunteers with an award recognizing efforts to promote a better \nunderstanding by Americans of other cultures. This award was presented \nto the Returned Peace Corps Volunteers of the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison. Since 1987, the group has raised money by selling calendars \nwith pictures of Peace Corps experiences from around the world. The \nmoney is used to promote grassroots projects in countries where the \nvolunteers served. The group also works to raise awareness about the \nPeace Corps and participates in charity events.\n  This story is both an inspiration and a call to further service. The \n$98,000 that the Returned Peace Corp Volunteers of Wisconsin-Madison \ndonated over a 2-year period to the Peace Corps Partnership Program is \na wonderful and meaningful achievement. It is my hope that other people \nin Wisconsin and throughout the United States will view these returned \nvolunteers as role models.\n  In closing, I wish to thank the 171,000 Americans who have served in \nthe Peace Corps since 1961 and extend special recognition to the 4,409 \nWisconsinites counted among that number. The work of the Peace Corps \nhas made an extraordinarily valuable difference to so many people \nthroughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2000-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2000-S2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING WOMEN IN SCIENCE WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today \nto publicly recognize South Dakota's Women in Science Conference that \nis taking place March 7-11, 2005.\n  Hosted by the National Weather Service, this conference introduces\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\njunior and senior high school females to the multitude of opportunities \navailable to women in science- and math-related occupations. Studies \nindicate that, while females thrive in science and mathematics in grade \nschool, far too frequently female students lose interest in these \nsubjects by the time they reach graduation. As Kristine Thompson, a \ngeologist and curator of the Mammoth Site's In-Situ Bonebed notes, ``In \nthe past, many girls and young women with an interest in science and \nmath often were redirected to other fields. Although women account for \nhalf of the work force, they constitute less than 20 percent of \nscientists.''\n  Consequently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's, \nNOAA, National Weather Service forecast offices in Aberdeen, Rapid \nCity, and Sioux Falls, in conjunction with local and State agencies, \nschools, and businesses, are cohosting Women in Science conferences \nthroughout South Dakota. These symposiums, created 5 years ago by the \nAberdeen National Weather Service, are designed to foster personal \nconnections between accomplished professional women scientists and \nfemale students. The Women in Science Conference creates a unique forum \nwhere successful female scholars and professionals meet and hopefully \ninspire young women to continue developing and cultivating their \ninterests in the natural and physical sciences. To demonstrate the \nsignificance of these events, Governor Mike Rounds, by Executive \nProclamation, declared this week ``Women in Science Week in South \nDakota.''\n  Among the notable guests featured throughout the week is keynote \nspeaker Karen Stoos. Karen is a native of Hoven, SD, and is currently a \nbiologist at the Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch of the National \nHuman Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, MD. Other presenters' \nareas of expertise span the fields of geology, animal science, \nengineering, medicine, and metrology. Additionally, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the National Weather Service, and \nthe Girl Scouts will have exhibits and representatives in attendance. \nMore than 1,000 seventh through twelfth-grade students and teachers are \nalready registered to attend.\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to share with my colleagues this \nexciting and significant series of events, and I am very pleased that \nthe conference's efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated. I \nstrongly commend the hard work and dedication of the National Weather \nService and all of the sponsors of the Women in Science Conference, as \ntheir contributions will positively impact the lives of so many young \nwomen in South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2001-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMMENDING IFES\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter from Secretary Rice to IFES President Richard Soudriette dated \nFebruary 28, 2005, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the, material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2005.\n     Mr. Richard Soudriette,\n     President, International Foundation for Election Systems, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Soudriette: On behalf of the Department of State, \n     I would like to offer my thanks for the International \n     Foundation for Election Systems' role in supporting the \n     recent elections in Iraq. On January 30 we saw millions of \n     Iraqis brave intimidation and threats of death to demonstrate \n     their commitment to democracy. We are heartened by this \n     process for the future of vibrant, thriving democracy in \n     Iraq.\n       The success of this first step in Iraq's transition to \n     democracy is due in no small part to your organization's \n     diligence and the dedication of your highly skilled staff. \n     IFES's guidance on election regulations and operations, \n     complaints adjudication, and public information not only \n     helped to ensure transparency but also served to buoy \n     confidence that these historic elections were indeed credible \n     and transparent. Additionally, IFES's continuing role in \n     building the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq's \n     capacity for future electoral events will buttress Iraq's \n     evolving democratic institutions.\n       Thank you again for your great contribution to the future \n     of Iraq. Together, we will help the Iraqi people realize \n     their dream of living in a free and democratic society.\n           Sincerely,\n     Condoleezza Rice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2001-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2001-S2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           CASUALTIES IN IRAQ\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 1,500 American service men and \nwomen have been killed in Iraq, and more than 11,000 have been wounded.\n  We were all moved by the Iraqi elections last month. I and all \nAmericans support the creation of a legitimate, functioning Iraq \nGovernment that guarantees the rights of all Iraqis. We all want \ndemocracy in Iraq to take root firmly and irrevocably.\n  But we also want to know when we will have achieved our mission in \nIraq and when our 135,000 soldiers will be able to return home with \ndignity and honor.\n  At a March 1 hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee, General \nAbizaid, the leader of the Central Command, gave the clearest \nindication so far about when our mission might end.\n  General Abizaid said, ``I believe that in 2005, the most important \nstatement that we should be able to make is that in the majority of the \ncountry, Iraqi security forces will take the lead in fighting the \ncounterinsurgency. That is our goal.''\n  About the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces, General Abizaid \nsaid, ``I think in 2005 they'll take on the majority of the tasks \nnecessary to be done.''\n  If the Iraqis make the significant progress this year that General \nAbizaid expects, it is perfectly logical to expect that a large number \nof American troops will be able to return home.\n  Our troops are clearly still needed to deal with the insurgency. But \nthere is wide agreement that the presence of American troops is also \nfueling the insurgency and making it more difficult to defeat.\n  After the election, the administration announced that 15,000 American \ntroops added to provide security for the elections would return, and \nadditional troops should be able to return this year. Doing so would \nclearly help take the American face off the occupation and send a \nclearer signal to the Iraqi people that we have no long-term designs on \ntheir country.\n  In the February 28 edition of US News and World Report, General \nAbizaid emphasized this basic point. He said ``An overbearing presence, \nor a larger than acceptable footprint in the region, works against you \n. . . The first thing you say to yourself is that you have to have the \nlocal people help themselves.''\n  Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the same point in a hearing at the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on February 3. He said, ``I have talked \nto some of our commanders in the area. They believe that over the \ncourse of the next six months you will see whole areas of Iraq \nsuccessfully handed over to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police.''\n  Before the election, the administration repeatedly stated that 14 of \nthe 18 provinces in Iraq are safe. We heard a similar view in a \nbriefing from Ambassador Negroponte.\n  If some areas can be turned over to the Iraqis in the next 6 months, \nas Secretary Wolfowitz indicated, it should be done. It would be a \npowerful signal to the Iraqi people that the United States is not \nplanning a permanent occupation of their country. If entire areas are \nbeing turned over to the Iraqis, we should be able to bring many \nAmerican troops home.\n  The road ahead will be difficult because the violence is far from \nended. Sixty-six Americans soldiers have been killed in the 31 days \nsince the election an average of two a day. But the election has \nproduced new hope, and the Iraqi people are now forming the \nTransitional Government that will write a new constitution for the \ncountry and hold elections next December for the permanent new \ngovernment that will lead their new democracy.\n  We all hope for success in Iraq, and appropriate withdrawals of our \nforces can clearly be an important factor in achieving that success.\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\n  The President's commitment to keeping American troops in Iraq as long \nas it takes and not a day longer is not enough for our soldiers and \ntheir loved ones. They deserve a clearer indication of what lies ahead, \nand so do the American people. General Abizaid has begun to provide \nclarification of that very important issue, and I hope the President \nwill as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2002-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HARLEY-DAVIDSON KANSAS CITY ASSEMBLY PLANT\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nworkers at Harley-Davidson's Kansas City Assembly Plant for their hard \nwork and to salute Harley-Davidson for all of the great things they \nhave done for the State of Missouri since locating the plant here just \na few years ago.\n  Harley-Davidson is the oldest and largest motorcycle manufacturer in \nthe U.S. The Kansas City plant, one of only two Harley-Davidson final \nassembly plants in the country, produces the Sportster, the Dyna Glide, \nand the V-Rod, and ships those motorcycles all over the world. The \nplant, which employs over 900 people, opened in 1998, and has achieved \nits intended goal of significantly increasing Harley-Davidson's \nproduction capacity and productivity.\n  Every September, the plant hosts an open house for Platte County \nresidents and Harley enthusiasts from across the country to tour the \nplant and learn about how motorcycles are built. Best of all, anyone \nwith a motorcycle license can take the opportunity to test ride a brand \nnew Harley.\n  Harley-Davidson's contributions to the Kansas City area are important \nto job creation and sustaining economic growth, and Missourians are \nproud to have such an iconic symbol of the American spirit located in \nour State. I am honored to share their accomplishments with you today, \nand I wish the workers at the Kansas City Plant success in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2002-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 27.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of Ohio relative to the Clear Skies Act of 2005; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 20\n\n       Whereas although the nation's air quality has improved \n     significantly since the early 1970's, pollutants such as \n     sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury continue at \n     levels that cause environmental and public health concerns. \n     Because of those concerns, the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency has established stricter National Ambient \n     Air Quality Standards, most recently for ozone and \n     particulate matter; and\n       Whereas currently, 474 counties, including 33 in Ohio, are \n     in nonattainment with the ozone standard and 224 counties, \n     including 32 in Ohio, are in nonattainment with the \n     particulate matter standard. Nonattainment designations place \n     a significant burden on state and local governments, which \n     must develop plans to reduce emissions and come into \n     attainment by a specific date; and\n       Whereas in order to ensure that the states have the most \n     effective means of attaining the new standards, the Clear \n     Skies Act of 2005 (S. 131) has been introduced in the United \n     States Senate. This legislation not only is based on the \n     successful Acid Rain Programs, it also incorporates a multi-\n     emissions approach that takes advantage of the benefits that \n     would result from controlling multiple pollutants at the same \n     time; and\n       Whereas the Clear Skies Act balances environmental, energy, \n     and economic needs. For example, it requires power plants to \n     reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and \n     mercury by 70% by 2018 and allows the nation to continue \n     burning coal, our most abundant and low-cost energy source, \n     while improving our nation's air quality: Now, therefore be \n     it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the Senate of the 126th \n     General Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Congress of \n     the United States to enact the Clear Skies Act of 2005 in \n     order to improve our nation's air quality and ensure our \n     nation's economic stability; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the members of the Ohio \n     Congressional delegation, and the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-31.

 By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Dole, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Lincoln,

A bill to provide a site for the National Women's History \nMuseum in the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nWomen's History Museum Act of 2005. I appreciate the support of my \ncolleagues who have helped in this important effort and who have agreed \nto be cosponsors, including Senators Landrieu, Dole, Mikulski, \nHutchison, Boxer, Snowe, Cantwell, Murkowski, Clinton, Feinstein, \nLincoln, Murray, Stabenow, Voinovich, Akaka, Bennett, Durbin, \nLautenberg, Sarbanes, and Pryor. I introduced this bill last Congress, \nand it passed the Senate unanimously.\n  The need to establish a museum recognizing the contributions of \nAmerican women is clear. There is currently no national institution in \nthe Washington, D.C. area that is dedicated to the legacy of women's \ncontributions throughout our country's history. Sadly, fewer than 5 \npercent of the Nation's 2,200 National Historic Landmarks are dedicated \nto women, a troubling fact given the significant contributions of women \nthroughout our Nation's history.\n  The proposed legislation would direct the General Services \nAdministration (GSA) to negotiate and enter into an occupancy agreement \nwith the National Women's History Museum, Inc. (NWHM) to establish a \nmuseum in the currently vacant Pavilion Annex of the Old Post Office \nbuilding in Washington, D.C. The NWHM is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, \neducational institution in the District of Columbia that was created to \nresearch and present the historic contributions that women have made to \nall aspects of human endeavor and to present the contributions that \nwomen have made to the Nation in their various roles in family, the \neconomy, and society. In 1999, the President's Commission on the \ncelebrating of Women in American History concluded that ``efforts to \nimplement an appropriate celebration of women's history in the next \nmillennium should include,the designation of a focal point for women's \nhistory in our Nation's capital,'' citing the efforts of the NWHM to \nimplement this goal.\n  The proposed legislation would serve two important purposes: \nCreating, as the President's Commission recommended, a national women's \nmuseum in the District of Columbia and, by designating the Pavilion \nAnnex, utilizing a currently vacant space on Pennsylvania Avenue, \nconsidered ``America's Main Street.''\n  I would note that, last Congress the Government Accountability Office\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\n(GAO) placed real property on its High Risk list noting that vacant and \nunderutilized properties present significant potential risks to Federal \nagencies including lost dollars because of the need for maintenance and \nlost opportunities because the property could be put to more beneficial \nuses. The Annex has been vacant for more than 10 years and it is \nunclear whether, if at all, GSA will be able to generate a use for the \nbuilding. While the adjacent Old Post Office is a national historic \nlandmark, the Annex is not and has sat vacant and deteriorating for \nyears, while Federal dollars are used to keep it maintained and \nsecured.\n\n  In addition, the proposed legislation would generate revenue from \nthis now vacant property for the Federal Government through rental \npayments, based on the fair market value. The museum would also benefit \nthe city by drawing an estimated 1.5 million visitors annually to the \nDistrict and promoting economic activities by attracting tourists.\n  I believe this legislation is clearly a win-win situation.\n  There is strong precedent for this type of legislation. In fact, \nmuseums in the District of Columbia are historically established by \nCongress through legislation that authorizes the use of Federal land or \nbuildings. One recent legislative example is the National Museum for \nAfrican American History and Culture, which identified potential sites \nfor such a Museum. Another example is the National Law Enforcement \nMuseum Act, which authorized the National Law Enforcement Officers' \nMemorial Fund, Inc. to build a Museum on Federal land. The current \nBuilding Museum located in the historic Pension Building was authorized \nby an act of Congress.\n  I believe that just as these museums serve very important public \npurposes of educating visitors about important aspects of our history \nand culture, so also would a national women's history museum fill a \nvoid in telling the story of women in our history.\n  The most compelling reasons to support this important piece of \nlegislation are the stories of the women in American history, who \nhelped change and shape our Nation: Women who were and are trailblazers \nsuch as Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the first woman to serve on the \nSupreme Court; Sally Ride, who was the first American woman in space; \nand Madeleine Albright, who was the first woman U.S. Secretary of \nState. We should ensure that the stories of women with unwavering \nbravery are told. Women like Harriet Tubman, who led slaves to freedom \nusing the underground railroad, and Rosa Parks, who sparked a movement \njust by refusing to sit in the back of a bus. A national museum would \nrecord this history and tells the stories of these pioneering women, so \nthat others might be inspired by them.\n  One woman who inspired me and who is my own role model is the woman \nwho served in the Senate seat that I now hold, Maine's own Margaret \nChase Smith, who was the first woman nominated for president of the \nUnited States by a major political party and the first woman to serve \nin both houses of Congress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in \n1940. She was a woman who embodied the independent spirit of Maine. She \nwas from Skowhegan and was known as a smart, courageous, and \nindependent Member of Congress. Long after it became commonplace for \nwomen to serve in the highest ranks of our government, Senator Smith \nwill be remembered in Maine and the Nation for her courage and service.\n  These women, and many like them, are the reason I am proud to sponsor \na bill directing that the Old Post Office Annex be made available to \nhouse the National Women's History Museum. Women's history needs a \nplace in our Capital and in our collective American history, so that we \nall cannot only learn about our past, but also be inspired to make \nhistory of our own.\n  I urge that my colleagues support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 502. A bill to revitalize rural America and rebuild main street, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, traveling throughout rural Minnesota, I \nsee a very real need for the revitalization and rebuilding of Main \nStreets, and this is why today I am introducing the Rural Renaissance \nAct with my good friends Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator Graham of \nSouth Carolina, and Senator DeWine of Ohio. This legislation \nacknowledges that rural America needs significant infrastructure \ninvestment if it is to join with the rest of the Nation in an economic \nrecovery, and our bill proposes to apply $50 billion toward this end.\n  Many Minnesota cities and towns need help with updating or expanding \ntheir drinking water supply systems or their wastewater treatment \nsystems. The West Central Initiative and the USDA both estimate that \nthere is a $1.5 billion gap between available local, State, and Federal \nresources and the amount needed by Minnesota communities. There are \nsimilar needs in communities throughout the rest of the Nation. \nDecaying physical infrastructure needs to be addressed because it \nimpacts more than just health and quality of life. It also impacts the \nability of a city or town to build housing, provide services, ensure \naccess to information, and grow jobs. Throughout rural America, \nprogress is being made in many areas, but in others, a lack of funding \nis impacting the ability of communities to address very critical albeit \nbasic needs. Here is an example of the physical infrastructure \nchallenges facing rural America: The Environmental Protection Agency \nestimates that communities will need an estimated $300 billion to $1 \ntrillion over the next 20 years to repair, replace, or upgrade drinking \nwater and wastewater facilities, accommodate a growing population, and \nmeet water quality standards.\n  Current residents and businesses of rural communities face a \nchallenge when it comes to accessing the Internet. This reality means \nthat these cities and towns are set back when it comes to attracting \nnew residents and businesses. While the number of broadband subscribers \nhas risen dramatically in recent years, studies conducted by the FCC, \nDOC, and USDA all suggest that urban and high-income areas are far \noutpacing deployment in rural and low-income areas. As a result of \nthese disparities, rural America suffers adverse economic and social \nconsequences. The USDA has reported that in 2000, less than five \npercent of towns with populations of 10,000 or less had access to \nbroadband. Likewise, the Commerce Department has found that 21.2 \npercent of Internet users in urban areas have access to high-speed \nconnections, while only 12.2 percent of Internet users in rural areas \nhave this technology.\n  Housing is essential if communities want to keep the businesses they \nhave or attract new ones. Employers need to know that employees will be \nable to find housing that they can afford in or near the community. \nHousing efforts must emphasize new construction and rehabilitation \nalike. Communities need new units to attract new families and they must \nhave the ability to help residents remodel and renovate existing \nhousing. Housing in rural America is clearly an economic development \nissue. It is clear that these physical infrastructure needs have \nsubstantial financial implications for rural America. Some 1.8 million \nhomes and apartments are moderately or severely substandard. Our Rural \nRenaissance Act addresses these needs. The impact of doing nothing \nposes great risks for the future of rural cities and towns.\n  As you can see, the need for a rural renaissance is clear. Greater \nMinnesota alone needs almost $7 billion over the next 20 years to \nmodernize infrastructure, accommodate the increasing population, and \nmeet current water quality standards. The cost of bringing high speed \nInternet access to the rest of rural America is estimated at about \n$10.9 billion. These are just a couple of examples but the most vivid, \nI think, are just the closed stores you see up and down our Main \nStreets. We'd like to turn these towns around like we did in St. Paul, \nand we can.\n  Our Rural Renaissance Act will fund these infrastructure \nimprovements--and also provide for community facilities and farmer-\nowned and value-added projects--by sending $50 billion out to rural \nAmerica in one to three years at a cost of about $15 billion over 10 \nyears. It can be done through Federal bonds,\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\njust as we helped pay for the costs of World War II and as State and \nlocals pay for many infrastructure developments. The key, however, is \nthat these monies will be made available to States and locals, as well \nas farmer-owned coops and other eligible entities, in the form of \ngrants and low interest loans.\n  We have seen tremendous support from groups back home and across the \ncountry who share a commitment to revitalizing rural America and \nrebuilding our Main Streets. Those supporting this bill include, the \nAssociation of Minnesota Counties, the League of Minnesota Cities, the \nMinnesota Rural Water Association, the Independent Community Bankers of \nMinnesota, the Minnesota Rural Electric Association, the University of \nMinnesota, the Rural Broadband Coalition, the National Council of \nFarmer Cooperatives, the Telecommunications Industry Association, the \nAmerican Sugarbeet Growers Association, Land O' Lakes, the Minnesota \nCorn Growers Association, the AgCountry Farm Credit Services, the \nAgStar Financial Services, the Farm Credit Services of Grand Forks, the \nFarm Credit Services of Minnesota Valley, AgriBank, the Minnesota \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the Minnesota Association of \nCooperatives, the Wisconsin Federation of Cooperatives, the Minnesota \nBarley Growers Association, the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nthe Minnesota Nursery and Landscape Association, the America Soybean \nAssociation, the Minnesota Association of Townships, the Minnesota \nChapter of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \nOfficials, and the Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association.\n  These groups and many others agree with us when we say that we need \nthe Rural Renaissance Act. And we look forward to working with them on \nthis legislation. Together, we can create economic opportunity in rural \nAmerica and grow jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Rural Renaissance Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand Parents as Teachers programs and other \nquality programs of early childhood home visitation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I introduced S. 503, the Education Begins At \nHome Act. It is at the desk. It is cosponsored by Senators Talent and \nDeWine. I invite my colleagues to look at it and join with me in this \nsignificant measure to improve early childhood education and \ndevelopment of our children.\n  Parents as Teachers has worked in Missouri. It is a program which \ninvolves training and assistance for parents of children from birth to \n3 years of\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nage. We have had significant improvements in educational achievements. \nWe have identified problems in children. We have solved problems and \nsaved money by avoiding the necessary, expensive, and very difficult \nremedial efforts. It involves home visits. It involves bringing \nchildren of like age groups together. It works at home. It works for \nthe poorest families. It works for very busy two-working-parent \nfamilies. It works on our military installations.\n  This measure expands from currently 3,300 children whose parents are \nin the program nationally to potentially 2.7 million families with \nyoung children throughout the United States. The program is presently \nin all States, in the Union. This expands on it and makes sure we use \nour early education dollars to the maximum benefit. Get parents \ninvolved. Home visits work.\n  Research has clearly shown that the early years are critical in a \nchild's development and lay the foundation for success in school and in \nlife. The home is the first and most important learning environment for \nchildren, and parents are their child's first and most influential \nteacher.\n  Through parent education and family support, we can promote parents' \nability to enhance their children's cognitive, language, social-\nemotional and physical development--thereby helping parents to prepare \ntheir children for success in school.\n  It only makes sense to equip parents with the skills they need to \nhelp maximize their child's health and development and this is exactly \nwhat the Parents at Teachers Program does.\n  The curriculum is designed to build the foundation of later learning, \nprovide early detection of developmental delays as well as health, \nvision and hearing problems, prevent child abuse and neglect and \nincrease children's school readiness and school success.\n  To achieve these goals, Parents as Teachers provides personalized \nhome visits by trained parent educators, group meetings with other new \nparents and formal screening of vision and hearing.\n  Twenty-one years ago I pushed the Early Childhood Education Act \nthrough the Missouri legislature. During my second term as Governor I \nsigned that ground breaking bill into law which mandated PAT in every \nschool district in the state of Missouri. For me that was the \nculmination of 5 long years of work.\n  One might say I was on a mission. And I was. Because in 1981, I found \nmyself in a similar situation to that of the Missouri's current \nGovernor. I was about to be a new father myself.\n  PAT certainly made a positive difference in my family. PAT helped us \nthrough sleepless nights, teething, and learning the ABC's. My son, \nSam, was probably one of the first babies to benefit from the Parents \nas Teachers materials in Missouri. And countless others have benefited \nsince.\n  What began as an experiment in Missouri has expanded to more than \n3,000 sites in all 50 states, and seven foreign countries. Communities \nall over the world are investing in PAT because the results are \npositive and the cost is low.\n  Anecdotally, I can tell you that parents in PAT know that it is a \ntremendous benefit to them and their children.\n  The scientifically sound research shows that: At age 3, PAT children \nare more advanced in language, social development, problem solving and \nother cognitive abilities, PAT children score higher on kindergarten \nreadiness tests, Children who participate in PAT score higher on \nstandardized measures of reading, math and language in first through \nfourth grades, parents who participate in PAT are more confident about \ntheir parenting and are more involved in their children's schooling--a \nkey component of a child's success in school.\n  Recognizing that all parents need and deserve support in laying a \nstrong foundation for their child's success I will be introducing the \nEducation Begins at Home Act.\n  To date over 2 million families nationwide have received the \neducation and support they need through PAT. While this is a tremendous \naccomplishment, there are more families that can be reached by this \nexceptional program.\n  The Education Begins at Home Act makes a bold federal investment in \nparents by establishing the first, dedicated federal funding stream to \nsupport the expansion of Parents as Teachers--or other home visitation \nprograms--at the state and local level.\n  The $500 million in federal funds over 3 years included in this bill \nwill expand services to over 2.7 million families nationwide.\n  Ten times more families will be served by PAT under this legislation.\n  This bill will: provide $400 million over 3 years to states to expand \naccess to PAT, encourage and foster more collaboration between PAT and \nEarly Head Start Grantees, provide $50 million over 3 years to fund \ninnovative ideas and partnerships at the local level to expand access \nto PAT in communities with limited English proficiency; and provide $50 \nmillion over 3 years to reach more military families by expanding \naccess to PAT in schools and community organizations that serve \nmilitary families.\n  All babies are born to learn and a parent is a child's first and most \nimportant teacher. Parents as Teachers better prepares children for \nsuccess in school and life and helps parents become more active \nparticipants in their child's education.\n  The expansion of Parents as Teachers is a sound investment in the \nfuture of our children and families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 505. A bill to amend the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Act \nof 2000 to adjust the boundary of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage \nArea; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Boundary \nAdjustment Act. This legislation would amend the Yuma Crossing National \nHeritage Act of 2000, Public Law 106-319, to reduce the size of the \nheritage area to conform to the area set forth in the Heritage Area \nManagement Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002.\n  The Yuma Crossing Heritage Area was designated in October 2000. It \nsprung from a preliminary concept plan completed in 1999 by the \nHeritage Area Task Force. The boundaries proposed in that plan included \napproximately 22 square miles, extending from the Colorado River on the \nnorth and west to the Avenue 7E alignment on the east and the 12th \nstreet alignment on the south. These boundaries represented the task \nforce's ``best guess'' as to the cultural landscape warranting \ninclusion in the heritage area. This ``best guess'' was incorporated \ninto the legislation designating the Yuma Crossing National Heritage \nArea.\n  During the development of the final Heritage Area Management Plan, \nwhich was subject to comprehensive community involvement, it became \napparent that the area's boundaries were too large and should be more \nconcentrated along the Colorado River and in historic downtown.\n  Rather than simply leave the boundaries as they were set in the 2000 \nlegislation, we have heard from the community in Yuma that it is \nimportant that we conform the boundaries to those in the agreed-upon \nManagement Plan. Doing so will provide certainty to the heritage area \nand those private landowners who live within its current boundaries. It \nwill allow the heritage area to meet its management goals and \nresponsibilities without the worry that private property rights may be \naffected in the future.\n  This is a non-controversial, straightforward correction. I hope my \ncolleagues will work with me to pass it quickly this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 506. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nscholarship and loan repayment program for public health preparedness \nworkforce development to eliminate critical public health preparedness \nworkforce shortages in Federal, State, local, and tribal public health \nagencies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Durbin to \nintroduce the Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development Act of \n2005. This legislation aims to increase the\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\npipeline of qualified public health workers at the Federal, State, \nlocal and tribal levels by offering scholarships to students going into \nthe public health field. It also encourages current professionals to \nstay in the public health field by providing loan repayments in \nexchange for a commitment of a designated number of years of service in \npublic health.\n  The average age of lab technicians, epidemiologists, environmental \nhealth experts, microbiologists, IT specialists, public health \nadministrators and others who make up the public health workforce is \n47, seven years older than the average age of the Nation's workforce. \nOver the next five years, my State of Nebraska will have more public \nhealth workers who are eligible for retirement than any other state in \nthe Nation.\n  To encourage young people to enter the public health field, this \nlegislation authorizes $35 million per year for scholarships and $195 \nmillion per year for loan repayments. Eighty percent of the funds would \nbe dedicated for state and local public health workers, with bonus \npayments available to those who agree to be placed in under-served \nareas.\n  There are critical public health workforce shortages. We cannot \nafford to lose so many experienced workers just when our public health \nworkforce should be expanding to meet increasing health needs. The \nability of the public health system to respond to emerging infectious \ndiseases like West Nile Virus, food-borne illnesses, or bioterrorism \nrelies on a well-trained, adequately staffed public health network at \nall levels. It is important that we address this problem before it \nbecomes a crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reed, \n        and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 507. A bill to establish the National Invasive Species Council, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senators \nLevin, Stabenow, Reed, and Voinovich to introduce the National Invasive \nSpecies Council Act--a bill to permanently establish the National \nInvasive Species Council. I would like to thank my colleagues for their \nhard work on this legislation.\n  Recognizing the need for better coordination to combat the economic, \necologic, and health threats posed by invasive species, the federal \ngovernment established the National Invasive Species Council by \nExecutive Order in 1999. Today, the Council continues to operate and \ndevelop invasive species management plans. However, the Council is not \nas effective as it could be. The GAO reported that implementing these \nmanagement plans is difficult because the Council does not have a \ncongressional mandate to act. GAO further reported that most of the \nagencies that have responsibilities under the National Invasive Species \nManagement Plan have not been completing activities by established due \ndates and that these agencies lack coordination. These are significant \nproblems that must be addressed.\n  Invasive species are a national threat that we cannot afford to \nignore. Many states are trying to combat these species that are \nthreatening their local environments. Examples of such plants and \nanimals include the emerald ash borer, which has been particularly \ntroublesome in my home state of Ohio; the Chinese mitten crab; and \nhydrilla, considered to be one of the most problematic aquatic plants \nin the United States. If left unchecked, these and other invasive \nspecies pose dangerous environmental, health, and economic threats. \nEstimates of the annual economic damages caused by invasive species in \nthis nation are as high as $137 billion. It is clear that more must be \ndone.\n  To combat the serious threats posed by invasive species, we need \nfederal coordination and planning. Our bill would provide just that and \non a permanent basis. Under this legislation, the Secretaries of State, \nCommerce, Transportation, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, \nInterior, Defense, and Treasury, along with the Administrators of EPA \nand USAID, would continue to work together through the National \nInvasive Species Council to develop a National Invasive Species \nManagement Plan.\n  The duties of the Council are generally to coordinate federal \nactivities in an effective, complementary, cost-efficient manner; \nupdate the National Invasive Species Management Plan; ensure that \nfederal agencies implement the Management Plan; and develop \nrecommendations for international cooperation. Additionally, if \nrecommendations are not implemented, agencies would have to report to \nthe Council. The Council is directed to develop guidance for federal \nagencies on prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species so \nthat federal programs and actions do not increase the risk of invasion \nor spread non-indigenous species. And finally, the bill would establish \nan Invasive Species Advisory Committee to the Council.\n  The National Invasive Species Council could enhance its effectiveness \nand better protect our environment from invasive species with a \ncongressional mandate. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this measure \nso that the Federal Government can better respond to the threat posed \nby invasive species.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lugar, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 508. A bill to provide for the environmental restoration of the \nGreat Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Great \nLakes Environmental Restoration Act with my colleague, Senator Levin. I \nwould like to thank him for all of his hard work on this legislation.\n  For those who have seen one of the five Great Lakes, it is not \ndifficult to understand their importance. Covering more than 94,000 \nsquare miles and draining more than twice as much land, these \nfreshwater seas hold an estimated six quadrillion gallons of water--or \none-fifth of the world's surface freshwater. The Great Lakes ecosystem \nincludes such diverse elements as northern evergreen and deciduous \nforests, lake plain prairies, and coastal wetlands. Over 30 of the \nbasin's biological communities and over 100 species are globally rare \nor found only in the Great Lakes basin. The 637 State parks in the \nregion accommodate more than 250 million visitors each year, and the \nGreat Lakes basin is home to more than 33 million people--or one-tenth \nof the U.S. population.\n  As co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Senator Levin and \nI have worked together on legislation and other initiatives to protect \nthis natural resource. We secured funding from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) for water level gauges, a replacement \nice-breaking vessel, and funding for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission \nfor sea lamprey control. Additionally, Senator Levin and I met with the \nU.S. Trade Representative Office in an effort to prevent Great Lakes \nwater from being diverted abroad. We worked to authorize the Great \nLakes Basin Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Program in the 2002 Farm \nBill, and three years ago, we joined our colleagues in the House to \npass the Great Lakes Legacy Act. This legislation provides up to $50 \nmillion per year to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to remove \ncontaminated sediments at Areas of Concern.\n  These steps are positive, but we are not keeping pace with the \nproblems facing the Great Lakes--the Federal Government simply is not \nproviding the funding to protect them. An April 2003 Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) report found that the Federal Government \nspent roughly $745 million over the last ten years on Great Lakes \nrestoration programs. Now consider that the GAO reported that the eight \nGreat Lakes States spent $956 million during that same ten-year period.\n  There is ample evidence that this current level of commitment is \nsimply not enough to address the challenges. In 2001, there were \napproximately 600 beach closings as a result of e-coli bacteria. \nFurther, State and local health authorities issued approximately 1,400 \nfish consumption advisories in the Great Lakes. In 1978, the United \nStates and Canada amended the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to \ngive priority attention to 43 designated Areas of Concern. Since the \nsigning, the Federal Government has not been able to\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nremove any U.S. sites from the Areas of Concern list. Invasive species \nare one of the largest threats to the ecosystem and the $4.5 billion \nGreat Lakes fishing industry. There are now over 160 aquatic invasive \nspecies threatening the Great Lakes. It is imperative that we fix these \nproblems.\n  For several years, I have been calling for a plan to restore the \nLakes. I have been urging the governors, mayors, the environmental \ncommunity, and other regional interests to agree on a vision for the \nfuture of the Great Lakes--not just for the short-term, but for the \nlong-term. It is time for us to come together to develop a plan and put \nit in place.\n  The bill we are introducing today builds upon the efforts by those in \nthe Great Lakes states who are working with the congressional \ndelegation and federal officials on the Great Lakes Regional \nCollaboration group. It provides the funding needed to implement their \nrecommendations.\n  This legislation would provide the tools needed for the long-term \nfuture of the Great Lakes. First, our bill creates a $6 billion Great \nLakes Restoration Grant Program to augment existing federal and state \nefforts to clean, protect, and restore the Great Lakes. An additional \n$600 million in annual funding will be appropriated through the EPA's \nGreat Lakes National Program Office. The Program Office will provide \ngrants to the Great Lakes States, municipalities, and other applicants \nin coordination with the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory \nBoard. This funding will provide the extra resources that existing \nprograms do not have.\n  While the Great Lakes are a national resource, leaders in the region, \nnot Washington bureaucrats, should set priorities and guide restoration \nefforts. That is why our bill requires close coordination between the \nEPA and state and regional interests before grants are released. The \nGreat Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board, led by the Great \nLakes governors, will include mayors, federal agencies, Native American \ntribes, environmentalists, industry representatives, and Canadian \nobservers. This Advisory Board will prioritize restoration projects, \nsuch as invasive species control and prevention, wetlands restoration, \ncontaminated sediments cleanup, and water quality improvements. \nAdditionally, this Advisory Board will provide recommendations on which \ngrant applications to fund. The input from the Advisory Board ensures \nthat regional leaders will be critical in determining the long-term \nfuture of the Great Lakes.\n  As the April 2003 GAO study reported, environmental restoration \nactivities in the Great Lakes suffer from lack of coordination. The \nsecond goal of this legislation is the codification of the Great Lakes \nInteragency Task Force to coordinate Federal activities in the Great \nLakes region. The EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office would serve \nas the council leader, and participants would include key federal \nagencies involved in Great Lakes restoration efforts. The council would \nensure that the efforts of federal agencies are coordinated, effective, \nand cost-efficient.\n  Lastly, this bill would help address a GAO recommendation that a \nmonitoring system and environmental indicators be developed to measure \nprogress on new and existing restoration programs in the Great Lakes.\n  Our bill is a major step in the right direction. I would again like \nto thank my colleague, Senator Levin, for his dedication to the Great \nLakes and to their restoration. We need to continue to refocus and \nimprove our efforts in order to reverse the trend of additional \ndegradation of the Great Lakes. They are a unique natural resource for \nOhio and the entire region--a resource that must be protected for \nfuture generations. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this \nbill and in our efforts to help preserve and protect the long-term \nviability of our Great Lakes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Environmental \n     Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Great Lakes and the connecting channels of the \n     Great Lakes form the largest freshwater system in the world, \n     holding \\1/5\\ of the fresh surface water supply of the world \n     and \\9/10\\ of the fresh surface water supply of the United \n     States;\n       (2) 30 years after the date of enactment of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), water \n     quality in the Great Lakes has improved, but the Great Lakes \n     remain in a degraded state;\n       (3) evidence of the degraded environment of the Great Lakes \n     includes--\n       (A) a record 599 closings of Great Lakes beaches in 2001;\n       (B) an increase to 20 percent in the percentage of Great \n     Lakes shoreline that contains polluted sediments; and\n       (C) the issuance by State and local authorities of 1,400 \n     fish consumption advisories relating to the Great Lakes;\n       (4) the Great Lakes are sources of drinking water for \n     approximately 40,000,000 people in the United States and \n     Canada;\n       (5) in the years since the Great Lakes Water Quality \n     Agreement was signed and the United States and Canada agreed \n     to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and \n     biological integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin \n     and give priority attention to the 43 designated Areas of \n     Concern'', no sites have been restored in the United States;\n       (6) it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments to ensure that the Great Lakes \n     remain a clean and safe source of water for drinking, \n     fishing, and swimming; and\n       (7) while the total quantity of resources needed to restore \n     the Great Lakes is unknown, additional funding is needed now \n     to augment existing efforts to address the known threats \n     facing the Great Lakes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve the operation of energy markets; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in light of the most recent evidence \nuncovered about Enron's participation in the Western Energy Crisis, I \nrise today to introduce the Energy Market Oversight Bill with Senators \nLevin, Harkin, Cantwell and Wyden.\n  This bill would: Improve Price Transparency in Wholesale Electricity \nMarkets. The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nestablish an electronic system to provide information about the price \nand availability of wholesale electricity to buyers, and sellers, and \nthe public.\n  Prohibit Round Trip Electricity Trades. The bill prohibits the \nsimultaneous buying and selling of the same quantity of electricity at \nthe same price in the same location with no financial gain or loss. \nRound trip or ``wash trades'' are essentially bogus trades whereby no \nelectricity changes hands, but the profit from the trades enriches the \nbottom-line of a company's financial report.\n  Increase Penalties for Violations of Federal Power Act. Maximum fines \nfor violations of the Federal Power Act are increased from $5,000 to \n$1,000,000.; and maximum sentences are increased from 2 to 5 years. \nCurrent fines are extraordinarily low and therefore provide no \ndeterrence to illegal activity.\n  Increase Penalties for Violations of Natural Gas Act. The bill \nincreases maximum fines for violations of the Natural Gas Act from \n$5,000 to $1,000,000.\n  Prohibit Manipulation in Electricity Markets. Manipulation is \nprohibited in the wholesale electricity markets and FERC is given \ndiscretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violations. \nStrangely enough, manipulation of energy markets is not specifically \nprohibited. This would add language to Part II of the Federal Power \nAct.\n  Repeal the ``Enron exemption''. Repeals the Commodities Future \nModernization Act exemption for large traders in energy commodities and \napplies the anti-manipulation and anti-fraud provisions of the \nCommodities Exchange Act to all Over the Counter trades in energy \ncommodities and derivatives. In my view, when Congress exempted energy \nfrom the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, it created the \nplaying field for the Western Energy Crisis of 2000 and 2001, and cost \nmillions of people millions of dollars.\n  Provide CFTC the Tools to Monitor OTC Energy Markets. For Over the \nCounter trades in energy commodities and derivatives that perform a \nsignificant price discovery function, including trades on electronic \ntrading facilities, the bill requires large sophisticated traders to \nkeep records and report large trades to the CFTC. This does not change \nthe law, only applies the law that exists for futures contracts to over \nthe counter trades in the energy markets.\n  Limit on Use of Data. Requires the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to seek information that is necessary for the limited \npurposes of detecting and preventing manipulation in the futures and \nover the counter markets for energy; to keep proprietary trade and \nbusiness data confidential except when used for law enforcement \npurposes. This does not require the real-time publication of \nproprietary data.\n  No Effect on Non-Energy Commodities or Derivatives. The bill would \nnot alter or affect the regulation of futures markets, financial \nderivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated on page 20 the \nfollowing: ``The amendments made by this title have no effect on the \nregulation of excluded commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.''\n  In addition, the bill states: ``The amendments made by this title \nhave no effect on the regulation of metals under the Commodity Exchange \nAct.''\n  The Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001 has still not been resolved. \nMeanwhile, more and more information about Enron's role in the crisis \nemerges. On February 3, 2005, the Snohomish Public Utility District \nreleased transcripts of tapes showing that on January 17, 2001, Enron \ntraders concocted false repairs for a Las Vegas power plant--making \npower unavailable that would have been delivered to California--on the \nvery same day that supplies were so tight that Northern California \nexperienced a Stage 3 power emergency and rolling blackouts hit as many \nas 2 million consumers.\n  By taking the plant offline, Enron was also in direct violation of an \nEmergency Power Order by U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that \nrequired power generators to make power available to California.\n  Telephone transcripts between Enron and the Las Vegas plant \nconfirming the effort to falsify repairs read as follows:\n\n       Bill: Rich: Ah, we want you guys to get a little creative.\n       Rich: OK.\n       Bill: And come up with a reason to go down.\n       Rich: OK.\n       Bill: Anything you want to do over there? Any----\n       Rich: Ah----\n       Bill: Cleaning, anything like that?\n       Rich: Yeah, Yeah. There's some stuff we could be doing.\n\n  Enron knew exactly what it was doing when it manipulated the Western \nEnergy markets. Enron traders tested gaming techniques in the \nCalifornia market as early as May 1998, creating imbalances in the \nCalifornia market as a result of loopholes it discovered in the system.\n  The schemes the company used in 2000-2001 had already been rehearsed \nin\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nCanada. ``Project Stanley'' was one such technique--Enron traders \ninflated energy prices in Alberta, Canada by colluding with other \nenergy marketers.\n  Enron advocated for ``de-regulation'' of California's energy markets \nwhile drafting language that was full of loopholes it could exploit. \nSimilarly, the company was the main force behind a provision that \nexempted it from federal oversight. This exemption, known as the \n``Enron loophole,'' was created in 2000 when Congress passed the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act.\n  The loophole exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight and \nexcluded it completely if the trade was done electronically.\n  We must close this loophole in order to prohibit fraud and price \nmanipulation in all over-the-counter energy commodity transactions, and \nprovide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the authority it needs \nto investigate and prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation.\n  We need to give the CFTC this authority because we learned during the \nWestern Energy Crisis that there was pervasive manipulation and fraud \nin energy markets, and that FERC and the CFTC were unable or unwilling \nto use the authority they had to intervene.\n  We need to give the CFTC this authority because we need regulators to \nprotect consumers and make sure they're not taken advantage of.\n  We need to give the CFTC this authority because when there are \ninadequate regulations, consumers are ripped off.\n  The Western Energy Crisis cost California about $40 billion. \nCalifornia has been asking for $9 billion in refunds. However, given \nthe fact that Enron is in bankruptcy, it would be a miracle if the \nState receives even half of that amount.\n  Yet there is nothing preventing another energy crisis from happening \nagain, in my State or elsewhere.\n  Therefore, we need Federal oversight of our energy markets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce and eliminate electronic waste through \nrecycling; to the Committee on France.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the pace of technological innovation offers \nAmerican consumers an eye-catching array of electronic gadgets. But for \nevery new lap top or HDTV that goes home from the store with a \nconsumer, an old computer or TV gets moved to the garage or shoved into \nthe back of a closet. What to do with the growing amount of trash from \nthe digital economy is a question that Senator Talent and I believe \nmust be addressed before our landfills are full and foreign countries \nclose their ports to ships loaded down with old US computers. Today we \nare introducing bipartisan legislation to jumpstart a nationwide \nelectronic waste recycling initiative.\n  When I was a member of the Commerce Committee, I helped write the\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nground rules for the digital economy. My goal was to help create a \nclimate that would spur the development of technology so it would \nbecome accessible and affordable to all Americans. This approach seems \nto be working. One measure of the success of the digital economy is the \nsheer number of computers and electronic gadgets that Americans own. \nAmericans now spend more than $130 billion a year on electronics, from \ncomputers to HDTVs.\n  The boom in consumer spending on electronics and the growth in the \ndigital economy are not without a downside. In one year alone, some 60 \nmillion computers and 20 million television sets become obsolete and \nmore than 500 million computers will be discarded in the decade ending \nin 2007. These obsolete computers alone will result in over 6.3 billion \npounds of plastic and 1.6 billion pounds of lead in our landfills or \nincinerators.\n  Electronic waste, or e-waste, is not even a blip on the radar screen \nof most policymakers. There have been a few news articles here and \nthere, but so far they've been buried, well behind page one. I want to \ntackle the problem of e-waste in the same way we went about solving the \nY-2K problem: putting policies in place to help all stakeholders deal \nwith it before it overtakes us.\n  Some communities across the country have begun to talk about how to \ndeal with the accumulation of electronic waste. A few States, like \nCalifornia and Maine, recently passed laws to get recycling programs \ngoing. Several other States, including my own State of Oregon, will \nlikely consider legislation this year. Among the options, some States \nfavor an upfront fee, tacked onto the price of electronics, intended to \nhelp pay for the cost of recycling, others are looking at end-of-life \nfees. No one yet has looked at the approach Senator Talent and I are \nproposing.\n  My own sense is that slapping a fee on consumers for the purchase of \na new computer or television is not necessarily the best way to \nencourage them to drag those old 80-pound computers and TVs out of the \nbasement and get them to a recycling facility. Someone who needs a new \none may just pay the fee but leave their old computers and TVs at home. \nEnd-of-life fees mean that today's manufacturers and retailers end up \npaying for e-trash left over from manufacturers that have gone out of \nbusiness or from off-shore companies.\n  The bipartisan legislation Senator Talent and I are introducing \ntoday, The Electronic Waste Recycling Promotion and Consumer Protection \nAct, takes a novel approach to the problem.\n  First, to get consumers motivated to move their old computers or \ntelevisions out of the garage and to a recycling facility, the bill \nwould give them a one-time tax credit based on showing they gave their \nold computers or televisions to a qualified recycler.\n  Second, to build up the recycling infrastructure nationwide, the \nlegislation would give manufacturers, retailers and qualified recyclers \ntax credits over a 3-year period, based on showing that they had \nrecycled a certain amount of e-waste each year and done it in a way \nthat is safe and environmentally sound.\n  Third, the bill would give the Environmental Protection Agency a year \nto come up with options for a nationwide e-waste recycling program that \nwould, if approved by Congress, preempt State plans. Manufacturers, \nretailers and recyclers are going to find it increasingly difficult to \ndeal with a crazy quilt of 50 different State e-waste recycling laws.\n  These are the incentives, but incentives without teeth won't work. So \nat the end of 3 years of tax credits, if EPA determines that there are \nenough recyclers in place, no one who operates a municipal solid waste \nfacility could knowingly accept any computer, computer monitor or \ntelevision unless the e-waste is to be recycled.\n  The bill would also ask EPA to consider the benefits of requiring \nmanufacturers who sell computers and TVs to take them back for \nrecycling. And, to make sure we're keeping our own house in order, the \nlegislation would require the federal government to properly recycle \nits computers.\n  The goal here is to provide incentives to build a nationwide e-waste \nrecycling infrastructure. EPA estimates that electronic waste already \nconstitutes 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the heavy metals \nfound in landfills today. If this waste is not handled properly, there \nis a real risk that toxins from the lead, mercury and cadmium will \nleach into the air, soil and water. The health effects of these toxins \nare well known and include an increased risk of cancer as well as harm \nto kidneys, the brain and the nervous system.\n  As one who has worked so hard to foster the digital economy, I \nbelieve there is also a duty to assure that e-waste is handled \nresponsibly. Consumers need to know that potentially harmful e-waste is \nbeing handled properly and I can't find a reason to add millions of \ntons of new toxic waste to our environment.\n  I also believe that the United States, as the leading innovator and \nconsumer of electronic products in the world, has a duty to deal with \ne-waste responsibly. Sending shiploads full of e-junk that contains \nharmful lead, mercury and cadmium to poor countries overseas is not my \nidea of responsible.\n  Senator Talent and I have worked with a group of folks that normally \ndon't see eye to eye on such issues. Through many hours of negotiation \nthey have helped us produce a bill that represents a solid first step \ntoward solving this problem. I am pleased that we have support for the \napproach taken in our legislation from environmental groups and \nindustry groups, ranging from manufacturers like HP and Intel to \nretailers and solid waste recyclers, like Waste Management. We are \ncommitted to continuing to work with them to move the legislation \nthrough Congress.\n  In closing, electronic waste is not going away. It's time to put \nbipartisan policies in place that will jumpstart the creation of a \nnationwide e-waste recycling infrastructure so that consumers have \naccess to recycling facilities and get in the habit of recycling these \nitems. I've talked to manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, \nenvironmental and consumer groups and they tell me that this issue must \nbe addressed now by a national rather than state-by-state approach. \nThis bill is a common-sense, first step that will help us get a handle \non the growing problem of electronic waste.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that the approved application under the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the drug commonly known as RU-\n486 is deemed to have been withdrawn, to provide for the review by the \nComptroller General of the United States of the process by which the \nFood and Drug Administration approved such drug, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce ``Holly's \nLaw,'' a bill that would suspend FDA's approval of RU-486 and direct \nthe GAO to conduct an independent review of the process used by the FDA \nto approve the drug.\n  Holly's Law is named in memory of Holly Patterson, an 18-year old \nwoman who died after taking the drug in 2003. RU-486 has killed three \nwomen in the United States and many more have been hospitalized with a \nsevere bacterial infection known as septic shock.\n  RU-486 was approved by the FDA in September of 2000. The FDA approved \nRU-486 under a special ``restricted distribution'' approval process \nknown as ``Subpart H,'' reserved only for drugs that treat ``severe or \nlife-threatening illnesses,'' like cancer and AIDS.\n  Subpart H allows an expedited approval of certain drugs by not \nsubjecting them to the testing and review standards required of all \nother new drugs. These are important tests necessary to determine the \nsafety and long-term effects of a drug. Clearly, the fact that these \ntests were not done on RU-486 was a damaging omission considering the \ndeath and illness associated with use of the drug.\n  Due to the serious threat RU-486 poses to women's health, we are \nasking that Congress suspend FDA's approval of RU-486 until the GAO can \nprovide a report on whether RU-486 should have been deemed ``safe and \neffective'' by the FDA.\n  I am grateful to Senators Allen, Brownback, Coburn, Ensign, Enzi, \nInhofe, Santorum and Vitter who have joined me as original cosponsors \nof this bill. They understand that RU-486 is a dangerous drug that \ncannot remain on the market while more women die. I urge my colleagues \nto support Holly's Law to take RU-486 off the market before more women \nare harmed by it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that the use of the drug mifepristone \n     (marketed as Mifeprex, and commonly known as RU-486) in \n     conjunction with the off-label use of misoprostol to \n     chemically induce abortion has caused a significant number of \n     deaths, near deaths, and adverse reactions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall ensure that the Comptroller General has \n     full access to all information possessed by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services that relates to such process.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall complete the review under paragraph (1) and \n     submit to Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services a report that provides the findings of the review.\n       (c) Contingent Reinstatement of Approval of Drug.--If the \n     report under subsection (b) includes a determination by the \n     Comptroller General of the United States that the approval by \n     the Food and Drug Administration of mifepristone was provided \n     in accordance with section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall publish such statement in the Federal \n     Register. Effective upon the expiration of 30 days after such \n     publication, subsection (a) shall cease to have any legal \n     effect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 512. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to classify \nautomatic fire sprinkler systems as 5-year property for purposes of \ndepreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I rise today to introduce with Senator Rockefeller the \nbipartisan Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2005. Passage of this Act \nwould serve greatly to help reduce the tremendous annual economic and \nhuman losses that fire in the United States inflicts on the national \neconomy and quality of life.\n  In the United States, fire departments responded to approximately 1.7 \nmillion fires in 2002. Annually, over 500,000 of these are structural \nfires causing approximately 3,400 deaths, around 100 of which are \nfirefighters. Fire also caused some 18.5 million civilian injuries and \n$10.3 billion in direct property loss. The indirect cost of fire in the \nUnited States annually exceeds $80 billion. These losses are \nstaggering. All of this translates to the fact that fire departments \nrespond to a fire every 18 seconds. Every 60 seconds a fire breaks out \nin a structure, and in a residential structure every 80 seconds.\n  There are literally thousands of high-rise buildings built under \nolder codes that lack adequate fire protection. Billions of dollars \nwere spent to make these and other buildings handicapped accessible, \nbut people with disabilities now occupying these buildings are not \nadequately protected from fire. At recent code hearings, \nrepresentatives of the health care industry testified that there are \napproximately 4,200 nursing homes that need to be retrofitted with fire \nsprinklers. They further testified that the billion dollar cost of \nprotecting these buildings with fire sprinklers would have to be raised \nthrough corresponding increases in Medicare and Medicaid. In addition \nto the alarming number of nursing homes lacking fire sprinkler \nprotection, there are literally thousands of assisted living facilities \nhousing older Americans and people with disabilities that lack fire \nsprinkler protection.\n  The solution resides in automatic sprinkler systems that are usually \ntriggered within 4 minutes of ignition when the temperature rises above \n120 degrees. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has no \nrecord of a fire killing more than two people in a public assembly, \neducational, institutional, or residential building that has fully \noperational sprinklers. Furthermore, sprinklers are responsible for \ndramatically reducing property loss, from as low as 42 percent to as \nhigh as 70 percent depending on the structure.\n  Building owners do not argue with fire authorities over the logic of \nprotecting their building with fire sprinklers. The issue is cost. This \nbill would drastically reduce the staggering annual economic toll of \nfire in America and thereby dramatically improve the quality of live \nfor everyone involved. This legislation provides a tax incentive for \nbusinesses to install sprinklers through the use of a 5-year \ndepreciation period, opposed to the current 27.5 or 39-year period for \ninstallations in residential rental and non-residential real property \nrespectively. While only a start, the bill will help eliminate the \nmassive losses seen in nursing homes, nightclubs, office buildings, \napartment buildings, manufacturing facilities, and other for-profit \nentities.\n  This bill enjoys support from a variety of organizations. They \ninclude: the American Insurance Association, the American Fire \nSprinkler Association, the California Department of Forestry and Fire \nProtection, Campus Firewatch, Congressional Fire Services Institute, \nIndependent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators, International Association of Fire \nChiefs, International Fire Service Training Association, National Fire \nProtection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, National \nVolunteer Fire Council, the Society of Fire Protection Engineers, and \nthe Mechanical Contractors Asociation of America.\n  The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2005 provides long-needed safety \nincentives for building owners that will help fire departments across \nthe country save lives. I ask my colleagues for their support of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 513. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nKennedy, Mikulski, Harkin, Bingaman, Reed, Murray, Lincoln, Kerry and \nDurbin in introducing the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct of 2005. This legislation would extend to firefighters and police \nofficers the right to discuss workplace issues with their employers.\n  With the enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act, State and \nlocal government employees remain the only sizable segment of workers \nleft in America who do not have the basic right to enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with their employers. While most \nStates do provide some collective bargaining rights for their public \nemployees, others do not.\n  Studies have shown that communities which promote such cooperation \nenjoy much more effective and efficient delivery of emergency services. \nSuch cooperation, however, is not possible in the States that do not \nprovide public safety employees with the fundamental right to bargain \nwith their employers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is balanced in its recognition \nof the unique situation and obligation of public safety officers. The \nbill requires States, within 2 years, to guarantee the right of public \nsafety officers to form and voluntarily join a union to bargain \ncollectively over hours, wages and conditions of employment. The bill \nprotects the right of public safety officers to form, join, or assist \nany labor organization or to refrain from any such activity, freely and \nwithout fear of penalty or reprisal. In addition, the legislation \nprohibits the use of strikes, lockouts, sickouts, work slowdowns or any \nother action that is designed to compel an employer, officer or labor \norganization to agree to the terms of a proposed contract and that will \nmeasurably disrupt the delivery of services.\n  Under this legislation, States would continue to be able to enforce \nright-to-work laws which prohibit employers and labor organizations \nfrom negotiating labor agreements that require union membership or \npayment of union fees as a condition of employment. The legislation \nalso preserves the right of\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nmanagement to not bargain over issues traditionally reserved for \nmanagement-level decisions. All States with a State bargaining law for \npublic safety officers that grants rights equal to or greater than the \nrights provided under this bill would be exempt. The bill also gives \nStates the option to exempt from coverage subdivisions with populations \nof less than 5,000 or fewer than 25 full time employees.\n  Labor-management partnerships, which are built upon bargaining \nrelationships, result in improved public safety. Employer-employee \ncooperation contains the promise of saving the taxpayer money by \nenabling workers to offer input as to the most efficient way to provide \nservices. In fact, studies have shown that States that give \nfirefighters the right to discuss workplace issues actually have lower \nfire department budgets than States without those laws.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2005 will put \nfirefighters and law enforcement officers on equal footing with other \nemployees and provide them with the fundamental right to negotiate with \nemployers over such basic issues as hours, wages, and workplace \nconditions.\n  I urge its adoption and ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD:\n  S. 514. A bill to complete construction of the 13-State Appalachian \ndevelopment highway system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am, again, introducing legislation \ndesigned to fulfill an important promise made by the Federal Government \nto the people of my State and my region some 40 years ago. That \npromise, building and completing a network of highways through the \nAppalachian region is known today as the Appalachian Development \nHighway System or ADHS. I look forward to working with my fellow \nSenators to have my legislation included in the reauthorization of the \nFederal-aid Highway Program, a program at the core of Federal \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Over the course of the 108th Congress, we failed to reauthorize this \nprogram. That legislation should have been enacted into law prior to \nbeginning fiscal year 2004. We are now more than one third of the way \nthrough fiscal year 2005 and the 109th Congress must initiate new bills \nto get the job done. I know I speak for many Senators in stressing the \nneed to complete this job during this session of Congress. We must \nauthorize a bill that addresses our deteriorating highways and bridges, \nand is not squeezed by the artificial funding ceiling that the \nadministration wants.\n  The administration's own Conditions and Performance Report again \nreminds us that a great deal more investment in our infrastructure is \nessential to prevent the further deterioration of our nation's highways \nand bridges.\n  At a September 30, 2002 hearing of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Administrator Mary Peters testified that, despite the \nhistoric funding increase accomplished through TEA-21, congestion on \nour roads continues to worsen. Funding for highway infrastructure by \nall levels of government will have to increase by more than 65 percent \nor $42.2 billion per year to actually improve the condition of our \nNation's highways. A funding increase of more than 17 percent or $11.3 \nbillion is necessary to simply maintain the current poor condition of \nour highway network, where more than one in four of our Nation's \nbridges are classified as deficient.\n  At the end of 2002, I worked doggedly to ensure that the Senate \nprevailed in the conference with the House on the omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 and rejected every penny of \nthe $8.6 billion cut in highway funding proposed by President Bush. In \n2003, I was pleased to join with Senators Bond and Reid, the respective \nchairman and ranking member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee \nin sponsoring a bipartisan amendment to the budget resolution for \nfiscal year 2004 boosting funding for our Federal-aid Highway Program \nby several billion dollars. That amendment commanded 79 votes on the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. President, I am one of only two members still serving in the \nCongress that had the privilege of casting a vote in favor of \nestablishing the Interstate Highway System. I did so as a Member of the \nother body back in 1956. Of equal if not greater importance to the \ntransportation needs of my region, however,\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nwere the findings of the first Appalachian Regional Commission in 1964, \nthat while the Interstate Highway System was slated to provide historic \neconomic benefits to most of our Nation, the system would bypass the \nAppalachian region because of the extremely high costs of building \nhighways through Appalachia's rugged topography.\n\n  In 1965, the Congress adopted the Appalachian Regional Development \nAct that promised a network of modern highways to connect the \nAppalachian region to the rest of the Nation's highway network and, \neven more importantly, the rest of the Nation's economy. Absent the \nAppalachian Development Highway System, my region of the country would \nhave been left with a transportation network of dangerous, narrow, \nwinding roads following the path of river valleys and stream beds \nbetween mountains.\n  One of the observations contained in Administrator Peters' testimony \nback in September of 2002 that especially caught my eye was her \nstatement that ``the condition of higher-order roads, such as \ninterstates, has improved considerably since 1993 while the condition \non many lower-order roads has deteriorated.'' The pattern of road \nconditions mirrors the distribution of wealth in our country. The rich \nare getting richer while the poor get poorer. That observation becomes \nespecially pertinent when one contemplates the challenge of completing \nthe Appalachian Development Highway System.\n  We have virtually completed the construction of the Interstate \nHighway System and have moved on to other important transportation \ngoals. However, the people of my region still wait for the Federal \nGovernment to make good on its 40-year-old promise to complete the \nADHS. The system is still less than 80 percent complete. My home State \nof West Virginia is below the average for the entire Appalachian region \nwith only 72 percent of its mileage complete and open to traffic.\n  Unfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent \ntransportation routes to school; and there are still pregnant mothers, \nelderly citizens and others who lack road access to area hospitals. \nThere are thousands upon thousands of people who cannot obtain \nsustainable well-paying jobs because of poor roads. The entire status \nof the Appalachian Development Highway System is laid out in great \ndetail in the Cost to Complete Report for 2002 completed by the \nAppalachian Regional Commission. This is the most comprehensive report \non the status of the Appalachian Development Highway System to date, \nand I commend the staff of the Appalachian Regional Commission for \ntheir hard work on this report. The last report was completed in 1997 \njust prior to Congressional consideration of TEA-21.\n  The enactment of TEA-21 signaled a new day in the advancement of the \nAppalachian Development Highway System. Through the work of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, and the administration, we took a great leap \nforward by authorizing direct contract authority from the Highway Trust \nFund to the States for the construction of the ADHS. Up until that \npoint, funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System was \nlimited to uncertain general fund appropriations. By providing the \nStates of the Appalachian region with a predictable source of funds to \ncomplete ADHS segments, TEA-21 reinvigorated efforts to keep the \npromise made to the people of the Appalachian region.\n\n  This initiative has been a great success. States are making progress \ntoward the completion of the system. Since the last Cost to Complete \nReport, 183 miles of the system have been opened to traffic and, the \ncost to complete the system has been reduced by roughly $1.7 billion in \nFederal funds.\n  I am pleased to report that the 13 States, to date, have succeeded in \nobligating just under 90 percent of the obligation authority that has \nbeen granted to them for the completion of the system. A 90-percent \nobligation rate compares quite favorably to some of the other \ntransportation programs through which the States were granted multiple \nyears to obligate their funds.\n  According to the ARC's Cost to Complete Report, the remaining Federal \nfunds needed to complete the ADHS as the system was defined at the time \nthat report was completed are now estimated to be $4.467 billion. When \nadjusted for inflation over the life of the next highway bill, using \nthe standard inflation calculation for highway projects, a total of \n$5.04 billion will need to be authorized to complete the system. That \nis a lot of money and I believe that figure deserves some explanation.\n  The considerable cost of completing the last 20 percent of the ADHS \nis explained by the fact that the easiest segments of the system to \nbuild have already been built. Much of the costs associated with \ncompleting the most difficult unfinished segments are driven by the \nrequirement to comply with other Federal laws, especially the laws \nrequiring environmental mitigation measures when building new highways \nthrough rural areas. While the $5.04 billion figure may seem large to \nsome of my colleagues, I would remind them that the last highway bill \nauthorized more than $218 billion in Federal infrastructure investment \nover 6 years. It is my sincere hope and expectation that the next \nhighway bill will authorize an even greater amount.\n  Of critical importance to this debate is the fact that the unfinished \nsegments of the ADHS represent some of most dangerous and most \ndeficient roadways in our entire Nation. Often lost in our debate over \nthe necessity to invest in our highways is the issue of safety. The \nFederal Highway Administration has published reports indicating that \nsubstandard road conditions are a factor in 30 percent of all fatal \nhighway accidents. I am quite certain that the percentage is a great \ndeal higher in the Applachian region.\n  The Federal Highway Administration found that upgrading two-lane \nroads to four-lane divided highways decreased fatal car accidents by 71 \npercent and that the widening of traffic lanes has served to reduce \nfatalities by 21 percent. These are precisely the kind of road \nimprovements that are funded through the ADHS. In my state, the largest \nsegment of unfinished Appalachian Highway, if completed, will replace \nthe second most dangerous segment of roadway in West Virginia. So, even \nthose who would question the wisdom of completing these highways in the \nname of economic development should take a hard look at the fact that \nthe people of rural Appalachia are taking their lives in their hands \nevery day as they drive on dangerous roads. It is time for this \nCongress, in concert with the administration, to take the last great \nleap forward and authorize sufficient contract authority to finally \ncomplete the Appalachian Development Highway System. If we enact \nanother six-year highway bill with sufficient funds to complete the \nsystem, we will finally pay the full costs of the ADHS some 45 years \nafter the system was first promised to the people of my region. The \nlegislation I am introducing today, the ``Appalachian Development \nHighway System Completion Act,'' will provide sufficient contract \nauthority to complete the system. Importantly, it will guarantee that \nthe states of the Appalachian Region do not pay a penalty, either \nthrough the distribution of minimum allocation funds, or the \ndistribution of obligation limitation, for receiving sufficient funds \nto complete the Appalachian system.\n  I am very pleased that this administration has taken on the goal of \ncompleting the ADHS. In her letter accompanying the Cost to Complete \nReport, Administrator Peters said ``the completion of the ADHS is an \nimportant part of the mission of the Federal Highway Administration. We \nconsider the accessibility, mobility and economic stimulation provided \nby the ADHS to be entirely consistent with the goals of our agency.'' \nMs. Peters further stated that the Appalachian Regional Commission's \n2002 Cost to Complete Report, ``provides a sound basis for apportioning \nfuture funding to complete the system.'' I thank Mary Peters and the \nentire Federal Highway Administration for their leadership on this \nissue and I look forward to working with Ms. Peters and her agency to \nensure that this commitment is borne out in the transportation \nreauthorization legislation that is developed by the Congress.\n  Completion of a new highway bill will be an enormous task for this \nCongress--one that is now more than 2\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nyears overdue. As I look back over the many years of my public career, \none of the accomplishments of which I am most proud was my amendment \nproviding an additional $8 billion in funding to break the logjam \nduring the debate on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct in 1991. Another was my sponsorship of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \nAmendment during the Senate debate of TEA-21 in 1998. That effort \nresulted in some $26 billion in funding being added to that bill and \nput us on a path to historic funding increases for our nation's highway \ninfrastructure. I look forward again to working with my fellow Senators \non completion of a bill that makes the necessary investments in our \nnation's highways, not just in the Appalachian region but across our \nentire country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD:\n  S. 515. A bill to amend title 32, United States Code, to increase the \nmaximum Federal share of the costs of State programs under the National \nGuard Youth Challenge Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in recent years, the public profile of the \nNational Guard has changed considerably. Known mainly for the \ncontributions of citizen-soldiers to their States and communities, \ntoday the men and women of the National Guard are serving on the front \nlines in Iraq and Afghanistan, enduring hardships in two of the world's \nmost dangerous places.\n  In spite of the long deployments, far away from the small towns and \nbig cities that these citizen-soldiers call home, the National Guard \ncontinues its work for our States and the American people. Today, I \nintroduce legislation to support a most successful program that has \nhelped the National Guard change the lives of tens of thousands of \nyoung Americans.\n  In 1991, I provided the first funding to establish a pilot program \nknown as the National Guard Civilian Youth Opportunities Program. Over \nthe years, this program has expanded in size and scope and is now known \nas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program.\n  The Youth Challenge Program gives high school dropouts the skills \nthey need to turn their lives around. The advantage of using the \nNational Guard to provide a structured environment for these students \nhas been confirmed in studies by the Defense Science Board in 2000, the \nWhite House Task Force on Disadvantaged Children in 2003, and the \nDepartment of Defense in 2004.\n\n  The program now operates 27 academies in 24 States, including West \nVirginia, Alaska, Hawaii, Georgia, Louisiana, Virginia, Michigan, \nFlorida, Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Over 5,000 cadets \nare now in training, and more than 58,000 have graduated from the \nprogram since 1993. Fully three-quarters of the Youth Challenge \ngraduates have earned their high school diplomas in the program, but \nthe program is at the mercy of shrinking state budgets.\n  In March 2004, the Department of Defense recommended an increase in \nFederal support for the program in order to prevent any more closures \nof Youth Challenge academies. The bill I introduce today would write \nthat recommendation into law, phasing in the additional Federal support \nover 3 years.\n  My legislation also proposes to increase the authorization for the \nYouth Challenge program by $16.3 million, including $6.3 million for \nthe proposed increase in the Federal share of the Youth Challenge \nProgram's cost for Fiscal Year 2006.\n  My bill authorizes an additional $10 million to provide the first \nsignificant per-student increase in funding since the program began. \nFor more than 12 years, the funding of the Youth Challenge Program has \nremained constant at $14,000 per student, per year. Imagine that. Think \nof that. At a time when the cost of education is growing by leaps and \nbounds, the Youth Challenge program has held the line on its budget for \nmore than 12 years.\n  But such discipline means that there have been cutbacks in teachers, \nuniforms, and activities. The additional $10 million authorized in my \nbill would end these cutbacks, and may also be used to open new Youth \nChallenge academies, giving more at-risk youth a chance to change their \nlives.\n  Many of the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard serve our country \nin distant lands, but their commitment to their communities continues. \nThe legislation I introduce today will strengthen that commitment by \nexpanding the National Guard Youth Challenge Program for disadvantaged \nyouth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 517.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a controlled \nsubstance monitoring program in each State; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nSessions, Senator Durbin and Senator Dodd in introducing the ``National \nAll Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act.'' Our goal is to \nhelp States establish electronic databases to monitor the use of \nprescription drugs and deal more effectively with the growing national \nproblem of prescription drug abuse.\n  Over 6 million Americans currently use prescription drugs for non-\nmedical purposes. 31 million say they've abused such drugs at least \nonce in their lifetime. Since 1992, the number of young adults who \nabuse prescription pain relievers and other addictive drugs has more \nthan tripled. Prescription drug abuse among youths 12 to 17 has soared \ntenfold.\n  State programs to monitor addictive medications can help curb this \nabuse. Currently, 20 States have such programs in place, including \nMassachusetts, but they vary greatly in the collection and storage of \nthe data, and in the methods for using the databases.\n  The information contained in these databases is important, because it \ncan be used to identify physicians and patients who encourage the non-\nmedical use of prescription drugs. It can also be used to reduce the \ndiversion of prescription drugs for illegal use.\n  Our bill authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make grants to States to \nestablish these needed monitoring programs. For States with existing \nprograms, the grants can be used to improve their systems and \nstandardize the data collected to allow easy sharing of the information \nbetween the States.\n  Any such program, however, must include strong safeguards for medical \nprivacy, and make certain that the database cannot be used to put \nimproper pressure on physicians to avoid prescribing essential drugs. \nThe proper treatment of pain, for example, is an enormous medical \nchallenge, but this essential care will be much more difficult if \npatients fear that their prescription histories will not be protected, \nor if physicians begin to look over their shoulder every time they \nprescribe pain medication.\n  We all share the goal of reaching the right balance between the \ninterests of patients, physicians, and law enforcement, and we think \nthis legislation does that. It requires that in grant applications, \nStates must propose security standards for the electronic databases, \nincluding appropriate encryption or other information technology. \nStates also must propose standards for using the database and obtaining \nthe information, including certifications to be sure that requests for \ninformation are legitimate. The bill requires the Secretary to provide \na follow-up analysis of the privacy protections within two years after \nenactment.\n  The national problem of prescription drug abuse worsens every year. \nPhysicians want to treat pain without contributing to addiction. Law \nenforcement officials want to stop the flow of prescription drugs from \npharmacies to the streets. A national prescription drug monitoring \nprogram will provide a valuable resource to achieve these goals. I \ncommend Senator Sessions for his leadership on this important health \nissue, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to fight \nprescription drug abuse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 519. A bill to amend the Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources \nConservation and Improvement Act of 2000 to authorize additional \nprojects and activities under that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that is \nvital for water conservation in my home State of Texas. This \nlegislation would amend The Lower Rio Grande Valley Water Resources and \nConservation Improvement Act of 2000, which was passed with Unanimous \nConsent in the 106th Congress, to authorize work needed to conserve and \nenhance water supplies in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. It would do so \nby improving the water infrastructure used by farmers, ranchers, \nmunicipalities and a growing population.\n  Improving water conveyance infrastructure is the top priority for \nenhancing water conservation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Currently, \nunprecedented growth coupled with Mexico's past failure to comply with \nthe 1944 Water treaty, reinforces the dire need for water conservation. \nThe Lower Rio Grande Valley depends upon an adequate supply of water. \nStudies show that water losses resulting from seepage, spills and \nevaporation exceed 68 billion gallons of water per year, underscoring \nthe pressing demand for improvements which will ensure efficient \nconservation of water.\n  By enacting this legislation, 19 additional water districts will \nenhance their ability to conserve their resources. Residents in the \nLower Rio Grande Valley will not be forced to rely on canal systems \nsubject to seepage and evaporation. Improving irrigation systems and \nupdating this 100-year-old water distribution system will provide \ncitizens in South Texas with a sufficient supply of one of nature's \nmost valuable resources. Rather than waiting for the unpredictability \nof Mother Nature to increase water resources through rainstorms, these \ncommunities can rely on more effective water systems.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure to \nhelp the citizens of the Lower Rio Grande Valley better conserve their \nwater resources. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 5,000,000 Americans are infected with the \n     hepatitis C virus (referred to in this section as ``HCV''), \n     and more than 3,000,000 Americans are chronically infected, \n     making HCV the Nation's most common chronic blood borne virus \n     infection.\n       (2) Nearly 2 percent of the population of the United States \n     have been infected with HCV.\n       (3) Conservative estimates indicate that approximately \n     30,000 Americans are newly infected with HCV each year, and \n     that number has been growing since 2001.\n       (4) HCV infection, in the United States, is the most common \n     cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and liver \n     cancer, the most common indication for liver transplant, and \n     the leading cause of death in people with HIV/AIDS. In \n     addition, there may be links between HCV and certain other \n     diseases, given that a high number of people infected with \n     HCV also suffer from type 2 diabetes, lymphoma, thyroid and \n     certain blood disorders, and autoimmune disease.\n       (5) The majority of individuals infected with HCV are \n     unaware of their infection. Individuals infected with HCV \n     serve as a source of transmission to others and, since few \n     individuals are aware they are infected, they are unlikely to \n     take precautions to prevent the spread or exacerbation of \n     their infection.\n       (6) There is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection.\n       (7) Treatments are available that can eradicate the disease \n     in approximately 50 percent of those who are treated, and \n     behavioral changes can slow the progression of the disease.\n       (8) Conservative estimates place the costs of direct \n     medical expenses for HCV at more than $1,000,000,000 in the \n     United States annually, and such costs will undoubtedly \n     increase in the absence of expanded prevention and treatment \n     efforts.\n       (9) To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed \n     Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C \n     Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic Disease in 1998 \n     and the National Hepatitis C Prevention Strategy in 2001, and \n     the National Institutes of Health convened\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\n     Consensus Development Conferences on the Management of \n     Hepatitis C in 1997 and 2002. These recommendations and \n     guidelines provide a framework for HCV prevention, control, \n     research, and medical management referral programs.\n       (10) The Department of Veterans Affairs (referred to in \n     this paragraph as the ``VA''), which cares for more people \n     infected with HCV than any other health care system, is the \n     Nation's leader in HCV screening, testing, and treatment. \n     Since 1998, it has been the VA's policy to screen for HCV \n     risk factors all veterans receiving VA health care, and the \n     VA currently recommends testing for all those who are found \n     to be ``at risk'' for the virus and for all others who wish \n     to be tested. In fiscal year 2004, over 98 percent of VA \n     patients had been screened for HCV risk factors, and over 90 \n     percent of those ``at risk'' were tested. For all veterans \n     who test positive for HCV and enroll in VA medical care, the \n     VA offers medications that can help HCV or its complications. \n     The VA also has programs for HCV patient and provider \n     education, clinical care, data-based quality improvement, and \n     research, and it has 4 Hepatitis C Resource Centers to \n     develop and disseminate innovative practices and tools to \n     improve patient care. This comprehensive program should be \n     commended and could potentially serve as a model for future \n     HCV programs.\n       (11) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and \n     awareness of HCV and to assist State and local prevention and \n     control efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF \n                   HEPATITIS C.\n\n       Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n  ``PART R--PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS C\n\n     ``SEC. 399AA.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senators \nHutchinson, Schumer, and Cornyn in introducing the Hepatitis C Epidemic \nControl and Prevention Act. Our goal is to provide for the prevention, \ncontrol, and treatment of Hepatitis C viral infection through \neducation, surveillance, early detection, and research.\n  Hepatitis C is the most common, chronic, blood-borne infection in the \nUnited States. An estimated 5 million Americans are now infected with \nthe Hepatitis C virus, and 30,000 more are infected every year. The \nrate of infection continues to rise--between 1990 and 2015, the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention project a 4-fold increase in the \nnumber of persons with chronic infection of the virus.\n  Persons infected with the Hepatitis C virus come from all walks of \nlife, but those at greatest risk include health workers, emergency \nservice personnel, and drug users. Tragically, the majority of infected \nindividuals are unaware of their infection, are not receiving \ntreatment, and are sources of transmission of the virus to others.\n  Infection with the Hepatitis C virus has serious health effects. It \ncan cause liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer, and is \nthe leading indicator for liver transplants. The illnesses are often \nlife-threatening--up to 10,000 Americans die yearly from Hepatitis C \ncomplications, and it is the 7th leading cause of death for men between \nthe ages of 25 and 64. In addition to the human costs, the disease has \nmassive financial implications. Direct costs associated with care are \nexpected to exceed $1 billion a year by 2010. Without intervention, the \nepidemic is projected to result in costs of over $54 billion by the \nyear 2019.\n  Greater Federal investment will have a critical role in reversing \nthis silent epidemic. Our Hepatitis C bill will increase public \nawareness of the dangers of Hepatitis C, and make testing widely \navailable. For those already infected, it will provide counseling, \nreferrals, and vaccination against Hepatitis A and B and other \ninfectious diseases. It will also support research to develop a vaccine \nagainst Hepatitis C, just as we now have for Hepatitis A and B. It will \ncreate a multiagency Liver Disease Research Advisory Board and mandate \na study of programs used by the Veteran's Administration, in order to \nprovide important lessons and models of care for the nation. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention will increase surveillance \nactivities, and provide Hepatitis C coordinators to provide technical \nassistance and training to state public health agencies.\n  This bill will have a major impact on the lives of millions of \nAmericans who are infected by Hepatitis C, and the families and loved \nones who care for them. I look forward to working closely with my \ncolleagues to act quickly to pass this needed legislation. I especially \ncommend the impressive work of the students at Robinson Secondary \nSchool in Fairfax, VA, for their continuing dedication to informing \nMembers of Congress about this important issue and bringing national \nattention to it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 523. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to rename the \ndeath gratuity payable for deaths of members of the Armed Forces as \nfallen hero compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a simple piece of \nlegislation. The idea underlying this bill is\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\nsimple: words matter. How we characterize what we do sends a message, \nand nowhere is that more clear than in the question of survivor \nbenefits for survivors of military fatalities.\n  The Senate this year is considering major increases in survivor \nbenefits for military families. That is as it should be, and I am proud \nto support two specific proposals to increase that assistance.\n  We have an historic opportunity to raise both the direct DoD \nassistance and the life insurance payouts to families from $12,420 to \n$100,000 and to provide an extra $150,000 in life insurance payouts.\n  We also have an opportunity to allow full concurrent receipt of the \nDoD's Survivor Benefit Plan and the VA's Dependency & Indemnity \nCompensation.\n  We also have the opportunity to improve the help that military \nsurvivors get in navigating the bureaucracies of the VA and the DoD to \nget the benefits they deserve.\n  And finally we have the opportunity to protect military families from \npredatory life insurance companies. All of these reforms are needed, \nand all are within our reach this year.\n  As I studied this issue, I was struck by the term ``Death Gratuity.'' \nThat is the name for the assistance that taxpayers make available to \nmilitary survivors. The term gratuity means gift.\n  I believe that not one of the widows, widowers, or children left \nbehind think of that money as a gift. These families and these heroes \nare the ones who have given the gift to us. They are the ones who have \ngiven the ultimate sacrifice.\n  I know that the name of the assistance is not as important as the \nassistance itself, but I am sure that hearing the term ``gratuity'' is \na bitter pill for survivors who have just received the worst news of \ntheir lives.\n  I for one refuse the term ``Death Gratuity,'' and I am introducing \nlegislation today to change it to ``Fallen Hero Compensation.''\n  This is a simple change, but it more properly reflects the sacrifices \nmilitary survivors have made and more properly expresses the gratitude \nand dignity we owe these families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to strengthen the consequences of the fraudulent use \nof United States or foreign passports and other immigration documents; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I are introducing \nlegislation to combat the use of fraudulent immigration documents, \nparticularly passports and other travel documents.\n  The need to prevent and prosecute passport and travel document fraud \nis clear, and this bill would increase penalties for the use of \nfraudulent travel documents.\n  We know that the threat of terrorism against the United States is \nreal and as the 9/11 Commission Report states, ``for terrorists, travel \ndocuments are as important as weapons.'' In order to minimize the \nthreat of terrorism to the United States, we must make every effort to \nlimit the use of fraudulent immigration documents.\n  The bill Senator Sessions and I are introducing would make the use of \nfraudulent travel documents--such as passports, Border Crossing Cards, \nCanadian driver's licenses or identification cards, transportation \nletters for parolees, military identification cards or green cards--an \naggravated felony which will mandate detention and increase the \nlikelihood of prosecution.\n  Today, this is not the case. Instead, fraudulent documents are \nroutinely returned to the offender and individuals are allowed to \nreturn home without suffering any consequences from their attempts to \ncircumvent our immigration laws.\n  Why is this a problem?\n  Firstly, admission to the United States is a privilege and not a \nright. We should not tolerate fraud and deception at our ports of \nentry, particularly because it should be apparent that a terrorist \norganization as sophisticated as Al Qaeda is well aware of our current \nprocedures and can be expected to take full advantage of them.\n  Secondly, the 9/11 Commission found that as many as 15 of the 19 \nhijackers on September 11, 2001 could have been intercepted by border \nofficials, based in part on their travel documents. In fact, all but \none of the September 11 hijackers acquired some form of U.S. \nidentification document and some of those documents were acquired by \nfraud. All of the hijackers opened bank accounts in their names and \nused passports and other identification documents that appeared valid \non their face.\n  Even before September 11, 2001, the use of fraudulent immigration \ndocuments to enter the United States was a threat that we did not \nsufficiently heed.\n  Let me give you some known examples of terrorists who have entered, \nor attempted to enter the United States, with fraudulent travel \ndocuments: Ahmed Ajaj and Ramzi Yousef attempted to enter the United \nStates with fraudulent passports. Both were later implicated or \nconvicted in the first World Trade Center bombing in February of 1993.\n  Ahmed Ressam used a fraudulently obtained Canadian passport, and, in \n1999 attempted to cross the border from Canada at Port Angeles in \nWashington State. A border inspector felt Mr. Ressam looked nervous, \nand a search of his car turned up a trunk full of bombs. There is some \ndebate about the exact target(s) of the attack; however, it seems \nlikely that Los Angeles International Airport and perhaps the \nmillennium celebrations in Seattle were the intended targets.\n  It is no secret that: as the 9/11 Commission Report makes clear, Al \nQaeda has established a complex international travel network that \nallowed, and presumably still allows, its operatives to legally travel \nworldwide to train, conduct reconnaissance or otherwise prepare for an \nattack. This network included, and presumably still includes, the use \nof altered and counterfeit passports and visas.\n  Many countries, including France, Portugal and Saudi Arabia, have \nreported tens of thousands of passports and travel documents stolen. \nWhen these are stolen in large numbers, they are sold on the black \nmarket to others.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that had the immigration system set a \nhigher bar for determining whether individuals are who they claim to \nbe--and ensured consequences for any violations--it could potentially \nhave denied entry, deported or come into further contact with the \nterrorists that were involved in the September 11, 2001 attack on the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\n  Last year, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the \nInspector General issued the following reports on lost and stolen \npassports: ``A Review of the Use of Stolen passports from Visa Waiver \nCountries to Enter the United States'', December 2004; and, ``An \nEvaluation of the Security Implications of the Visa Waiver Program'' \n(April 2004).\n  I encourage my colleagues to read these reports on the \nvulnerabilities in our current border security. To summarize, the \nreports state that: In the United States alone, immigration officials \nhave records for 1.2 million stolen passports.\n  Aliens applying for admission into the United States using stolen \npassports have little reason to fear being caught and are usually \nadmitted. It has been standard practice to simply return a fraudulent \npassport to an individual seeking entry and let them return to their \ncountry. This, in effect, is the soft underbelly of the entire passport \nsystem.\n  The Director of the U.S. National Central Bureau of INTERPOL said \nthat for 55 of the 181 INTERPOL countries, there probably were over 10 \nmillion lost and stolen passports that might be in circulation.\n  Law enforcement officials state that lost and stolen passports are \nthe greatest security problem associated with the Visa Waiver Program.\n  And now that I've mentioned the Visa Waiver Program, let me say a few \nthings about this program.\n  I believe the Visa Waiver Program is the Achilles heel in our \nimmigration system. This program allows roughly 13 million individuals \nto enter the United States each year from 27 countries, without a \nvisa--meaning they enter without a thorough background and security \ncheck.\n  Since we do not have in place a fully operational entry and exit \nprogram, specifically an exit system, we have no real way of knowing if \nmillions of travelers who entered the United States have left as \nrequired.\n  Last year, Congress extended the deadline for one year for countries \nparticipating in the Visa Waiver Program to include biometric \nindicators in passports to verify the identity of bearers at the \nrequest of the Administration.\n  It is likely this deadline will again need to be extended.\n  I believe that granting another extension will be another opportunity \nfor terrorists, organized crime rings, petty crooks, counterfeiters and \nforgers to continue entering the United States virtually unnoticed \nbecause we won't be able to confirm that they are who they say they \nare.\n  The bottom line is that we must crack down on document fraud if we \nare to protect our borders. There are thousands, even millions, of \nlost, stolen and fraudulent international passports, travel documents, \ndriver's licenses and other identity documents in circulation, and we \nmust now allow those to compromise our homeland security.\n  The purpose of this bill is twofold: first, to give the Department of \nJustice the incentive to vigorously prosecute all cases involving \npassport and travel document fraud, as well as certain other egregious \ncases of immigration document fraud.\n  Second, by encouraging policies that make these cases a priority for \nprosecution, it will require that Department of Homeland Security \nofficials not return fraudulent documents to travelers, but instead \nturn them over to the Department of Justice so that they can institute \ncriminal proceedings.\n  Unfortunately, the prosecution of immigration document fraud is not a \nhigh priority for the Department of Justice, because, although current \npenalties allow for a sentence of up to 25 years, typically most \nalien's convicted of travel document fraud serve less than one year in \nprison.\n  Also, the immigration consequences of document fraud are relatively \nminor. Low sentences, coupled with minimal immigration consequences, do \nnot provide much incentive for U.S. Attorneys nationwide to consider \nthe prosecution of immigration document cases a priority nor can they \nbe seen as anything but a slap on the wrists of the offenders.\n  Senator Sessions and I pose a solution to this problem by toughening \npenalties so that we instill in those seeking to use fraudulent travel \nand immigration documents a real sense of fear that they will be caught \nand prosecuted to the fullest extent possible under our laws.\n  In any kind of meaningful border protection plan, one must have a \ngood sense of who is entering and exiting the country. That simply \ncannot be known if the individual is using a fraudulent document.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I also ask by unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to reauthorize the Act, to improve early learning \nopportunities and promote school preparedness, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am here with Senator Dodd and \non behalf of Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy to introduce the Caring \nfor Children Act of 2005 which reauthorizes the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant, CCDBG, program. This program provides funding \nto States for child care vouchers.\n  Across the United States last year low-income parents of 2.3 million \nchildren were able to use these certificates or ``vouchers'' to help \npay the cost of child care while the parents worked or continued their \neducation so they could get a better job.\n  Last year, my home State of Tennessee spent $251,760,528 for child \ncare, much of which came through the CCDBG program. This important \nprogram legislates how States are to administer child care. States \nprovide certificates to parents to choose the type of care that best \nfits their children's needs.\n  In Tennessee, 1 percent of children receive care in their own home, \n19 percent have chosen to place their children in family home care, 5 \npercent are in group care while the vast majority, 75 percent, are in \nchild care centers. About 24,500 Tennessee families with children are \nenrolled in some form of subsidized child care, and as of January of \nthis year, 46,591 children were receiving subsidized child care in my \nhome State.\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\n  A family of four, which is a typical size for eligible families in \nTennessee, is eligible for child care support when their median income \nis no more than 60 percent of the State's median income. That means \nthat families making $33,000 or less are eligible for some assistance, \nthough they may also have to make a co-payment. For example, a family \nof four making $32,000 would be required to pay $56 per week for the \nfirst child and $42 per week for the second child.\n  This year we are making the CCDBG program even better with four key \nimprovements.\n  First, the act increases the quality set-aside from 4 percent, \ncurrent law, to 6 percent. Eighty percent of parents report that their \nchild care is poor to mediocre, so we need to take steps to improve \noverall quality of care. The quality set-aside is used to offer \ntraining and professional development to child care workers. States can \nalso use quality funds to provide technical assistance to child care \nfacilities to help them enhance learning opportunities for pre-school \nor school-aged children while in care. Of course, States could choose \nto do even more, and I am happy to report that my own State of \nTennessee spends at least 12 percent on quality improvements.\n  Second, the act requires States to use at least 70 percent of funds \nfor direct services. This will ensure that more of the money gets into \nthe hands of parents rather than State bureaucracies. Under current \nlaw, States vary greatly in what percentage they use for direct \nservices since current language simply specifies that a ``significant'' \nportion be used for services.\n\n  Third, the legislation emphasizes the importance of school \npreparedness by adding a new goal: development of pre-reading, \nprenumeracy, math and language skills for children in care. Research \nhas proven that a child's brain doubles in size between birth and age \n3. These are formative years for both physical and cognitive \ndevelopment.\n  Fourth, the bill establishes a temporary small business competitive \ngrant program to encourage small businesses to work together to provide \nchild care services for employees. Senator Roberts developed this \ninnovative $30 million grant program, and I am glad it could be \nincluded in the bill.\n  The CCDBG program is important for supporting parents raising \nchildren across the country. One such parent is Tameka Payton. Tameka \nwas nineth grade when she had her first child, Javonta. When she became \npregnant, Tameka was a ward of the State. She had grown up with an \nabusive mother who was addicted to drugs. After being removed from the \ncare of her mother, she was placed in the care of her aunt who also \nproved abusive. Tameka ran away, and was placed in the foster care \nsystem until she was 18. She then had two more children, Jayla and \nMichael, before finding a family resource center at the Salvation Army \nthat connected her and her children to Tennessee's Family First \nprogram.\n  The Family First program and the child care certificates she receives \nthrough this program enabled Tameka to find work and become a better \nmother. She is currently working 40 hours a week while working on her \nGED. She is about to take the test. Everyday she brings her children 4, \n2, and 1 to the McNeilly Center. Tameka feels confident that not only \nare her children receiving quality care but also she is learning how to \nbe a better mother. Her children's teachers are receptive and answer \nall of her questions. She has learned to spend time reading to her \nchildren so she can contribute to their education, too.\n  The Federal CCDBG program funds the child care certificates Tameka \nreceives. Without them, Tameka, and her children, would be in a very \ndifferent place today.\n  Tameka's dream is to get her GED and attend Tennessee State \nUniversity. The support she receives has given her the chance to \nrealize that dream, and make a better life for herself and her \nchildren. I expect her hard work to payoff.\n  Another Tennessee parent who has benefited from the program is Renee \nPrigmore. Renee is currently a toddler teacher at the McNeilly Center \nin Nashville. But she first found McNeilly as a parent, not as a \nteacher. As a single parent of three, she used her child care \ncertificates at McNeilly to leave her kids in quality care while she \nattended community college.\n  Renee has attained her degree as a Child Development Associate, CDA. \nHer children are now 10, 6, and 4 and she is exiting out of the child \ncare program because she is able to provide for her three kids. The \nchild care certificates she received enabled her to take the time to \nreceive that degree and provide for her family.\n  People like Tameka Payton and Renee Prigmore have used the CCDBG \nprogram to build a new and better life for their families. With the \nintroduction of the Caring for Children Act, we can make that program \neven stronger, so that parents raising children are able to build a \nbetter future for their families. I ask my colleagues to join with me \nin this important endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 525\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nKennedy, Alexander and Dodd in introducing the ``Caring for Children \nAct of 2005'' which reauthorizes the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant (CCDBG). This legislation is essential to continued success with \nwelfare reform because it helps low-income parents find and pay for \naffordable child care so that they can work.\n  As members of this body know, child care vouchers provided to parents \nby States using CCDBG funds greatly facilitate the expansion of child \ncare subsidies and promote parental choice by allowing eligible parents \nto select their preferred type of care setting and provider, including \nfaith-based providers.\n  Current law provides States with flexibility in determining how to \naddress the child care needs of low-income families and children, \nincluding establishing the eligibility requirements for participation.\n  The legislation we are introducing today adds even greater \nflexibility by proposing to eliminate the arbitrary Federal ceiling for \neligibility. Removal of this ceiling, previously set at 85 percent of \nState median income, eliminates any Federal income-based restriction on \nState determination of who receives benefits. However States must \ncontinue to prioritize families based on need.\n  States provide child care assistance to both TANF and non-TANF \nfamilies. For the first time the Caring for Children Act requires \nStates and territories to show they are spending at least 70 percent of \ntheir mandatory child care money on actual subsidies for child care. \nFor TANF families, families transitioning off TANF, and families at \nrisk of becoming dependent on public assistance an assurance of the \nState's commitment to providing significant funds for direct assistance \nis critical.\n  The bill we are introducing today also addresses factors that in the \npast made finding care difficult for parents. We have specifically \nrequired States to meet the child care needs of parents who have \nchildren with special needs, parents who work non-traditional hours, or \nparents who need child care for infants and toddlers. Additionally, the \nlegislation streamlines and reduces unnecessary paperwork by allowing \nStates to provide assistance to eligible families for six months before \nre-determining eligibility.\n  The bill also supports the needs of small business owners and \noperators, by providing resources for small businesses to join together \nto provide child care for their employees. This will be of great help \nfor rural areas, where small businesses provide most of the employment \nopportunities.\n\n  Last, but most importantly, the bill responds to, in significant \nways, the very disturbing reports about the lack of quality in child \ncare and the lack of tangible results from current investments in \nquality. The bill before us increases the quality set-aside from 4 to 6 \npercent and directs child care quality funds toward activities that can \nreally make a difference. Under this bill, States would develop child \ncare quality targets and would be held accountable to reach those \ntargets. Quality funds would be available for States to: develop and \nimplement voluntary guidelines on pre-reading and language skills and \nprenumeracy and mathematic skills and activities for child care \nprograms in the State; support activities and provide technical \nassistance to enhance early learning and school preparedness in \nFederal, State and local child care settings; offer training, \nprofessional development and educational opportunities for child care \nproviders that relate to scientifically based curricula and teaching \nstrategies through several means including distance learning; offer \nincentives for child care providers that meet or exceed State child \ncare services guidelines; evaluate and assess the quality and \neffectiveness of child care programs and services offered in the State \nto young children on improving overall school preparedness; and other \nactivities that can be shown to improve child safety, child well-being, \nor school preparedness.\n  The improvements made to the program by this legislation and the \nresources it provides will continue to help provide quality child care \nin my home State of Wyoming, and other rural States. Many families in \nWyoming reside in very isolated areas, and by helping to support child \ncare centers in those rural areas, this legislation will help provide \nhigh quality child care; a service that many in those communities might \notherwise be forced to do without.\n  This legislation represents a truly bi-partisan effort and I look \nforward to having it signed into law this year. The Caring for Children \nAct includes some very important changes in our nation's premier child \ncare program that provide families with the assistance they need to \nwork and access to child care that best meets their children's needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child \ncare; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators \nDodd, Kennedy, and Murray in once again introducing the Child Care \nQuality Incentive Act, which seeks to redouble our child care efforts \nand renew the child care partnership with the States by providing \nincentive funding to increase payment rates.\n  This legislation seeks to put high-quality child care within the \nreach of more working families. As things stand, States too often fund \nonly a fraction of prevailing child care costs.\n  Under the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), States are \nrequired to perform market rate surveys every two years. Yet many \nStates\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\ndisregard them when it comes time to setting their payment rates, the \nlevel at which States reimburse child care providers who care for low-\nincome children who receive a child care subsidy. As a result, States \nare unable to meet the law's promise to give eligible low-income \nfamilies the same access to child care services as non-eligible \nfamilies.\n  At stake are safe, supportive, and educationally enriching \nenvironments for children during the formative years that set the stage \nfor future performance in school and beyond. When payment rates are set \ntoo low, child care centers that serve low-income children struggle to \nsurvive and may have to close. If they choose to stay afloat despite \nthe limited ability of families to pay, the tradeoffs directly impact \nthe quality of care. Such tradeoffs include smaller staffs, underpaid \nemployees with few or no benefits, and limited employee training, \neducational materials, and community services like health screenings. \nThose centers that avoid this route may turn low-income children away \nor be forced out of business.\n  Under welfare reform we expect the neediest parents to hold jobs to \nsustain their families. We must also afford them responsible choices to \nprotect their children while they pursue their economic future.\n  Our legislation creates a new mandatory funding pool under the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant to help States increase payment rates, \nwhile requiring States to set payment rates in line with updated market \nrate surveys. As such, it will allow more low-income families access to \nquality child care, and increase the availability of quality child care \nfor all families.\n  Support for this legislation is strong among leading national \norganizations such as USA Child Care, the Children's Defense Fund, the \nYMCA of the USA, Catholic Charities of the USA, the Child Welfare \nLeague of America, and many more. A range of local and State \norganizations and providers have also offered endorsements.\n  This year, Congress is slated to reauthorize the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, \nKennedy, Murray, and me in this endeavor to improve the quality of \nchild care by cosponsoring the Child Care Quality Incentive Act and \nworking to include its provisions in the CCDBG reauthorization. The \ntime to bring payment rates in line with market realities is now. Only \nthen will the commitment to offer equal access to quality child care \nring true.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n     much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n     nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care \n     and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, \n     positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of \n     long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term \n     economic and social self-sufficiency.\n       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n     6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day \n     in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 \n     in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n     development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care \n     that threatens the safety and health of children.\n       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $12,000 per \n     year.\n       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n     care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal \n     subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For \n     families with young children and a monthly income under \n     $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent \n     of their income.\n       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the \n     maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for \n     the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to \n     ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.\n       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n     children get and whether families can find quality child care \n     in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n     force child care providers serving low-income children to cut \n     corners in ways that impact the quality of care for the \n     children, including reducing the number of staff, eliminating \n     professional development opportunities, and cutting enriching \n     educational activities and services.\n       (7) Children in low-quality child care are more likely to \n     have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n     aggression toward other children and adults.\n       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n     care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n     qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n     training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and \n     purchase basic supplies, children's literature, and \n     developmentally appropriate educational materials.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the \n     quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child \n     care payment rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Caring for Children Act of 2005. We were able to work \ntogether on both sides of the aisle to prepare this bill to reauthorize \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant program. The Caring for \nChildren Act reflects our common goals to expand access and improve the \nquality of child care for children and families throughout the Nation.\n  Child care is a key issue in both welfare reform and education \nreform. The success of our welfare system rests on our ability to \nprovide dependable and consistent child care support for low-income \nfamilies, so that they can work and provide for their families. \nImproving the quality of child care and the environment in which our \nchildren develop is an essential responsibility of our society as a \nwhole, and this legislation can be an important part of our effort in \nCongress to meet that responsibility.\n  Today, 65 percent of parents with young children and 79 percent of \nparents with school age children are in America's workforce. During the \nworking day, 14 million children are cared for by someone other than a \nparent.\n  For low-income families and single mothers, child care assistance is \na lifeline. Low-income mothers who receive child care assistance are 40 \npercent more likely to remain employed after 2 years, compared to those \nwho do not receive such support. Yet child care is still unaffordable \nfor far too many families--full-day care can easily cost thousands of \ndollars a year and become an impossible expense for millions of \nfamilies.\n  The Caring for Children Act will expand access to child care and do \nmore to deliver the support that working parents need in obtaining \neffective child care. The bill supports activities to help parents fmd \nquality care through State Resource and Referral Centers, so that \ngreater information and outreach to parents will be available.\n  Child care is a vital support for working parents, and it is also an \nessential link in preparing young children for school. Research shows \nthat the early environments in which children learn and develop have a \nprofound impact on their later development and on their success in \nschool. Unfortunately, much remains to be done to improve the quality \nof child care. Nearly half of all kindergarten teachers report that the \nmajority of children in each entering class has specific problems, \nincluding difficulty in following directions, lack of even the most \nbasic academic skills, troubled situations at home, or difficulty in \nrelating to other children.\n  The Caring for Children Act seeks to improve the quality of child \ncare available to low-income children and their families through the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant. The bill will raise the amount \nof funds that States must dedicate to quality activities from 4 to 6 \npercent.\n  Most important, the Act will promote better child care by focusing on \nactivities that make children ready to learn, and encouraging States to \nimprove child safety and well-being. Funds will be used to provide \ngreater training and support for child care workers, establish \nvoluntary guidelines for school preparedness, and enhance the early \nlearning of young children.\n  Investments in the child care workforce are also essential to improve \nthe quality of care. Today, only one in\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\nseven child care centers provides a level of quality adequate for child \ndevelopment. Thirty states have no pre-service training requirements \nfor child care workers. Our bill supports professional development and \neducation opportunities for child care providers to upgrade their \nskills and to use proven and effective early learning materials and \nteaching strategies in their work. It encourages states to increase the \nrecruitment and retention of qualified child care staff and reduce the \nhigh turnover rates in child care centers.\n  We must also do more to ensure that states provide timely and \nadequate payments for high quality care. The Caring for Children Act \nwill improve reimbursement rates for care in the states, and more \neffectively use the market survey required under current law to \nestablish payment rates. I commend Senator Reed for his leadership on \nthose provisions.\n  Finally, the Caring for Children Act creates a new Federal commitment \nto serve children in need, including families with infants and \ntoddlers, children with disabilities, and families that require special \ncare during non-traditional work hours. Thanks to Senator Harkin's \nleadership, the needs of infants and toddlers will continue to be \naddressed in this bill.\n  The Caring for Children Act builds on effective practices already \nunderway in many states, but we still have a long way to go to see that \nall children have access to good child care. More resources are clearly \nrequired, and the need is urgent.\n  In nearly half the states, eligible children are being placed on \nwaiting lists or being turned away altogether. In Massachusetts, over \n16,000 low-income children are on waiting lists.\n  Instead of responding to this need, the President's budget for Fiscal \nYear 2006 freezes funding for the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant. Under the Administration's own calculations, 300,000 fewer low-\nincome children will have access to child care assistance by 2010. \nSurely, we can do better.\n  It makes no sense to cut back on child care for low-income children. \nWe need to serve as many needy children as possible. I look forward \nvery much to working with our colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nmake that goal a reality as the reauthorization of the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families Block Grant moves forward this year.\n  I commend Senators Enzi, Alexander, and Dodd for their impressive \nwork on this bill. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support \nthis important legislation and work with us to provide the support for \nquality child care that low-income families throughout America need and \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Schumer, and \n        Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 527.

Mr. President, the tragic attacks of September 11, \n2001 reminded us that police are heroes who risk their lives to protect \nus.\n  That's why it's so outrageous that a gun manufacturer would design \nand market a ``cop killer'' weapon.\n  Today on the streets of our cities there is a handgun, called the \nFive-SeveN, that was specifically designed to pierce bulletproof vests \nlike the ones worn by police.\n  The web site for this gun actually brags that it can pierce \nprotective armor--that it is a potential cop killer.\n  One of these weapons was recently confiscated by police officer in \nCamden, NJ, from a suspect charged with trafficking in large amounts of \nnarcotics.\n  If there had been a gunfight, the police would have been outgunned.\n  Who knows how many cop-killer guns are on the streets of my State--or \nyours?\n  Police across the nation are alarmed by this weapon. The police chief \nof Jersey City, Robert Troy, recently pleaded with Congress to ban this \ngun.\n  That's why I have introduced the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) \nAct to take ``cop-killer guns'' off the streets. And, I am pleased \nSenators Corzine, Schumer and Clinton are co-sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  There might be a place for this gun on a battlefield . . . but not \nnear a playground.\n  Not on our streets.\n  The cop-killer gun isn't good for hunting. The last time I checked, \ndeer didn't wear bulletproof vests.\n  It isn't for target shooting.\n  It isn't even a practical weapon for protection against home \nintruders.\n  The cop-killer gun was designed for one thing--piercing the \nprotective armor worn by police officers.\n  This is a weapon a terrorist or criminal would love: light and easily \nconcealed, yet so powerful that it can penetrate a bullet-proof vest \nfrom a distance of more than two football fields.\n  Armor-piercing bullets are already illegal, but the cop-killer gun \nhas slipped through a loophole in the law.\n  Simply put, this gun skirts the law by delivering ammunition with \nunusual velocity, turning otherwise legal bullets into ``cop killers.''\n  We can't sit by. We must protect our police.\n  We must ban the cop-killer gun and close the loophole on cop-killer \nbullets.\n  Our police officers risk their lives to protect us . . . but we \nshould reduce that risk as much as possible.\n  Let's get cop-killer guns off our streets.\n  Let's pass the PLEA Act.\n  The PLEA Act is simple. It would ban the Five-seven assault pistol, \nban the special armor piecing FN 5.7 x 28mm S 192 ammunition, expand \nthe federal definition of armor piercing ammunition, and require the \nAttorney General to test any ammunition that is capable of penetrating \nbody armor.\n  The PLEA Act does not apply to the military and law enforcement. In \nfact, it specifically exempts sale of armor piercing ammunition to the \nmilitary and law enforcement.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Law Enforcement \n     Armor Act'' or the ``PLEA Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Law enforcement is facing a new threat from handguns \n     and accompanying ammunition, which are designed to penetrate \n     police body armor, being marketed and sold to civilians.\n       (2) A Five-seveN Pistol and accompanying ammunition, \n     manufactured by FN Herstal of Belgium as the ``5.7 x 28 mm \n     System,'' has recently been recovered by law enforcement on \n     the streets. The Five-seveN Pistol and 5.7 x 28mm SS192 \n     cartridges are legally available for purchase by civilians \n     under current law.\n       (3) The Five-seveN Pistol and 5.7 x 28mm SS192 cartridges \n     are capable of penetrating level IIA armor. The manufacturer \n     advertises that ammunition fired from the Five-seveN will \n     perforate 48 layers of Kevlar up to 200 meters and that the \n     ammunition travels at 2100 feet per second.\n       (4) The Five-seveN Pistol, and similar handguns designed to \n     use ammunition capable of penetrating body armor, pose a \n     devastating threat to law enforcement.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect the \n     Nation's law enforcement officers by--\n       (1) testing handguns and ammunition for capability to \n     penetrate body armor; and\n       (2) prohibiting the manufacture, importation, sale, or \n     purchase by civilians of the Five-seveN Pistol, ammunition \n     for such pistol, or any other handgun that uses ammunition \n     found to be capable of penetrating body armor.\n\n     SEC. 3. ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Definition of Armor Piercing Ammunition.--\n     Section 921(a)(17)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iii) a projectile that--\n       ``(I) may be used in a handgun; and\n       ``(II) the Attorney General determines, pursuant to section \n     926(d), to be capable of penetrating body armor.''.\n       (b) Determination of Capability of Projectiles to Penetrate \n     Body Armor.--Section 926 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\n       ``(d)(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \n     of this subsection, the Attorney General shall promulgate \n     standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against Body \n     Armor Exemplar.\n       ``(2) The standards promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     shall take into account, among other factors, variations in \n     performance that are related to the type of handgun used, the \n     length of the barrel of the handgun, the amount and kind of \n     powder used to propel the projectile, and the design of the \n     projectile.\n       ``(3) As used in paragraph (1), the term `Body Armor \n     Exemplar' means body armor that the Attorney General \n     determines meets minimum standards for the protection of law \n     enforcement officers.''\n\n     SEC. 4. ARMOR PIERCING HANDGUNS AND AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 922 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding after subsection (y):\n       ``(z) Five-seveN Pistol.--\n       ``(1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person to \n     manufacture, import, market, sell, ship, deliver, possess, \n     transfer, or receive--\n       ``(A) the Fabrique Nationale Herstal Five-SeveN Pistol;\n       ``(B) 5.7 x 28mm SS190 and SS192 cartridges; or\n       ``(C) any other handgun that uses armor piercing \n     ammunition.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--This subsection shall not apply to--\n       ``(A) any firearm or armor piercing ammunition manufactured \n     for, and sold exclusively to, military, law enforcement, or \n     intelligence agencies of the United States; and\n       ``(B) the manufacture, possession, transfer, receipt, \n     shipment, or delivery of a firearm or armor piercing \n     ammunition by a licensed manufacturer, or any person acting \n     pursuant to a contract with a licensed manufacturer, for the \n     purpose of examining and testing such firearm or ammunition \n     to determine whether paragraph (1) applies to such \n     firearm.''.\n       (b) Penalties.--Section 924(a)(1)(B) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``or (q)'' and inserting \n     ``(q), or (z)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 528. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to provide grants to States to conduct demonstration projects \nthat are designed to enable medicaid-eligible individuals to receive \nsupport for appropriate and necessary long-term services in the \nsettings of their choice; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Smith, \nintroduce the Money Follows the Person Act of 2005. This legislation is \nneeded to truly bring people with disabilities into the mainstream of \nsociety and provide equal opportunity for employment and community \nactivities.\n  In order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with \ndisabilities need access to community-based services and supports. \nUnfortunately, under current Federal Medicaid policy, the deck is \nstacked in favor of living in an institution. The purpose of this bill \nis to level the playing field and give eligible individuals equal \naccess to community-based services and supports.\n  Under our legislation, the Medicaid money paid by states and the \nFederal government would follow the person with a disability from an \ninstitution into the community. This legislation provides 100 percent \nFederal reimbursement for the community services that an individual \nneeds during the first year that they move out of an institution or \nnursing home. By fully reimbursing the states, it gives them some \nadditional resources to allow people with disabilities to choose to \nlive in the community.\n  President Bush first proposed the Money Follows the Person \nRebalancing Initiative in his FY '04 budget and indicated that the \ndemonstration project would provide full Federal reimbursement for \ncommunity services for the first year that an individual moves out of \nan institution or nursing home. Senator Smith and I have worked with \nthe disability community and others in drafting this legislation, and \nwe look forward to working with the Administration and our colleagues \nto enact the Money Follows the Person concept into law.\n  We have a Medicaid system in this country that is spending \napproximately two-thirds of its dollars on institutional care and \napproximately one-third on community services. This bill is an \nimportant step toward switching those numbers around.\n  It is shameful that our federal dollars are being spent to segregate \npeople, not integrate them. It has been 15 years since we passed the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, which said ``no'' to segregation. But \nour Medicaid program says ``yes'' and we need to change it. This is the \nnext civil rights battle. If we really meant what we said in the ADA in \n1990, we should enact this legislation.\n  The civil right of a person with a disability to be integrated into \nhis or her community should not depend on his or her address. In \nOlmstead v. LC, the Supreme Court recognized that needless \ninstitutionalization is a form of discrimination under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. We in Congress have a responsibility to help \nStates meet their obligations under Olmstead. An individual should not \nbe asked to move to another state in order to avoid needless \nsegregation. They also should not be moved away from family and friends \nbecause their only choice is an institution.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus reached in the \nADA that Americans with disabilities should have equal opportunity to \ncontribute to our communities and participate in our society as full \ncitizens. That means no one has to sacrifice their full participation \nin society because they need help getting out of the house in the \nmorning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service.\n  This bill will open the door to full participation by people with \ndisabilities in our neighborhoods, our communities, our workplaces, and \nour American Dream, and I urge all my colleagues to support us on this \nissue. I want to thank Senator Smith for his commitment to improving \naccess to home and community based services for people with \ndisabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Money Follows the Person Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to designate a United States Anti-Doping Agency; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, America is a nation of sports fans and \nsports players. In fact, it is hard to imagine something more \ninfluential in today's society than athletics. As children, we grow up \nemulating our favorite players in the backyard. Year in and year out we \nwatch and hope that this is the year our favorite team makes it to the \nSuper Bowl, the World Series, or the Big Dance. And every 4 years we \nwatch in pride and tally the medals as American athletes compete in the \nOlympic games.\n  Every day millions of young people from across the country share the \nsame dream of one day playing in the big leagues. But the reality is \nthat most will never get the chance. In an average year, there are \napproximately 2 million high school boys playing football, baseball, \nand basketball. Another 68,000 men are playing the sports in college \nand 2,500 are participating at the major/professional level. In short, \nonly 1 in 736, or 0.14 percent will ever play professional sports.\n  With that kind of competition, compounded by the lure of fame, \nendorsements and multi-million dollar contracts, an increasing number \nof young athletes are giving in to the seduction of performance \nenhancing drugs hoping to gain an edge on their peers. And what can you \nexpect when some of the biggest superstars in sports have been found \nusing steroids as a way to improve their performance. But, unlike \nbetter athletic gear, better nutrition, and better training, injecting \nand ingesting performance enhancing drugs as a shortcut to the big \nleagues jeopardizes the health and safety of young athletes and \ncheapens the legitimacy of competition.\n  In an effort to combat the use of performance enhancing drugs at the \nyouth and amateur sports level, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Biden, Senator McCain and Senator Stevens in \nintroducing legislation to authorize continued Federal funding for the \nUnited States Anti-Doping Agency, USADA. As the anti-doping agency for \nthe United States Olympic movement since 2000, USADA is responsible for \nensuring that U.S. athletes participating in Olympic competition do not \nuse performance enhancing drugs. Through its efforts, USADA is \nestablishing a drug free standard for amateur athletic competition. \nThis is achieved through testing, research, education, and \nadjudication.\n  USADA conducts nearly 6,500 random drug tests on athletes annually \nand has made anti-doping presentations to over 3,000 athletes and \ncoaches last year alone. Over the last 2 years, USADA has worked to \nprevent U.S. Olympic athletes who have used banned substances from \nparticipating in the Olympic Games. But for the efforts of USADA, it is \npossible that more than a dozen elite U.S. athletes would have \nparticipated in the Athens Games last Summer and potentially \nembarrassed the U.S. once their drug use was exposed. USADA also works \nto fund research, including more than $3 million in grants for anti-\ndoping research over the past 2 years, which is more than any other \nanti-doping agency in the world. The research and testing standards \nserve as models for other amateur athletic associations who wish to \nprotect the health of their athletes and the fair competition of sport.\n  To date, the Federal Government has provided approximately 60 percent \nof USADA's operational budget, with the remainder of the agency's \nbudget provided by the U.S. Olympic Committee and private funding \nsources. With continued support and proper funding, USADA could expand \nand improve upon the programs for anti-doping that already exist and \ncontinue to enhance the credibility of U.S. athletes in the eyes of the \ninternational sports community.\n  While the issue of anabolic steroids has received a great deal of \nnational and international attention in the context of professional \nsports, the importance of stopping steroid abuse extends far beyond the \ntrack, baseball diamond, or football field. Instead our focus should be \non the health and future of our children. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin in support of this legislation to set the standard for free and \nfair competition.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF UNITED STATES ANTI-DOPING AGENCY.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) United states olympic committee.--The term ``United \n     States Olympic Committee'' means the organization established \n     by the ``Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act'' (36 \n     U.S.C. 220501 et seq.).\n       (2) Amateur athletic competition.--The term ``amateur \n     athletic competition'' means a contest, game, meet, match, \n     tournament, regatta, or other event in which amateur athletes \n     compete (36 U.S.C. 220501(b)(2)).\n       (3) Amateur athlete.--The term ``amateur athlete'' means an \n     athlete who meets the eligibility standards established by \n     the national governing body or paralympic sports organization \n     for the sport in which the athlete competes (36 U.S.C. \n     22501(b)(1)).\n       (b) In General.--The United States Anti-Doping Agency \n     shall--\n       (1) serve as the independent anti-doping organization for \n     the amateur athletic competitions recognized by the United \n     States Olympic Committee;\n       (2) ensure that athletes participating in amateur athletic \n     activities recognized by the United States Olympic Committee \n     are prevented from using performance-enhancing drugs;\n       (3) implement anti-doping education, research, testing, and \n     adjudication programs to prevent United States Amateur \n     Athletes participating in any activity recognized by the \n     United States Olympic Committee from using performance-\n     enhancing drugs; and\n       (4) serve as the United States representative responsible \n     for coordination with other anti-doping organizations \n     coordinating amateur athletic competitions recognized by the \n     United States Olympic Committee to ensure the integrity of \n     athletic competition, the health of the athletes and the \n     prevention of use of performance-enhancing drugs by United \n     States amateur athletes.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 69\n\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) evolved from the Conference on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which was established in 1975, \n     and the official change of its name from CSCE to OSCE became \n     effective on January 1, 1995;\n       Whereas the OSCE is the largest regional security \n     organization in the world with 55 participating States from \n     Europe, Central Asia, and North America;\n       Whereas the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the 1990 Charter of \n     Paris, and the 1999 Charter for European Security adopted in \n     Istanbul are the principle documents of OSCE, defining a \n     steadily evolving and maturing set of\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\n     political commitments based on a broad understanding of \n     security;\n       Whereas the OSCE is active in early warning, conflict \n     prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict \n     rehabilitation;\n       Whereas Russia and Georgia agreed at the 1999 OSCE Summit \n     in Istanbul on specific steps regarding the withdrawal from \n     Georgia of Russian forces, including military equipment \n     limited by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe \n     (CFE), and committed to resolve other key issues relating to \n     the status and duration of the Russian military presence in \n     Georgia;\n       Whereas Russia has completed some of the withdrawal from \n     Georgia of military equipment limited by the CFE Treaty in \n     excess of agreed levels, but has yet to agree with Georgia on \n     the status of Russian forces at the Gudauata base and the \n     duration of the Russian presence at the Akhalkalaki and \n     Batumi bases;\n       Whereas Russia completed the withdrawal from Moldova of its \n     declared military equipment limited by the CFE Treaty, but \n     has yet to withdraw all its military forces from Moldova, as \n     Russia committed to do at the 1999 OSCE Summit in Istanbul;\n       Whereas Russia made virtually no progress in 2004 toward \n     its commitment to withdraw its military forces from Moldova;\n       Whereas Moldova has called for a genuinely international \n     peacekeeping force to replace the Russian forces, and insists \n     on the implementation by Russia of its commitment to withdraw \n     its remaining military forces from Moldova;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Colin Powell stated at the \n     December 2004 OSCE Ministerial in Sofia, Bulgaria, that \n     ``Russia's commitments to withdraw its military forces from \n     Moldova, and to agree with Georgia on the duration of the \n     Russian military presence there, remain unfulfilled. A core \n     principle of the CFE Treaty is host country agreement to the \n     stationing of forces. The United States remains committed to \n     moving ahead with ratification of the Adapted CFE Treaty, but \n     we will only do so after all the Istanbul commitments on \n     Georgia and Moldova have been met. And we stand ready to \n     assist with reasonable costs associated with the \n     implementation of those commitments.'';\n       Whereas since June 2004, Russia has called for the closure \n     of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), the sole \n     source of objective reporting on border crossings along the \n     border between Georgia and with the Russian republics of \n     Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia;\n       Whereas OSCE border monitors took up their mission in \n     Georgia in May 2000, and prior to the failure to extend the \n     mandate for the BMO in December 2004, OSCE border monitors, \n     who are unarmed, were deployed at nine locations along that \n     border;\n       Whereas the current rotation of the BMO includes 65 border \n     monitors from 23 countries, including Austria, Azerbaijan, \n     Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \n     Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, \n     Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, \n     Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States;\n       Whereas at the December 2004 OSCE Ministerial, Russia \n     blocked renewal of the mandate for the BMO in Georgia;\n       Whereas Russia has stated that the BMO has accomplished \n     nothing, but it has in fact accomplished a great deal, \n     including observing 746 unarmed and 61 armed border crossings \n     in 2004 and serving as a counterweight to inflammatory press \n     reports;\n       Whereas in response to Russian complaints about the cost-\n     effectiveness of the BMO, the OSCE agreed in December 2004 to \n     cut the number of monitors and thereby reduce the cost of the \n     BMO by almost half;\n       Whereas the BMO began shutting down on January 1, 2005;\n       Whereas the staff of the BMO is now dismantling facilities \n     and is not performing its mission;\n       Whereas the shutdown of the BMO will become irreversible in \n     the second half of March 2005 and is currently scheduled to \n     be completed by May 2005;\n       Whereas the United States has reiterated its disappointment \n     over the failure of the Permanent Council of the OSCE to \n     reach consensus on renewing the mandate of the BMO, despite \n     request of Georgia, the host country of the BMO, that the \n     OSCE continue the border monitoring operation, and the \n     consensus of all states but one to extend the mandate for the \n     BMO; and\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to the United States \n     Mission to the OSCE, Stephan M. Minikes, said in a statement \n     to the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on January 19, 2005, \n     that ``we believe that the closure of the BMO would remove a \n     key source of peaceful relations and of objective reporting \n     on events at the sensitive border and increase the likelihood \n     of heightened Russia-Georgia tensions.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) urge Russia to live up to its commitments at the 1999 \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     Summit in Istanbul regarding Georgia and Moldova;\n       (2) in cooperation with its European allies, maintain \n     strong diplomatic pressure to permit the OSCE Border \n     Monitoring Operation (BMO) in Georgia to continue; and\n       (3) if the BMO ceases to exist, seek, in cooperation with \n     its European allies, an international presence to monitor \n     objectively border crossings along the border between Georgia \n     and the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and \n     Ingushetia.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing the \nUnited States Senate's concern about Russia's actions in Georgia and \nMoldova.\n  At the Organization for Security & Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) \n1999 conference in Istanbul, Russia signed commitments to withdraw \ntroops from both Georgia and Moldova. While Russia has fulfilled some \naspects of those agreements, Russian troops and military bases remain \nin both countries. In my resolution, I urge Russia to live up to its \n1999 Istanbul Commitments.\n  The resolution also addresses concerns about the OSCE's Border \nMonitoring Operation (BMO) in Georgia. The BMO, which took up its \nmission in Georgia in 2000, is the sole source of objective reporting \non border crossings along Georgia's border with the Russian republics \nof Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia.\n  Since last June, Russia has called for the closure of the BMO in \nGeorgia. In December, Russia blocked renewal of the mandate for the \nBMO, stating that it had accomplished nothing. I am disappointed that \nthe OSCE was unable to renew the BMO's mandate. The BMO started \nshutting down in January and is expected to be fully closed by May.\n  The future of the BMO mission is uncertain. The United States, in \ncooperation with its European allies, should work to preserve the BMO \nin Georgia. But if the BMO is not revived, my resolution calls upon the \nUnited States and its European allies to seek an international presence \nto monitor objectively crossings along Georgia's border.\n  I am concerned that if Russia does not fulfill its commitments to \nwithdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova, and if the Border Monitoring \nOperation in Georgia shuts down, the security situation in the region \ncould further deteriorate. The United States must provide strong \nleadership on these issues.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/03/senate-section/article/S2045-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 70--COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY \n                                 SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 1602.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, the Senate adjourn until 9:30 a.m. \non Friday, March 4.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will continue \nconsideration of the bankruptcy bill.\n  We have had a very, very productive week considering a number of \namendments and had a number of rollcall votes. In addition, we have \nreached an agreement, which I will be commenting on shortly with the \nunanimous consent request, that will allow us to vote on both the \nKennedy and Santorum minimum wage amendments Monday afternoon. Those \ntwo votes will occur at 5:30, and Senators should plan to be here for \nthose important votes.\n  We will be in session tomorrow, as I mentioned. There will be no \nrollcall votes during tomorrow's session. Senators who wish to speak on \nthe bill are encouraged to come to the floor tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had relatively short days because of \nsome things which happened in the evening. We have done pretty well \nthis week. I think we have close to 15 amendments total. The bankruptcy \ndebate was interrupted as a result of legislation that Senator Nickles \nand I produced some time ago to take a look at regulations promulgated \nby the government only be used three times but was used in the mad cow \nsituation. That took up a big chunk of time today.\n  I think we have done quite well. There are a number of Senators \ncoming here tomorrow to offer amendments on bankruptcy.\n  It is the contemplation, after having conferred with the Republican \nleader, that we are going to try to resolve a time to finish the clinic \nviolence amendment. We are trying to do that early next week. I \ncertainly hope we can do that as early as we can.\n  This week we have really been legislators. It has been very nice.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I concur with the Democratic leader. It has \nbeen a productive week, and we are governing with meaningful solutions, \nand we look forward to completing this bill next week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in addition to the Kennedy \namendment regarding minimum wage, that it be in order for Senator \nSantorum to offer a first-degree amendment related to the minimum wage \nissue; provided further that on Monday, March 7, there be 3 hours of \ndebate equally divided between Senators Santorum and Kennedy, or their \ndesignees; provided further that at 5:30 on Monday the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the Kennedy amendment to be followed by a vote on the \nSantorum amendment with no amendments in order to either amendment, and \nno further intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that if either amendment does not \nreceive 60 votes in the affirmative, then Senate action on the \namendment be vitiated and the amendment be immediately withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
