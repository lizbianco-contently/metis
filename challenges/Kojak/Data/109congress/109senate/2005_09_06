Mr. President, I have a few housekeeping matters as we \nbegin today.\n  I have talked to the Democratic leader and a number of our colleagues \nabout changes we have made in our current schedule. As all Members are \naware, on July 29 we filed cloture motions on two items that were \nscheduled for consideration today. In light of Hurricane Katrina, we \nwill be shifting our focus this week, and I am prepared to make those \nchanges by unanimous consent.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the two cloture votes scheduled \nfor 5:30 this afternoon be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the order \nbe modified so that at 2:15 today, the Senate begin a period for \nmorning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach, with the time until 5:30 equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  I further ask consent that at 5:30 today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on adoption of a resolution related to Hurricane Katrina.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Senators should be aware that now the vote \nat 5:30 today will occur on the resolution expressing condolences to \nthe victims of Katrina. I expect that a number of our colleagues will \nwant to speak today on that resolution, and we have provided time to do \nso between 2:15 and 5:30 today.\n\n  In addition, following that vote, at 6 p.m. this evening there will \nbe an all-Senators briefing related to our Gulf States. At that \nbriefing will be a number of the Cabinet Secretaries who will be \navailable. That briefing will be in S-407 in the Capitol.\n  As I have been stating, it is our intention to move very quickly, \nresponsibly, and aggressively to Hurricane Katrina and her aftermath. \nThis relief is underway. We need to make sure that we are maximally \nsupportive and responsive in a timely fashion. I believe we \ndemonstrated that last Thursday when we came in in an urgent session to \napprove $10.5 billion which subsequently became law and was signed by \nthe President.\n  Later today--again another manifestation of being able and \nappropriately responding to the changing events--we will clear a bill \nknown as the Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Sessions Authority \nwhich will allow the affected U.S. courts to conduct business under \nthese emergency conditions.\n  Tomorrow, we will pay tribute to the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, William Rehnquist. I will say more later today on the schedule \nas it relates to the funeral and a Senate resolution relating to Chief \nJustice Rehnquist.\n  Finally, we will be turning to the Commerce, Justice and Science \nappropriations bill later this week. That appropriations measure does \nfund a number of hurricane-related activities.\n  Earlier today, the Democratic leader and I, Chairman Specter, and \nRanking Member Leahy from the Judiciary Committee outlined the schedule \nwith\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\nregard to Judge Roberts' hearings and the nomination process over the \nnext month. Those hearings will begin Monday, September 12, at noon. \nThe committee will report out Judge Roberts no later than Thursday, \nSeptember 22. We will begin Senate floor consideration the week of \nSeptember 26, and we will complete action no later than Friday, \nSeptember 30.\n  I believe that is relatively complete in terms of the changes we have \nmade in response to two very sad and unfortunate events: Hurricane \nKatrina, a natural disaster which is ongoing, as we all know, and the \ndeath of Chief Justice Rehnquist. We will remain flexible in terms of \nour scheduling in this body to address that natural catastrophe along \nthe Gulf States. We will be acting in a bipartisan and bicameral way, \nas has been seen to date, in these matters in order to facilitate an \nimmediate response initially to the victims and then ultimately to the \nrecovery and rebuilding of those gulf regions, with the goal of greater \nprosperity than they have ever seen in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9608-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9608-S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 KATRINA AFTERMATH AND RECOVERY EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I did have the opportunity to travel to the gulf coast and \nparticipate, not as a Senator but as a volunteer physician, and to see \nfirsthand the tremendous response on the ground among our medical \npersonnel, our health personnel, and our volunteers, but also to \nwitness firsthand that scope of human suffering and need that was \ncaused by last week's catastrophe, which affected those three Gulf \nStates and indirectly affected the entire region--indeed, the entire \ncountry. What I saw was staggering. Hurricane Katrina now stands as the \nlargest natural disaster in American history. Ninety thousand square \nmiles, an area larger than the United Kingdom, have been utterly \ndevastated.\n  Many of my colleagues have had the chance to fly over that region. As \nwe all know, many of our colleagues and their families have been \ndirectly and personally impacted. The cities are flooded, the entire \ncoast along southern Mississippi destroyed, towns demolished, farmlands \nturned to swamp, transportation, distribution channels totally wiped \nout, and local communication destroyed, slowly coming back but totally \ndestroyed. Hundreds of thousands of residents affected across these \nthree States are now displaced.\n  In our leadership meeting a little while ago, we went around the \ntable. Everybody has received the displaced persons in numbers of \nthousands and thousands.\n  Many of these people have health problems, short-term and long-term \nproblems, that must be addressed. It is going to take all of us pulling \ntogether to do this.\n  Secretary Leavitt, Health and Human Services Secretary, estimates \nthat thousands of innocent people have died in the hurricane's wake. As \nthe floodwaters recede, more and more bodies, unfortunately, will be \nfound--people who were unable to escape the torrential flooding that \ntook place shortly after the hurricane struck. The loss is so profound \nthat none of us will be able to express what we have seen or what we \nfeel in words.\n  I have had a chance to be in other areas, in Sri Lanka after the \ntsunami and in the Darfur region in Sudan. Everybody says, Is this \nworse? How do you compare it? You can't compare it; all were tremendous \ntragedies. But I will say that what I had the chance to see there, in \nterms of the mass of humanity in that convention center and in the New \nOrleans airport, I can't compare it to anything I have seen, even \nhaving seen such tragedies elsewhere in the world.\n  One of the other things I need to mention early on is that human \nconnection you do see when you are in the middle of a response such as \nthis--the compassion, the concern. You saw patients lying together on \nscores and scores of stretchers, hundreds of stretchers that were on \nthe floor, and you have one patient leaning over, taking care of \nanother patient even though they didn't know each other. Patients were \ntaking care of themselves, especially early on when there was a clear \nshortage of personnel to respond to that initial disaster, as people \ncame flowing into the airport.\n  You had rescue workers from all walks of life, volunteers from \ncollege campuses, health personnel from what are called DMAT or \ndisaster medical assistance teams from around the country, all enduring \ncrushing heat and exhaustion to pour out their hearts and use those \nskills they had, whatever those skills, so we could maximize that \nresponse to those people being evacuated from this place.\n  Volunteer workers were from the State of the distinguished President \npro tempore, the State of Alaska. I had the opportunity to work side by \nside with them, and with volunteers from Hawaii and from Tennessee. I \nsaw a number of my colleagues from medical college, from Vanderbilt in \nNashville, and Boston, MA, where I worked in the past. They were \ncontributing in such a positive way.\n  Many people were so moved by the stories they read they got on the \nroad and went to that Gulf State region to volunteer their services. \nThey didn't ask; they didn't pay attention to the redtape or people who \nsaid stay away, and went in. They were all very useful as they poured \nout their hearts to those who were suffering from this catastrophe.\n  I have to also mention the Knox County Volunteers, because the \nsheriff's department there sent down several helicopters early on, \nagain before even being asked, and they were very instrumental in \ndropping food and dropping supplies and helping people trying to \nevacuate their homes. I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with \nthem for both days, both at the convention center where we spent time, \nas well as at the New Orleans airport and, indeed, over in Mobile, AL. \nThey were there and all along the Mississippi coast, as we touched down \nthere.\n  I will have more to say about what I have been able to observe in \nthose experiences because I think it does reflect both the misery but \nalso the great compassion and the pulling together, the great spirit of \nthe American people that we are going to absolutely have to call upon \nas we continue to address this tragedy.\n  We in the Senate are acting. We are acting aggressively and \nresponsively and early. We are going to continue to do so. This has \nbecome our major priority, even though there are a lot of other issues \nwe are addressing. We have the skyrocketing energy prices, gasoline \nprices, and oil prices. We have the ongoing war in Iraq. We have the \njudicial nomination which is underway. And we have the response to \nKatrina. The response to Katrina right now, because it is an ongoing \ncatastrophe, an ongoing natural disaster, needs to be first and \nforemost. We are acting and we are going to continue to act \naggressively.\n  Last Thursday night we came in and the Democratic leader and I helped \nusher through, in a highly unusual emergency session, the $10.5 billion \naid bill. As we said then, that was only the beginning. We have so many \nurgent responsibilities now that we will be working together in a \nbipartisan way to address these issues.\n  Last Tuesday we sent out a note to all committee chairmen to begin \nbringing their legislative proposals to us. Over the next 48 hours we \nwill be talking to each of the chairmen and ranking members, to pull \ntogether their ideas both for the immediate response and the midterm \nresponse and the long-term response. There are a lot of human, \npractical needs that have to be addressed right now. The Federal \nGovernment has a major role as we look at health and we look at social \nservices and we look at housing and we look at food and we look at \nshelter, and then, in the longer term, solutions to putting the Gulf \nCoast back on a fast track to recovery and to rebuild, and rebuild with \na goal of even greater prosperity in the future.\n  The Energy Committee is conducting hearings today and will be \naddressing the supply/demand issues. There will be many more hearings \naddressing these issues. I have encouraged our Members to look at some \nof these real warning flags that have arisen, things such as the price \ngouging and excessive profit taking by energy companies and by oil \ncompanies. These are issues we have to be aggressive with, especially \nin this time of need.\n  Even before the hurricane hit, having spent about 2 weeks traveling \nacross\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nTennessee, listening, we heard again and again the price of gasoline \nand diesel at the pump was wiping out any margins of even survival for \nmany farmers and people who rely on our transportation industry.\n  I do want to call upon the energy industry and the energy sector to \nbe a responsible corporate actor. If not, there is going to be a real \nfocus placed by this Congress because they absolutely must respond \nappropriately. I mention that because of the reports, people calling in \nabout price gouging and excessive profit taking. If that is occurring \nanywhere, it absolutely must be reported immediately to the Department \nof Energy and must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  We have asked the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to conduct vigorous oversight hearings on what went wrong \nduring those initial days and hours, and what lessons we can learn from \nthis awful tragedy. Most of our response and energy needs to be focused \non the victims right now, both their evacuation and responding to their \nneeds, but at the same time that committee will begin their vigorous \noversight hearings in an orderly way to collect the appropriate \ninformation. Emergency response was unacceptable early on and in many \nways I saw it firsthand as a medical volunteer. We have to fix it. \nThose sorts of things should not happen in America today.\n  Every issue before us we will be addressing. Again, we are just \ncoming back in. I look forward to doing that. One of the biggest \nproblems on the ground will be the issues surrounding communications, \ncommand and control structures, and we will be addressing the longer \nterm issues of housing long term but also temporary housing, and issues \nsuch as health coverage and unemployment insurance, getting power back, \nrestoring the ports back to activity, dredging channels for those \ndisplaced, and making sure their insurance coverage--if they were so \nlucky to have insurance--is actually provided to them in a timely way.\n  Let me close by simply saying I am humbled and inspired by the \ntremendous generosity of all Americans who have given so much of \nthemselves and their time and their energy over the last several days--\nand their money--and the resources of compassion. I thank you and I \nknow America thanks you.\n  We are going to have to continue to invest. We are going to have to \ncontinue to pull together. The Senate is rolling up its sleeves. It has \ndone so. We are at work and will work aggressively to respond \nappropriately.\n  I am confident that America will be able to meet the challenges that \nlay ahead. Through all of this, we will be made stronger and better and \nmore unified and more hopeful as we pull together as a government and \nas a people in this time of crisis. The American people are leading the \nway, and together we will all be able to overcome these challenges.\n\n\n                           The Supreme Court\n\n  Tomorrow, I will have more to say about Chief Justice Rehnquist and \nthe nomination of Judge Roberts for Chief Justice.\n  Today, let me briefly say the Senate and the Nation mourn the loss of \nthe Chief, as he was affectionately known by so many of us and known on \nthe Supreme Court. We will all miss Chief Justice Rehnquist--from his \nbrilliant legal mind to his efficient and effective administration of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  We look forward with confidence as the President's new nominee for \nChief Justice, Judge Roberts, is considered. Judge Roberts learned from \nthe best. He was, in fact, a clerk, as we all know, for then-Associate \nJustice Rehnquist. There is no doubt in my mind that Judge Roberts has \nthe temperament, has the skill, and has the mind to lead the Supreme \nCourt for decades to come.\n  With that, we have a lot to do. I know the Democratic leader has a \nstatement. Then we will have time this afternoon after our lunches for \npeople to come back and make statements as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senate, under the \nstanding order, is to go out of session at 12:30 today. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if my remarks take \na little bit longer, that we wait until after my remarks to put the \nrecess.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9609-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the August recess was memorable for me for \nseveral reasons, not the least of which was my first visit to a \nhospital on my own behalf since I was 8 years old. I am grateful to the \nphysicians who cared and consulted with me. Admiral Eisold, the \nPhysician of the Capitol, is really a national treasure. The Congress \nis fortunate to have his curative hand over all we do.\n  While speaking of admirals, I would be remiss not to mention the \nSenate Chaplain, ADM Barry Black. After my brief hospital visit, my \nfirst public appearance in Nevada was at a faith-based summit I had \nbeen planning since January. The event turned out extremely well. The \nhighlight of the summit was a presentation of Dr. Black, our Chaplain. \nI only wish all Americans--Christian, Jewish, Protestant, Mormon, \nHindu, and Muslim--could have heard his presentation on faith and on \nvirtue and why America must be a virtuous nation. His remarks were \ninspiring not only for me but for everyone within the sound of his \nvoice.\n  I am happy to report that I am well. I feel fine. I have been advised \nmedically that I have no restrictions on my activities. I am so \nfortunate to now return to work in a place that I love--the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Words cannot adequately express my appreciation for the thoughts and \nprayers and good wishes that I received from my Senate colleagues and \nthe rest of the Senate family--some of whom are in the Chamber as I \nspeak--and, of course, my friends in Nevada and around the country. I \nwill long remember the cards, letters, phone calls, e-mails, and other \nexpressions of concern. So even though these words are insufficient, I \nthank you all for your concern for me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9609-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9609-S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, much has happened in the weeks since we \nadjourned for the August recess. In just the last few days, we have \nseen tragedy strike the gulf coast and learned that our friend, William \nRehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, had passed. Our thoughts \nand our prayers are with those struggling to pick up the pieces on the \ngulf coast following the hurricane. And, of course, our thoughts and \nprayers are with the Chief Justice's family.\n  I had the good fortune of working with the Chief on several \noccasions, the first when I was head of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee. I told my Democratic Senators I was going to ask the Chief \nJustice to come and talk to us. They said he would never do that. I \ncalled him, and he was happy to come. At that lunch, he displayed a \ngreat command of the law, of course, a strong commitment to judicial \nindependence, and something that we didn't know existed--a sharp sense \nof humor. Just a short time later, I got to know him better when he \npresided over the impeachment trial here in the Senate.\n  I am grateful to have worked with him, and in addition to have spoken \nto him on the telephone on several occasions at his office and at his \nhome.\n  As I have indicated, my condolences are with his family. He will be \nmissed.\n  Now that the President has said he will nominate Judge Roberts to \nreplace Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Senate's advice and consent \nresponsibility is even more important. If confirmed to this lifetime \njob, Judge Roberts will be the leader of the third branch of the \nFederal Government and most prominent judge in our Nation. The Senate \nmust be vigilant in considering this nomination.\n  I, of course, look forward to consulting with the President on the \nO'Connor seat which at some time will become vacant when the \nreplacement is chosen. Justice O'Connor, we have heard from this floor \nand around the country, has been a voice of moderation and reason on \nthe Court, and should be replaced by someone who, like her, embodies \nfundamental American values of fairness, liberty, and equality.\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9609-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9609-S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Justice O'Connor, we have heard from this floor \nand around the country, has been a voice of moderation and reason on \nthe Court, and should be replaced by someone who, like her, embodies \nfundamental American values of fairness, liberty, and equality.\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9610-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the work that we have to complete in the \nwaning days of this session is significant and difficult, and nothing \nwe do in the days ahead can be more important than helping the victims \nof Hurricane Katrina get back on their feet. They are counting on us. \nIt is their time of need. We owe it to them to give them everything we \nare capable of giving them.\n  The most terrible tragedies routinely bring out the best in America \nand Americans. We have seen that again in the aftermath of Katrina, one \nof the most horrible natural disasters in the history of this Nation.\n  Americans are coming together and giving their time and money to the \nmillions of victims. They are putting their personal concerns aside so \nthey can put Americans in need first. Now they expect America's \nGovernment to do the same.\n  There are dozens of steps the Senate can take in order to get \nimmediate relief to the victims of the gulf coast--steps we can take to \nmake sure Medicaid is easily and readily available to those who need \nit, to get families the housing assistance they badly need, and to get \nresources to the school districts all over the country so displaced \nchildren do not lose a precious day of this school year. These items \nmust be our top priority.\n  I commend the majority leader for clearing the Senate Calendar of the \nestate tax so we can focus on Katrina. We can do better. Families in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida are counting on us to do \nthat. They are suffering, and they have nowhere else to turn. We owe it \nto them to make their safety and survival our top priority, and we \nshould give them nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9610-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the entire Nation continues to be focused \non the millions of Americans who have been devastated and displaced by \nhurricane Katrina. My heart and prayers go out to the individuals and \nthe families who have had to endure so much over the last 8 days; \nfirst, the natural disaster of Katrina and then the unnatural disaster \nof the delayed and deeply flawed relief effort.\n  Last week, as this tragedy was unfolding, I was on a congressional \ndelegation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, among other things, meeting \nwith members of the Iowa National Guard who are training units of the \nnew Afghan Army. I will have more to report about that trip in coming \ndays. While this tragedy was unfolding, most of the time I was in \nPakistan watching. No matter where we went, it was on television, \nwhether we were going to meet the President of Pakistan or whether we \nwere going out to a small village to visit some schools we have helped \nto fund in the past in poor villages. Everyone had a television focused \non it.\n  As I was there watching it unfold, I had this terrible feeling of \nhelplessness; also, I must add, a feeling of embarrassment and being \nashamed that our Government was not responding more forcefully to this \ndisaster.\n  I will take advantage of this first opportunity to be back in the \nSenate to speak publicly about the events surrounding Hurricane \nKatrina. There is no question FEMA has failed and, more broadly, the \nFederal Government has failed the people of the gulf coast. In other \nparts of the country that are vulnerable to similar natural disasters \nor terrorist attacks, Americans are saying: There, but for the grace of \nGod, go I, go me or my city. It is important those responsible for this \nsystematic failure be held accountable and plans and procedures be put \nin place to avoid any recurrence of this failure.\n  I know I will not be the only Senator demanding hearings and rigorous \noversight by Congress in the weeks ahead, but that is in the weeks \nahead. That is down the road. Today, we must focus on the immediate and \nlonger term human needs of the people of the gulf coast. As ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee and of the subcommittee on Labor \nand Health and Human Services of the Committee on Appropriations I will \ndo my part, again with my distinguished chairman, Senator Chambliss of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, and Senator Specter, who is chairman of \nthe subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, along with \nSenator Cochran, the full chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, \nto see we provide maximum resources for relief and recovery efforts \nacross the gulf coast region.\n  For instance, we need to make sure USDA, the Department of \nAgriculture, is able to meet the food needs of the victims and to \nassist hard-hit agricultural producers. We will also need to extend \nemergency Medicaid benefits to hundreds of thousands of victims. I will \nwork closely with Senators and officials from Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama, to ensure that their needs are fully and effectively met.\n  Indeed, in recent days, my staff has been meeting with Senator \nLandrieu's staff to share the experience and the expertise we gained in \nthe wake of our widespread flooding in Iowa back in 1993. Some of the \nvisual images, especially of New Orleans and some of the other towns \nalong the gulf coast totally flooded with water, brought back memories \nof the flood of 1993 in Iowa, when whole towns were wiped out, some \nnever to be rebuilt. People lost their homes, life savings, and \nmementos, such as pictures and family albums, the things that mean so \nmuch in our lives.\n  I remember 1993 and those floods in Iowa. At that time, I cochaired a \ntask force, along with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, whose State was \nalso devastated by the same flooding, to identify the types of \nassistance that would be needed, as well as the best way to secure that \nassistance in Congress as well as in the executive branch. I am hopeful \nour past experience can provide a roadmap for officials responding to \nthis latest disaster.\n  Some of the needed assistance is obvious, beginning, of course, with \nfood. Me must make sure these people who have been displaced to other \nStates get adequate food and nutrition, and shelter, of course. It is \nso wonderful to see so many people opening their homes, their \ncommunities, their facilities, to take care of people who have been \ndisplaced from their own homes and communities. But we need to provide \nshelter in the longer term. Where is that going to come from? People \ncannot live for 6 months, 9 months, 2 years, in the Astrodome or in any \nother public facility which is housing these people now. We have to \nfind adequate shelter.\n\n  Many of the people who have been displaced--let's face it, the vast \nmajority are very poor people, and I will have more to say about that \nlater--need health care assistance. Many of the communities are already \nat the breaking point, in terms of providing health care to the poorest \nof their citizens.\n  We need to be doing something about at least those three things--\nfood, shelter and health care--right now. In the weeks and months \nahead, more will be needed, including grants to individuals. Grants to \nindividuals helped immeasurably in my State of Iowa after the flood of \n1993, to help them move back, to get a start, to buy simple things like \na bed, a stove, a refrigerator.\n  Loans will be needed to small businesses to get them back on their \nfeet. Think of all the small Main Street businesses wiped out. They are \ngoing to need help to get back on their feet.\n  We need buyouts of homes in frequently flooded areas. Senator Bond \nand I also worked together after the flood of 1993 on hazard \nmitigation. Sometimes individuals located in an area constantly under \nflood threats or which has been flooded numerous times need to be \nrelocated. We did that very effectively in both Iowa and in Missouri.\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\n  We need funding for community redevelopment. Much more will have to \nbe done down the pike.\n  This Congress must step up to the plate and do it. If we can spend \nbetween $5 billion and $6 billion a month in Iraq, surely we cannot \nshirk our responsibility to our own citizens in this country.\n  As we learned back in 1993 in the Iowa floods, there are other less \nobvious forms of assistance that are also critically important. I add \nhere, psychological counseling, psychological help for people who have \nlost loved ones or were traumatized by the disaster, especially young \npeople and kids.\n  I salute Governor Tom Vilsack, of my State of Iowa, for leading a \nrobust response to this disaster. He has ordered our State Government \nto prepare for the potential relocation of up to 5,000 people from the \ngulf coast region. They will be given shelter and assistance in \ncommunities all across our State. Again, I am so proud of my fellow \nIowans. The phone calls have been coming in. They have room to take in \none, two, or three people. They are opening their homes. The churches \nacross our State are saying they will do whatever they can to help find \nhousing and accommodations for people. Governor Vilsack has also \ndirected the Iowa Department of Public Health to deploy a 30-member \nteam of doctors, nurses, and other health officials to southeast \nLouisiana.\n  I say to my fellow Iowans and to all my fellow Americans, our prayers \nfor the victims are important, but as President Kennedy once reminded \nus, here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. Each and every one \nof us can make a difference to the victims of this disaster. There are \ndozens of organizations, including the Red Cross and Salvation Army, in \nurgent need of donations and assistance.\n  So it is at times like this we are reminded we truly are one American \nfamily. Families look out for one another. I have no doubt people all \nacross this country will continue to open their hearts and be as \ngenerous as possible in the days and weeks and months ahead.\n  Likewise, I am hopeful this Congress and this White House will also \nbe generous. We will do whatever it takes to help the people of New \nOrleans and the gulf coast put their lives and communities back \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I, too, rise in an expression of sympathy \nto the victims of Hurricane Katrina and to convey my deep gratitude to \nthe many people who are working in ongoing relief efforts.\n  As we gather here today, thousands of people throughout the South are \nstruggling to recover from one of this Nation's greatest natural \ndisasters. Really, if you think about it, it is a disaster that \ncontinues to unfold. With the public health issues, the sustenance-of-\nhuman-life issues, the needs that need to be met on a daily basis, this \ndisaster, the full extent of it, is not yet even known.\n  As we all know, Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast on Monday, \nAugust 29, leaving in its wake destruction and devastation. The loss of \nlife is incalculable at this time. The city of New Orleans lies in \nruin, and residents of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida are \nstruggling today to meet their most basic needs--shelter, food, clean \nwater, and medical care.\n  This Congress has appropriated, on an emergency basis, more than $10 \nbillion to help meet the most immediate needs of these victims of this \ndisaster. But, obviously, there is more that needs to be done.\n  Thousands of Americans now face the daunting task of rebuilding their \nlives. I am proud to report the people of my State of Texas are doing \ntheir part, welcoming literally almost a quarter of a million people \nwith open arms. While some Texans are providing resources to meet \nevacuees' immediate needs, others are facilitating longer term needs \nfor this large and displaced population. State and local government \nagencies are coordinating efforts on the ground and countless \nvolunteers--from churches, synagogues, mosques, other faith-based \norganizations, and just good hearted people--are providing all of the \nhelp they can on a round-the-clock basis to ensure our neighbors' needs \nare being met.\n  On the ground, nearly 2,000 soldiers and airmen from the Texas Air \nNational Guard are continuing to provide assistance with Hurricane \nKatrina relief and security efforts. An additional 350 members of the \nTexas State Guard have also joined them. Texas National Guard aviation \nhas moved more than 6,650 people, distributed 20,000 meals, and almost \n40,000 bottles of water, and supplied more than a million pounds of \nmaterial to help repair the breach in New Orleans' levees.\n  Even as Texas leaders have notified FEMA and Louisiana officials that \nwe are nearing capacity, people across the State continue to open their \nhomes to their neighbors in need and to reach out to help them in any \nway they can.\n  In the shelters, one of the most important ongoing efforts is to \nlocate a place for displaced residents to actually live on a temporary \nbasis. The Red Cross in Dallas is doing everything it can to register \nevacuees or those who have been victimized by Katrina. This will help \nfacilitate the reuniting of these victims with their families and loved \nones. This effort is being duplicated at all other shelters.\n  The city of Fort Worth and Tarrant County have partnered to provide \nthe best possible care for victims. The local government has taken full \nresponsibility for this situation and is managing these shelters in an \nefficient and professional manner.\n  In Houston, 20,000 people are being housed and cared for at the \nAstrodome. Another 4,000 are being sheltered at the Reliant Center. And \n3,000 more are being housed at the George R. Brown Convention Center. \nIt is estimated that up to 100,000 more are in hotels and shelters \nthroughout the greater Houston area, with around 200,000 to 250,000 \nvictims of Katrina in Texas.\n  Mr. President, 20,000 volunteers in Houston alone have been working \nto accommodate the enormous manpower requirements to put all of these \nefforts in place.\n  A lot of credit is due not only at the highest levels of State \ngovernment, to Governor Perry and his team, but also to local leaders \nsuch as Harris County Judge Robert Eckels and Mayor Bill White of \nHouston who have done an excellent job working to mobilize the major \ncounty and city efforts to offer immediate shelter to these victims. \nBoth the judge and the mayor have been going to Fortune 500 companies \nin the greater Houston area to ask for immediate help and have been met \nwith generous offers of assistance. Shelter volunteers are working, \nalso, to make sure the medical needs of these evacuees are being met. \nDallas County Health and Human Services has stated that physicians are \ntaking extra precautions to prevent the outbreak of communicable \ndiseases at the shelters. The Mental Health and Mental Retardation \nDepartment has deployed social workers and psychiatrists to shelters to \nhelp deal with the mental trauma associated with this disaster.\n  But in addition to the immediate needs for food, clothing, water, and \nmedical care, there are long-term needs that need to be addressed as \nwell. We must also ensure that these long-term needs are met by this \nsame team effort of Federal, State, and local officials, as well as \nnongovernmental and faith-based organizations. Federal agencies have \nstepped up and have given information to evacuees on how to receive \nSocial Security and other Government benefits while they are \ntemporarily displaced.\n\n  The Post Office has stopped mail according to ZIP Codes so mail will \nnot be lost and can ultimately be delivered. Local district clerks have \ngiven information regarding how to apply for child support payments. \nAnd I recently was in communication with district clerk Charles \nBacarisse of Harris County, who is working with attorney general Gregg \nAbbott to make sure child support payments are delivered on time to \nthose who are entitled to them.\n  Congress is also considering waivers so the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development can give out vouchers for housing.\n  My office has joined with the rest of the congressional delegation to \nfacilitate the Federal Emergency Management Agency's ability to provide \nservices and assisting HUD to provide housing as quickly as possible to \nsuch an enormous number of people. Likewise,\n\n[[Page S9612]]\n\ncommunities have joined together, and many good people are personally \neven housing in their home those who have nowhere else to turn.\n  So I am gratified, but not surprised, by the big heart of the people \nin the State of Texas toward those who are in need. We know there are \nstories that are heartwarming on a personal level as well as on a \nlarger level as to the way people are responding, which is in a way \nthat we would all hope that if the shoe were on the other foot we would \nrespond.\n  While we have heard there have been episodes of lawlessness, looting, \nand other acts of desperation, it is important to remember there have \nbeen innumerable acts of kindness from those expressing charity and \ngoodwill which I believe truly embodies the American spirit and the \nTexas spirit. These are some of the stories on which I would like to \nclose.\n  I was told an expectant couple from Louisiana was so appreciative of \nthe warm welcome they received when they arrived in Dallas that they \nnamed their newest arrival, their baby girl, ``Dallas,'' after our fine \ncity.\n  After a 23-hour drive to Texas, one woman gave birth to her new son \nand named him after the hospital where he was born in gratitude for the \nmoney, gift certificates, clothes, and other necessities that the \nhospital staff collected for her.\n  Louisiana resident Bernell Royal was rescued from his rooftop with \nnothing more than a bag of clothes--no identification, no wallet, no \npersonal documents or effects. He is now being housed at a shelter in \nAustin, TX. Although he believes everything he owned is now gone, he \ntold one reporter:\n\n       I feel like in Austin I've found a new sense of respect, \n     dignity and honor. I would love to stay in Austin, get a job, \n     and start a new life.\n\n  We hope he will.\n  In Duncanville, Darwin German II and his family wanted to help \nhurricane victims, so they decided to give away what they had--free \napartments at the Candlelight Park Apartments. Move-in costs will be \ncovered, as well as 4 months of free rent.\n  Dallas school officials over the weekend prepared to enroll \napproximately 500 student evacuees who were expected to start school \ntoday. The Dallas Morning News reports that Melissa Farria said when \nher children were registered for school:\n\n       These people are amazing. . . .When they were saying they \n     were registering students, I couldn't believe it.\n\n  And the University of Texas is likewise opening its doors to Texas \nstudents who were on their way to Louisiana universities. It has been \nreported that 134 undergraduates and 60 law students have now been \nenrolled at the University of Texas and will be able to continue their \nprograms of study.\n  The Dallas Morning News is offering free classified advertisements \nfor businesses and individuals offering free goods or services to \nevacuees from areas struck by Hurricane Katrina.\n  These are just some of the stories of goodwill and charity and big \nhearts that we found in response to this terrible disaster. I know the \ntemptation is perhaps almost irresistible, particularly here in \nCongress, to point the finger of blame at mistakes made, plans that \nwere not executed the way we hoped they might have been. Believe me, \nthere will be plenty of time for that. But I believe right now it \nrepresents a distraction from the job we ought to be about, as \nexemplified by these wonderful Good Samaritans I have described this \nafternoon.\n  We ought to be about making sure people have food, shelter, and clean \nwater; that they have medical care; that their children are allowed to \ngo to school; and that we help them get on with their lives and leave \nthe blame game and the finger-pointing for later on. I know Congress \nand the Senate will undertake a series of hearings--and, in fact, this \nafternoon--looking at gasoline prices. We should and we will deal with \nthat issue appropriately. We also ought to look at the mistakes that \nwere made and things that could be done better. I am confident the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will, in due \ncourse, have hearings and make sure we learn from those mistakes and we \ndo better next time.\n  But I think more than anything else this is a time for Americans to \npull together. I wanted to take a few minutes to express my gratitude \nto the big-hearted people of Texas for taking in these nearly quarter \nof a million evacuees from Hurricane Katrina who had nowhere else to \nturn and who were looking for the milk of human kindness, which they \nfound in the great State of Texas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, millions of Americans on the Gulf Coast \nhave endured an almost unspeakable tragedy over the past 10 days. \nThousands are likely dead. Hundreds of thousands had their lives \nupended and wondered so rightly why their Government seemed to have \nabandoned them. Millions of Americans across the country are asking \nthemselves when the suffering will end.\n  We cannot undo what has happened, but there is one thing we can do to \nredeem ourselves and to live up to our greatest American ideals.\n  We can commit that we will not stop, that we will not rest, until \nthese communities are back and stronger than before, until families \nhave been reunited, and until the survivors of this catastrophe are \nrestored into the full measure of American life.\n  If 6 months from now we are still referring to American citizens as \nrefugees, if we are content that American families are holed up without \njobs, without homes, without security, then we will have failed and \nfailed miserably.\n  Our response to date has not been worthy of our Nation, and we will \nhave to examine why it wasn't until last Friday that our brave and \ncommitted National Guard forces were deployed to deliver supplies to \nthe starving, suffering Americans stranded at the New Orleans \nConvention Center.\n  The time will also come to determine why the mandatory evacuation \norder wasn't implemented effectively and why the Army Corps of \nEngineers wasn't given the resources long ago to prevent the collapse \nof the levees that caused most of the loss of life, especially when \nFEMA had called such a hurricane one of the ``likeliest, most \ncatastrophic disasters facing the country.''\n  Clearly, mistakes were made that cost lives, displaced thousands, and \nleft one of America's most unique and treasured cities under water and \nabandoned. There will come a time to hold accountable the responsible \nofficials who allowed this disaster to become even more disastrous.\n  But our first priority now is to do everything we can to meet the \nneeds of our fellow citizens and to provide a helping hand to the \ncountless generous Americans throughout the Nation who have opened \ntheir homes, their schools, and their communities to our displaced \nfellow citizens. Today our job is to meet the great, daunting, and \nunprecedented challenge of rebuilding the entire region.\n  Our obligation is to guarantee that the Americans thrust into the \ndarkness of despair and homelessness last week emerge with a restored \nfaith in their fellow citizens and a renewed belief that this is a land \nof opportunity.\n  This is a challenge for all of us--as individuals, as public \nofficials, and as members of religious and charitable organizations.\n  But above all it is the job of our national Government, which alone \nhas the resources, the manpower, and the authority to lead this \nenormous effort. The eyes of the world are upon us--watching to see how \nwe take care of our own.\n  The $10.5 billion Congress passed last week was an initial gesture, \nbut it's just a small fraction of the amount needed to address the \nunprecedented challenges this entire region faces. It's only the \nbeginning, and we need to recognize that.\n  We should move quickly, for example, to address the health needs of \nthese citizens. The disaster area is a public health hazard as well. \nThe floodwaters are potentially disease-ridden. Countless people have \nbeen injured or taken ill as a result of the disaster. The physical and \nmental health needs of thousands must be met as they try to cope with \nthe horror that they've endured.\n  We also need to ensure that the elderly and disabled who rely on \nsupplemental assistance to live continue to\n\n[[Page S9613]]\n\nget it, even though they've been dislocated.\n  We must do all we can to see that school children and college \nstudents don't miss a year of their education.\n  There are approximately 70,000 children in the New Orleans school \nsystem, some 7,000 to 8,000 schoolteachers. That school system has \neffectively been completely destroyed--all of the books lost, all of \nthe records completely lost. We don't know where those schoolchildren \nhave moved to, which children have gone where. The payrolls for all of \nthe school administrators have effectively been lost. We know that what \nI just mentioned for New Orleans has been replicated in school district \nafter school district throughout the whole gulf area.\n  School districts across the country are taking in children from the \ndisaster area. Thirty-five cities as far north as Detroit have come \nforward to date, we understand, with Houston working to serve 6,000 \nstudents, Dallas-Fort Worth making room for 5,000. These school \ndistricts are doing our Nation a great service. We need to make sure \nthey have the support they need as they step forward.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, a number of colleges have offered \nto take the graduate students that were studying at law schools such as \nTulane and other students who were studying at the great universities \nin Louisiana and along the gulf area. This is something we should \nfollow up on, the challenges, to make sure that the students, whether \nit is K-12, whether it is in college, or whether it is in graduate \nschools, we reach out to try to assist students in the educational \narea.\n  Colleges are volunteering to admit displaced students from the \nregion. We must offer them additional aid for generously admitting \nthese students and must assure that adequate student aid is available \nto those who temporarily attend a new college.\n  The hundreds of thousands of workers who now have no jobs need an \nincome to help them overcome the delay in finding new employment. We \nmust amend our disaster unemployment assistance laws to enable these \nmen and women to qualify for help. For example, under the emergency \nunemployment provisions, you to have wait 30 days in order to be \neligible to be a recipient. That is obviously a rule that has to be \naddressed if we are going to use that particular mechanism to get \nincome to these needy families.\n  We need to rebuild the public health infrastructure which is under \nincreasing strain as the number of uninsured continues to climb. Sadly, \nHurricane Katrina has only made this crisis worse.\n  These are but a few of the actions we must take--and take now--to \ndeal with the immediate needs of those displaced by Katrina and of the \ncommunities that have so generously taken them in.\n  In the longer term, I believe we should establish a New Orleans and \nGulf Coast Redevelopment Authority, with cabinet rank, to coordinate \nplanning and funding needed to restore the infrastructure of that \nbattered region--the electricity, water, gas, roads, railroads, and \nbridges, and, especially, the levees and flood control facilities. \nThese actions are beyond the ability of any single community, city, and \nState to handle on their own. It is a national responsibility, and we \nneed a capable authority to work with State and local officials and \nlocal citizens to rebuild the future.\n  The scope of this national crisis exceeds anything since the Great \nDepression. It's the first time a major U.S. city has been leveled \nsince the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. It will likely exceed the \ncost in human lives of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, where more than \n8,000 persons are thought to have perished.\n  It's the kind of disaster we no longer thought possible in an age of \ninstantaneous global communications, rapid transportation, highly \naccurate weather forecasts, and advanced engineering. It was most \ncertainly the kind of suffering that should not be tolerated by a \nmodern society with so many tools at its disposal.\n  In the weeks, months, and even years ahead, the recovery from this \ndisaster--the complete, total, and unambiguous recovery--must become a \nprimary focus of our national government.\n  As elected officials we cannot allow this work to be sidetracked by \nlesser priorities. If we don't get this right for our fellow Americans, \nlittle else can matter.\n  For our political leadership in Washington, in the White House and \nhere on Capitol Hill, this is a test of wills, a test of leadership, a \ntest of vision and compassion.\n  It will require singular focus and an unyielding commitment.\n  The most immediate task is still to save lives. Over 1.5 million have \nbeen evacuated from the devastated area, but many still remain, \nparticularly in outlying rural areas cut off the most from the outside \nworld.\n  Local authorities, the National Guard, and the Coast Guard are still \ntrying to reach and rescue men, women, and children from the ravaged \nareas. It's a race against time before waterborne disease, dehydration, \nand neglect take their toll. They are working around the clock, and \nthey deserve all the resources they need.\n  For the hundreds of thousands of Americans thrust into homeless \nshelters as a result of the tragedy, we need to make sure they are \ngetting the care, nutrition, and counseling they so desperately need.\n  But the urgency is not limited to these immediate and enormous \nhumanitarian tasks. It extends to the rebuilding efforts too, because \nthe more rapidly we can revitalize the great city of New Orleans, and \nso many other communities, the sooner we can help people rebuild their \nlives.\n  These cities and towns are not just bricks and mortar. They are \ncommunities and economies of countless families, neighbors, and \nbusiness owners, desperate for a return to normalcy.\n  It's said that nearly 80,000 jobs in New Orleans alone are provided \nby the tourism industry. How many more of those jobs can we save--how \nmany more families can have stability again--if we get the city back on \nits feet in 6 months as opposed to 1 year? Two years? Three years? How \nmuch human misery and suffering can we still prevent?\n  I'm impressed with the way the Army Corps of Engineers is working to \nrebuild the levees and begin to drain away the water. It's such a \ncritical step in locating the missing and beginning the process of \nrecovery.\n  The Army Corps now estimates that perhaps within 30 days, New Orleans \nand the surrounding areas will finally be dry.\n  The question for Congress and the administration is will we be ready \non Day 31? Will we be ready to start cleaning the streets and homes and \nremoving the ghastly evidence of this most unbearable tragedy.\n  We owe it to the living to be ready. We owe it to the charitable \norganizations that are filling in the gaps and helping the displaced to \nget back on their feet. We owe it to the first responders who are \ngiving so much of themselves to ease the suffering.\n  We owe it to the millions of Americans who are opening their hearts \nand checkbooks to their fellow citizens.\n  History is watching us now, and it will judge our actions. We can't \nundo the failures in planning over many years or the failures in the \nimmediate response over the past 10 days.\n  But we can resolve to dedicate all of our energies and resources, and \nour resolve from this point forward to resources to bring about a \ncomplete and total recovery for the entire Gulf Coast area, and the men \nand women and children who've endured more than any of us can possibly \nimagine in this massive tragedy.\n  To the Gulf Coast region we need to be like Aaron and Hur who held up \nMoses' tired arms in battle.\n  Today, we need to be just as dedicated to the Gulf Coast region if we \nare going to lead our fellow Americans out of this time of darkness to \na better and stronger future.\n  The Katrina disaster also shines a bright light on another challenge \nfacing our country--the glaring economic disparities facing our \ncitizens. Those with means were able to escape the disaster. Those \nwithout could not.\n  Those with means can slowly and painfully rebuild their lives.\n  Those without means have nothing to let them rebuild.\n  As a nation, we must be sensitive to this inequality--sensitive as we \nrespond to Katrina, and sensitive, too, as we select new Justices for \nthe Supreme Court. That's a critical question for\n\n[[Page S9614]]\n\nJudge Roberts. Can he unite America for the future?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we have been alternating between \nthe Democrats and Republicans. I note that there is no Republican on \nthe Senate floor, and I will therefore now proceed in the interest of \neconomy of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I note Senator Lott has come to the floor of the \nSenate. I didn't know if the Senator wished to speak, as someone who \nhas lost his home in his State. I am happy to return to my time. Would \nthe Senator like to talk now?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, my good friend and my \npartner, for allowing me to have this opportunity. But to tell the \ntruth, I just arrived a few minutes ago, and I am still a bit emotional \nright this minute. If she would continue to give me just a few minutes \nto get my papers in order, I would appreciate it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Certainly. We welcome you back. And to the people of \nMississippi, know that we extend our concern and want to put our good \nintentions into operation.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate to speak about what has happened to \nour country and ideas on how we can move forward and make sure this \nnever happens again. I note that the Presiding Officer himself has been \na mayor and a Governor, so he knows what these kind of challenges are.\n  Last week on the Senate break, when I saw what was happening in \nLouisiana, in Mississippi, and in Alabama, I couldn't believe it. I \ncould not believe the devastation that occurred in these communities \nwhere entire neighborhoods were wiped out, that a wonderful city we \nhave all loved and admired and enjoyed, New Orleans, was now under 10 \nfeet of water, that the people of Mississippi all along their coast \nlost their homes, where with the flyovers all you saw was wreckage, \npeople on a beach and an American flag and a sheet saying: Please help \nus. And then also this going on in Alabama. We in Maryland know what it \nis like for a hurricane to hit. Just a few years ago, we survived \nHurricane Isabel where we had communities that looked like Baghdad on \nthe bay. So we were very concerned.\n  One thing we had was confidence that hope and help would be on the \nway.\n  Well, my gosh, this did not happen. I could not believe the slowness \nand the sluggishness of the response to these communities; that it was \nthe private sector that was on response a lot faster than our own \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, this is just unacceptable. This failure of Government \nto be able to respond more quickly and more effectively shows that the \npeople in these States have been doubly victimized. They were \nvictimized by the natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, and now by the \nresponse of their own Government.\n  It did not have to be this way. It did not have to be this way. In \n2000, a tiptop FEMA was turned to the Bush administration. President \nBush appointed Joe Allbaugh to be head of FEMA. We kept the legacy of \nreform that had begun under President Bush 1 and had started with \nAndrew Card and myself working on a reform of FEMA. This reform left \nFEMA in tiptop condition to respond to a crisis of a natural disaster \nin an American community.\n  I want to recall this to my colleagues. Back in the 1990s, I chaired \nan appropriations subcommittee called VA-HUD and Independent Agencies. \nOne of the independent agencies was FEMA. We saw its lackluster \nperformance in Hugo. But when Andrew hit Florida it was a disaster. It \nwas a disaster of proportions from the hurricane and then again the \nineptness of FEMA.\n  Well, we went to work, hands on. President Bush 1 sent Andy Card to \nFlorida and he began to work and we on appropriations began to work, \nand we worked across the aisle on a bipartisan basis to help not only \nFlorida but to take a longer look at the need to reform FEMA. And \nagain, working on a bipartisan basis, reform FEMA we did. We took it \nfrom an agency that was focused on the Cold War, was riddled with \ncronyism both at the National and State Governments. There was a \ntradition that because FEMA was only organized in the case of a nuclear \nattack that you did not have to put in professionals because it would \nnot matter; we would all be dead anyway. So there was cronyism, it was \nunfocused, it was of the Cold war, but again, working on a bipartisan \nbasis, we in appropriations worked with the White House to change it.\n  President Clinton came in, and we kept the reform momentum going. And \nwhat did we do? We said, No. 1, that FEMA, first of all, should say \ngoodbye to the Cold War and hello to being a risk-based agency, to take \na look at what most American communities would be threatened by. In \nthose days, it was a hurricane, it was a tornado, it was an earthquake. \nAnd then for it to go to an all-hazards agency, whether it was a train \nthat got stuck in a Baltimore tunnel with toxic fumes that we worried \nabout or whether it was an earthquake in California or a tornado in one \nof our Midwest States.\n  The other thing we focused on was that FEMA had to be run by \nprofessionals. It had to be run by someone who had dealt with \nmanagement situations. And that was either a civilian involved in \nemergency management or possibly someone from retired military, and we \nasked each Governor to also reform themselves at the State level. We \nliterally upgraded FEMA from the State and local level to the national \nlevel. We have had James Lee Witt. We had Joe Allbaugh, things were \nimproving.\n  The other thing we did was we made sure that we practiced the three \nRs for FEMA. What were the three Rs? Readiness, response, and recovery. \nIt took time, it took money, and it took cooperation. But again, \nworking on a bipartisan basis, we had it accomplished. We worked, as I \nsaid, with President Bush 1, then with President Clinton, and then, \neven though I chaired FEMA appropriations and was the prime mover in \n1994, Senator Kit Bond became the chairman of that wonderful \nsubcommittee, and for a decade, he too, working hand in hand, kept the \nmomentum of reform going concentrating on a professionalized FEMA that \ncould work on readiness, recovery, and response.\n  The States were ready, we were ready, and I think everyone agreed \nduring that time it worked well.\n  Well, now something terrible has happened since 2000, since 9/11, and \nI will tell you what happened.\n  First of all, somehow or another, FEMA has lost its way. Since it has \nmoved into Homeland Security, it has become unfocused, it has become \nunclear, it has lost its direction of being an all-hazards independent \nagency. Therefore, today, I am proposing a couple of things. I am \nproposing that, No. 1, we restore FEMA to being an independent agency \nresponsible to the President the way it was before 9/11; No. 2, that we \nalso make sure that, as an independent agency, it is an all-hazards \nagency run by a professional. I think it is time that Michael Brown \nleave FEMA. I think he either should leave voluntarily or \ninvoluntarily, but we need a professional in charge of FEMA; No. 3, \nthere should be a commission to look at what happened. But we can't \nwait. There is much to be done. There is much rebuilding that needs to \nbe done. We need to make sure that we are helping our own communities.\n  First of all, we want to congratulate the people at the local level \nfor their tremendous resiliency, the people of Mississippi, Alabama, \nand, of course, Louisiana. No. 2, we need to congratulate the nonprofit \nsector--the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, also \nuniversities that are taking in students. We need to thank people from \naround the world who not only have sent condolences but have sent \nresources, and we appreciate their help. But we need to make sure that \nwe have a FEMA that the American people can count on. We need to \nrestore it to an independent level, make it an all-hazards agency, make \nit one that focuses on readiness, response, and recovery.\n  What we can do now with new leadership is focus on the recovery part. \nWe want to say to the people of these States we know that when the TV \ncameras leave, your Government cannot leave you, we cannot forsake you, \nwe cannot abandon you. To the Governors of the States that have \nwelcomed these people, from Texas to Georgia to Arkansas, each \nstruggling, we say that we\n\n[[Page S9615]]\n\nneed to be there to help you. For all those other States that have sent \nhelp, including my own State of Maryland, we need to back those States \nand back those communities.\n  I say to all those people who have no home and living in temporary \nshelters, we need to help you find a way. For all of you who are living \nin motel rooms because you could evacuate, running out of time, running \nout of money, we need to identify who you are, see where you are, to \nmake sure you are connected with your family and begin to see if we \ncan't connect you with a home and with a job. We need to be able to do \nthat. But in order to do that, No. 1, we need new leadership at FEMA. \nNo. 2, we need to reform FEMA. And No. 3, we need to look ahead.\n\n  There are those who say: Well, Senator Mikulski, FEMA went under \nHomeland Security because of a global war against terrorism. We know \nthat, and I was one who voted to put it there. Well, I will tell you, \nwould you trust FEMA now if a dirty bomb hit a city? Would you trust \nFEMA now to be able to respond to a chemical or biological weapon? The \nanswer is no, no, no.\n  Much needs to be done. First of all, we need to support those \ncommunities that are helping other communities. We need to also salute \nthat which is working. Three cheers for the Coast Guard that was one of \nthe first on the job doing rescue; support the private sector, \nAmerica's corporations that are both paying their employees and sending \nin incredible donations. We need to support the nonprofits that are \nalso helping. But most of all we need to support each other.\n  I want to, once again, as I did at the time of Hurricane Andrew, \nreach across the aisle to an American President to say let's stop using \nthe term ``refugee.'' Let's start using the term ``Americans.'' Let's \nstart using the term ``citizens.'' Let's start acknowledging that we \nare all one people under God, indivisible. Let's work to reform FEMA. \nLet's get in the right leadership. And then let's work with the right \nresources, and let's do it in a spirit of cooperation. We had that \nspirit after 9/11. That is what somebody did to us. Now, we had a \nhurricane do something terrible to us. We should not do unto ourselves \nby not responding to the needs of our own people. Somebody once said it \ntakes a village to raise a child. Right now it takes a country to raise \nthese villages and all of those towns. My heart goes out to them. As I \nsaid, we in Maryland know what it is like to be on the coast and be \nhurt. I say to my colleague who has lost his beloved home that has been \nin his family for years, looking at him as a Senator, he has some \npower, and we are going to help him, but we think about all the little \npeople, all the little people, and we think about how we can help them. \nIf we work together as a country and make sure we work with America's \ncorporations, we will get the resources in the United States of \nAmerica. And then for the long haul, let's make FEMA an independent \nagency--an all-hazards, professionally run independent, responsible \nonly to the call of the Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. President, I once again say, God bless America and the people of \nits communities. I look forward to working, on a bipartisan basis, to \nresolve this issue. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, I appreciate her kind remarks, and I know how she feels, on a \nhuman and an individual basis, and I know she will be working with us \nto make sure that the full force of the Government is used and that \nwhere we need changes and where we need help, we will work together to \nput those in place.\n  I have learned, once again, that Mother Nature is a great equalizer. \nWhen you experience what we have experienced, which is an attack of \nmonumental proportions, politics and partisanship, national origin and \neconomic status, religion, all of that is put aside so that you can \nwork together to help people who are struggling for their lives, \nliterally.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about what is the situation \nthere. I came back because I wanted to express my feelings in a number \nof areas and talk about the devastation and not try to complain--in \nfact, I will not complain--but tell people how they can help. We need \nsolutions, and we need actions. After a couple days here, where I can \nmaybe meet with Cabinet Secretaries and meet with others who make \ndecisions, we will go back, and we will continue the effort. We are not \nat real cleanup yet, certainly not reconstruction. We are still dealing \nwith devastation, search and rescue, and health and safety. And it is \ndesperate. I want to begin by thanking my colleagues. So many of my \ncolleagues have sent messages, have called my offices, have gotten \nthrough to me and made huge efforts to try to express their concerns. I \ndon't want to belabor this point, but one of the calls was from Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts. He said that he and Teresa had been worried \nabout my wife Trisha and me and could they help. I said: You bet. He \nsaid: What can we do? What do you need? Where do you need it? I told \nhim: Don't worry about distribution. You let us know when you are going \nto land. We will have people for pickup and distribution.\n  That story can be told hundreds of times over from friends or people \nyou do not even know, Republicans, Democrats, people from Michigan, \nIllinois. It makes no difference. I could tell you an anecdote about \nevery State. A lady from Illinois, pastor of a church, wanted to do \nsomething. She loaded up her own van, did not even have enough fuel to \nget there, but somehow or another she begged, borrowed, wound up in the \ndisaster area handing out materials, supplies. Nobody paid for it. \nNobody asked for it. She loaded up and went to the sound of the cannon, \nand she made a difference.\n  Yesterday, when I flew in a Black Hawk helicopter to Poplarville, MS, \none of the areas off the Gulf Coast that one does not hear a lot about, \nto make sure people in rural and small towns know that help is on the \nway there, too, I was escorted by our delegation. We had a Mississippi \nBlack Hawk and three New York National Guard Black Hawk helicopters. \nSome of the first National Guardsmen who arrived were from Michigan. \nYou name it, I can tell a story about every State.\n  On Wednesday, when I was digging through the rubble of my own \nneighborhood, some guys walked up from Bert, FL, and said: We know a \nlittle bit about hurricanes. We know you are hurting and you need help. \nWe have six men, a bobcat, and a front-end loader. How can we help? I \nsaid: Can you clear that road, where we could get through there because \nthe traffic in that area is getting to be a problem. And there is a \nlittle retired schoolteacher living back over here. We have not been \nable to get into her house. The debris was 6 or 8 feet up against her \ndoors. We were afraid she was in there, but she showed up later in the \nafternoon, and we got her into her house. I do not know those guys. \nThey were from Bert, FL. If they are listening, if they ever hear this, \nI want to thank them for loading up and coming to help.\n  Now, I have been dealing with disasters in Mississippi and in our \nregion for 37 years, going back when I was a staff member for a \nDemocratic Member in the House. So I have dealt with hurricanes. I was \nthere for Camille, and I promised the Good Lord, if he would let me \nlive through that one, I would not stay for another one. I have not \nstayed for any more. I leave, and then when the wind slows down, I go \nback and I take down the boards and I pull the debris, with my \nneighbors and my friends and my family. This time we could not even \npull the debris. There was too much of it. But I have seen hurricanes \nof all kinds, and I have seen tornadoes and the devastation from ice \nstorms and floods. We have had everything in Mississippi but locusts, \nand I expect them to show up real soon. This is a disaster of biblical \nproportions. I want the people to understand that.\n  My house is irrelevant, in the bigger picture of what happened, \nexcept for one thing. This house was 150 years old. It was 12 feet \nabove sea level. It was 8 feet off the ground. Senator McConnell slept \nin that house. It was nothing special, but everything in there was \nspecial. The point though is, for 150 years, this house had been able \nto withstand everything Mother Nature could deal her. Yes, we had the \nporch torn off and we had the roof replaced several times and we had \nother damages, but\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nbasically it stood right there similar to a rock, and that is my \nhometown, Pascagoula, MS. As you go west, the damage gets worse and \nworse and worse: Biloxi, MS, Gulfport, MS, Pass Christian, Long Beach, \nBay Saint Louis. Waveland, MS, no longer exists. You might say, well, \nthe buildings are still standing. They were gutted. No, there is not a \nbuilding standing--this little community of 7,000 people. And then \nthere is New Orleans. A lot of people have been so emotionally touched \nand upset by what they have seen there, but one of the things they need \nto know is the hurricane hit us Monday. Their biggest disaster was \nFriday because the levees broke, the pumps had salt in them, and they \ndid not work. I flew over Jefferson Parish on Friday with the \nPresident. They had water up to the roof lines of the houses standing \nthere, and it had been rising ever since about Tuesday or Wednesday. So \ntheir worst disaster was not the hurricane; it was the aftermath.\n  I flew over and saw three big fires going on in New Orleans. Nobody \nwas trying to put them out. You know why? You could not get there. \nFinally, the National Guard came in with helicopters and buckets and \nhelped a little bit.\n  So the proportions of this are enormous. And for that reason, our \nresponse has not been perfect. A lot of criticism has been pointed at \nthis place or that place, why was the military not there earlier, or \nthis person or that group? It took the National Guard in my home State, \ngoing from Camp Shelby, 70 miles, to Gulfport, MS, 7 hours because they \nhad to cut their way through a major highway. Highway 49 was covered \nwith pine trees. They were still falling the next night when I went \nthrough there because they were kind of standing there and eventually \nfell right on down.\n  When you got on the ground, we did not know exactly where it was \ngoing to hit, and then the proportions of it exceeded what anybody \nexpected. And even when you got there, you could not communicate with \nanybody, no hard lines, no cell phones operating, no blackberry \nmessages were coming and going. It took us 2 days to get to where \npeople were. We are still looking for people we have not been able to \nfind. A lot of the bad things that I have tried to deal with turned out \nto be rumors. I had two good friends who were identified basically as \nmissing or dead Tuesday. Well, they were there Friday. I was told I \ncould not get to my house; the roads were closed. I advised what I was \ngoing to do to anybody who tried to stop me. When I got there, there \nwere no blockades. I went right through there like lightening, and so \ndid everybody else. So there are rumors about things.\n\n  Now, have mistakes been made? Is it bad? Is it still horrible? Has it \nnot been fast enough, good enough? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. What good \ndoes that do? I met yesterday with elected officials from 33 counties \nin my State, mayors, supervisors, clerks, sheriffs, police chiefs. And \nby the way, I cannot give enough accolades for what they have done. I \ntold them: Look, I do not want to hear about the problems of yesterday. \nI want to hear what your problem is today. Tell me what the solution \nis, and we will fix it before the sun goes down.\n  I want to give some idea of what is happening. The loss of life is \njust, one cannot even comprehend what people are dealing with. Of \ncourse, similar to everything else in life, when you have a disaster \nsuch as this, it is bad on everybody. The poor people and the people in \nlow-lying areas, they are hit harder than anybody, and we have to make \nsure we help them.\n  I want to specifically thank a few people. It is not a long list and \nI am going to miss some and I will be back to get to the rest of them. \nThe first responders saved a lot of lives, even saved property, which \nbecame irrelevant. National Guard, Coast Guard, military in general, \nthey are working now, the Seabees, the Corps of Engineers, the Navy. \nFor the first time in history, we are moving Navy flat-bottomed troop \ncarriers in to house people so that emergency workers will have a place \nto sleep at night and get a warm meal. Once again, we saw that the \nmilitary is not only for Iraq. We need the military for here.\n  You know when they got order in New Orleans? When the 82nd Airborne \npulled in, the shooting stopped. They brought in a tough general that \ncame off the plane cussing. Within 6 hours, things were under control. \nSo I want to thank them all. Policemen, firemen, stories I have heard, \npeople I have seen, emergency rescuers, ambulance, all of those first \nresponders. Local and State officials do not get enough credit.\n  In my State of Mississippi, one reason why I think we are doing a \nlittle better than we have in the past or than some other areas is we \nhave the best quality of elected officials, men and women, mayors, \nsupervisors. Our Governor, Haley Barbour, and our Lieutenant Governor, \nAmy Tuck, they have all been pulling together, and they deserve a lot \nof credit. Federal officials, there are so many things that have \nhappened I cannot list them all. Cabinet Secretaries and agency people, \nindividuals, FEMA is there on the job. They are getting hammered the \nmost, and we will have to think about whether they are set up in the \nright way, but there will be time for that.\n  Right now we want to know what can we do to help them do a better \njob. In my own State of Mississippi, the Mississippi Emergency \nManagement Administration has been criticized. I was about ready to \nexpress myself in a very profound way yesterday about the fact that we \ndo not have emergency housing arriving yet. I was told that the \nMississippi Emergency Management Administration had not requested the \ntrailers. So I got to where a MEMA official was and asked: Did you \nrequest the trailers?\n  Yes, 20,000, 2 or 3 days ago.\n  What is the problem?\n  He said: I do not know. I have made the request. So then the word \nfrom FEMA was: Well, we have not been told where to put them. Excuse \nme? The whole area is slick. Park them anywhere. There are no parking \nlimits. We are a parking lot. That is ridiculous. So there is \nbureaucratic nonsense going on, but we are getting there. We have that \nproblem resolved. We have FEMA talking to MEMA, talking to the people \nwho have the trailers. Three hundred arrived this morning; 20,000 more \nare coming. We will get through that.\n  I want to thank the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, all the other \ncharities, individuals, and churches. My wife, yesterday, worked all \nafternoon loading an 18 wheeler at Christ United Methodist Church, \nJackson, MS, where Baptists, Methodists, Catholics, and Jews were all \nworking together, all kinds of backgrounds, loading those 18 wheelers. \nNobody asked to pay for it. Nobody told them where to send it. They \nsaid: We are loading them, and we are sending them to the First Baptist \nChurch, Pascagoula, the First Presbyterian Church, Pascagoula, and to \nthe Episcopal Church at Ocean Springs, MS. They are there this morning \nwith things such as Clorox--never stop to think you need that--cleaning \nmaterials.\n  I saw the Red Cross riding around. They did not wait for people to \ncome to them because people could not get there. The Red Cross people \nwent into the communities and said: Here is a Styrofoam plate of warm \nfood. Some people had not seen warm food for days. Some people had not \neaten for days. And they are out there handing out water on the \nfrontline. The Salvation Army never asks questions; they provide help. \nSo all of those are doing a great job.\n  I want to do something else too. Well, before I get to that, \nvolunteers, boy, they have been great--people showing up saying: Where \ndo I go? That is one thing we do need is leaders.

We know it is coming. Procter \n& Gamble has given cash and supplies. Foreign aid, Sri Lanka has \noffered us money, $25,000. Well, it might as well as be $25 billion. \nAustralia, Taiwan, countries all over the world. This is an incredible \nlist and it is just a short list of people who are doing their part and \nI wanted that to be in the Record.\n  Most of all, I want to thank the people of my State. I cannot speak \nfor people in other States, but I know the people in my State. I have \nbeen there with\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\nthem in Pascagoula and Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Poplarville, Jackson and \npoints south. What an incredible spirit. We have been hammered, and \nthey are on their knees. This very morning, as my staff called and \ntried to talk to county supervisors and mayors, two counties said: \nLook, we need MREs--that is food--and we could always use more fuel and \nwe have some problems, but do not waste your time on us. Go help \nsomebody else that needs it worse.\n  When I stood with Gene Gaezo in Biloxi, MS, which is an international \ncity, a city of Slovenians, French, German, Greeks, Italians, \nVietnamese, and Hispanics, behind him was where his house was. He had \nlost everything, cars, boats, trash piled up way over your head, lost \nhis job in the gaming industry. And he said: Trent, what do I do? I \nsaid: Well, take care of yourself, feed your family, make sure \neverybody is safe, and then begin working on this trash. Help is on the \nway, do not worry. And he said: Well, you go take care of somebody who \nhas been hurt worse than me.\n  Unless you have lost loved ones, you were not hurting worse than that \nguy was. The spirit has been indomitable. They are not blaming anybody. \nThey are asking for help. I am proud of them. Our attitude is, hey, we \nhave been hit before, we may feel similar to a punching bag, but we \nwill come back. We are going to rebuild, and we will be bigger and \nbetter and stronger for it all. So I want to make sure that the \nAmerican people know the spirit of the people in my area.\n  I know there are going to be hearings. There are a lot of questions. \nBut, please, please, my colleagues, let's not try to fix blame right \nnow. There will be time for that. Let's fix the problems we have to \ndeal with now.\n  Do I have some ideas of what we need to do? Oh, yes. I agree with the \nSenator from Maryland, we should not have ever put FEMA in Homeland \nSecurity. We thought about it. Heck, we did it. Who are we going to \nblame for that? We did that. Maybe it was recommended, I don't know. \nBut you make mistakes. Last time I checked, we are still human beings.\n  I found out something else last week: Disasters bring out the worst \nin bad people but the best in good people. But let's focus on the good.\n  We are going to need legislative help. We are going to need \nappropriations. I know already, for instance, we have to allow in local \ncommunities for cleanup contractors to go on private property. The law \ndoesn't allow that except for the immediate aftermath for health and \nsafety. There are no lines. In Biloxi, MS, and Gulfport, MS, you can't \ntell where the private property was and public property was. It is \nnothing but a mound of debris. If you lost everything you had, it will \nbe months. You can't get the infrastructure back if you can't clean it. \nSo we have to change that. I have lots of ideas how we can improve it \nfor us now, but, more important, for the future, too.\n  What do we need? I want the American people to know. People from all \nover America are calling and crying, saying: How can I help? You can \nhelp. What we need right now are still basics. Food is still a problem, \ngetting it there, getting it distributed. We have now got to the point \nwhere we need clothes. People lost everything they had. We had doctors \nSaturday, in my hometown, wearing the same clothes they wore Sunday the \nweek before, because they didn't have any and they didn't have a place \nto get a shower or any of that.\n  So we need food, clothes, gas. If you can get there with some fuel, \nin some of those red containers, we need that. Baby supplies--I have \nbeen amazed how quickly you need diapers and baby wipes and baby \nformula. We could use that. Cleaning supplies. Plywood, if you have \nsome plywood laying around, load it and bring it down. Equipment of all \ntypes--chain saws, brooms, the basic stuff.\n  I believe there are people in Missouri and people in Georgia, when \nthey know that, who will load up and they will bring it to us and they \nwill distribute it on their own.\n  Yes, we need money. We don't need cash, but we need you to contribute \nto the Red Cross and Salvation Army so they can pay the expenses. Now \nwe are beginning to have a problem with the need for oxygen tanks. We \nhave to find a way to get those and get them where people need them.\n  We need manpower. If you are in Oklahoma and you are retired at 65 \nand you want to help, get in your truck and drive on down. Don't ask \nwhere to go and don't worry about what to do when you get there. When \nyou get there, look around. You will see plenty you can do. Anybody in \nAmerica who wants to go there and help us, come on down. We aren't \nblocking anybody.\n  We have to be careful because we may have an impending health \nproblem. I fear people are going to begin to have heart attacks and \nmental depression and emotional problems. If you cut your foot in \nGulfport, MS, you could be exposed to some bad infections and bad \ndiseases, so we have to be careful.\n  We do need more action. We get back down to what Senator Mikulski was \nsaying. We need leaders, men and women in the Government and everywhere \nelse, who can make a fast decision, be flexible when they make that \ndecision, think innovatively when they make a decision, and use a very \ndifficult thing--common sense. Use common sense.\n  Some of the people have been denied access to fuel or told you can't \ndo that. It is insane. I am getting ready to leave my hometown on \nWednesday night and I want to turn left, and the policeman says you \ncan't turn left. I said, Why not? and the policeman says, Well, I'm not \nfrom here but I am told you can't turn left. So I went down to the next \ninterchange, made a left turn and turned right. It didn't make any \nsense. No common sense. We have to do that.\n  I also have already reached out to some of what I think are some of \nthe best thinkers in America and some of the people who dealt with \nthis, and I said tell us what we can do so we can do it better, \nquicker, and when we build back we will be more secure and we will be \nable to survive maybe because of the way we build. I wanted to know how \ndid California get Interstate 10 bridges and overpasses back in \noperation in 2 months when it ordinarily would take 2 years. What was \nit they had?\n  I found out the Governor had the authority to waive everything. He \nwaived hearings, he waived environmental considerations. They awarded a \ncontract under expedited procedure. They gave the contractor huge \nincentives to finish ahead of schedule and under the money and great \npenalties if they didn't. And guess what, a 2-year project was \ncompleted in 2 months and 2 days and the contractor made more off the \nincentive payment than he did off the basic price. OK. We need to \nreplicate that.\n  I also think the Federal Government needs to think innovatively. If \nyou look at the situation in Bay St. Louis, MS, or New Orleans, LA, \nwhat do we want to do to avoid this sort of problem in the future, and \nhow can we do whatever we do better than we have done it?\n  We need a very aggressive, entrepreneurial proposal for the dramatic, \nbold rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. We want to rebuild, but we don't \nwant to build it the way it was. We want to build it bigger and \nstronger, maybe a little further back, maybe with the help of some \nincentives we haven't had before, like tax credits. We need to help \npeople rebuild now. They don't need a refund next year, they need money \nand assistance now.\n\n  These are the times that try men's souls, the worst I have ever seen. \nBut I do believe we will persevere and, with God's help and with the \nhelp of my colleagues in this great body, and with our President--who \nhas been there, has cried with us and sweated with us, and I have \nlooked at him and I have watched him show his compassion, and I have \nseen him give orders to do a better job--we will get through this.\n  I thank everybody. I am going to do something unusual, too. There are \nexceptions, but even the news media have been helpful. The news media \nin my home State don't just tell the bad stories. We had a wedding for \nsome evacuees. This young couple had to get married, so the people in \nJackson, MS, gave the lady a wedding dress and a wedding cake, and they \ngave them a wedding.\n  They told us good stories and they told us many times where we needed \nto be and where the problems are. Yes, there is some criticism and \nnegativism to go around, but there is a lot of positive out there, too, \nand I am making\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\nsure we build on that side of this equation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first let me say I know on behalf of \neveryone in the Senate how relieved we are that our colleague Trent \nLott and his wife are safe. We all thank him for his inspiring \nobservations about the experiences of the past week, the reactions of \nthe people, the response of people around America to this great crisis. \nI say to our friend from Mississippi how grateful we are he is safe and \nsound and back among us. We will be working with him to make sure we \ndeal with the immediate needs and make whatever adjustments we can for \nthe future, to try to make sure the next time, God forbid something \nlike this happens to our country, we will be even better organized to \nrespond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues today \nto talk about the devastation in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama as \na result of Hurricane Katrina. While Senator Lott is on the floor, I \nwant to give my personal condolences to him and his family and all \nthose who have suffered in Mississippi as well as the other States \ninvolved.\n  My personal deepest sympathies, and those from the people of Michigan \nas well as our prayers, go out to the families grieving the loss of \ntheir loved ones and to the survivors who are struggling to cope and to \nfind shelter, food, and medical care in the wake of this horrendous, \nthis terrible disaster.\n  My heart goes out to all of our colleagues--Senator Landrieu, Senator \nVitter, Senator Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Shelby, and Senator \nSessions. Their constituents are suffering. So are they, and \nparticularly Senator Landrieu and Senator Lott, who have lost their \nfamily homes to this vicious storm. All of America is hurting with the \nvictims and their families. We are finding ways to help and reach out \nand make a difference in these critical times following the hurricane.\n  Americans are donating record amounts of money, time, and supplies to \nhelp those who are displaced by the hurricane. The most important thing \nright now is to make sure we are saving lives and that we are providing \nfood and shelter and medical care for the people affected by this \ntragedy.\n  As has happened with many other States, two jetliners arrived in \nMichigan yesterday with the first group of 289 hurricane evacuees. \nTroops and volunteers at our Battle Creek Air National Guard base will \nprovide clean shelter and food and clothing to them. They are the first \nof many evacuees we plan to take in Michigan, and I know this is \nhappening in the States of my colleagues all over the country as people \nopen their hearts, open their homes, and open their pocketbooks to \nshare with those who have been affected. Michigan's Department of \nNatural Resources has loaded 25 boats and trailers with supplies and \nsent them to the Gulf Coast. We also have several Michigan State Police \nteams moving south to assist with the emergency response.\n\n  Michigan's Department of Transportation has fuel trucks headed south \nand is making arrangements for alternative flight operators to pick up \nevacuees, if necessary.\n  There are so many individual stories of heroism and generosity rising \nfrom the depths of this catastrophe, both in the States affected by the \nhurricane and in communities all across our country. I have heard \nstories about individuals in New Orleans who stayed after helping their \nfamilies escape to safety. They stayed to help rescue their neighbors. \nTwo men from Simmesport took their airboat through New Orleans and \ntransported by themselves more than 1,000 people to safety in the first \nday after the hurricane. When a news crew from North Carolina tried to \ninterview them about their heroic efforts, they declined, saying they \nhad too much work to do and no time to stop and talk.\n  We have all heard the heartbreaking stories of sacrifice--of the wife \nwho let go of her husband's hand as he clung to the wreckage of their \nhome, giving her own life so her husband would be able to be alive to \nraise their children. We salute each and every one of those heroes, \nthese people who put others before themselves, who made sacrifices so \nothers could be brought to safety.\n  There are stories about people all across our great Nation who are \nanswering the call to help fellow Americans. In Michigan, families and \nbusinesses are working together to help victims and families. My alma \nmater, Michigan State University, and the University of Michigan, are \ncollecting donations for the Red Cross at their football games. On \nSaturday, the University of Michigan fans put $40,000 into buckets as \nthey entered the stadium. One anonymous donor put in a wad of five $100 \nbills. Some donations are big, some are small, but they all count and \nthe donations are coming in from all kinds of venues. Nine-year-old \nRochester Hills resident Megan and her five-year-old sister Lauren set \nup a booth to sell lemonade, chocolate chips, and their toys to raise \nmoney to send to the Red Cross. The girls raised $80, and their parents \npromised to match it.\n  These are the stories that matter right now, both in the States \naffected and all across the country: saving lives, finding shelter, \nfood, medical care, and raising funds to help the hurricane victims.\n  But there is also another story to tell. It is about the Federal \nGovernment and our responsibility to all Americans to be prepared--to \nbe prepared not only for this kind of disaster but for a coordinated \nresponse to help save lives and prevent chaos. We must find answers to \nbasic questions that the American people are asking right now as they \nwatch the aftermath on TV, minute by minute, hour by hour, and they say \nover and over again to themselves: How could this have happened in the \nUnited States of America, the greatest country on Earth? How could our \ncountry allow people to die without getting them water, food, and \nmedical care?\n  In this time immediately following the disaster, we have an \nobligation to correct the mistakes in crisis response and we have \nquestions to answer to everyone--certainly to those who have been \naffected.\n  Are we investing enough in homeland security? I say no, and I have \nsaid no since 9/11. Why has the Senate basically ignored the Rudman \nreport from 3 years ago that showed our Nation's first responders need \nadditional funding in the amount of $20 billion a year? Senator Dodd \nand I offered that amendment to fully respond to that report now for 3 \ndifferent years. I hope we are going to be able to get that done.\n  How much are we to invest to maintain the flood control projects of \nour Corps of Engineers? Clearly, the current level is not enough, and \npeople have said that it wasn't enough. In 2002, Mike Parker, former \nAssistant Secretary for the Army for Civil Works, testified before the \nSenate Budget Committee, of which I am a member, that funding cuts to \nthe Corps' budget would have a negative impact on the national \ninterest.\n  Are we stretching our National Guard troops too thin? Thirty-five \npercent of Louisiana's National Guard troops--3,000 soldiers--are in \nBaghdad. Is that too many? Spokesman LT Andy Thaggard of the \nMississippi National Guard, which has a brigade of more than 4,000 \ntroops in central Iraq, said this about the hurricane response: ``We \nneed our people.''\n  Are we heeding the scientific advice that overwhelmingly points to \nglobal warming as a possible cause for increased hurricanes?\n  We have important questions to answer--serious questions for which we \nall need to work together to take responsibility--about how the Federal \nGovernment could have better handled the events that unfolded as a \nresult of this catastrophe called Hurricane Katrina. We need to make \nsure that we are responding quickly, not only to help those in need \ntoday but, Heaven forbid, that something happens tomorrow. We have to \nbe ready. We have to learn from this catastrophe, from the mistakes and \nthe lack of adequate response, and quickly fix it. That is our job.\n  It is absolutely critical that local communities have the tools they \nneed to communicate, to coordinate, and to respond effectively when \ndisasters hit. They didn't have that in New Orleans--where the police \ndepartment and three\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\nnearby parishes are on different radio systems. They didn't have enough \nsatellite phones. They had ground and cell phone lines that were taken \nout with the storm. And the communications systems they did have--like \nmost local communities across the Nation--were not interoperable. They \ndo not work together.\n  Police officers called Senator Landrieu's office because they \ncouldn't reach commanders on the ground in New Orleans because they \nwere sharing satellite phones that were in short supply. The result of \nthis lack of interoperability was nothing short of chaos.\n  FEMA Director Michael Brown has said that emergency assistance \ndelivery problems were caused by ``the total lack of communications--\nthe inability to hear and have good intelligence on the ground.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, has said that \nFEMA's efforts to deal with the hurricane have been completely \nineffective, and he called the Federal Government's response a failure. \nThese are his words:\n\n       I think FEMA has been completely dysfunctional and is \n     completely overwhelmed, and I don't know why. This situation \n     was utterly predictable.\n\n  And he is right. We knew before Katrina hit that too many of our \npolice, fire, and emergency medical services and transportation \nofficials could not communicate and still cannot communicate with each \nother. Our local departments are not able to link their communications \nwith State and Federal emergency response agencies.\n  A June 2004 U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that 94 percent of \ncities do not have interoperable capability between police and fire and \nemergency medical services. Sixty percent said they do not have \ninteroperable capability with the State emergency operations center. As \nwe saw with the hurricane, that puts our communities and every single \nAmerican in danger.\n  This lack of communications interoperability is a crisis, and we must \ndeal with it. We must deal with it now. It is one of the lessons that \nhas been painfully--painfully--learned from this hurricane. We need to \nlearn it, and we need to learn it quickly.\n  That is why as soon as possible I will offer, again, my amendment \nthat provides $5 billion for interoperable communications grants for \nAmerica's first responders to provide a strong commitment to this \nproblem. We know what it costs. CBO outlined what it would cost. We \nneed to get this done.\n  When we debated this amendment in this year's 2006 debate on homeland \nsecurity appropriations, many of my colleagues across the aisle opposed \nit because they felt it was a local responsibility.\n  Communications is not a local responsibility when the FEMA Director \nadmits that he learned about the 25,000 people trapped at the New \nOrleans Convention Center from news reports. This is not acceptable, \nand the American people expect us to act now. There is no more time to \nwaste. I am for fixing the problem.\n  I believe our Government failed the people of the gulf coast. Members \nof the administration and the Congress must admit that we need more \nresources to deal with potential disasters, whether they are natural \ndisasters or stem from a terror attack.\n  The shock and the horror of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will \nlive with us forever.\n  We salute the heroes in this disaster, and our prayers are with the \nvictims. The American people, as they always do, are rising to the \nchallenge and helping our communities across the Nation. We thank every \nsingle person for making that contribution, saying that prayer, \ndonating their clothes, donating food, getting in their cars and \ndriving down to help, or getting a bus or getting a caravan from their \nchurch. But I believe from the bottom of my heart that we in \nGovernment, this Senate and the House and the administration, have got \nto step up and do our part. We have got to step up. We know what needs \nto be done. We know what needs to be done to make sure our communities \nhave the communications equipment they need. We know what needs to be \ndone to make sure these disasters don't happen again--by providing the \nArmy Corps of Engineers with what they need to keep communities safe. \nWe know what needs to be done.\n  While we are joining on the floor--and we will join together to reach \nout to help the victims and address issues that relate to health care, \nhousing, education, and other issues that need to be addressed--I hope \nwe are not going to leave this floor after working on those things \nwithout having said we fixed it for the next hurricane, for the next \nterrorist attack, for the next bioterrorist attack, or for the next \nnatural disaster. We have a responsibility to step up and solve the \nproblems that added to the chaos and the hurt and the loss of life \nbecause the right priorities were not put in place by the Congress and \nthis administration.\n  We can fix it, and it is on our shoulders to make sure that we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  A few moments ago, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi spoke on the \nfloor of the Senate about the pastor from my State of Illinois who just \ngot into her truck and drove to Mississippi to see what she could do to \nhelp. There are people like her all over my State and all over this \nNation.\n  Illinois so far has received 500 Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Another \n250 will arrive at the Rockford Airport today. The number could rise \ninto the thousands.\n  Thirty families so far have asked to enroll their children in \nIllinois schools, and more are on their way.\n  America's Second Harvest, based in Chicago, and the American Red \nCross, filled a United Airlines flight with 25,000 pounds of critically \nneeded relief supplies and sent it--in just a few days from Chicago to \nNew Orleans.\n  I got a call while I was traveling the State last week from a Pepsi \nCola distributor in Quincy, IL. He said:\n\n       Senator, I want to send 33,000 cases of water to Louisiana. \n     How can I do it?\n\n  We have been working with them ever since.\n  Six-hundred Illinois firefighters traveled to Baton Rogue. Personnel \nfrom the Scott Air Force base near Belleville, IL, have been busy \nflying airlift missions to the disaster area.\n  Mr. President, 328 members of the Illinois National Guard are \nproviding some of the big trucks they desperately need to transport \npeople and material to the areas hard hit by Katrina. Another 500 \nmembers of the Illinois National Guard are expected to ship out to the \ngulf coast by tomorrow. By the end of the week, nearly one-tenth of the \nentire Illinois National Guard could be serving on the gulf coast.\n  Mr. President, 400 doctors and nurses from the Rush University \nMedical Center, the University of Illinois, and Cook County Hospital \nare ready to be deployed as soon as they get the call.\n  What does this say? It says that when we have pain and distress in \nthe American family, we come together. And that is the way it should \nbe.\n  Twelve years ago, there was a flood on the Mississippi, Illinois and \nMissouri Rivers. As a Congressman from the flood-affected area, I \nreally felt the pain of the people living in the small communities. I \nreflected on that for a moment and the heroic efforts made by some to \nrespond to their needs. Then I tried to put it into perspective of what \nwas happening on the gulf coast in Alabama and Mississippi and \ncertainly in the State of Louisiana. What we went through just \nabsolutely pales in comparison.\n  Thousands of our fellow Americans may have lost their lives in \nHurricane Katrina. Hundreds of thousands of people in Alabama, \nMississippi, and Louisiana have been displaced from their homes maybe \nnever ever to return.\n  Hurricane Katrina may be one of the worst economic disasters in our \nNation's history.\n  Put in perspective, 48 hours after 9/11 we came up with the estimate \nthat we would need $250 billion to deal with the devastation of that \nterrible act of terrorism; that is about the high level mark for the \ncost of a disaster. Preliminary estimates now from Hurricane Katrina \nsurpass $100 billion, and some say as high as $150 billion, to give you \nsome idea of the devastation and the challenge that we face.\n  How do we estimate how many jobs have been lost on the gulf coast? \nSome say a half million.\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\n  The economic aftershocks are being felt across the country. Just ask \nanybody who is filling up a gas tank anywhere in America.\n  In Illinois, our farmers, who have had a tough year with the drought \nand a short corn crop, now worry about getting their products down the \nMississippi and down the Illinois to market with the Port of New \nOrleans damaged.\n  Let us put it into some perspective for a moment.\n  President John Kennedy said:\n\n       To those whom much is given, much is required.\n\n  Sadly, the agenda of the Senate in the past has not reflected what I \nconsider to be the core value and truth of President Kennedy's remarks.\n  Last week, while the mayor of New Orleans was issuing a desperate SOS \nfor help to rescue tens of thousands of people who were trapped in the \ncity and in danger of dying without food, water, medical care, or \nshelter, the leader of the Republic National Committee sent out his own \nSOS. It said: Call your Senators and tell them to vote this week to \ngive a $1 trillion tax break--to the wealthiest people in America.\n  It is hard to understand how that could be happening in the midst of \nthis national disaster. At a time when thousands are dispossessed, \nhomeless, hungry, and desperate to know what their futures will be, how \ncan we focus on tax breaks and tax cuts for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica?\n  Majority leader Bill Frist did the right thing. He pulled the estate \ntax issue from the agenda. A trillion-dollar tax break for millionaires \nshould be the last thing on our minds. We have Americans in distress. \nLet us not worry about making it more comfortable for those who live in \nthe lap of luxury already.\n  Never in our history have we cut taxes for the wealthy during a war--\nwhich we are engaged in now in Iraq and Afghanistan--and never should \nwe cut taxes on those in America who are well enough during a national \ncrisis such as Hurricane Katrina. We need to put first things first.\n  At a time when the American family is in pain, when our neighbors are \nhomeless in Katrina's wake, when we are losing our children in Iraq, \nwhen our hard-working friends can't afford health insurance and \ngasoline for their cars and the basics for their kids, when the \nblessings of prosperity reach a few and not the many, Members of \nCongress on both sides of the aisle must feel the hurt and understand \nthe heart of America.\n  Americans will always rise to a call for shared sacrifice and unity. \nDuring World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt made a speech. This \nis what he said.\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a \n     shipyard, or on the farms or in oil fields or mines, \n     producing the weapons or the raw materials that are needed by \n     our Armed Forces.\n       But there is one front, and one battle, where everyone in \n     the United States--every man, woman, and child--is in action, \n     and will be privileged to remain in action throughout this \n     war. That front is right here at home, in our daily lives, in \n     our daily tasks. . . .\n  FDR said:\n\n       Here at home everyone will have the privilege of making \n     whatever self-denial is necessary, not only to supply our \n     fighting men, but to keep the economic structure of our \n     country fortified and secure during the war and after the \n     war. . . . This will require, of course, the abandonment not \n     only of luxuries, but of many other creature comforts.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt was appealing to the best in America, a sense of \nunity and a sense of sacrifice in a time of great national need. Can \nanyone recall a time recently, other than September 11, when we have \nfelt that same sense of need in this country?\n  President Roosevelt went on to say:\n\n       Every loyal American is aware of his individual \n     responsibility. Whenever I hear anyone saying, ``The American \n     people are complacent--they need to be aroused,'' I feel like \n     asking them to come to Washington to read the mail that \n     floods into the White House and into all departments of this \n     government. The one question that recurs throughout all these \n     thousands of letters and messages is, ``What more can I do to \n     help my country in winning this war?''\n\n  Those are the words of Franklin Roosevelt, appealing to a core \nAmerican value, appealing to the American family to stand together.\n  After September 11, a new generation of Americans asked the same \nquestion: What can we do to help this country win this war on \nterrorism? Many of them, the best of them, are serving today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Nearly 2,000 members of our military, including 77 \nfrom my home State of Illinois, have paid the ultimate price, have \ngiven up their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Four Illinoisans died in \nIraq during August. More National Guard and Reserve members died in \nIraq during the first 10 days in August than in any full month during \nthe entire war. Many thousands more have suffered serious injuries. I \nhave met some of them at Walter Reed Hospital and other veterans \nfacilities. They are making enormous sacrifices.\n  After September 11, Americans answered the call for shared sacrifice \nat home, too. What an enormous outpouring of sympathy and generosity, \nincluding the blood banks with people standing in line, the charities \nwith people making their contributions, the outpouring of sentiment and \nhope and prayers for the victims of September 11. Even people living on \nsmall fixed incomes in America asked: How can I help? They each gave \nwhat they could.\n  Some of the same units that served in the Persian Gulf, those who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan, are now helping others right here at \nhome. That is the spirit of America.\n  This week, as we prepare to mark the fourth anniversary of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, we see the same spirit on the rise in America. \nThe extraordinary way our country reaches out with its wallets, its \nhearts, opening its home to the victims of Hurricane Katrina shows us \nonce again that the spirit of shared sacrifice is strong. That spirit \nmust not only guide us in our conversation with America, it should \nguide us with our agenda in Congress.\n  We are all in this together, in times of war and in times of national \ncatastrophe. It is not tax cuts for the wealthy that protect America \nand make us strong. What sees us through hard times has always been our \nbelief in America, our shared commitment to one another, and our \nwillingness to accept our fair share of sacrifice.\n  We have all learned a lot in the last few weeks. Sadly, many believed \nour homeland security was up to the challenge and the task. It did not \nwork in many parts of the gulf coast. It certainly did not work in New \nOrleans. This hurricane, leading to a breach of a levee, has resulted \nin the loss of thousands of innocent lives.\n  Many felt if we faced that kind of catastrophe, whether from a \nnatural disaster or from some terrorist attack involving biological or \nchemical weapons, we were ready to evacuate innocent people, to move \nfolks out of hospitals so they could be taken care of in other places. \nBut we know now from what happened just a few days ago that we are not \nprepared. We are not ready. We are not as safe and secure as we should \nbe in this time of danger in the world, danger from terrorist attack, \ndanger from natural disaster.\n  We need to do more. We need to focus on making America safe. We need \nto focus on thanking those who are giving so much every minute of every \nday to help those in need. And we need to focus on our prayers and \nthoughts directed to the victims of this terrible tragedy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak, as my colleagues have \nbefore me, about the terrible tragedy in the Gulf Coast. As the rescue \nand recovery in the Gulf Coast continues, as we pray for each life, my \nthoughts, for instance, always go back to 9/11, the tragedy that befell \nmy city and State.\n  It is sort of a horrible thing to say, in a certain sense, about the \nnumber of people who died, but people thought the number of deaths in \nour State and our city would be much greater than it was. I think about \na week after the planes hit the Twin Towers, most people were talking \nabout over 10,000 people dying. As I said, I feel awkward\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\nsaying this, but it is a true thought we all have, that only 3,000 were \nfound to have passed. Still, it is an awful number, and the families \nmiss those people every single day. I knew some of them myself. I miss \nthem and think of them. But we hope and pray this happens in Louisiana, \nthat the horrible numbers we have heard about--the possible number of \ndeaths--are significantly lower.\n  One other thought I want to mention about New York, before getting \ninto the substance of my remarks, is that this morning I was privileged \nto attend a groundbreaking for the new New York/New Jersey rail station \nto be built at Ground Zero. It will be a beautiful and sweeping \nstation. The architect, the world-famous Mr. Calatrava, got the idea of \na child releasing a dove at the station. At least by the designs and \npictures I have seen, it will be a soaring and sweeping station.\n  At that memorial I thought about the victims and the people of the \nGulf. I said to them that a week after the planes hit the Twin Towers, \nwe were filled with despair, anguish, anger, and thought there would \nnever be any hope after something that horrible happened. But the human \ncondition is a remarkable one. And, of course, hope is always with us, \nas the Greek mythological story of Pandora's box shows.\n  The groundbreaking that Senators Clinton and Lautenberg and Corzine \nand I attended this morning with the Governors of New York and New \nJersey shows us there is always hope. This station--a beautiful, \nsweeping, soaring station--will rise like a phoenix out of the ashes of \n9/11.\n  I say to my colleagues who represent the Gulf States, as well as to \nall the people in the Gulf States: Hope will return. It is hard to see \nnow, with so much devastation and so much anguish and so much sadness, \nbut it will return. Just as in New York we are rebuilding ourselves, \nhopefully to be bigger and better and stronger than we were before 9/\n11, I know that, too, will happen with the people in the gulf region. \nSo my thoughts are with them. All of our thoughts are with them.\n  Because of the devastation of Katrina, we confront one of the most \nextraordinary challenges this Nation has ever faced: To feed, to \nclothe, to house, to help an estimated 1 million Americans who were \ndisplaced and who now have to rebuild their lives.\n  The disaster area is some 90,000 square miles. That is almost double \nthe entire State of New York. It is an area nearly as large as the \nUnited Kingdom. The amount of damage to the homes, the businesses, the \nschools, the infrastructure, the roads, the bridges is in the tens of \nbillions of dollars, most certainly. It is already estimated, for \ninstance, that Louisiana alone has lost at least 110,000 businesses. \nAnd that number is likely to climb as we calculate the full extent of \nthe damage.\n  The images on TV are devastating. They are of hungry, weeping \nchildren, of families returning to the destroyed remains of their \nneighborhoods, discovering they have lost everything they have owned, \nfrom precious family keepsakes to their houses and cars and \nlivelihoods. The pictures of angry, frightened people, with nowhere to \ngo, unsure of what will happen to themselves and their loved ones rings \na deep chord in every one of our hearts. And there are the deaths of so \nmany. The psychological toll of this tragedy will be heavy indeed, \nespecially, of course, on the children. Another thing we learned after \n9/11 is to pay particular attention to the children. Sometimes it took \nthem, in New York, over a year to speak about what they had seen.\n  When my city faced a devastating attack, America stood with us in our \ntime of need. I want to assure the people of the gulf region that New \nYorkers--I think I can say probably just about every one of the 19 \nmillion New Yorkers--will stand with you, the people of the gulf \nregion, as you stood with us in the dark days immediately following 9/\n11.\n  The love and support New Yorkers received from the rest of the \ncountry after 9/11 meant so much in the wake of those attacks and the \nlong, difficult road to recovery. I want the people of New Orleans and \nthe rest of the Gulf Coast to know we will support them, too, no matter \nhow long, no matter how difficult their recovery may be. We will do \nwhatever it takes to help now, tomorrow, next week, next month, next \nyear, and on into the future.\n  We took the first step last week when Congress provided $10.5 billion \nin desperately needed disaster relief funds to the devastated region. \nBut as I learned in the aftermath of 9/11, money is only the first \nstep. The next step is to ensure that bureaucratic rules and \nregulations do not prevent the money from being spent quickly and where \nit is most needed. We discovered after 9/11 that the rules governing \nhow Federal dollars can be spent and benefits accessed--from HUD to the \nDepartment of Transportation to the IRS--became insurmountable \nobstacles for so many of our citizens in need. And many of the problems \nfaced after 9/11 will be faced a thousandfold for Hurricane Katrina \nbecause there are so many more people and businesses that were hurt.\n  It is essential that Congress take action as quickly as possible on \nas many fronts as possible. Every day makes a difference for those \nseeking a place to live, a way to get their children back to school, to \nget health care, to get a job. So many jobs are gone. Furthermore, \nafter 9/11, Congress tackled many of the problems facing Hurricane \nKatrina victims and has a template to work with. And Senator Reid, \nworking with our committee leaders, has already compiled a list of \naction items Congress should address this week.\n  Before I get into those action items, I want to say one other thing. \nWe do need the most competent people running the agencies that are in \ncharge of this recovery effort. And I heard, an hour or so ago on the \nfloor, our colleague, my friend, Senator Mikulski, speak on that issue. \nWe all know Senator Mikulski is somebody who knows FEMA and the \nagencies involved with recovery extremely well because as chairperson \nand as ranking Democrat on the relevant appropriations subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over FEMA, she knows them. We also know she is a \ntemperate person in the sense that she does not regularly get up and \ndemand that people step down. But when she spoke on the floor an hour \nago and said that the FEMA head, Brown, should either step down or be \nforced to step down, I think all of us should listen to her. These are \nserious times, and fingers of blame should not be pointed at any one \nplace. But to make sure we have the most competent people in charge as \nthe rescue effort proceeds is very important. So again I want to urge \nmy colleagues to listen to what Senator Mikulski had to say because I \nthink it is extremely important to us.\n\n  Now, getting back to the list that Senator Reid, working with some of \nour committee leaders, has compiled, it is a list of action items, and \nI hope Congress will address it this week. The list includes providing \nMedicaid, housing vouchers, and emergency cash for all displaced \nvictims, waiving deadlines, and expediting applications where \nnecessary, and waiving the requirements to prove residency or asset \nlevels or to provide other paperwork which, of course, so many of those \nwho have lost everything in their lives no longer have. The Reid \npackage also proposes tax incentives for families who take in victims, \nand identifying Federal facilities that can house them.\n  The proposal also focuses on helping the tens of thousands of \nchildren who need to get enrolled quickly into schools around the \ncountry by providing those schools with financial assistance and \nwaiving the usual bureaucratic requirements for enrollment. I believe \nthis must be one of our highest priorities. Since the hurricane \noccurred right at the beginning of the school year, there is not a day \nto waste. We cannot let our children simply hang out there without \nproviding for their education, which, Katrina or not, means their \nfuture.\n  My heart grieves at the sight of so many of these children sitting \naround the Astrodome and other shelters with no place to go. It is \nSeptember. Let us pledge to get all those children, who have faced so \nmuch trauma already, into school by the end of the month. We must \nprovide the Federal dollars needed to bolster those schools that are \nopening their hearts and doors to these children, from Houston to San \nFrancisco to Vermont. We must also provide these children with all they \nwill need--food and shelter and school supplies--to keep their \neducation on track.\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\n  We must also make sure our brave National Guard personnel, who are on \nthe front lines abroad in Iraq and now here at home, receive all the \nassistance they need, from debt and student loan relief to allowing \nthem to qualify for Federal health care and retirement benefits. Our \nNation owes these American heroes nothing less.\n  Finally, the Reid proposal addresses what may ultimately be our most \npressing challenge--finding employment for the victims of Katrina, by \nmaking employers eligible to claim the Work Opportunity Tax Credit of \nup to $2,400 per worker they hire. We need to do this and much more. \nWith so many businesses and so much infrastructure destroyed, we will \nneed both the Federal Government and the private sector to step to the \nplate and get people back to work.\n  Congress can and should tackle right away in these few weeks the \nproblems that have been mentioned above. We should learn lessons from \nwhat we were able to do after 9/11 for New York. With a million people \nin need of assistance, it is inexcusable that we would delay. Let us \nmove this package this week, not next week or the week after.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues today have spoken about the \nalmost unbelievable disaster that has occurred in the Gulf region. Only \nnow are we fully beginning to understand the lives lost and the \ncomplete devastation of the region. I know there will be a lot of time, \nperhaps, to evaluate what kind of emergency preparedness existed or why \nproper preparedness did not exist. This is the moment and the time for \nall of us to concentrate on finding the survivors.\n  There are so many victims. We know that many of those who have died \nin this disaster have not yet been found. We know there are survivors \nwho have not yet been found. We are nearly certain of that. This is an \nimportant time to marshal the resources of this country, to effectively \norganize the resources to search for survivors, and then to help those \nwho have been made victims by this devastating hurricane.\n  Many of us have suffered disasters. In North Dakota, in 1997, there \nwere the Red River Valley floods, when the entire city of Grand Forks \nwas evacuated. It was an enormous evacuation of people. Thank God at \nthat point we did not lose lives. We lost a great deal of property and \npeople suffered and had very tough times, but there was not loss of \nlife with respect to those floods. But an entire city of over 50,000 \npeople was evacuated from those floods. I recall President Clinton \nflying into Grand Forks on Air Force One and meeting with a large \nnumber of people who had crowded into a hangar at the Air Force base. I \nremember what President Clinton said to them that day. He said very \nsimply: You are not alone.\n  That is the message that our country must give to all of those who \nare victims of Hurricane Katrina: You are not alone. This country \ndoesn't move ahead by leaving some behind. This country knows your \nplight, knows the despair of having lost what you have lost, joins you \nin sympathy for the loss of lives, and extends a hand to say we want to \nhelp you during these difficult times.\n  There are so many needs and so many things that have to be done: \nhousing, basic needs such as food and shelter, jobs, education, short-\nterm spending money to get on your feet if you have lost everything. \nThose are the things that, in a package of assistance by the Congress, \nneed to be addressed quickly.\n  I know there are some who tend to believe that Government ought not \nexist. They think Government is the problem. But when something like \nthis happens, we together, through our Government, work to extend a \nhelping hand. This Congress cannot be reticent about arriving at that \npoint to extend a helping hand to provide for the needs of people who \nhave been displaced, who have suffered and are victims of this \ndevastating hurricane.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims of this \ndevastating hurricane that has displaced, some say, 1 million people \nand caused massive loss of life. While there are public policy issues \nthat we should discuss and will discuss in the coming days and months, \nall of us, as a country, will pray for those poor people who have \nsuffered immensely in recent days. We hope the searches to find \nsurvivors continue to move forward and that we find additional \nsurvivors. And we hope in every possible way those who have been the \nvictims of this hurricane understand this is a great country and this \ncountry extends its hand to say to them: You are not alone. Actions by \nthis Congress will manifest that. We ought to do that quickly and \nurgently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9624-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9624-S9625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GASOLINE PRICES AND WINDFALL PROFITS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I also wish to speak about a subject that \nhas some relationship but an issue that the American people were facing \nbefore the hurricane hit. Prior to the devastating Hurricane Katrina, \nthe Senate Energy Committee had scheduled a hearing on gasoline and oil \nprices. That hearing is now going on. I spent the last 2 hours \nattending it. It was scheduled before this hurricane. Obviously, when \nthe hurricane hit, a number of oil refineries and a couple of major \npipelines shut down. It has had an impact beyond that which was \noccurring prior to the hurricane.\n  Prior to the hurricane hitting, oil prices had already risen $30 a \nbarrel above that which existed a year and a half to 2 years ago. The \nmajor integrated oil companies that have become larger through mergers \nand concentration in recent years were already earning record profits.\n  Last evening, a friend of mine went to a gas station and pumped \ngasoline into his car and his son's car, about 15 gallons in each car. \nThe bill was $103 dollars. Every American citizen understands that \nsticker shock when they pull up to the gas pump. We are told by some: \nIt is the free market.\n  Here is what has happened to the profits of U.S. major oil and gas \ncompanies in billions of dollars from 2002, at which point they were \n$20 billion, to this year, when they are going to be over $100 billion. \nThis is not a free market; this is a market with clogged arteries. It \nis OPEC pricing. It is a few countries that live on top of sand that is \nundergirded by substantial deposits of oil sitting around and deciding \nhow much they are going to produce and what price they want to extract. \nSo it is OPEC pricing. It is a concentrated domestic industry through \nmergers. It is rampant speculation. And it is also substantial windfall \nprofits for some very profitable oil companies.\n  The question is, Where is the gain and where is the pain? Here is the \ngain.\n  We use 21 million barrels of oil a day. Sixty percent comes from \noutside of our country, which means we now have revenuesharing going on \nbetween the American drivers and consumers and the OPEC countries, \nincluding the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and the Iraqis and others. It is \nforced revenuesharing. We pull up to the pump, we pay an inflated price \nfor gasoline, and we send the money to the Middle East. Forty percent \nof that which we use is produced domestically by larger and larger oil \ncompanies, grown larger by mergers in recent years. That 40 percent has \nincreased by $30 a barrel. That means the profits have increased by $7 \nbillion a month for the domestic producers.\n  The integrated domestic producers in many cases have control of oil \nfrom the discovery in the ground to the gasoline pump. Eighty billion \ndollars a year in extra profits will exist in the coming year if the \nprice of oil stays where it is now. That profit doesn't emerge out of \nthin air. It comes from extracting it from the consumers who drive up \nto the gas pump and take out their credit card or their currency and \npay for a tank of gasoline.\n  Something needs to be done. Tomorrow, I intend to introduce windfall \nprofits rebate legislation. The bill will establish a price point for a \nbarrel of oil. A portion of the windfall profits above that amount \nwould be captured and sent back to the consumers who are paying the \nexcess or windfall profits to the companies. I would exempt from that \nwindfall profits recapture that amount of additional money that is \nbeing used by the companies for domestic exploration or for increasing \nrefinery capacity. If it is being used for that, I say fine. At least \nwe are trying to search for a better future with a greater energy \nsupply. But some of the\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nmajor oil companies are now buying back their stock with that profit. \nThat doesn't benefit this country.\n  These are windfall profits at the expense of consumers to enrich the \nlarger integrated oil companies. I believe part of it ought to be \nrecaptured and sent back as a rebate to the American consumer. I will \nintroduce that legislation tomorrow.\n\n  I know it is controversial. I know some people may think the best way \nto address all of this is to sit around with your hands in your pocket \nand wipe your brow and wring your hands and fret about it and \nessentially do nothing. These represent the windfall profits on 40 \npercent of that which we use. Twenty-one million barrels a day. Forty \npercent of that comes from domestic producers. That has increased over \n$30 a barrel with no additional cost incurred by the major oil \ncompanies. It amounts to $7 billion windfall profits a month or $80 \nbillion windfall profits a year. I believe some of that ought to be \ncollected and sent back to consumers as rebates.\n  Again, I know that is controversial. I know some won't want to do \nthat. The plain fact is, if we do nothing, you have a massive transfer \nof income from people who can't afford it to people who shouldn't get \nit to interests that shouldn't get it. I believe Congress should take \naction. I understand that this is a shorter term issue, but John \nKenneth Galbraith said: In the long run, we are all dead. So let's deal \nwith the short term.\n  Yes, I want to shed our addiction of running gasoline through \ncarburetors and fuel injectors. I wrote the provision in the Energy \nbill, signed by the President, that has a $3.7 billion title dealing \nwith hydrogen and fuel cells. That ought to be our future, hydrogen and \nfuel cells. If you run on hydrogen--and hydrogen is ubiquitous, it is \neverywhere--you get water vapor out the tailpipe, and you have twice \nthe efficiency of power to the wheel. That is wonderful. Put up a wind \nturbine and collect energy from the wind and use the electricity \ncollected from the wind to separate hydrogen from water with \nelectricity--something called electrolysis--and then put that hydrogen \nin a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. The Energy bill has a pretty good \ntitle on that. I wrote that title.\n  We need to shed our addiction to this oil. We need to shed our \ndependence on Middle East oil. In the meantime, in the short term, when \nyou drive up to a gas pump with 2 cars and pump 15 gallons in each and \npay $103, the question is, Who is pocketing that money and why? There \nis no justification for that kind of windfall profit.\n  If the oil industry wants to have substantial profits to invest back \ninto the ground or to build additional refineries, that is fine. That \nwouldn't be captured by a windfall profit. But when the oil industry is \ngetting windfall profits to the tune of $7 billion a month, which they \nare doing right now, and some are busy buying back their stock, the \nAmerican consumers deserve a break. They have had a bellyful of this. \nWe have seen it all over this country where the big interests get \nbigger. They extract more from the rest, and nobody seems to care much.\n  One final point, there is also a provision in the final Energy bill \nthat requires the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation \nof oil and gas prices within 90 days. I wrote that provision as well. \nBut frankly, I have minimum hope that the Federal Trade Commission is \ngoing to be an ambitious referee with respect to pricing. This Congress \nshould take action.\n  Here is what we face from now to Halloween to Thanksgiving to \nChristmas with respect to $226 million a day of windfall profits. That \nis $30 a barrel above that which existed when you already had record \nprofits in the domestic industry. I believe some of it ought to be \nrecaptured and given back to American consumers.\n  I saw an old car with an old bumper hanging down. That car had seen a \nbetter day--rust in the fenders and the bumper hanging halfway on the \nright. I saw it at a stop sign near Mohall, ND, one day. The bumper \nsticker had a plaintive message. It said: We fought the gas war and gas \nwon.\n  The fact is, American consumers ought to be given an even break. That \nis why I am introducing this legislation tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before the Senator from North Dakota leaves the floor, I \ncommend him for his comments. I am prepared to share some thoughts as \nwell about the events in our country over the last week or so, but the \nSenator's comments about the energy crisis are tremendously timely in \nlight of what has occurred in prices over the last number of days all \nacross our country. And I join him in introducing legislation at least \nby tomorrow I hope in a bipartisan effort.\n  Again, he makes a very significant point that any of these resources, \nadditional dollars that are pouring into the coffers of the industries \nthat would go for exploration, research, refining capacity, are not \nincluded. In fact, we wish they would do more in developing new sources \nof energy. But if they are pocketing these resources at the expense of \nour economy, then I think it is incumbent upon us in this institution \nto respond and to not allow this gouging to occur at a time when the \ncountry is suffering. As someone who has paid a lot of attention over \nthe years to the fuel cell industry, I do not think I am exaggerating \nwhen I say the capital of the fuel cell industry has been the State of \nConnecticut over the last number of years. United Technologies, to \ntheir great credit--aside from being a large defense contractor--has \nworked aggressively in the fuel cell area. The Senator from North \nDakota is absolutely correct that fuel cells offer tremendous \nopportunity. It is not like inventing some new technology. It is out \nthere. If we would put the resources behind it, make it a bit more \nefficient than it is today, which is not a great deal, not a very \ndifficult thing to do, then we could make some giant steps forward in \nreducing our dependency on foreign countries and our dependency on \nnonrenewable sources of energy.\n  I commend the Senator for his comments and his ideas.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are many companies involved in hydrogen fuel cell \ntechnology, including United Technologies, that are very active in this \narea. The Senator is absolutely right with respect to activities in \nConnecticut. I also want to point out my point on the floor of the \nSenate is not to tarnish the oil industry. I have been a supporter of \nit in areas where I felt we should support it. We produce oil in North \nDakota. My point is that as the major integrated companies become \nbigger and more concentrated, they in some cases work oil from the \nground to the gas pumps with tremendous pricing capabilities. They are \nbeneficiaries from the enormous amount of excess profit. If they pump \nthose back into the ground or to increase refinery capacity, that is \nfine. But when they are buying back their stock, I believe they ought \nto give that windfall, ill-gained profit back to the consumers from \nwhere it came.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from North Dakota. I know my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, has offered the \nlegislation in the other body. I think it was a bipartisan proposal \nthat she made over there on this issue. So again my compliments to \nSenator Dorgan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9625-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9625-S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes this \nafternoon if I could and express my sympathy and the sympathy of my \nfamily, I know the sympathy of all of us in this Chamber, to the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding that occurred \nparticularly in Louisiana. I thank the leadership for giving us an \nopportunity today to express ourselves as a national body about this \ndevastation that has occurred. There will be a lot of discussion about \nwhat happened, what did not happen, the shortcomings of our Government \nin responding in a timely fashion to this situation. But today is a \ntime to offer our prayers and our sincere and deep sympathies to those \nwho have suffered as much as they have.\n  There will be hearings next week. The President, I gather, has \nannounced an investigation at the executive branch level. I think an \nindependent investigation is probably the best way to proceed. Having \nthe Government investigate itself is interesting but not\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nalways the best way to get to the bottom of the information we ought to \nhave about what happened. Because we will have events like this--\nhopefully nothing of this magnitude--again. There will be other events \nthat require our Nation to respond far more expeditiously, far more \nthoughtfully, far more humanely than we did in this situation.\n  First, it obviously goes without saying that the thoughts and prayers \nof all of us and the entire country are with the people of the Gulf \nregion at this hour. This is a disaster of unspeakable and \nunprecedented proportions, and we are still struggling to comprehend \nthe magnitude of this event. Certainly the attacks of September 11, \n2001 come to mind in terms of the damage done to life and property.\n  At the same time the devastation wrought by this act of nature is \nquantitatively and qualitatively different. As we speak here this \nafternoon, an entire American city, between a half a million and a \nmillion people, is uninhabitable. Its mayor tells us it will remain in \nthat state for many months to come. Hundreds are believed to be dead \nand he predicts that the number will soar in the days to come--possibly \ninto the thousands.\n  In Mississippi over 100 are known dead. According to that State's \nGovernor, the destruction of the Gulf communities such as Biloxi, \nGulfport, and Bay St. Louis is nearly total. Let me be clear and repeat \nwhat I said. I said destruction, not damage. Thousands of homes and \nplaces of business are a total loss and will have to be completely \nrebuilt in the coming months. I know that our colleague, Senator Lott \nof Mississippi, lost his own home. Nearly a million homes in his State \nhave been without power for days.\n  In Alabama more than 400,000 homes and businesses have lost power. \nMobile and the surrounding environs suffered severe flooding. In \nwestern Florida the situation is similar. The Presiding Officer \ncertainly knows of what I speak. Hundreds of thousands were without \npower and with scant access to the basic necessities of life--clean \nwater, sanitary facilities, food, and shelter.\n  The upshot of all this destruction and damage is that millions of our \nfellow American citizens are now literally refugees in their own \ncountry.\n  We don't like to use the word refugee and I certainly have stayed \naway from it. But as you watch pictures of people walking along \nrailroad tracks, along highways, of people perched on rooftops waiting \npatiently for aid, and enduring deprivation that we have never seen in \nthis country on such an immediate and immense scale as we have in this \nevent, then certainly the word refugee is appropriate in these \ncircumstances.\n  We are receiving reports of looting, shooting, and chaos that has \ninterfered with rescue and relief efforts. We all struggle to remember \na comparable amount of destitution and destruction in our Nation. And \nso far we struggle in vain in that effort. We cannot believe what we \nare seeing is taking place in our own Nation, our beloved America. \nNothing like this has ever happened in the United States.\n  And we are reminded as well that America is not a loose collection of \nStates or regions. We are a single indivisible nation. What happens in \none State or region is felt all across our country in the concerns of \nloved ones, the charitable contributions, and the secondary \ndeprivations that all Americans will experience as a result of this \ncatastrophe.\n\n  The Gulf region is a principal source of domestic and foreign goods \nthat are consumed by all of us--natural gas, oil, lumber, poultry, \ncoffee, and bananas. It is the departure point for the export of \nbillions of dollars worth of goods made in our own Nation--corn, \nsoybeans, wheat, and other commodities.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers tells us it could take as long as 6 \nmonths to drain the water from the basin in which the city of New \nOrleans lies. It will take months if not years before that city and \nother areas damaged by this hurricane and flood return to some \nsemblance of normalcy. The aid package we considered last Thursday \nevening is the first installment of emergency aid for the national \nGovernment but by no means will it be the last. This Senator pledges \nhis support for delivering all appropriate aid as expeditiously as \npossible to those in need in the gulf region. This is a time requiring \nunity and urgent action.\n  There will be a time, as I said earlier, in the days and weeks to \ncome to examine what went wrong. And a lot went wrong before as well as \nafter this hurricane and flood.\n  Our citizens are already asking the tough questions about what we \ncould have done to prevent the full extent of this tragedy. They are \noutraged, not just in the Gulf area. I spent yesterday in my home State \nof Connecticut. I went to the State armory in that city to help \norganize food assistance packages that were being shipped to the Gulf \nregion. I can tell you people in the city of Hartford, as well as \npeople throughout my State are outraged and appalled by what they saw \nas incompetence and indifference at the very highest levels of our \nnational Government. And I think they are right to be incensed and to \ndemand better action and answers to what occurred.\n  They want to know why there has been a 44-percent cut in funds for \nflood prevention in New Orleans since 2001, even though a 2001 FEMA \nreport told us that a hurricane flooding New Orleans was one of the \nthree most likely major disasters facing the United States, along with \na terrorist attack in the city of New York.\n  Citizens want to know why the administration, despite promising there \nwould be no net loss of wetlands, has allowed their development, \nincluding those in the Gulf region, which are better flood prevention \nmechanisms than any dam or levy built by man.\n  Citizens all across this country want to know why, despite knowing \nfor days before the hurricane that it could cause major devastation, it \ntook so long for the Federal agencies to mobilize relief, rescue, and \nlaw and order operations.\n  Citizens want to know all across our Nation whether nationwide spikes \nin the price of gasoline are normal under these circumstances or the \nresult of price gouging by unscrupulous profiteers who always stand \nready to take advantage of tragedy. And they want to know that our \nPresident and Attorney General are doing everything possible to prevent \nprice gouging.\n  These are very important issues--not the only ones--but they are some \nof the ones being asked by our fellow citizens at this very hour.\n  As I said a moment ago, now is the time for us to pull together as a \nnation to support one another, to do what we can to help the people of \nthe Gulf region get their lives back to some semblance of normalcy.\n  Eight days after the hurricane first hit the gulf region and 9 days \nafter it became a storm stronger than the New Orleans levees could \nhold, there are still critical needs that must be addressed \nimmediately.\n  Right now as we speak here today in this Chamber, New Orleans is \ncoated with a layer of toxic sewage that endangers the health of both \nthose left stranded and the relief workers themselves. It has been \nestimated that there are thousands of bodies that have yet to be \nrecovered on the streets and bayous of Jefferson Parish. There are \npublic safety concerns. There is not enough food and water. And the \ncity remains without power.\n  They need our help now, and they need more than the direct assistance \nwe have just begun to deliver. Last week, as I mentioned earlier, this \nbody approved over $10 billion in emergency aid. That is a fraction of \nwhat will be required in the coming months and years to rebuild the \nlives and communities affected by this tragedy.\n  Our first concern must, of course, be the health of those who still \nremain.\n  We need to guarantee all displaced victims access to comprehensive \nhealth care coverage, to Medicaid, including waiving residency, assets, \nand copayments requirements. Those who survive remain at great risk for \nillness and disease. They need and deserve medical care.\n  We need to provide resources to help the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention and local public health authorities monitor and respond \nto disease outbreaks and to help treat victims. We need to work closely \nwith the pharmaceutical industry to get badly needed medication to \nthese affected areas.\n  We need to make sure that this is a long-term effort. We must provide \nfunding for continued monitoring of\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\nthose in the region, as exposure to environmental hazards could have \nlifelong consequences.\n  We should invest in the public safety net and support mental health \nproviders to help victims cope emotionally with the disaster. We need \nto offer Federal support for communities and tax incentives for \nindividuals to incorporate displaced victims.\n  We also must provide basic services and support for those who now \nliterally live as refugees in other States.\n  The New Orleans school district has been decimated. Only 2,500 of the \n7,000 employees have been accounted for. The central office has been \ndestroyed, and all of the school records in New Orleans are gone.\n  Thankfully, there are over 30 cities that have stepped forward to \ntake in the 20,000 children who have so far been identified as in need.\n  We have to get direct financial assistance to the school districts \nabsorbing these students so they can adequately care for them in \naddition to the students they already serve.\n  We also must provide financial assistance for college students as \nthey relocate to other universities and provide incentives for those \nuniversities that have already offered students a new home.\n  And we must make sure that victims are not penalized by rules, \nregulations, and responsibilities that may work well under normal \ncircumstances but can be debilitating in times of an emergency.\n  We should waive income requirements for Head Start displaced \nchildren. We should give States that have offered childcare to refugees \nflexibility on their subsidy payments. And we should waive TANF work \nrequirements for victims of the hurricane and flood.\n  We should also offer tax relief to victims so they can begin \nrebuilding their lives and expand and extend unemployment assistance so \nthey can get back on their feet more quickly.\n  We should mobilize volunteers through AmeriCorps and other \norganizations in a unified rebuilding effort. And we should encourage \nprivate industry to participate with their own resources and expertise.\n  We also need to guarantee that the brave military personnel who \ncontinue to carry out operations in the gulf region with characteristic \nprecision and professionalism will have all the resources that they \nneed.\n  Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard crews rescued over 22,000 people in \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, but we are not properly supporting \nthem, in my view. Their costs in both operations and reconstruction are \nestimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and they are being \nforced to divert funds from their already strapped 2005 accounts. This \nshould be simply unacceptable to all of us.\n  We also must start discussing long-term solutions. We must be \nprepared as a nation to prevent or mitigate the effects of tragedies of \nthis magnitude. We must invest in viable and sufficient flood control \nprojects. We must examine building codes to consider if they can be \nstrengthened to limit damage in the future. Perhaps most importantly, \nwe must develop disaster relief plans throughout our Nation so that we \nwill not again be caught off guard as we were this time.\n  We must restore the ability of the Federal Government to respond to a \ndisaster of this magnitude whether manmade or natural.\n  During the 1990s, FEMA evolved to fulfill this role and demonstrated \nthrough several disasters its ability and confidence, I might add, to \nquickly mobilize resources and other aspects of relief efforts. By all \naccounts, that is no longer the case. We should consider whether FEMA \nshould be made a Cabinet level agency and whether there are other steps \nthat the national Government can take so that in the future we can \nfully mobilize our resources to respond to national catastrophes.\n  I am also going to revisit shortly, when the appropriations bills \ncome up, what I have recommended on three different occasions, along \nwith my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, to fully fund the \nfirst responders. It was strongly recommended by our former colleague, \nWarren Rudman, who, along with a very distinguished commission financed \nand supported by the Council on Foreign Relations, reported that we \nshould be spending some $20 billion every year for 5 years to see to it \nthat we have the adequate resources in place to respond.\n  Now, they were talking about a terrorist attack when they talked \nabout first responders. They did not have in mind natural disasters of \nthis magnitude. But clearly we need to anticipate both. We have \nnarrowly lost that amendment on three different occasions. But I would \nhope in light of what has occurred in the Gulf region of our own Nation \nover the last week and a half that we would be able to find the \nnecessary support to see to it that our first responders in this \ncountry have the tools, the equipment, and the preparation so that we \nnever ever again find ourselves in this situation, ill prepared to \nrespond to a crisis of this kind.\n  Lastly, I want to pay a little special tribute to my own \nconstituency. As I mentioned a few moments ago, I spent a good part \nlate yesterday morning at the armory in Hartford, CT, where people in \nmy office were gathering these supplies to send down to the gulf \nregion. It was Labor Day, and I went over half expecting there might be \na handful of people there to process and handle the contributions. \nThere were hundreds of people there. It was really rather an emotional \nmoment to drive up and see literally hundreds of people, volunteers \nfrom various churches and organizations in my State, gathering the \nmaterials. There was a line of automobiles that went around the block \nseveral times. People with their families in the car, with young \nchildren, arrived, opened up their trunks and the backs of their cars, \nand pulled out food, clothing, supplies of all kinds to be delivered to \nthe victims of Katrina in the Gulf region. And then to watch volunteers \nsorting it out, packaging it up again. This was at one armory. Today \nthey are opened up across the State, and again we are seeing the same \nreaction today--literally thousands of people pouring out in our small \nState of Connecticut to provide assistance. What I know is that it is \noccurring all across the country.\n  While we are talking about the failures of Government to respond \nwell, how proud all of us ought to be in this Chamber of our fellow \ncitizens because they are not sitting down. They are reacting. They are \ninvolved in telethons and charitable giving, doing everything they can \nto assist the people of the Gulf region. It is a great picture of \nAmerica. It is what all of us believe about our country. In moments \nlike this I did not hear a person in Connecticut talk about the South \nor southerners or differences in red States and blue States. I watched \ngood people in the city of Hartford, CT, doing everything they can to \nhelp out people in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. That is our \nAmerica. That is the country we represent, and we are all deeply proud \nof our fellow citizens. We will get through this. We will put these \npeople back on their feet again, but we need to be better prepared so \nwe can minimize the kind of hardship that these communities have \nsuffered through in the last 10 days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my \ncolleagues in offering my support and sympathy and certainly everything \nwe can do from my home State of Washington to so many of our fellow \nAmericans who are suffering so tragically from the outfall of Hurricane \nKatrina. I want them to know we will do everything we can to make sure \nwe are there for them.\n  I have to say that over the past week, citizens from this end of the \ncountry to my end of the country on the west coast have been glued to \ntheir television screens and really overwhelmed by the tremendous \ndevastation and the unfathomable suffering of so many of our fellow \nAmericans. The images have become almost too much to bear, watching \nfamilies without food and water, people who have been trapped on their \nroofs, people searching for their loved ones. People have come up to me \neverywhere when I have gone through my State over the last week. My \noffice has been inundated by calls from my fellow citizens in \nWashington State who are really horrified at the conditions they have \nseen on TV. They are asking, rightfully, what can we do to help and how \ncan we be there for our\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\ncitizens? They are reaching into their own pockets and doing everything \nthey can, and that truly has been heartwarming to see.\n  They are also asking, How could this have happened? I have to say \nthat people in my home State are upset and, really, with good reason. \nOur Government failed in its initial response. We now have to see that \nwe succeed in this ongoing recovery. That certainly is my focus right \nnow.\n  There is going to be a lot of time for hard questions and \naccountability, but I think today we need to focus on meeting the \ntremendous needs that rescue workers and our guard and police forces \nare meeting on the ground. We also need to recognize that the recovery \narea is now no longer just limited to the gulf coast. As Americans have \nopened their hearts and their homes and they have opened up their \ncommunities and their stadiums and their hospitals and their homes in \ntowns and cities from coast to coast, that need has spread across the \ncountry.\n  Shortly, in my home State of Washington, we are expecting to welcome \n2,000 evacuees. Nearly 200 of them are going to arrive by this \nThursday, and we need to make sure we are doing everything and being \nprepared to meet their needs as they come to our States. Right now we \nhave to ensure that the evacuees have the bare essentials, that they \nhave food, clothing, and shelter. We also have to make sure we are \npreparing for the long term.\n  For most children in this country, as we all know, this week marks a \nvery exciting time, the beginning of the school year, a time that they \nhead off to meet their new teachers and reconnect with old friends and \nmake new ones. For all of the children who have been displaced from \ntheir homes and their school districts by the effects of Hurricane \nKatrina, the beginning of the school year is really the least of their \nworries. But we will need to come together as a country to help these \nschools across the Nation that are taking in these students from the \ngulf coast.\n  I just heard on the television before I came here that there will be \nprobably 200,000 or more of these young students, and we have to do \neverything we can to absorb the costs and help the transition for these \nchildren and families, to make it as smooth as possible.\n  We also need to make sure we pay special attention to funding for \nsupport for homeless and foster children and ensure that the most \nvulnerable among us have the support they need to succeed and to build \nbrighter futures again.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many different sectors of our \ntransportation system have also stepped up to the plate to deliver \ncritical service, and because this region's infrastructure is so \ndevastated we need to immediately explore alternatives to moving people \nand freight throughout the region. I think we all know it is going to \ntake time to get our transportation infrastructure back to where it \nwas, but we need to start concentrating on that and getting systems put \nin place now as well.\n  Rest assured, I will be asking very hard questions in the days to \ncome about what went wrong and what we need to do to ensure that \nAmericans never endure such preventable suffering again. All of those \nquestions will be explored in detail, but right now I am going to \ncontinue to make sure that we are providing the immediate support that \nour families and our communities again need. Once again, I just want to \nsay my thoughts and my prayers go out to everyone who has been touched \nby this disaster.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois who has been down in the region is \non the floor with us. I look forward to hearing about his firsthand \nexperience as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to address what has been a \nheartbreaking week for all of us. As was mentioned by my distinguished \ncolleague from Washington, I just returned from a trip from Houston \nwith former Presidents Clinton and Bush as part of a fund-raising \neffort to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As we wandered \nthrough the crowd, we heard in very intimate terms some of the heart-\nwrenching stories that all of us have witnessed on television over the \npast several days: Mothers separated from their babies; adults mourning \nthe loss of elderly parents; descriptions of the heat, filth, and fear \nof the Superdome and of the convention center in New Orleans.\n  There was an overriding sense of relief in Houston, and the officials \nin Houston and in the entire State of Texas deserve great credit for \nthe outstanding job they have done in creating a clean and stable place \nfor the tens of thousands of families who have been displaced.\n  A conversation I had with one woman captured the realities that are \nsettling into the families as they face the future. She said to me: We \nhad nothing before the hurricane, and now we have less than nothing. We \nhad nothing before the hurricane, now we have less than nothing.\n  In the coming weeks, as the images of the immediate crisis fade and \nthis Chamber becomes consumed with other matters, we will be hearing a \nlot about lessons learned and steps to be taken. I will be among those \nvoices who will be calling for action. In the most immediate term, we \nwill have to assure that the efforts at evacuating families from the \naffected States proceed--they are not finished yet--that these \nAmericans who are having to flee their homes, their cities, their \ncounties, and their towns are fed, clothed, housed, and provided with \nthe medical care and medicine they need.\n  We are also going to have to make sure we cut through the redtape \nthat has inexcusably prevented so much help from getting to the places \nwhere it is needed. I can say from personal experience over the last \nweek how frustrating it has been, how unconscionable it has been to be \nunable to find somebody in charge so that we can get medical supplies, \ndoctors, nurses, and other supplies down to the affected areas quickly \nenough.\n  We are going to have to make sure in this Chamber that any \nimpediments that may continue to exist in preventing relief efforts \nfrom moving forward rapidly are eliminated.\n  Once we stabilize the situation, this country is going to face the \nenormous challenge in providing stability for displaced families over \nthe months and years that it is going to take to rebuild. Already the \nState of Illinois has committed to accepting 10,000 displaced families. \nThere are stories in Illinois, as there are all across the country, of \nchurches, mosques, synagogues, and individual families welcoming people \nwith open arms and no strings attached.\n  Indeed, if there is any bright light that has come out of this \ndisaster, it is the degree to which ordinary Americans have responded \nwith speed and determination, even as their Government has responded \nwith what I consider to be unconscionable ineptitude, which brings me \nto the next point. Once the situation is stable, once families are \nsettled for at least the short term, once children are reunited with \ntheir parents and enrolled in school and the wounds both on the outside \nand on the inside have healed, we are going to have to do some hard \nthinking about how we could have failed our fellow citizens so badly \nand how we will prevent such failures from ever occurring again.\n  It is not politics to insist that we have an independent commission \nto examine these issues. It is not politics. Indeed, one of the \nheartening things about this crisis has been the degree of outrage that \nhas come from across the political spectrum--from across races, across \nincomes; the degree to which the American people sense that we can and \nwe must do better, and a recognition that if we can't cope with a \ncrisis that has been predicted for decades, a crisis in which we were \ngiven 4 to 5 days' notice, then how can we ever hope to respond to a \nserious terrorist attack in a major American city in which there is no \nnotice and in which the death toll and the panic and the fear may be \nfar greater?\n\n  That brings me to my final point. There has been a lot of attention \nin the media about the fact that those who were left behind in New \nOrleans were disproportionately poor and disproportionately African \nAmerican. I have said publicly that I do not subscribe to the notion \nthat the painfully slow response of FEMA and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity was somehow racially based. I do not agree with that. I think \nthe ineptitude was colorblind.\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\n  But what must be said is that whoever was in charge of planning and \npreparing for the worst-case scenario seemed to assume that every \nAmerican has the capacity to load up the family in a SUV, fill it up \nwith $100 worth of gasoline, stick some bottled water in the trunk, and \nuse a credit card to check into a hotel on safe ground. I see no \nevidence of active malice, but I see a continuation of passive \nindifference on the part of our Government toward the least of us.\n  So I hope that out of this crisis we all begin to reflect--Democrats \nand Republicans, Black and White, young and old, poor and wealthy. I \nhope we all begin to reflect, not only on our individual \nresponsibilities to our families and ourselves but on our mutual \nresponsibilities to our fellow Americans, mutual responsibilities that \nreflect themselves in church and community organizations and block \nclubs but also express themselves through our Government.\n  I hope we realize the people of New Orleans were not just abandoned \nduring the hurricane, they were abandoned long ago--to murder and \nmayhem in their streets, to substandard schools, to dilapidated \nhousing, to inadequate health care, to a pervasive sense of \nhopelessness.\n  That is the deeper shame of this past week, that it has taken a \ncrisis such as this to awaken in us the understanding of the great \ndivide that continues to fester in our midst. That is what all \nAmericans are truly ashamed about. That is what I am ashamed about. And \nthe fact that we are ashamed about it is a good sign. The fact that all \nof us don't like to see such a reflection of this country that we love \ntells me that the American people have better instincts and a broader \nheart than our current politics would indicate. ``We had nothing before \nthe hurricane,'' the woman told me. ``Now we have even less.'' I hope \nwe all take the time to ponder the truth of that message.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to extend my deepest sympathies and \nstrongest possible support for the people of America's Gulf Coast \nregion, which was devastated by the terrible forces of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  In the aftermath of the worst natural disaster in the history of the \nUnited States, we continue our attempt to comprehend the magnitude of \nthe losses that have occurred--most especially all those who have lost \ntheir lives, lost livelihoods, and virtually all their physical \npossessions. The scale of the destruction is most horrifically \nreflected in the faces of those we have seen over the past week--faces \netched with an indelible and almost unimaginable sorrow, suffering, and \nburden, and their images have reverberated throughout a country in \nsolidarity with their terrible plight. Indeed, there are colleagues in \nthis very body who have endured horrendous loss, and my thoughts and \nprayers go out to them as well.\n  In Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida lives have been \nforever transformed along with the landscape, as we have witnessed \nuntold scenes of homes that no longer exist; floods that ravage entire \nneighborhoods and cities; fires that consume what remains of buildings, \nmen, women, children, and the elderly seeking food, water, and \nmedicine--as well as missing loved ones.\n  The cities of New Orleans, Biloxi, Gulf Port, Pascagula, and so many \nothers have sustained injuries almost beyond belief. America and the \nworld have been stunned by the cruelty of the tragic effects of this \nstorm. At the same time, we are also hearing the stories of those who \nhave rushed to the aid of our fellow Americans in need--men and women \nof the National Guard and the U.S. Armed Services, paramedics, doctors, \npolice men and women, volunteers from all walks of life. And as chair \nof the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, I \nespecially thank the selfless commitment of the people of the Coast \nGuard, who have rescued at least 32,000 thousand individuals find have \nserved with the greatest heroism and honor.\n\n  To the people of the Gulf region: You do not stand alone in your pain \nand frustration. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that essential \nitems, medical care, and shelter are provided in a timely fashion, \nwherever and whenever they are needed. I am pleased the Congress passed \na $10.5 billion emergency spending bill to move the Gulf region toward \nrecovery, and there should be no question that as additional resources \nare required, they will be provided. It is only with the full weight of \nthe Federal Government that the entire region will not only endure, but \nrecover. And as chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, I will \nleave no stone unturned in identifying resources and services that can \nhelp bring such a recovery to fruition.\n  I also believe that, looking forward, it is critical to examine and \nassess what steps might have been taken not only to diminish the impact \nof the hurricane, but also to respond appropriately in its aftermath. \nWe must determine how we, as a nation, could have been better prepared. \nWe owe that not only to those who will face potential catastrophes in \nthe future, but also to all those who have died and those suffering \ntoday from Katrina's swathe of devastation.\n  In the end, no human or natural act can deprive Americans of their \nunyielding and singularly determined spirit, and that truth has once \nagain demonstrated itself in the hearts of the people of the Gulf Coast \nas well as the millions of acts of kindness and compassion that have \nmanifested themselves throughout America in Katrina's wake. We also \nappreciate the outpouring of sympathy and support expressed by many \nnations and their people throughout the world. Grief and humanity, hope \nand caring truly know no political boundaries. This is a tragedy for \nall of humankind, a wound to our world, but it is one from which we \nwill, in time, recover to the fullest extent possible.\n  All of our will and our resources as one of the wealthiest nations on \nearth must and will be brought to bear over what will be a long but \nultimately triumphant process of reclaiming our Gulf Coast towns and \ncities for the future. As we all work toward that common goal, we do so \nhand-in-hand with all those for whom we are praying and keeping in our \nthoughts.\n  While the hurricane's winds and rain have long since dissipated, the \ncollective concern and strength of this Nation continues ever onward--\nunbroken, undaunted, unflagging. Our message to the people of the Gulf \nCoast is both simple and solemn: Your country will be with you every \nstep of the way, and that is our promise to you in this most difficult \nand desperate of times and forever forward from this day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to again express my deepest \nsympathies to all those who have suffered so much because of Hurricane \nKatrina and its aftereffects. This past week has seen destruction and \nmisery on a scale perhaps not witnessed before in the United States. \nWords simply cannot describe it.\n  Americans have responded to this tragedy in typical fashion with \nuntold acts of kindness and selflessness. Many who have lost everything \nthemselves have worked without sleep and in terrible conditions to help \nthose who cannot help themselves. The Coast Guard and military saved \nthousands stranded on rooftops. People have volunteered their services \nand their homes and have donated generously. Companies both large and \nsmall have also stepped up to help, as has the international community. \nIn my own State of Wisconsin, we have mobilized and deployed almost 500 \nmembers of the National Guard. First responders and rescue workers have \ntraveled to the stricken areas to help, people are preparing shelters \nfor those who have been displaced, and people are opening their \npocketbooks. I deeply admire and respect all of these acts of heroism \nand generosity. And as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I want to express my sincere thanks to the many in the \ninternational community who have come forward with their own offers of \nhelp, and their words of support and solidarity.\n  Unfortunately, these acts of heroism and compassion starkly contrast \nwith the inadequacy of the response to this major national disaster. \nThousands desperate for help were left stranded as the relief effort \nslowly sputtered into action. Empty assurances and high-level excuses \nwere no comfort to those stuck in overcrowded and unsafe shelters or to \nthose who were desperate for medicine. It is shocking and \ndisappointing, to say the least, that 4\n\n[[Page S9630]]\n\nyears of efforts to supposedly improve our emergency response \ncapabilities fell so short. We have devoted countless hours, and tens \nof billions of taxpayer dollars, to Homeland Security since 9/11. But \nthe American people have not gotten an adequate return for this massive \ninvestment.\n  We must do all we can to help the residents of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama get back on their feet and rebuild their homes \nand their lives. These Americans will need our resolve and our \npartnership long after the headlines fade.\n  In addition it is of the utmost importance that there be a thorough \nand independent review of the response to Hurricane Katrina in order to \nidentify failures and improve our emergency response system and \ncapabilities. I pledge to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that those responsible for costly failures are held \naccountable, and to ensure that we learn from this tragedy. We must \nface up to the searing and shameful images of American families being \nleft to fend for themselves in increasingly desperate circumstances, \nand we must ensure that we never see such images again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be voting on a \nresolution expressing our deep and heartfelt sympathy for the victims \nof Hurricane Katrina. I know I speak for all when I say that the Senate \nand the American people stand by the good people of Alabama, Louisiana, \nand Mississippi who have suffered so deeply and who have lost so much. \nWe are committed to helping them recover and rebuild. Last Thursday \nnight, we passed $10.5 billion in aid, but this is just the \ndownpayment. There is still much hard work ahead.\n  One of our most important and pressing duties is to conduct a \nthorough investigation from top to bottom of the initial emergency \nresponse. There is no question that in many places the early emergency \nresponse was simply unacceptable. No one who saw the news and the \nmounting discomfort and despair at the Superdome and the convention \ncenter could say otherwise. We need to find out what went wrong and \nwhat went right, and we will. We need to find out what we need to do so \nwe are never, ever caught unprepared again.\n  As I mentioned this morning, I traveled to the gulf coast this \nweekend, not as a Senator but as a volunteer physician. A major problem \nI saw firsthand was a very basic one, one of communications. It is so \nironic, and this is why it is so important that we provide the \noversight, because Congress has appropriated funds for communications \nand for the interoperability of communications, but I didn't see any of \nthat on the ground. People worked without functioning radios when I \narrived, and literally within that large terminal and one of the large \nmain rooms there, people could not communicate from one side of that \nroom to the other. Doctors and nurses had to use runners to shuttle \nthrough the airport. It simply did not make sense. It does not make \nsense in America.\n  Many other challenges I saw we will be addressing on the floor of the \nSenate in the appropriate oversight mechanism. Our full attention at \nthis juncture needs to be directed to saving lives. The President has \nstated this again and again. Literally as we speak here today, there \nare people in those second and third floors of homes who have not yet \nbeen rescued. Every major city houses the poor and the elderly and the \ninfirm, and every American city is a potential target of a disaster or \nan attack, either natural or otherwise. There can be no excuses for \ninaction.\n  Senator Susan Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman, the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, have announced their oversight hearings. Again, our \nattention needs to be on saving and sustaining those people who are \nsuffering as we speak, but at the same time we have a mechanism that is \nunderway to begin our very serious, very important responsibility of \noversight as to what did not go well and what needs to go much better \nin the future.\n  I do want to assure the American people that the Senate is hard at \nwork. We have rolled up our sleeves. We began with the passage of the \n$10.5 billion the other night. It is very likely that in very short \norder, we will have a much larger supplemental come through, maybe \nwithin the next several days, on the Senate floor, and it will require \nyet another supplemental funding bill in the future. We are determined \nthat New Orleans, where I was Saturday and Sunday; or Biloxi, where I \nwas on Sunday; or Mobile, also on Sunday--really that entire coast--\nwill recover and that we will rebuild in a way that is bigger and \nbetter and stronger. That is the future to which we are committed.\n  We have many hurdles to face in the meantime, and we will address \nthose aggressively. We faced urban disasters in our history. As former \nSpeaker Gingrich said in the last couple of days: A large chunk of \nChicago was burned all the way to the ground, and it came back stronger \nthan ever. He also mentioned San Francisco, leveled by an earthquake \nonly to reemerge a\n\n[[Page S9631]]\n\nmuch more beautiful and more prosperous city. America has never shied \nfrom a challenge. We are a nation of people who have come to these \nshores to work hard and to dream big. It is in our national DNA. It is \nwhat makes us great.\n  This weekend, I saw the incredible generosity and caring and \ncompassion and outpouring among volunteers and military personnel and \nGuard personnel and medical and health professionals from all over the \ncountry--citizens helping one another, patients in adjacent gurneys \nhelping one another, pouring out their hearts and their time and their \nresources. It was humbling and it was inspiring.\n  I am confident that together we will meet the challenges that lie \nahead and emerge more prosperous and more united than ever.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 233) expressing the condolences of \n     the Nation to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, commending \n     the resiliency of the people of the States of Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Alabama, and committing to stand by them in \n     the relief and recovery efforts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For 33 years, Justice Rehnquist was a fixture on the \nCourt, and he demonstrated both a love and a respect for the \ninstitution. He led the Judicial Conference of the United States with \ndistinction, advocating for judicial independence during this 18-year \ntenure as Chief Justice.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier who attended \nhigh school in Indianapolis and whose family resides in Martinsville. \nJeremy Doyle, 24 years old, died on August 18 when his vehicle was \nstruck by a roadside bomb in Samarra, Iraq. With so much of his life \nleft before him, Jeremy risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Although he did not call Martinsville home, Jeremy's impact on the \ntown was demonstrated by the hundreds of families who lined the town's \nstreets for 3\\1/2\\ miles as his funeral procession wound through \ndowntown. At the funeral, family members remembered Jeremy as a \njokester and a soldier who deeply loved his family and the U.S. \nmilitary. A commander of an armored humvee, Jeremy was on his second \ntour of duty in Iraq having returned to Iraq after being slightly \nwounded last spring while he tried to deactivate an explosive. His \nuncle told the crowd gathered at Jeremy's funeral service: [Jeremy] \nwill forever be my hero. I stand here today to express the same \nfeelings of pride and gratitude for this young man's sacrifices and \nthose made by his family on behalf of our country.\n  Jeremy was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, stationed at \nFort Wayne, GA. This brave young soldier leaves behind his wife, Leah \nMcGinnis Doyle.\n  Today, I join Jeremy's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jeremy, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jeremy was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jeremy will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jeremy's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here. This statement is \njust as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that \nthe impact of Jeremy's actions will live on far longer than any record \nof these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jeremy Doyle in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Jeremy's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said: He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jeremy.\n\n\n                     Army Sergeant Michael Schafer\n\n  Mr. President, with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude I wish \nto honor the life of a brave soldier from Crown Point. Michael Schafer, \n25 years old, died on July 25 from enemy gunfire on a quick reaction \nforce mission in Oruzgan, Afghanistan. With so much of his life left \nbefore him, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A generous and humorous man, Michael enlisted in the military \nfollowing high school and re-enlisted 2 years ago. In joining the \nmilitary, Michael continued a family tradition, as his father, Mark, \nserved in the Navy. He was among the paratroopers who jumped into \nnorthern Iraq in March 2003 at the start of the war. Upon the \ncompletion of his time in the Army, Michael dreamed of becoming a \npolice officer. A true believer in the cause of freedom, Michael often \ntold his family that he loved what he was doing. His family recounted \nto a local newspaper their pride in Michael and his habit of putting \nothers before himself. I stand here today to express the same feelings \nof pride and gratitude for this young Hoosier's sacrifices and those \nmade by his family on behalf of our country.\n  Michael was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, \nVicenza, Italy. This brave young soldier leaves behind his wife, \nDanielle, and their adopted son.\n  Today, I join Michael's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace.

I want the Senate and the American people to know about \nthis extraordinary young woman who served us all so well.\n  Laura was my Web designer, in charge of my Senate Web site. Over the \npast several years, she transformed ``boxer.senate.gov'' from a simple, \nnondescript Web page to a modern, cutting-edge site that has won awards \nfor its clean look, comprehensive content, and accessibility.\n  Today thousands of Californians visit this site every week to get up-\nto-date information, express their opinions, and obtain help from my \noffice and Government agencies. Laura's many additions to the site \nincluded video updates from California and the Senate floor, contests \nfor kids on Earth Day and the Fourth of July, and dozens of links to \nother sites providing news, information, and assistance.\n  Laura was not only a tremendous asset to my staff; she was also a joy \nto work with. She was smart, funny, and most of all big hearted. She \nwas both tech wise and user friendly, always willing to share her \nknowledge and expertise. In our Los Angeles office, she organized great \npotluck lunches where she cooked well, ate prodigiously, and shared her \neclectic taste in music of all kinds--good, bad, and strange.\n  A truly urban Angeleno, Laura lived in a downtown LA loft and \nrecently led her new husband James and their wedding party on a \ncandlelight procession through the center city.\n  Laura was a highly skilled and devoted public servant who believed \nthat technology can and should add to our understanding of Government \nand give more people the opportunity to participate in our democracy. I \ndeeply appreciate her service to the Senate and the people of \nCalifornia.\n  I know Members will join me in honoring the memory of Laura Esguerra \nAdams and sending our thoughts and prayers to her husband, family, and \nmany dear friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9632-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9632-S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THOMAS A.

He was elected to IIABA's executive \ncommittee in September 1999, and was installed as the organization's \npresident last October. Tom is an executive with the Cogswell Agency in \nGreat Falls, MT.\n  During Tom's year as president, IIABA accomplished a number of \nmilestone achievements.

It continued its momentum in the area of agency \ntechnology and paid off the mortgage on its headquarters in Alexandria, \nVA.\n  Tom has been active on all levels of the insurance industry \nthroughout his career. From his service as the Independent Insurance \nAgents of Montana representative, to the chairman of the national IIABA \nfinance committee, Tom has exhibited great vision and direction for \nthis organization. On the local level, he twice served as president of \nthe Independent Insurance Agents of Great Falls.\n  Tom's experience has not been limited to leadership roles alone. He \nalso has proven instrumental in various insurance industry education \nefforts throughout his career, and taught many professional \naccreditation classes. I also value Tom's commitment to his community. \nHe is active in church and professional organizations, from Optimist \nInternational, to the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Boy \nScouts.\n  I sincerely thank Tom for his efforts on behalf of IIABA and the \npositive impact his efforts have had on this organization and his \ncommunity back home in Great Falls, MT.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize a wonderful Californian, Alan Bergman, in \nhonor of his 80th birthday. Few in the world today have brought so much \npleasure, joy, and insight to so many as have Alan and his wife \nMarilyn.\n  Alan Bergman was born on September 11, 1925, in Brooklyn, NY. He had \nan ear for music at a young age--at age 10, he knew he wanted to be a \nsongwriter. After studying at the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill and the University of California at Los Angeles, Alan moved \nto Philadelphia. There, he worked as a director for children's \ntelevision shows, and moonlighted as a songwriter. He soon moved back \nto Los Angeles at the urging of his mentor, Johnny Mercer, to work full \ntime on his budding songwriting career.\n  In Los Angeles, Alan met Marilyn Keith. Alan and Marilyn hit it off \nright away, and Alan knew that in Marilyn he had a friend and a musical \npartner. Alan also knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life \nwith this remarkable woman. And in 1958, Alan and Marilyn were married. \nWith Marilyn's musical background, she and Alan were a perfect match. \nThey began to write lyrics together. It soon became evident that Alan \nand Marilyn Bergman were a powerful team, working on lyrics for \ntelevision shows and movies. In 1968, their efforts won them their \nfirst Oscar for ``The Windmills of Your Mind,'' the theme song from the \n``Thomas Crown Affair.''\n  There would be more recognition to come for the Bergmans, the only \nhusband-and-wife team of lyricists. In 1968, Alan and Marilyn also won \na Golden Globe Award for ``The Windmills of Your Mind.'' In 1973, Alan \nand Marilyn won two Emmys, an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe Award \nfor ``The Way We Were.'' In 1984, they won another Oscar for the score \nfor ``Yentl,'' and won Emmys for ``Sybil,'' ``Queen of the Stardust \nBallroom,'' ``Ordinary Miracles'' and ``A Ticket to Dream.'' And these \nare just a few of Alan and Marilyn's many awards.\n  In addition to these awards, Alan and Marilyn have received many \naccolades. Among others, they have been inducted into the Songwriters \nHall of Fame, and have received the National Academy of Songwriters \nLifetime Achievement Award, the Spanish Cultural Medal of Honor, and \nthe Governors Award from the National Association of Recording Arts and \nSciences. As president of the American Society of Composers, Authors \nand Publishers, Marilyn has worked with many in Congress, in a \nbipartisan way, to protect intellectual property rights.\n  Recently, Alan unveiled another one of his many talents--in addition \nto being a world-renowned songwriter, Alan is also a gifted singer. He \nhas performed shows across the country, from the Algonquin Hotel in New \nYork to the Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, showcasing the songs that he \nhas written with Marilyn.\n  When I met Alan and Marilyn in 1990, I knew that my life as a \npolitical leader would take on a new dimension. I was to learn that as \na human being I had been enriched beyond measure.\n  Alan and Marilyn's musical achievements throughout their lifetimes \nshow how exceedingly talented and gifted they are. Their success is a \nresult of their hard work and dedication.

Thanks to their \npetition, Congress, through a joint resolution on August 2, 1956, \nrequested that the President proclaim that September 17 through 23 \nserve as Constitution Week.\n  This week sets out to emphasize citizens' responsibilities for \nprotecting and defending the Constitution, inform people that the \nConstitution is the basis for America's great heritage, and encourage \nthe study of the historical events surrounding its framing in September \n1787.\n  I applaud the Daughters of the American Revolution for their \ncontinued dedication to celebrating the importance of the Constitution \nthrough education and activism. Moreover, I commend the Fort Miro \nChapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Monroe, LA, for \ndoing this fine work on behalf of the State of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9633-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9633-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9633-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9633-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9634-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9634-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING THE ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of September 1, 2005, a message from the \nHouse of Representatives, delivered by one of its clerks, announced \nthat the House has passed the following bill, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3645.

Convention Against Transnational Organized \n                     Crime (Exec. Rept. No. 109-4)\n\nThe Text of the Resolution of Ratification as Reported by the Committee \n   on Foreign Relations Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present \n                          concurring therein),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO RESERVATIONS, \n                   UNDERSTANDINGS, AND DECLARATIONS\n\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \n     Crime (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Convention'') and two supplementary protocols: the Protocol \n     to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \n     Especially Women and Children (hereinafter in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``Trafficking Protocol'') and the Protocol \n     Against Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air \n     (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Smuggling Protocol''), adopted by the United Nations \n     General Assembly on November 15, 2000 and signed by the \n     United States on December 13, 2000 at Palermo, Italy (T. Doc. \n     108-16), subject to the reservations, understandings, and \n     declarations of sections 2, 3 and 4.\n\n     SECTION 2. RESERVATIONS AND DECLARATION RELATIVE TO THE \n                   CONVENTION\n\n       (a) Reservations.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following reservations \n     relative to the Convention, which shall be included in the \n     United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America reserves the right to \n     assume obligations under the Convention in a manner \n     consistent with its fundamental principles of federalism, \n     pursuant to which both federal and state criminal laws must \n     be considered in relation to the conduct addressed in the \n     Convention. U.S. federal criminal law, which regulates \n     conduct based on its effect on interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or another federal interest, serves as the \n     principal legal regime within the United States for combating \n     organized crime, and is broadly effective for this purpose. \n     Federal criminal law does not apply in the rare case where \n     such criminal conduct does not so involve interstate or \n     foreign commerce, or another federal interest. There are a \n     small number of conceivable situations involving such rare \n     offenses of a purely local character where U.S. federal and \n     state criminal law may not be entirely adequate to satisfy an \n     obligation under the Convention. The United States of America \n     therefore reserves to the obligations set forth in the \n     Convention to the extent they address conduct which would \n     fall within this narrow category of highly localized \n     activity. This reservation does not affect in any respect the \n     ability of the United States to provide international \n     cooperation to other Parties as contemplated in the \n     Convention.\n       (2) The United States of America reserves the right not to \n     apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 15, \n     paragraph 1(b) with respect to the offenses established in \n     the Convention. The United States does not provide for \n     plenary jurisdiction over offenses that are committed on \n     board ships flying its flag or aircraft registered under its \n     laws. However, in a number of circumstances, U.S. law \n     provides for jurisdiction over such offenses committed on \n     board U.S.-flagged ships or aircraft registered under U.S. \n     law. Accordingly, the United States will implement paragraph \n     1(b) to the extent provided for under its federal law.\n       (3) In accordance with Article 35, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 35, paragraph 2.\n\n[[Page S9645]]\n\n       (b) Declaration.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following declaration \n     relative to the Convention:\n       The United States of America declares that, in view of its \n     federalism reservation, current United States law, including \n     the laws of the States of the United States, fulfills the \n     obligations of the Convention for the United States. \n     Accordingly, the United States of America does not intend to \n     enact new legislation to fulfill its obligations under the \n     Convention.\n\n     SECTION 3. RESERVATIONS, UNDERSTANDING, AND DECLARATION \n                   RELATIVE TO THE TRAFFICKING PROTOCOL\n\n       (a) Reservations.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following reservations \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America reserves the right not to \n     apply in part the obligation set forth in Article 15, \n     paragraph 1(b), of the United Nations Convention Against \n     Transnational Organized Crime with respect to the offenses \n     established in the Trafficking Protocol. The United States \n     does not provide for plenary jurisdiction over offenses that \n     are committed on board ships flying its flag or aircraft \n     registered under its laws. However, in a number of \n     circumstances, U.S. law provides for jurisdiction over such \n     offenses committed on board U.S.-flagged ships or aircraft \n     registered under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States \n     will implement paragraph 1(b) of the Convention to the extent \n     provided for under its federal law.\n       (2) The United States of America reserves the right to \n     assume obligations under this Protocol in a manner consistent \n     with its fundamental principles of federalism, pursuant to \n     which both federal and state criminal laws must be considered \n     in relation to conduct addressed in the Protocol. U.S. \n     federal criminal law, which regulates conduct based on its \n     effect on interstate or foreign commerce, or another federal \n     interest, such as the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of \n     ``slavery'' and ``involuntary servitude,'' serves as the \n     principal legal regime within the United States for combating \n     the conduct addressed in this Protocol, and is broadly \n     effective for this purpose. Federal criminal law does not \n     apply in the rare case where such criminal conduct does not \n     so involve interstate or foreign commerce, or otherwise \n     implicate another federal interest, such as the Thirteenth \n     Amendment. There are a small number of conceivable situations \n     involving such rare offenses of a purely local character \n     where U.S. federal and state criminal law may not be entirely \n     adequate to satisfy an obligation under the Protocol. The \n     United States of America therefore reserves to the \n     obligations set forth in the Protocol to the extent they \n     address conduct which would fall within this narrow category \n     of highly localized activity. This reservation does not \n     affect in any respect the ability of the United States to \n     provide international cooperation to other Parties as \n     contemplated in the Protocol.\n       (3) In accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3, the United \n     States of America declares that it does not consider itself \n     bound by the obligation set forth in Article 15, paragraph 2.\n       (b) Understanding.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following understanding \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol, which shall be included \n     in the United States instrument of ratification: The United \n     States of America understands the obligation to establish the \n     offenses in the Protocol as money laundering predicate \n     offenses, in light of Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the United \n     Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, as \n     requiring States Parties whose money laundering legislation \n     sets forth a list of specific predicate offenses to include \n     in such list a comprehensive range of offenses associated \n     with trafficking in persons.\n       (c) Declaration.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     under section 1 is subject to the following declaration \n     relative to the Trafficking Protocol: The United States of \n     America declares that, in view of its reservations, current \n     United States law, including the laws of the States of the \n     United States, fulfills the obligations of the Protocol for \n     the United States.

A bill to amend the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of \n1999 to extend the termination date for mandatory price reporting; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Harkin to introduce legislation today that would \nextend the termination date for mandatory price reporting.\n  Due in large part to concerned Iowa livestock producers, Congress \npassed the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act, LMPR, in 1999 to help \nimprove market transparency.\n  Since Mandatory Price Reporting was implemented by USDA in 2001, I \nhave heard from producers across Iowa who question the integrity and \naccountability of the reported prices under Mandatory Price Reporting \nunder this law.\n  While there is a lack of ``believability'' regarding the information \ngenerated by Mandatory Price Reporting, nearly all producers across \nIowa feel strongly that the information would be valuable if the \nprogram had more credibility and improved transparency.\n  Thanks to producer comments and dissatisfaction with the current \nprogram, Senator Harkin and I offered to initiate a Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, examination of the Mandatory Price \nReporting program.\n  I then conditioned my support of any multi-year extension or revision \nof Mandatory Price Reporting on the GAO study results.\n  Unfortunately, there is growing pressure from packers and ``packer \nlackeys'' to act before the GAO report is completed.\n  Under the auspice of ``consensus'' a number of groups serving packer \ninterests are pushing agendas contrary to the interests of Iowa's pork \nproducers and cattlemen.\n  The Iowa livestock community believes any congressional action before \nreceipt and review of the GAO report would be premature and ill-\nadvised.\n  The goal of re-authorization should be to improve the existing \nlegislation to the best of our ability based upon the best available \ninformation and analysis.\n  If the non-partisan GAO is not allowed to complete its work before \nthe law is re-authorized, Congress will be neglecting the opportunity \nto review and reflect upon an exhaustive study.\n  Let me be clear, livestock producers in Iowa do not think it is \nprudent to move forward without substantive review and potential \nimprovement of the current program. Only those entities that fear \ntransparency should be fighting for a 5 year extension with no \nconsideration for the GAO's pending conclusions.\n  The House Agriculture Committee passed out a five year extension and \nI hope they will take into consideration the remarks made by me today. \nI look forward to protecting the interests of family farmers and \nbelieve this another way of providing that protection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1614. A bill to extend the authorization of programs under the \nHigher Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 2005.\n  Education beyond high school and lifelong education opportunities are \nvital if we are to retain our competitive edge in the global economy \nand make every American a part of our Nation's success story. Our \nworkforce needs education and training that will\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\nmeet the demands of tomorrow's workplace.\n  Technology, demographics and diversity have brought far-reaching \nchanges to the U.S. economy and the workplace, including an increased \ndemand for a well-educated and highly skilled workforce. Those changes \nwill continue and the need for skilled workers will only increase in \nthe years to come.\n  The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is an important part \nof meeting these concerns. Today's students will become tomorrow's \nleaders, in the economy, in education, and in every other aspect of our \nsociety. A strong postsecondary education will be the key to their \nfuture success in those roles.\n  I am pleased to be introducing this legislation with my distinguished \ncolleague and ranking member of the Committee, Senator Kennedy. He and \nI both share a commitment to improving access and quality of \npostsecondary education for all students, and a strong interest in \nkeeping America competitive in this global economy.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will improve postsecondary \neducation by strengthening the accreditation process, improving access \nthrough the use of technology, supporting student financial aid \nprograms, reducing the need for remedial education, helping more \nstudents complete high school, and supporting transitions for all \nstudents from high school to college.\n  Among the most important provisions of this bill is a program that \nwould provide additional grant aid to those students with the greatest \nfinancial need. This legislation would also focus its resources on \nincreasing the number of math and science graduates by providing \nadditional grant aid for students in their third and fourth years of \ncollege.\n  This legislation would also increase access to Federally guaranteed \nstudent loans, which would help ensure that students are not forced to \ntake out higher interest loans from other sources. It would also expand \nthe role of institutions and guaranty agencies in providing financial \nliteracy to students, so they will make better choices regarding their \nfinancial future.\n  In addition to these priorities, the bill would also help to address \nthe Federal deficit in a meaningful way, by saving $7 billion over the \nnext 5 years. Although we were forced to make some difficult choices in \nreaching this level of deficit reduction, I am pleased that we were \nalso able to write good policy, provide increased support for students \nand put in place a program that will help strengthen America's place in \nthe global marketplace our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my chairman, Senator \nEnzi, in the introduction of a bill that will bring much needed relief \nto students and families struggling to pay for college. We plan to \nreport out this bill from our Committee later this week. The assistance \nit contains can not come soon enough.\n  In today's global economy, a college degree is more valuable than \never. Students and workers must have the skills they need to succeed. \nWhen I graduated from high school, good jobs were available to high \nschool graduates. Today, that is not the case. More and more jobs--\nparticularly jobs that can reasonably support a family--require men and \nwomen to have a college degree or certificate, and the best jobs \nrequire advanced degrees.\n  But today, many families across America are facing a combination of \nhope and anxiety as their children go back to college--hope that their \nchildren will do well and anxiety about rising costs that are swamping \nfamily budgets.\n  Public tuition is up 35 percent over the last 4 years. Nationally, \nlast year, almost 200,000 qualified students didn't go to college at \nall because they couldn't afford the high cost. According to new data \nfrom the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial \nAssistance, the poorest students face an average unmet financial need \nof nearly $6,000.\n  Many who find a way to go to college are borrowing more heavily than \never. In 1990, only 16 percent of students took out a college loan. \nToday, it is 52 percent. Thirty years ago, the typical student aid \npackage was 60 percent grants and 40 percent loans. Today, it is the \nreverse--40 percent grants and 60 percent loans. The average \nundergraduate now has $17,000 in college debt.\n  Families across the country are dedicating larger and larger portions \nof their income to send their children to college. In Massachusetts, \nafter taking the average financial aid package into consideration, a \nfamily making the average salary must contribute 31 percent of their \nincome to cover the costs of sending one child to college for just one \nyear. In some States, the percentage is even higher. Families are \nstruggling to pay for college and as a result the doors of college are \nbarred for too many students.\n  Congress can do more to ease the squeeze, and this bill is an \nimportant step in the right direction. Many of us would like to do \nmore, and we are concerned that $7 billion in this bill will be \ndedicated to Reconciliation, which will be used to pay for tax cuts for \nthe wealthy.\n  Nevertheless, the assistance in this bill for students and for their \nfamilies is substantial. It provides at least $5.5 billion for \nadditional grant aid to the students who need it the most. It improves \nthe existing student loan programs by making important changes to \ncreate real competition between the various programs and keeping the \ncost of loans affordable. It also strengthens the act's graduate \nstudies program, and expands access to loans and grant aid for these \nstudents.\n  The bill also strengthens programs to prepare students to go to \ncollege and stay in college, such as GEAR UP and TRIO. We extend and \nimprove programs to support minorities, such as the Hispanic Serving \nInstitution Program, the Tribal College Program and the Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities Program. A new program supports \ninstitutions serving large numbers of Native American students.\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\n  We are making small improvements in getting qualified young people to \ncollege, but we still have much to do to keep them enrolled and earn a \ndegree. The committee has made an effort to address the retention issue \nby including programs to help students succeed in college.\n  We also continue our focus on teacher preparation by strengthening \npartnerships with the K-12 systems who hire the teachers, and giving \npriority to preparing teachers for shortage subjects such as special \neducation and math and science.\n  As the bill recognizes, to help the Nation compete in today's global \neconomy, we must strengthen the teaching of math and science in schools \nand colleges. It is shameful that America is now ranked only 29th in \nthe industrial world in math education, and that we have fallen from \nthird in the world to 15th in producing scientists and engineers.\n  The bill provides strong incentives for math and science graduates to \nteach for at least 5 years in the schools that need them most. We also \ncreate a new scholarship program for low income students, pursuing \ncareers in math, science, technology and engineering, and high need \nforeign languages.\n  From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the engine of \nthe American dream, and we can't let it stall. A larger share of our \npopulation needs to participate in postsecondary education. We looked \nat ways to expand access to working adults through modular and \ncompressed coursework, and to students with disabilities who can \nbenefit from taking courses rather than taking standardized tests.\n  Our goal is to give all students and their parents the support they \nneed to benefit from education and keep our country strong in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/06/senate-section/article/S9691-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 233--EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE NATION TO THE \n VICTIMS OF HURRICANE KATRINA, COMMENDING THE RESILIENCY OF THE PEOPLE \nOF THE STATES OF LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, AND ALABAMA, AND COMMITTING TO \n            STAND BY THEM IN THE RELIEF AND RECOVERY EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Lott, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, \nMr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \nChambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \nDeMint, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, \nMr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, \nMr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
