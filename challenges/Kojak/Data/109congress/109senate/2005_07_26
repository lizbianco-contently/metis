The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we come back for a final week before our \nrecess with a number of important items, many of which are the \nculmination of many months of work. It will be a challenging week in \norder to accommodate the range of issues. I will mention a number of \nthose that will be addressed. I do hope all of our colleagues will \nconsider the importance of addressing each of these and doing it in a \ntimely way that respects people's schedules and gets us out at the end \nof this week. It is going to be a real challenge, but it can clearly be \naccomplished if we all work together in a collegial and civil way as we \ngo.\n  This morning we will resume debate on the Defense authorization bill. \nUnder the order, there will be 20 minutes remaining for debate to be \nused on the Collins and Lautenberg amendments on contracts. Following \nthat time, we will proceed to a series of votes. We will be voting on \nthe Collins amendment. Following that, we will vote in relation to the \nLautenberg amendment. Following that, we will vote in relation to a Boy \nScouts amendment. That will be followed by a cloture vote on the \npending Defense authorization.\n  If cloture is invoked, we will stay on the Defense bill until that is \ncompleted, something I am very hopeful we will be able to do shortly. \nIf cloture is not invoked, we would proceed to a cloture vote with \nrespect to the motion to proceed to the gun manufacturers liability \nbill which we also will address this week. These cloture votes will \nallow the Senate to complete these two important measures.\n  In addition to that, we have a number of additional items, including \nthe conference report on energy, the conference report on highways, and \nthen there are a number of appropriations conference reports that may \nbecome available in addition to these measures. We are looking at the \nissue on Native Hawaiians and a death tax issue. We have a lot of work \nto do in a very short period of time. We clearly will be working \nthrough Friday of this week and, if it means going into the weekend to \ncomplete the work, we are prepared to do that.\n\n\n                         The Boy Scout Jamboree\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to mention--I know the \nSenator from Alaska has a comment--our sympathy for the tragic events \nthat have occurred at the Boy Scouts Jamboree. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with the many families who have been affected so directly. We will \ncontinue to reach out over the course of the day for the tragic event \nthat occurred there.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Cloture Votes\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would, through the Chair, ask the \ndistinguished majority leader if the majority leader would agree that \nwe would continue on the Defense bill, vitiate cloture on it and the \ngun bill, and finish the Defense bill by a time certain, say Thursday \nat 7 o'clock in the evening? We would try to work through our \namendments. We would have time agreements on amendments. We would have \nthe two managers of the bill set us up so we could vote on these, \nRepublican and Democratic amendments, work through all these. I have a \nmore extended statement I am going to give in a little bit, if we can't \nwork something out on this. I will ask unanimous consent, but I would \nask the distinguished Senator from Tennessee if he would consider a \nunanimous consent agreement that will allow us to finish this bill by a \ntime certain on Thursday and, following that, in fact, what I think \nwould be most appropriate is we finish the very important Defense bill \nthis week, and the second we get back in September move to the gun \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Through the Chair in response to the Democratic leader, we \nlaid out a plan at the end of last week where we can stay on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. We have filed cloture to \nbring some order to that process. We will have the opportunity to vote \non cloture this morning. I expect cloture to be invoked. We should \nfinish the Defense authorization bill. I have also made it clear from \nthis desk and on the floor that we are going to finish the gun \nmanufacturers liability bill before we leave. That makes it challenging \nbecause we have the very important Department of Defense authorization \nbill, but we have a plan and a way to finish that by invoking cloture \nthis morning, finishing with that issue, and then moving directly to \nthe gun manufacturers liability bill. Therefore, I do not believe we \nneed--in fact, I know we don't need a unanimous consent agreement in \norder to accomplish that. So at this juncture we will stay on the plan, \nthe Department of Defense cloture vote this morning--and I expect it \nwould be invoked--finish that bill and then proceed to the gun \nliability bill.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair if the Senator from \nTennessee, the distinguished majority leader, has a statement to make. \nOtherwise, I have a statement I am going to make this morning.\n  Mr. FRIST. I do not have a statement this morning. Following the \nDemocratic leader's statement, I believe the Senator from Alaska has a \nbrief statement to make as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Alaska say he \nneeded a minute or two. I would be happy, if he wants to do that at the \npresent time, to allow the President pro tempore of\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nthe Senate, the most senior Member of the Senate, to give a statement. \nThen I will give mine.\n  Before the leader leaves the floor, I will use leader time. I don't \nthink I will need to use more than the 10 minutes, but that would push \nthe votes back 10 minutes. I think everyone should be entitled to the \ntime they have. Is that OK with the leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Boy Scouts Jamboree Tragedy\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me thank the two leaders for their \ncourtesy.\n  Last Thursday it was my privilege to meet on the Capitol steps with a \ngroup of Boy Scouts from my State, 71 young Scouts and 9 adults, which \nincluded 5 distinguished Boy Scout leaders. As we all know, we have \nheard the news, a tragic accident occurred at Fort A.P. Hill, and four \nof those leaders have passed away. Another is seriously injured. It has \nbeen a shock to the Alaska community, certainly a shock to the \nJamboree. We are working with the Army. This occurred on an Army base, \nand there is a CID investigation going on, as well as a Virginia State \ninvestigation, to determine the cause of this tragedy. Clearly, there \nare 71 young men down there who are very shocked and very disturbed \nover this tragedy.\n  I want to thank the leader for his comments and the Chaplain for the \nmention of these men in his opening prayer. It is impossible for us to \nfathom a tragedy of this sort. In any event, I want to say to the \nSenate and to the Alaskan people we will do everything we can to help \nthese young men and to comfort them and make certain they are cared for \nin this period of mourning the loss of these distinguished Boy Scout \nleaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that statements that appeared in the \nAnchorage Daily News this morning about this incident and from the \nWashington Post reporting on the incidents be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, July 26, 2005]\n\n                   Alaska Scout Leaders Die Near D.C.\n\n                  (By Katie Pesznecker and Lisa Demer)\n\n       Four Boy Scout leaders were killed in Virginia on Monday, \n     the opening day of the organization's national Jamboree, when \n     a metal tent pole they were holding hit a power line and \n     apparently ignited the canvas tent above them, according to \n     Scout officials and witnesses.\n       Officials late Monday confirmed the leaders who died are \n     Ron Bitzer, Michael Lacroix and Michael Shibe of Anchorage \n     and Scott Powell, who moved to Ohio last year.\n       A fifth Alaska Scout leader, Larry Call, and an \n     unidentified contractor were hospitalized with injuries, \n     according to Boy Scout officials. Call is being treated at a \n     Virginia hospital burn unit, said his wife, Paula Call.\n       No children were seriously injured, but about 30 Alaska \n     Scouts saw the accident happen some time between 12:30 p.m. \n     and 1 p.m. Alaska time at Fort A.P. Hill, an Army base about \n     one hour south of the nation's capital.\n       Karl Holfeld, an Anchorage father, said his 15-year-old \n     son, Taylor, witnessed the accident. Taylor was on his cell \n     phone talking to his mother in Anchorage when the accident \n     occurred.\n       ``They all started screaming,'' Holfeld said. ``He said, \n     `Oh my God, oh my God, the tent is on fire, they're being \n     burned!' And she told him to stay away, to not touch \n     anything, because there could be a live wire.''\n       Paula Call spoke to her husband and others after the \n     accident. The group of men was erecting a large tent, like a \n     circus tent, she said. She didn't know what it was for.\n       ``As they got it up, this pole started to lean and it \n     touched a utility live wire,'' Paula Call said.\n       She hadn't heard about the fire but said her husband \n     suffered electrocution burns on his hands, hips and feet. His \n     condition improved during the day and he will recover, she \n     said.\n       The Calls' son Kendell, 15, saw the accident but is too \n     upset to talk about it in detail, Paula Call said. A second \n     son was also there. Witnesses told her Kendell reacted \n     quickly to help his father.\n       Her husband ``was just concerned about the boys. It was the \n     most horrific thing he knows they will ever witness,'' she \n     said.\n       The Scouts were taken from their camp to meet with grief \n     counselors and a chaplain, said Renee Fairrer, director of \n     National News and Media for the Jamboree.\n       Seventy-one boys and nine adults were traveling with the \n     Jamboree contingency representing the Western Alaska Council \n     of Boy Scouts of America. Bill Haines, executive director of \n     the council here, said others came from Juneau and Fairbanks.\n       Jamboree leaders are ``the cream of the crop,'' he said. \n     ``They were the best we had.''\n       Of the men who died, Shibe had two sons at the Jamboree, \n     and Lacroix, who runs an Anchorage vending machine company, \n     had one son in attendance, Haines said.\n       Holfeld had known both Bitzer and Shibe for years. Shibe \n     and Holfeld earned their Eagle ranks together in the 1970s.\n       ``We crossed paths at Scout things all the time,'' Holfeld \n     said. ``They were just phenomenally effusive and so dedicated \n     to the youth. They were enthusiastic gentlemen that totally \n     believed in the Boy Scouts and showed that through their \n     efforts and commitment.''\n       Bitzer and his wife, Karen, had recently sold their \n     Anchorage home, and Haines said he believes they were \n     preparing to move to Reno. He worked a couple of years as a \n     Scout executive, Haines said. Bitzer was a retired \n     administrative law judge and an assistant scoutmaster of \n     Troop 129 in Anchorage, said family spokesman Ken \n     Schoolcraft, the troop's scoutmaster.\n       Bitzer spent years running the Junior Leader Training \n     Conference, a summer event at Camp Gorsuch on Mirror Lake, \n     said Dylan O'Harra, 19, a former Anchorage Boy Scout who went \n     to Bitzer's program.\n       ``He was another guy who was dedicated to spending his time \n     helping Scouts, helping kids advance and appreciate the \n     outdoors,'' O'Harra said.\n       Powell was single and retired last year after a career in \n     Boy Scouts. He had moved to Ohio but attended Jamboree at the \n     last moment after a boy was unable to go, Haines said.\n       Powell had devoted years to Alaska Scouts, including more \n     than 20 years as program director at Camp Gorsuch.\n       ``For every kid who ever went to the camp, Scott Powell was \n     the most inspirational and exciting guy that you've ever \n     met,'' said O'Harra, who attended and worked at Camp Gorsuch. \n     ``When you wanted to be on staff, you wanted to be on staff \n     so you could be on Scott's team. He's the reason a lot of \n     kids came back to the camp as counselors for years and \n     years.''\n       Jamboree is a decades-old event and one of the biggest \n     gatherings of Boy Scouts worldwide. The first, in Washington, \n     D.C., in 1937, drew more than 27,000 people. Scout officials \n     said attendance at this one, the 16th Jamboree, is expected \n     to top 43,000 Scouts and leaders from the United States and \n     20 countries.\n       This is the seventh Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, nestled in \n     the rolling hills of Caroline County, Virginia. Scouts swarm \n     3,000 acres. Within hours on Monday, cadres from various \n     cities and states were expected to stake down some 17,000 \n     tents and put up 3,500 patrol kitchens. The Scouts who attend \n     are at least 12 years old and younger than 18.\n       Boys at the 10-day event do all things Scout-related--from \n     biking to archery to kayaking. They earn merit badges and \n     cook many of their own meals. Camp highlights include blow-\n     out opening and closing arena shows that include Army Rangers \n     parachuting in, fireworks exploding, folks singing and \n     dancing. President Bush is scheduled to speak Wednesday \n     night.\n       Alaska leaders split the kids into two groups: Troop 711 \n     and Troop 712. They spent four days together touring \n     Washington before arriving at Jamboree for opening day \n     Monday.\n       Several adults from Alaska's group helped put up a large \n     tent. It might have been a mess hall for the group or the \n     sleeping quarters for the leaders, said Mike Sage, an \n     Anchorage father who chaperoned Alaska Scouts at the last \n     Jamboree four years ago.\n       The tent has a large metal pole as its center support and \n     also poles at its corners. Men were reportedly holding on to \n     those, Paula Call said.\n       It's unclear how the pole came in contact with the wire.\n       ``They either hit the power line with the pole, or a truck \n     went by and knocked the pole over,'' Holfeld said. ``Either \n     way, the pole hit the power line, electrocuted them, set the \n     tent on fire, the tent fell on them, and they were trapped \n     underneath,'' with Scouts watching.\n       In interviews and press releases all day, Boy Scout \n     officials referred to the incident as ``an electrical \n     accident.''\n       A statement on the official Jamboree Web site said: ``Our \n     prayers and sympathies are with the families of each of the \n     victims. It is a tragic loss that is shared by everyone in \n     the BSA. Counselors and chaplains are at the jamboree and \n     available to any Scout or leader. A thorough investigation \n     into this accident is under way.''\n       Fairrer said Boy Scouts of America is leading the \n     investigation and working with the military.\n       People have died or been seriously injured before at \n     Jamboree, Fairrer said. But she could not recall a \n     catastrophe of this magnitude.\n       ``And any time there's a death, it hurts all of us,'' \n     Fairrer said. ``Within scouting, we are one big family.''\n       Gov. Frank Murkowski said in a statement early Monday \n     evening that he was ``very saddened today to learn of the \n     deaths of these four Scout leaders in such a tragic and \n     unexpected accident. . . . These individuals were killed \n     while serving Alaska's young people, and I admire and thank \n     them for that service.''\n       The three boys whose fathers died are returning to Alaska, \n     Haines said.\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n       ``The other boys who didn't lose their fathers are going to \n     make a decision with their leaders about what to do.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2005]\n\n                 Four Scout Leaders Die in Va. Accident\n\n                  (By Karin Brulliard and Martin Weil)\n\n       Fort A.P. Hill, VA.--Four adult Scout leaders from Alaska \n     were killed Monday afternoon at the Boy Scout Jamboree in an \n     electrical accident that apparently occurred when a pole from \n     a tent they were setting up struck an overhead power line, \n     officials said.\n       Three others, a Scout leader and two contract workers, were \n     injured in the accident, which happened a few hours after the \n     official noontime opening of the jamboree. The gathering \n     draws thousands of Scouts every four years from across the \n     United States and many foreign countries.\n       No Boy Scouts were injured.\n       The leaders were from the Anchorage area and represented \n     the Scouts' Western Alaska Council, an official of that \n     council said. Bill Haines said two of those killed and the \n     injured leader had children with them at the jamboree, about \n     75 miles south of the District.\n       ``It's a very tragic loss for all of us,'' Haines said.\n       The children, he said, were coping. ``They are all being \n     taken care of,'' he said.\n       Sheriff A.A. ``Tony'' Lippa Jr. of Caroline County said a \n     preliminary investigation indicated that the pole had struck \n     the power line but that authorities had not determined how it \n     happened. ``We're not sure if the poles shifted,'' he said.\n       Scout officials gave no details of how the accident \n     occurred, other than to say that it was between 4:30 and 5 \n     p.m. while the camp for the Alaskans was being set up. One \n     person with knowledge of jamboree operations, who spoke on \n     condition of anonymity because an investigation is underway, \n     confirmed that a tent-support pole touched an electric line.\n       After the accident, witnesses saw a slender pole that \n     protruded through the apex of a pyramid-shaped tent and \n     appeared to be touching one or more overhead lines. The tent \n     was one of two at the Alaskans' site that appeared to be \n     intended for use as a group gathering place rather than for \n     sleeping.\n       One of the two light-colored tents apparently had been \n     fully erected. The other tent, where the accident apparently \n     occurred, was cordoned off with yellow tape. The Scouts who \n     might have stayed in that area had been moved.\n       Haines, in a telephone interview from Alaska, said the four \n     men who died ``were leaders in the Scouting community, \n     longtime Alaskans. They were very instrumental in the \n     council'' It was the first jamboree for one of the men.\n       Lippa said the ages of three of the four were 42, 47 and \n     58.\n       All those injured were in stable condition at hospitals, \n     the sheriff said. None of the men's names was released last \n     night.\n       Officials said late last night that they expected the \n     jamboree to continue but were not certain whether any \n     adjustments to the schedule or participation might be made. \n     Bob Dries, volunteer chairman of the event's national news \n     and media operation, said: ``I would expect the jamboree is \n     going to carry on. Certainly, our sympathy is with the \n     families. It's a sad day. The jamboree is about kids and \n     having fun.''\n       Renee Fairrer, director of national news and media for the \n     jamboree also said the event would go on. She said the Alaska \n     contingent had been separated from the others.\n       Gregg Shields, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, said \n     chaplains and grief counselors were meeting with the Scouts \n     from the Western Alaska council. Those Scouts are ``our \n     primary concern right now,'' he said.\n       Haines said he did not know whether they would stay for the \n     duration of the jamboree, which runs through Aug. 3. ``We're \n     going to do what the troop wants,'' Fairrer said.\n       Other Scouts from the general area in which the accident \n     occurred appeared to be taking part late yesterday in planned \n     activities. Some were seen setting up cots or reading. A \n     Scout-run camp radio station interrupted its normal broadcast \n     to report the accident.\n       Fairrer said the accident was being investigated by the Boy \n     Scouts and the U.S. Army, which operates the base in Caroline \n     County, about 10 miles east of Interstate 95 on Route 301, \n     just south of the Rappahannock River.\n       She said late Monday that 32,000 Scouts and an additional \n     3,500 leaders had assembled to live for 10 days in what is \n     essentially a huge tent city on the grounds of the base. \n     President Bush is scheduled to address the gathering \n     Wednesday night.\n       The accident, Fairrer said, occurred at the eastern edge of \n     the campsite, which she estimated at seven to 10 miles from \n     the fort's main gate. The base is about 76,000 acres; the \n     Scouts are using about 5,000. Jamboree representatives said \n     as many as 17,000 two-man tents might be pitched.\n       The site is supplied with electricity by the Rappahannock \n     Electric Cooperative, Fairrer said. The utility last night \n     said it was assisting in the investigation.\n       Over the past weekend, some of the Scouts have been in \n     Washington, swarming over the Mall and through the monuments, \n     a blur of khaki and neckerchiefs and patch-covered shoulders.\n       Hundreds of buses pulled into the military base yesterday \n     to disgorge Scouts by the thousands. Officials said they came \n     from 50 states and 20 foreign countries. At least 400 Scouts \n     from the Washington region were scheduled to be on hand.\n       The jamboree has been held at the military base since the \n     1980s.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, I thank the Senate and the leaders for their \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                    Cloture on Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Members heard the colloquy between the \ndistinguished majority leader and this Senator. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time I use not apply to any of the order now before the Senate \nwith regard to the four votes that are pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I was in Chicago over the weekend at an event. I talked to \na well-dressed, very articulate man. I didn't realize he was as old as \nhe was, but I learned later he was 83 years old. His name is Green. He \nhad served in the South Pacific for 3 years during World War II. All \nthose islands we hear so much about, he was on all of them, carrying a \nrifle, fighting for our country.\n  This morning I thought about Mr. Green. In World War II, do you think \nthe Senate would have spent a matter of a few hours on the Defense \nbill? I don't think so. During World War II, Senator Truman, among \nothers, debated very vociferously whether there should be an \ninvestigation into how money was being spent by the military and the \nGovernment generally. It was controversial, but it was debated. Senator \nTruman's actions carried.\n  What are we doing here today? What are we doing here today? A bill \ninvolving 1.4 million active-duty men and women serving in uniform for \nour country and a million Guard and Reserve, approximately 2.5 million \nmen and women serving this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, \nGermany, all over the world, a bill that is costing the American \ntaxpayer during this year approximately $450 billion--that doesn't \ncount the usual emergency supplementals that are not part of this \nprocess involving tens of billions of dollars--we are going to spend on \nthis bill a few hours. To this point we have not had a single vote on a \nDemocratic amendment. It is unconscionable to do this, to end debate on \nthese amendments that help our country.\n\n  Just a few of them. Concurrent receipt is something I have worked on \nwith the two managers of this bill for 4 years. What is concurrent \nreceipt? Is it important to the military? It absolutely is. Prior to \nthe 4 years this Senate worked on it, a person who retired from the \nU.S. military who was disabled could not draw his disability benefits \nand his retirement benefits. If you are retired from the military with \na disability and you worked at Sears, you could draw both, or if you \nworked at the Department of Interior, you could draw both. But not from \nthe military. We have changed it. We have not changed it enough, but we \nhave changed it a lot and it is helpful. But we need to continue to \nwork with these disabled American veterans to get them the money they \nhave earned and they deserve and which this country is obligated, in my \nopinion, morally to pay them. We won't have an opportunity to do that \non this bill because in an hour or so cloture will be invoked.\n  Senator Nelson from Florida wants to offer an amendment authorizing \nsurviving spouses to receive both survivor benefit plan annuity \nbenefits and indemnity compensation, and they should be able to get \nboth.\n  Senator Kerry wants to make permanent the temporary authority, \nincluding the emergency supplemental for dependents of service members \nwho die on active duty to remain in military housing for 1 year after \nthe person has been killed in the line of duty. That is not asking too \nmuch. We would like that amendment to be offered. We want to improve \nthis bill. We are not trying to tear the bill apart. We want to improve \nit.\n  Senator Lieberman and others want to increase the size of the \nmilitary by 20,000 a year for the next 4 years. I believe in this \namendment, but we very likely will not have the opportunity to have \nthat voted on.\n  Senator Murray has a childcare amendment that would help members\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\nof the U.S. military have their children taken care of while they are \non active duty.\n  Senator Durbin has an amendment to require Federal agencies to pay \nthe difference between military and civilian compensation for National \nGuard and Reserve. This is something we very likely will not have the \nchance to vote on.\n  Senator Levin has an amendment that would provide $50 million to \ncooperative threat reduction to meet the new opportunity to provide \nsecurity upgrades to 15 key Russian nuclear weapons sites.\n  Last week a report was issued by former Secretary Bill Perry that \nsaid the No. 1 problem the world faces is loose nukes. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  This is a bill that is so vitally important. It is important in \ndealing with veterans health care benefits. It is important in dealing \nwith Guard and Reserve, base closure, our war on terror, impact of \nsustained military operations to our troops and their families, \ndetainee abuse.\n  Republicans have joined with Democrats in saying let's take a look at \nwhat has gone on with how we treat prisoners of war--a bipartisan \namendment. We can read in any paper in the United States that last week \nthe Vice President of our country had been calling people at the White \nHouse, Members of the Senate, to tell them not to do that. Why? What \nare we afraid of? This is an open society. This is the United States. \nWe won't be able to offer that amendment. Is that why this bill is \nbeing taken away from us? Because the administration has said we don't \nwant you to look at what has gone on in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and \nother such places? This majority leader, apparently under pressure from \nthis administration, decided we were not going to deal with these \nimportant issues this year. Rather than putting our troops and our \nNation's security first by letting the Senate work its will on these \nimportant issues, the majority leader and this administration decided \nto prematurely cut off debate.\n  It is unheard of to do what is being done here. The hue and cry will \ngo forth from this majority we have here saying these awful Democrats \nare trying to hold up the Defense bill. Hold up the Defense bill for a \ncouple of days?\n  We believe we have an obligation, we Democrats believe we have an \nobligation to face difficult issues and not run from them, including \nthe embarrassment of what went on in our prisons at Guantanamo and Abu \nGhraib. We believe it is important to deal with weapons of mass \ndestruction in this bill. Unfortunately, that is precisely the choice \nthe majority leader is forcing this body to make today. If we do not \ninvoke cloture on this bill and forego our right to offer these \nimportant amendments, the bill is gone. We are not going to be able to \ntake these things up.\n  This work period is ending. We are going to go home. We are going to \ncome back in September. The fiscal year is on top of us. We have the \nRoberts nomination that will take a little time on the Senate floor \nafter the Senate Judiciary Committee completes its important work. What \nare the Republicans afraid of?\n\n  There is more to this than the administration simply wanting to cut \noff debate because of embarrassment to them about talking to these \nissues. The Republican leadership is also engaged in a very cynical \nploy here today. They have pitted the interest of a very powerful \nspecial interest group against this Nation's security needs. Rather \nthan spending the time needed to carefully consider critical national \nsecurity issues--and I think that is something that again we need to \nfocus on, national security issues--the Republican leadership has \ndecided it is more important that the Senate instead take up gun \nlegislation. I support the legislation, but let's be realistic about \nthis. Legislation that would trump the men and women of America who \nwear the uniform of our country? I don't think so. I don't think it is \na fair match. No matter how you may feel about gun legislation, it is \nnot a match to allowing us to proceed on the Defense bill as we have \ndone traditionally in this body.\n  I recognize we have wasted a lot of time in the Senate, spending one-\nthird--one-third--of the Senate's time on voting on three judges. Every \none of the people who was made a judge had jobs already. One-third of \nthe Senate's time was spent on three judges. So I know we are crimped \nfor time around here because of that. But we are going to take gun \nlegislation and compare it to the men and women who I visited out at \nWalter Reed laying in those hospital beds. Think of my friend, my new \nfriend, Mr. Green from Chicago, World War II veteran, proud of the \nservice he made to this country. He gave to this country. What we are \ndoing here today, would it ever have happened during World War II? No. \nI think it would be unfortunate if the Senate were to vote to end \ndebate today, but this is a position individual Senators can pick. I \nhaven't twisted any arms. Senators can do what they want to do.\n  What would be the best of all worlds is we could have a bipartisan \nopposition to this invocation of cloture today. That is what should \nhappen. There should be a revolt by my friends on the Republican side \nto cut off debate on this bill at this time.\n  This is an embarrassment to this body. It should be an embarrassment \nto the majority. This is something that is going to be around for a \nlong time. What is going to be around for a long time is how we have \nbeen treated on this legislation. Who is we? The American people.\n  I have only mentioned a few. I don't know how many amendments we have \npending--probably 30 amendments already that have been laid down. We \nhave had several others. The last time cloture was invoked on this bill \nwe had already acted on 80 amendments, after days and days of debate. \nThat is what it is supposed to be. And we are not asking for days and \ndays. We are saying we will finish the bill by Thursday. Today is \nTuesday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to clarify what we face at this moment. If I \nunderstand what the minority leader has said to the Senate, we have \npending amendments before the Senate on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill which will not survive, are not likely to survive, \ncannot even be considered because of this procedural decision by the \nmajority leader, by Senator Frist. And if I understand what the Senator \nfrom Nevada has said, he has said that included in the amendments which \nwill fall, will not be considered this week, would be an amendment he \nwants to offer to help totally disabled veterans, an amendment by \nSenator Nelson of Florida to provide funds for the widows and orphans \nof those who die in combat, an amendment by Senator Kerry to provide \nfor housing for 1 year for the family of a soldier who dies in combat, \nthe amendment by Senator Murray to provide childcare for soldiers' \nfamilies when the soldier is deployed overseas, and my amendment to \nmake up the pay difference for National Guard and Reserve who are \nactivated and lose money from their civilian pay. And if I understand \nthe Senator from Nevada, he is saying these amendments, these five or \nsix I have read, we have been told we won't have time to consider this \nweek.\n  If I understand the Senator from Nevada, he has said we don't have \ntime to deal with the totally disabled veterans, the widows and orphans \nof those who fall in combat, and those Guard and Reserve members who \nare activated, we don't have time for that because we have to move to a \nbill for the gun lobby, for the National Rifle Association.\n  If I understand what the Senator from Nevada says, it is more \nimportant for us to do our best for the gun lobbyists in their three-\npiece suits than for the men and women in uniform who are fighting and \ndying for our country. That seems to me to be the agenda and the \npriority of the majority leader who has come to the floor today.\n  Is that my understanding of what the Senator from Nevada has said?\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, yes. We have been reasonable. I believe there is no jury you \ncould have in the world that would think we are doing other than the \nright thing, asking for a couple days to improve a bill that will give \nbenefits to 2\\1/2\\ million Americans serving in uniform and a bill that \nis going to cost the taxpayers $450 billion\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\nin 1 year. We want to spend a couple days on this bill and we are not \nbeing allowed to because the administration is pushing them and the gun \nlobby is pushing them.\n\n  Look, I am not opposed to everything the administration does. I am \nnot opposed to everything the gun lobby does. But I am opposed to what \nthe administration is doing in this instance and the gun lobby in this \ninstance because it is wrong for the people of our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask further if I could ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Nevada through the Chair. Is it my understanding the Senator from \nNevada came to the floor and gave the Republican leader his assurance \nthat these amendments would be considered in a timely fashion and that \nwe would agree that this bill, the Department of Defense authorization \nbill, would be passed from the Senate this week, no later than Thursday \nevening, in plenty of time so that it will be there for the \nadministration and for the conference committee to consider, so there \nwould be no delay, so we could take up in a timely fashion amendments \nto help the totally disabled veterans, amendments to help the widows \nand orphans of those who have fallen in combat, amendments to help the \nGuard and Reserve when they are activated so their families can stay \ntogether? Did the Senator from Nevada give that assurance to the \nRepublican leader, Senator Frist, that we are not trying to delay this \nunreasonably but want to move it through quickly, consider these \namendments in a timely fashion, vote up or down and move to final \npassage this week?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is yes. I also say, Mr. President, so there is \nno problem later on, so everyone understands the quandary we are in--\nbut we didn't get us there, we didn't spend a third of our time on \nthree judges--here is the quandary we are in. As I understand the \nrules, if cloture is invoked on the Defense authorization bill, we will \nfinish it sometime Wednesday evening. Then there will be a vote that \nwill occur automatically on the gun handling bill legislation and then \nthere will be 30 hours to debate the motion to proceed on the gun \nlegislation. Senator Reed from Rhode Island has told me he wants to use \nall that 30 hours, he or some combination of Senators, so that will end \nsometime around midnight on Thursday. And then if the majority leader \nwants to continue the presentation of the gun legislation, there would \nhave to be cloture filed again for a Saturday vote or maybe even have a \nFriday vote if he does it Friday before midnight, and then there is \nanother 30 hours to go forward on the gun legislation. And during that \nperiod of time no other business can be conducted.\n  I have spoken with the majority leader about this issue. There will \nbe a small window of time on Wednesday between whatever time the 30 \nhours runs out at midnight, if he decides to continue on the gun \nlegislation, that we can in the few hours do the Energy conference \nreport, Interior conference report, highway conference report, \nlegislative branch conference report, and whatever else is available.\n  The time spent on judges has put this Senate in a real difficult \nposition, notwithstanding that the majority leader promised the \nSenators from Hawaii they can do the Native Hawaiian bill.\n  I want everyone to understand what they are walking into. The best \nwould be to defeat cloture. Senators from the majority side should join \nwith us to defeat cloture, finish the bill in the ordinary course, and \ndo whatever would come naturally after that, which would be a motion to \nproceed to the gun liability legislation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I have yielded to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me raise an issue and ask a \nquestion. We have spent time in this Chamber trying to address an \nimmediate shortfall in veterans health care funding. Senator Murray has \nbrought this to our attention. We have yet to see this resolved. We \nhave gone back and forth about whether we are going to provide adequate \nfunds now for our veterans.\n  Is it not true that one of the amendments--and I know this is true \nbecause I offered an amendment that would address this situation long \nterm--where instead of coming back and forth constantly trying to \nfigure out whether we are going to have the veterans funding year to \nyear so our veterans do not stand in lines, wait months to see a \ndoctor, and not receive what they need, isn't it also the understanding \nof the Democratic leader that my amendment that would address \npermanently the issue of veterans funding, therefore guaranteeing that \nwhen our brave men and women come home from the wars, end their \nservice, and become veterans, that they would be assured we will keep \nour promise to them as it relates to full funding of veterans health \ncare, is it the Senator's understanding that this amendment would also \nfall, we would not have the opportunity to address this issue in this \nbill?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been told that this amendment would \nfall. This amendment, which has already been filed, would fall \npostcloture. People would not have an opportunity to vote on this \namendment.\n  I will also say, one of the points I mentioned during my statement is \nthe Interior bill is coming up. We promised that would come up before \nwe leave because there is $1.5 billion in that bill for veterans' \nbenefits for this fiscal year because they have been so shortchanged.\n  I yield for a question from my distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \nDemocratic leader. I ask a very narrow question. He has pointedly \nraised three or four amendments that address the benefits that could go \nto veterans or active.\n  The Senator from Nevada has been a leader every year that this bill \nhas been brought up on a variety of issues, and no one takes the place \nto his fervor in trying to provide particularly for the concurrent \nreceipt legislation. But I have to say to my good friend, and my \nquestion is, am I not correct that this bill came up Wednesday night, \nand Senator Levin and I were on the Senate floor into the evening, this \nbill was on the floor Thursday right up until early evening and again \nFriday morning? Every one of those bills--concurrent receipts, I \nremember specifically asking Senator Nelson of Florida: Could you not \nbring up that bill early? He said: No, I am going to wait until \nTuesday. That is all he said.\n  I have to say, I believe I am correct that all of those pieces of \nlegislation that were mentioned could have been brought up Wednesday, \nThursday, Friday, and addressed by the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, I have sat \nside by side with him in the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nmany years now and have the greatest respect for him. In this instance, \nhe is just absolutely wrong.\n  On Wednesday, this bill was taken up late in the afternoon, with time \nfor opening statements. On Thursday, there were no votes after 6 \no'clock in the evening. Friday, no votes. Monday, no votes. As has been \nmentioned here on the floor of the Senate by me, among others, on many \ndifferent occasions, we cannot have work done here when we cannot have \nvotes on amendments. Fridays have become no-work days. If there are no \nvotes, we do not get anything done here. So I say to my distinguished \nfriend, I don't know when they should have offered amendments. I don't \nknow when Senator Nelson should have offered them. The point is, we \nhave said we will finish this bill by Thursday at 7 o'clock. Pretty \ngood time. It would give us today, tomorrow, and Thursday to complete \nthis bill. This would be far shorter than the time we normally spend on \nthis bill. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays is when we vote around \nhere. I think we should vote on Fridays and Mondays, but we do not. The \nMonday vote is a meaningless vote, in my opinion, to get people back \nhere.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not also true that these amendments, plus many \nothers, have been offered, and people would\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\nhave been perfectly happy to have votes on them if they were permitted, \nbut votes were not permitted, so they had to be temporarily laid aside \nso others could be offered? But the idea that those people who offered \nthose amendments would not have been happy to have votes on those \namendments is not right.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend through the Chair, not only is it true \nthat those amendments have been filed, they were required by the rules \nof the Senate to have been filed because there was a 2 o'clock cutoff \nfor the amendments to be filed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And are pending; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I don't know how many.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Over 40.\n  Mr. REID. In addition to that, I think there are a couple hundred \namendments filed by both sides. As happens here, with the cooperation \nof these two fine managers, we work down the number of these amendments \nand only go to the most important ones. That is what we said we would \ndo. I think it is a shame that we are going to be taken off this bill \nin about an hour. It is not good for this body, it is certainly not \ngood for this country, and it is certainly not good for the 2.5 million \npeople we respect so much who serve our military.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1377, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes equally divided between the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nand the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey has shed much \nneeded light on a disturbing problem, and that is the improper use of \nforeign subsidiaries by U.S. firms to conduct business in certain rogue \nnations where they might otherwise be barred from doing business by \nU.S. sanctions laws.\n  Like the Senator from New Jersey who has been a real leader on this \nissue, I have been very disturbed to read of allegations that foreign \nsubsidiaries of some of the best known American corporations have been \nconducting operations in countries such as Iran and Syria, even though \nU.S. sanctions laws prohibit their U.S. parents from doing so directly. \nThere are allegations that some of the subsidiaries in question are not \neven real companies but, rather, they are shell corporations that were \ncreated just for the purpose of evading the law.\n  These reports highlight that our sanctions laws are not as tough and \nas effective as they should be. In seeking a solution to this problem \nduring the past year, I have consulted extensively with the Treasury \nDepartment, the State Department, and other experts. It turns out to be \nvery complicated and presents a technical set of legal and foreign \npolicy issues to accomplish the goals that both the Senator from New \nJersey and I share.\n  Let me try to frame the choice that is now before our colleagues.\n  We have before the Senate two proposals designed to extend the reach \nof U.S. law, specifically the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct, or IEEPA, to cover companies doing business with countries covered \nby U.S. sanctions laws.\n  Let me explain what my proposal would accomplish. It does four \nthings. First, it would extend IEEPA to prevent U.S. companies from \ntrying to evade the law by moving operations overseas.\n  Second, my amendment would prohibit U.S. companies from approving, \nfacilitating, or financing actions that are illegal under IEEPA.\n  Third, it ratchets up the penalties for violations of the law from \n$10,000 per civil violation and $50,000 per criminal violation to \n$250,000 and $500,000 respectively.\n  And fourth, it ensures that the Treasury Department has the subpoena \npower it needs to enforce the new sanctions.\n  Let me explain what it would not do. Most important, my proposal \nwould not jeopardize our working relationships with key allies by \nattempting to assert U.S. jurisdiction on companies that operate and \nare incorporated elsewhere.\n  Second, it will not provide yet another incentive for American \ncompanies to move their jobs overseas through corporate inversions.\n  These are the main problems with the approach of my colleague from \nNew Jersey. Again, I emphasize that I share the same goal as my \ncolleague from New Jersey, and I salute him for focusing much needed \nattention on a very real problem.\n  Let me explain further. My colleague's amendment attempts to impose \nsanctions on businesses operating and incorporated in foreign \ncountries. So, for example, if a U.S. firm has a subsidiary in Great \nBritain, my colleague's amendment proposes to extend U.S. law to that \nsubsidiary, even if U.S. law is inconsistent with British law.\n  This is a dangerous and imperious approach to foreign policy. If \nother countries tried to impose similar rules on us, imagine how we \nwould respond. For example, imagine if Saudi Arabia tried to impose \ncriminal and civil penalties on a Saudi firm's U.S. subsidiary operated \nand incorporated under the laws of our country because that firm was \ndoing business in Israel, or imagine if Germany attempted to impose \nsanctions on a German firm's American subsidiary, again operating here \nunder our laws and regulations, for not meeting German labor laws that \nare inconsistent with our laws.\n  Moreover, my colleague's amendment would create the perverse \nincentive for American firms to invert or move overseas in order to \navoid the onerous and extraterritorial application of our sanctions \nlaws. We must not choose that path.\n  There is a very real problem here with some American companies \nexploiting an exception that is in the current law, but I believe that \nthe proposal I have advanced would greatly strengthen our laws, would \nprovide new tools for enforcement, and would enormously increase \npenalties for violations.\n  It would make crystal clear that a U.S. company is prohibited from in \nany way approving, facilitating or financing actions of a subsidiary \nthat would be illegal under the sanctions law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I extend my thanks to the Senator from \nMaine for her graciousness, in terms of describing an effort we are \nboth very much interested in, in solving a problem that exists before \nus. Very soon, the Senate is going to vote on the two amendments, both \nof them aimed at foreign subsidiaries doing business with terrorist \nnations. But only one of these amendments--and it may not come as a \nsurprise, mine--gets the job completely done.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Maine. She works very hard \nto chair a committee on which I sit, the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and accomplishes a lot. But \nunfortunately, in this case, the amendment she offered will not close \nthe loophole we are concerned about, nor will it stop American \nbusinesses from doing business with terrorist nations such as Iran.\n  It recognizes the seriousness of the problem but unfortunately, as it \nis presented, does not solve the problem. Iran is one of the world's \nlargest state sponsors of terrorism. Nobody doubts that. Every year, \nthe Iranian Government funnels tens of millions of dollars to Hamas and \nHezbollah and Islamic Jihad, to name a few. These organizations turn \naround and use that money to murder Americans and others who are trying \nto live their lives. No American company should be permitted to help \nthem in any way, either directly or with a sham corporation.\n  Iran also uses its oil revenues to fund its nuclear weapons program. \nOnce again, through sham corporations, American companies are helping \nthem develop those oil revenues. Revenues, for what purpose? The \npurpose is to attack our people and other innocents across the world. \nThat is why we do subject Iran to one of the strongest sanction regimes \nthat we have. But some American companies exploit a loophole in our \nsanctions laws. They go offshore, open a sham foreign subsidiary and \nuse that foreign subsidiary to do business with the Iranian regime with \nimpunity and help create profits for them to be used for any purpose \nthey choose.\n  This has to stop. In the past, I believe the Senator from Maine \nagreed\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\nwith me that this has to stop. In fact, last year she supported my \namendment. So I am hopeful that she will once again vote for my \namendment. I am going to vote for hers.\n  I want to be clear. I have no objection to the Collins amendment, and \nI am going to vote for it, as I said, as a signal that we must do \nsomething to stop supporting these avowed enemies of America. The \nCollins amendment is not a bad amendment, but it only codifies existing \nregulations that, frankly, are not enough. It confirms what we have now \nand permits companies to escape sanctions.\n  In the case of Cuba, we do not allow, any American company to use a \nsham to do business there. We ought not permit Iran to do the same \nthings.\n  If we want to close this loophole, my amendment is the only one that \naccomplishes it. Under the Collins amendment, the scenario on this \nplacard is still possible. Here is a U.S. corporation. Here is a \nforeign subsidiary of the U.S. corporation. They can do business with \nIran, who then sends funds to Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist \norganizations. They have their subsidiaries operating in other places. \nBut they should not have subsidiaries that are allowed to do business \nin this way.\n  We want to strengthen existing law. The way we do it is to explicitly \nsay that any foreign subsidiary, controlled by an American company, \nmust obey our sanctions.\n  The senior Senator from Michigan pointed out last week that the \nstandard we have, the sanctions standard, already applies to foreign \nsubsidiaries that do business in Cuba. I repeat what I said before. My \namendment simply applies the same rules to terrorist states such as \nIran.\n  I ask my colleagues, is fighting al-Qaida really less important than \nfighting Castro? If you vote no on this amendment, that is what you are \nsaying.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It makes clear we will \nnot allow foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to provide funds to \nIran. It is common sense. That is why a conservative group, the Center \nfor Security Policy, supports my amendment. Frank Gaffney, who is \npresident of the Center for Security Policy, said in the Washington \nTimes today:\n\n       If the Senate is serious about truly closing this loophole, \n     it must adopt the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n  That is from Frank Gaffney, president of the organization.\n  We have to stop U.S. companies from doing business with terrorists \nwhen they intend to murder innocent Americans. I ask my colleagues, \nplease support my amendment. Families across this country do what they \ncan to protect their loved ones and we can do no less. Every day we \nwait to close this loophole, more and more money flows into the hands \nof terrorists. For the sake of our troops, for the sake of our \ncitizens, we have to shut down this source of terrorist funding.\n  I again restate my intent. My intent is to support the Collins \namendment because it does open our eyes a little bit further to the \nproblem. But I hope, if we really want to solve this problem, the \nLautenberg amendment is the one that will finally be voted for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, again I commend the Senator from New \nJersey for focusing attention on what is a very real problem, and that \nis that the current law is not tough enough and there are reports that \nsubsidiaries of some very well-known American corporations are doing \nbusiness in states where U.S. sanctions laws apply. But I think when \nyou deal with this area, you need to be very careful to not craft a \nproposal that has unintended consequences.\n  Moreover, my colleague's amendment does not do what the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC, has specifically \nnamed as the legislative step that would be of most benefit to them, \nand that is substantially increasing the penalties in the current law.\n  My proposal would do that. Senator Lautenberg does not include \nincreases in the penalties.\n  In addition, my proposal explicitly grants the Treasury statutory \nsubpoena power to ensure that it has all of the enforcement tools it \nneeds.\n  But let me go back to the underlying issue. The Collins amendment \nwould be very specific in barring any action by a U.S. firm in \napproving, facilitating or providing financing for any action by its \nforeign subsidiary that would be unlawful for the parent company to \nengage in.\n  It would also prevent U.S. companies from evading the law by setting \nup a subsidiary overseas, a shell corporation. So I think the proposal \nthat I have set forth greatly strengthens the current law.\n  We do not, however, want to create a perverse incentive that would \nencourage American companies to invert and reincorporate overseas, and \nI fear that could well be the result of the amendment of Senator \nLautenberg.\n  I am concerned about something else, and I have given these examples. \nWe don't want to open the door to foreign governments trying to impose \non the American subsidiaries of firms incorporated in their countries, \ntheir countries' laws.\n  Let me give the example again. What if the Saudi Government tried to \nimpose a restriction on doing business in Israel on the American \nsubsidiary of a Saudi firm? We would be outraged about that.\n  This proposal raises many complex technical questions, and that is \nwhy the Treasury Department and the State Department have urged caution \nand much prefer the approach embodied in the Collins amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maine is expired. \nThe Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate that clarification.\n  I ask the Senator from Maine, under your amendment, is it possible \nfor a foreign subsidiary owned and controlled by a U.S. company to do \nbusiness with Iran?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield from his time, \nI would be happy to answer that question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I respect the Senator from Maine and do allow time \nfor an answer, if it is a short answer, please.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, under my amendment, it is very clear that \nan American parent could not in any way be involved in a subsidiary's \ndecision to do business in a prohibited nation. It could not approve \nit. It could not facilitate it. It could not direct it. It also could \nnot set up a subsidiary for the purpose of evading the law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator would yield for a question on my time. \nCan a subsidiary do business with Iran?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The subsidiary could not do business if it were in any \nway directed to do so, approved, financed, in any way, by the American \nparent. The language is very clear on that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I think the conclusion is in error. Rather than have \nthe debate about the precision with which the Collins amendment is \ndrawn, I point out two things. AIPAC and the Cuban American National \nFoundation support my amendment. That is very specific.\n  In the reference used about a Saudi company doing business with \nIsrael, Saudi Arabia already boycotts Israel, so that question is taken \ncare of.\n  I fail to see, I must say, why we are going through these gyrations \nexplaining a perverse effect when, in fact, what I want to do is stop \nany--by the way, the practice is taking place, currently.\n  What the Senator from Maine has done is codify regulation. I want to \nstop any possibility for a sham corporation that wants to evade our \nlaws to do business. That is where we are.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first question is on the amendment of the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

At this time, there will be 2 minutes equally \ndivided on the Lautenberg amendment, amendment No. 1351, on which the \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have just had a vote on the Collins \namendment that confirms we have a problem. There is no denying there is \na problem out there, but there is only one way to solve it; and that is \nto say that any American company cannot form a sham corporation and do \nbusiness with Iran as is presently being done. We do not permit it in \nCuba, and we should not permit it in any other place in the world. So I \nhope now I will get the same kind of support we have just seen because \nwe want to cure the problem. This is the best way to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I respect the intentions of my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, but his proposal is overbroad. It is strongly opposed \nby the administration. I urge opposition to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Craig).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair advise the Senate as to the \npending business.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1342, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a vote will now \noccur on the Frist amendment No. 1342. There will now be 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate. This will be a 10-minute vote. The \nsubsequent cloture vote that has been scheduled will also be a 10-\nminute vote.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, who is \nparticipating in a ceremony in the Rotunda, the Support Our Scouts Act \nof 2005--and I am a cosponsor--is a very important piece of \nlegislation, particularly in the wake of the tragic events that \noccurred last night. It will help ensure that the Defense Department \ncontinues to provide the Scouts the type of support it has lawfully \nprovided in the past, to include supporting the Scouts at their \njamborees.\n  In this context, I thank Senator Durbin for helping to refine the \namendment's language to provide flexibility to the agencies that \nprovide like support.\n  This amendment also ensures the Scouts have equal access to public \nfacilities, forums, and programs that are open to other youth and \ncommunity organizations. Boy Scouts, like other nonprofit \norganizations, depend on the ability to use public facilities and \nparticipate in these programs.\n  The Scouts are a youth organization, well known to every Member of \nthis body, that is committed to developing qualities such as \npatriotism, integrity, honesty, and other values in our Nation's boys \nand young men. The amendment by the distinguished majority leader makes \nthat goal clear.\n  As such, the amendment of the majority leader also makes clear that \nCongress believes the Boy Scouts should be treated the same as other \nnational youth organizations.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join the 50-plus cosponsors of \nthis legislation and vote with me and other supporters of Scouting.\n  Yesterday, July 25, tens of thousands of Scouts from around the \ncountry began arriving at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia. Tennesseans, such \nas Bill and Diane Goins from Soddy Daisy, TN, have traveled great \ndistances to participate. Vote for this amendment and let them know \nthat Congress wants the Pentagon's support to the Scouts at their \njamborees to continue.\n  Let's also let them know that not only is Defense Department \nparticipation helpful to the Scouts, it is also beneficial to the \ntraining of our armed forces.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my Senate colleagues to vote for the \nyoung boys and girls who are following in the worthy Scouting \ntradition. A vote for this amendment is a vote for them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I noted earlier when the majority \nleader offered this amendment, I support the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, \nand other youth organizations. The Frist amendment seeks to ensure that \ngovernment resources are not arbitrarily denied to youth organizations, \nwhile, at the same time, not limiting judicial review of the \nconstitutionality of government actions.\n  I want to thank the distinguished majority leader for working with me \nto address my concerns regarding section 2, in which his amendment had \nprovided a guaranteed funding level for youth organizations.\n  Together, we now have added flexibility to address cases where youth \norganizations no longer deserve the funding level they had previously \nreceived. For example, if a youth organization is convicted of a \ncriminal offense or a senior officer of a youth organization is \nconvicted of a criminal offense relating\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\nto his or her official duties, under this modification, the head of a \nFederal agency would be able to waive the guaranteed funding level. \nFederal agencies also would have the ability to waive this funding \nlevel if the youth organization is the subject of a criminal \ninvestigation relating to fraudulent use or waste of Federal funds. It \nis my expectation that Federal agencies will use ths discretion wisely.\n  Our modification also clarifies that the support that a Federal \nagency is required to provide youth organizations is subject to the \navailability of appropriations, which Congress can revisit each year.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the importance of \nour Nation's strong tradition of religious liberty, our tolerance of \nthe religious beliefs of all people, and our respect for those who do \nnot believe in God or a higher authority. This amendment respects the \nsignificance of religious liberty by not limiting the jurisdiction of \nFederal courts in determining the constitutionality of government \nsupport for youth organizations.\n  Therefore, I support this amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday, tens of thousands of Scouts \nbegan arriving at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia to attend the National \nScout Jamboree.\n  Held every 4 years at the Army base, the jamboree draws Scouts, \nleaders, and volunteers from around the world.\n  The Scouts will spend the next 10 days participating in outdoor \nactivities like archery; fishing; and geocoaching, a GPS-based \nscavenger hunt.\n  One Scout told the Washington Post:\n\n       It's just a lot fun. There's so much to do here. You get to \n     see so many people from all around and they have all sorts of \n     activities.\n\n  For the local community, the jamboree has been a great financial \nboost. Just this year alone, the event has pumped $26 million into the \ncommunity. The Scouts have spent $20 million on base improvements, \nincluding road paving and plumbing upgrades.\n  Unfortunately, this great summer Scouting tradition may come to an \nend. The reason? Because the Scouting oath includes an oath of duty to \na higher power. Despite decades of public support for Scouting, one \nFederal judge has ruled that the Pentagon can no longer provide its \nfacilities as a matter of church and state.\n  Because of this lawsuit by the ACLU, 40,000 Scouts are in danger of \nbeing denied permission to hold their jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, or \nany other publicly supported venue.\n  That is why I am offering the Support Our Scouts Act of 2005. These \nyoung people need our help and our voices to protect a great tradition.\n  Since 1910, Scouting has taught and enriched millions of boys and \ngirls, and drawn generations of Americans together.\n  Boy Scout membership has totaled more than 110 million young \nAmericans--including myself, my three boys, and over 40 current Members \nof the Senate.\n  Today, more than 3.2 million youths and 1.2 million adults are \nmembers of the Boy Scouts and Scout organizations such as the Tiger \nCubs and Cub Scouts.\n  These Americans are all dedicated to fulfilling the Boy Scouts' \nmission of instilling in our young people solid values such as honesty, \nintegrity, patriotism, and character.\n  The Support Our Scouts Act of 2005 will help ensure that the Defense \nDepartment continues to support the Scouts, as it has lawfully done for \nyears, including the summer National Scout Jamboree.\n  This amendment also ensures the Boy Scouts have equal access to \npublic facilities, forums, and programs that are open to a variety of \nother youth or community organizations.\n  Boy Scouts, like other nonprofit youth organizations, depend on the \nability to use public facilities and participate in these programs and \nforums. My amendment ensures the Scouts have fair and equal access to \nthese facilities.\n  My amendment also makes clear that the Congress regards the Boy \nScouts to be a youth organization and that the Boy Scouts--and the Girl \nScouts--should be treated the same as other national youth \norganizations.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join the 50-plus cosponsors of \nthis legislation and vote with me and other supporters of Scouting.\n  I want to thank Senator Durbin for helping to refine the amendment's \nlanguage. The Durbin modification will allow agencies to waive the \n``mandatory floor of support'' included in my proposal--but not \nnecessarily the support itself--if some senior officer of a youth \norganization or the organization itself is convicted of a serious \ncriminal offense.\n  We would expect agency heads to use this waiver sparingly and \njudiciously, and only for the most serious of offenses that are \nconnected to their official duties.\n  And once an organization has remedied the problem, we expect the \nbaseline of support to be fully restored by the federal agency to its \nprevious level.\n  The Scouts are committed to developing the best qualities in our \nNation's young people--qualities such as patriotism, integrity, \nhonesty, and compassion. This long-honored organization helps prepare \nour young people to be leaders in the communities, and leaders of the \nfuture.\n  A vote for the Support Our Scouts Act will let them know that \nCongress continues to support this worthy endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my Senate colleagues to vote for the \nyoung boys and girls who are following in the great Scouting tradition. \nA vote for this amendment is a vote for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support this amendment, as modified. It \nhas been modified to address a problem it had which did not relate to \nthe Boy Scouts but which had to do with the wording which made it \noverly broad. The language clearly depends upon an appropriate agency \nmaking either a grant or an appropriation. We support the amendment. We \nthank Senator Durbin, particularly, for his modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time having been yielded back, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1342, as modified. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Craig).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr).

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1042, an \n     original bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n     2006 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \n     for military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n         Bill Frist, John Warner, Michael Enzi, John Cornyn, Jon \n           Kyl, Richard Burr, Kit Bond, Lindsey Graham, John E. \n           Sununu, Chuck Grassley, Mike DeWine, Lamar Alexander, \n           James Talent, Pat Roberts, Johnny Isakson, Conrad \n           Burns, Richard G. Lugar.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate before the vote on cloture.\n  Who yields time?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure the record is spread \nwith the fact that we have offered everything. All we want is to finish \nthis bill tomorrow at 11 o'clock at night. We even backed it off to \n10:30. And the only amendments that would be in order would be those \nthat are within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. We \nwould have a Republican amendment, Democratic amendment, and we would \ngo through the process by these two fine managers.\n  What is wrong? What picture am I missing? Why can't we go forward and \ndo at least a little bit of work for the men and women in uniform of \nour country, namely 2\\1/2\\ million of them, plus taxpayers dollars, \n$450 billion for 1 year? Could not we at least spend 1 extra day on \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, both sides have talked about \nthe importance of the Defense authorization bill. We both feel the \nimportance of that bill. Cloture being invoked here shortly, which I \nbelieve it will, will allow us to have a Defense authorization bill in \nabout 30 hours. So we will complete our objective of having a bill if \ncloture is invoked, and I encourage people to vote for cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would just say briefly we would finish the \nbill at the same time if we entered into the agreement that I submitted \nto Senator Warner and the Republicans. Time is of no difference.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is vital that we complete action on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It is an important piece of \nlegislation that we must pass with all due haste to meet the needs of \nthe men and women of the U.S. military.\n  Defense bills are always serious matters--but this year Congress \nworks against a background of prolonged combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nworrying indicators of a force under strain, and with obligations to \ncare for a new generation of combat veterans and their families.\n  By virtually any measure, the American military is a force under \nstrain. It is a simple statement of fact--and a fact every one of us \nmust acknowledge and address so that this most magnificent military is \nnot irreparably harmed. Just 2 months ago, General Richard Myers, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported to Congress that the \nAmerican military is not as ready as it could be to meet new \ncontingencies beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. Units and personnel are \nfacing repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. So-called ``low-\ndensity-high-demand'' units and personnel are maxed-out. The Army has a \ndwindling number of Army Reserve and National Guard personnel available \nto perform combat support roles such as military police and civil \naffairs.\n  In recent weeks, two reports--one by the GAO, the other by RAND--\nhighlighted shortages in the Army Reserve. It is becoming increasingly \ndifficult for the Army Reserve to continue to provide ready forces in \nthe near term due to worsening personnel and equipment shortages. There \nare three primary causes for these shortages: the practice of not \nmaintaining Army Reserve units with all of the personnel and equipment \nthey need to deploy, personnel policies that limit the number of \nreservists and the length of time they may be deployed, and a shortage \nof full-time staff to develop and maintain unit readiness. As of March \n2005, the number of Army Reserve eligible for mobilization under \ncurrent policies had decreased to about 31,000 soldiers, or about 16 \npercent of Army Reserve personnel. But numbers don't tell the whole \nstory as those still available for mobilization may not have the skills \nand ranks needed to support ongoing operations. We must all be \nconcerned that the Army Reserve be able to provide forces that are \nready and relevant to ongoing operations.\n  But these issues--as serious as they are--will not be addressed by \nsimply rubber-stamping an important piece of legislation. I will vote \nagainst cloture because there are too many important amendments that \nwould improve this legislation and help the men and women of the \nAmerican military and their families. If we do invoke cloture, dozens \nof amendments that deserve a vote--up or down--would fall away, \nincluding amendments to protect the pay of mobilized reservists \nemployed by the Federal Government and to create mandatory funding of \nveterans healthcare. My own amendments to extend survivor housing \nbenefits beyond the end of the fiscal year, to increase funding for a \nvital weapons system sought by commanders in Iraq, and to begin the \nprocess of improving the GI Bill of Rights would never have received a \nvote.\n  I urge my colleagues to complete the defense authorization bill as \nquickly as possible and to consider the amendments which Members have \noffered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment that \nthe majority leader has decided to postpone further action on this \nyear's Defense authorization bill. This is an extremely important piece \nof legislation that deserves the Senate's full and careful \nconsideration right away. I have several worthy amendments to the bill, \nas do many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We have an \nobligation to our men and women in uniform and to the American people \nto thoroughly debate these important amendments and come up with the \nbest legislation possible for our Nation's security. If cloture is \ninvoked on this bill prematurely, the Senate will not have been able to \ntake up many of the essential amendments on which the Senate should be \nspending time, addressing such issues as pay and benefits for military \npersonnel, nonproliferation, and our detention policies. I am therefore \nhopeful that the Senate will reject attempts to cut off debate on this \nbill prematurely. Unfortunately, rather than allowing debate and action \non the Defense authorization bill to continue, the majority leader has \ndecided to move to a special interest bill instead. I am hopeful, \nhowever, that the Senate will soon be able to go back to working on a \nbill that is so important to our national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on S. 1042, the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n2006, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory \nunder the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Craig).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n48. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have a parliamentary inquiry. I would be happy to yield \nto my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was just going to ask the Presiding Officer the regular \norder.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I was going to do. I have a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. REID. Now that the Senate has defeated cloture on the Defense \nbill, will the Senate remain on this bill, which is the bill that is to \npay for our troops and protect our troops and our country, the Defense \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would be informed that under the \nprevious order--under the regular order, the Senate is to proceed to a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 397.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, then I have a unanimous consent request. \nThat request is that the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the \ngun liability bill be vitiated and that the Senate remain on the \nDefense bill and complete the Defense bill this week and the Senate \nbegin the very minute it gets back on September 6 with the gun \nliability bill, on cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I made it \nclear about 3 weeks ago to this body that we had a number of issues we \nwere going to address before leaving for recess. We listed a number of \nthem this morning. One of them was the gun liability bill. There are \nlots of roadblocks right now, barriers being thrown up to prevent us \nfrom addressing a very important bill that I believe we will show here \nshortly we have over 60 votes for. Thus, I will say one more time that \nwe intend to complete the gun liability bill before we leave, complete \naddressing it. I am very disappointed in the last vote, the fact that \nwe are not going to be proceeding with the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. I do look forward to coming back and looking at \nthat bill and passing that bill. It is a very important bill, and that \nis why we filed cloture to complete that. In all likelihood, what will \nhappen, we will proceed to the bill on gun liability, and the objective \nwill be to complete that this week, and thus I do object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, another parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. REID. When we finish the gun legislation, do we automatically \ncome back to the Defense bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should know that if the motion to \nproceed is passed, it displaces the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. REID. But that does not respond to my question. It is put back on \nthe calendar, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senate proceeds to the gun liability \nbill motion, then it would displace the DOD bill and place it back on \nthe calendar.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would ask unanimous consent that at any time determined \nby the majority leader, the Senate resume the Department of Defense \nbill at that time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate it.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that at the time determined by the \nmajority leader, we will return to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you. The majority leader said something here \ntoday that really surprised me. He said he is going to prove that the \ngun liability bill was one of the most important things we were going \nto do, and I want to know from the majority leader, does he think that \nbill is more important than the Defense authorization bill?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Regular order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does he think that the Defense authorization bill is not \nas important as gun liability?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would suggest and ask if the distinguished \nleader would modify his request to say that when we finish the gun \nlegislation, we would return to the Defense bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader----\n  Mr. FRIST. I object and I once again state my request that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, we return to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if we go \nto cloture and cloture is invoked, do we not displace the Defense \nauthorization bill for consideration in this Chamber this afternoon and \nfor the next days, if we pass it? Is that not the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If cloture is invoked on the motion to \nproceed, we will remain on the motion to proceed until time is used or \nyielded back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the answer is affirmative, that we are displacing the \nDefense authorization bill by voting on cloture on the motion to \nproceed. Am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the motion were to pass, the Senate would \ncontinue on that motion.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished majority leader \nwill bring this bill back at the earliest possible time. This is such \nan important piece of legislation. It should not be added to the tail \nend of things we do around here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8908-S8927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Whatever Members feel about gun liability, and there are \nmany divided opinions here, nothing could be more important than \nreturning to the DOD bill, supporting our troops, supporting our \nveterans. It is a $440 billion bill. The fact that we cannot debate it \nfor more than a few hours says something is wrong with this Senate. We \ncan do both. We should not leave the DOD bill until we finish. I urge a \n``no'' vote on cloture, whatever your view is on the gun liability \nprovision.\n  Mr. KYL. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Under the rules of the \nSenate, would it not be possible to debate the Defense authorization \nbill for 30 hours if we had voted for cloture or if we do vote for \ncloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would have been up to 30 hours if \napproved.\n  Mr. KYL. So we would have the opportunity if we were to invoke \ncloture to debate the Defense authorization bill for 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, we are now proceeding to S. 397, after a \nvery strong cloture vote with 66 Senators voting to move forward on \nthis legislation. It is something we have had taken up quite a number \nof times. It has broad support in terms of business groups, gun owners, \nlaw enforcement, labor unions, and sportsmen. There is nothing in it \nthat is harmful or damaging to our legal system. There is nothing in it \nthat provides any special interest protection to gun manufacturers. But \nit is a legitimate response to a growing concern that our legal system \nis being abused in such a way that could actually take legitimate \nbusinesses and put them out of business.\n  I think it is something that is of great concern to us, and this \nSenate has a majority that is ready to move forward with it. In the \ngreat spirit of our Senate, we will have a lot of debate. There are \nthose who don't approve. I know Senator Reed of Rhode Island is a \nstrong opponent of this legislation and he will certainly have a great \nopportunity to express his concerns on it. That is part of what we do. \nI note, however, this is not the first time the words will have been \nspoken on this issue. This bill has been up for some years now and has \ncome close to becoming law on several occasions, but has not yet done \nso.\n  It is important that we note that this legislation has the potential \nto impact our economy adversely. We need to look at how these proposed \nnovel legal theories adversely affect our economy. Someone will be \nmaking firearms in the world. People are not going to stop buying \nfirearms. They have a constitutional right to do so. It would be the \nheight of stupidity if we were to create laws and a legal system that \nput our firearm manufacturers out of business so that we have to buy \nimported firearms. That would not make good sense.\n  Our ultimate obligation is to the public. This body should take no \nsteps that would provide improper immunity for defective practices or \ndefective firearms that could be sold. That absolutely must not be \ndone. With that said, it is essential that we refrain from developing a \nlegal system, however, where lawyers are able to create causes of \naction and steer public policy through litigation--a public policy they \nhave not been able to win at the ballot box, and not been able to win \nthrough their State legislatures and the Congress. So since they have \nnot been able to win in the legislative branches, what we have had is a \ngroup of activist anti-gun people trying to accomplish the same goal \nthrough litigation.\n  We also need to remember in all we do regarding litigation that \npersonal responsibility is an important American characteristic. \nIndividual responsibility must not be stripped from all our \nexpectations, where plaintiffs are suing third parties on an almost \nstrict liability theory. Many trial lawyers are attempting to invent \nnew causes of action, with hopes of striking a litigation oil well. As \na result, industries such as arms manufacturing and the food industry \nare facing enormous insecurities. These industries have great reason to \nbe insecure. Everyone knows\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\nhow detrimental runaway verdicts can be and one major verdict can \nbankrupt an industry. Huge costs arise from simply defending an unjust \nlawsuit. Indeed, such lawsuits, even if lacking any merit and \nultimately unsuccessful, can deplete an industry's resources and \ndepress stock prices.\n  Defendant industries must hire expensive attorneys and have their \nemployees spending countless hours responding to the lawyers, providing \nthem information and so forth, and meeting with them. Industries, in \naddition, must purchase liability insurance which takes away from funds \nnecessary for expanding their new jobs, safety, research and \ndevelopment that they might otherwise be able to spend it on, which is \nimportant. No other nation must compete in the world marketplace \ncarrying such a huge litigation cost as American businesses do and \nparticularly gun manufacturers. Eventually, these costs are passed on \nto the consumer. Product prices increase and availability of the \nproducts becomes scarce.\n  In 1998, individuals and municipalities began filing dozens of novel \nlawsuits against members of the firearms industry. These suits are \nintended to drive the gun industry out of business by holding \nmanufacturers and dealers liable for the intentional and criminal acts \nof third parties over whom they have absolutely no control. The \nfirearms industry is particularly vulnerable to lawsuits.\n  In his testimony before a House subcommittee in 2003, the general \ncounsel of the National Shooting Sports Federation stated:\n\n       Industry-wide cost of defense to date [against these \n     lawsuits] now exceed $100 million. This is a huge sum of \n     money for a small industry like ours. The firearms industry \n     taken together would not equal a Fortune 500 company. The \n     National Shooting Sports Foundation now believes litigation \n     expenses have exceeded $150 million, Mr. President.\n\n  The danger that these lawsuits can destroy the gun industry is \nespecially ominous because our national security and liberties are at \nstake. First, the gun industry manufactures firearms for American \nmilitary forces and law enforcement agencies. Unlike many foreign \ncountries, the United States doesn't have a government armory, but \nrelies on private industry to make our firearms. Due in part to Federal \npurchasing rules, these guns are made in the United States by American \nworkers. Successful lawsuits can leave the U.S. at the mercy of \nforeign small arms suppliers.\n\n  Second, by restricting the industry's ability to make and sell guns \nand ammunition, the lawsuits threaten the ability of Americans to \nexercise their second amendment rights. I can imagine the impact the \nruin of the gun manufacturing industry would have on my home State of \nAlabama, which is one of the premier States in the Nation for hunting \nwhitetail deer and eastern wild turkey. Hunting is a part of the way of \nlife for nearly 500,000 Alabamans. That is about 1 in 9 of our \ncitizens. Imagine if they were unable to obtain hunting rifles or \nammunition. What would happen to the hunting industry, which brings \nclose to $45 million a year in revenues into the State and provides \nnearly 16,000 jobs?\n  Additionally, if the arms industry must continue to hash out massive \nlegal fees or eventually goes under, thousands of workers will lose \ntheir jobs. Manufacturers are already laying off workers to pay the \nlegal bills. Secondary suppliers to gun makers have also suffered. This \nis why it is not surprising that the labor unions representing workers \nat major firearms plants, such as the International Association of \nMachinists and Aerospace Workers of East Alton, IL, support this bill. \nThis union's business representatives stated the jobs of their 2,850 \nunion members ``would disappear if the trial lawyers and opportunistic \npoliticians get their way.''\n  Insurance rates for firearms manufacturers have skyrocketed since \nthese suits began. I am going to talk about these suits and why they \nare fundamentally wrong in a minute. These suits have caused the \ninsurance to go up and some manufacturers are being denied insurance \nand seeing their policies cancelled, leaving them unprotected and \nvulnerable to bankruptcy.\n  Thirty-three State legislatures have acted to block similar lawsuits, \neither by limiting the power of localities to file suit or by amending \nState product liability laws. However, one lawsuit in one State could \nbankrupt the industry, making all of those State laws inconsequential. \nThat is why it is essential that we pass this law.\n  The lawsuits we are talking about--the kind of lawsuits we will be \ndiscussing today are the kind of lawsuits that do not have merit. They \nare not the kind of lawsuits that ought to be brought. Many of them \neventually get dismissed by judges. Most of them do eventually. But the \ncosts are huge and, who knows, some day an activist court may start \nallowing these lawsuits to be successful.\n  The anti-gun activists, at their base philosophy, want to blame \nviolent acts of third parties--that is violent, illegal acts by \ncriminals--on manufacturers of guns, because they manufactured the gun, \nand they want to be able to sue the seller who sold the gun simply for \nselling them. This doesn't make sense. Should a car dealer be sued if \nsomeone intentionally runs down a pedestrian because the car dealer \nsold the car that was used by a third party to commit a crime, a \nhomicide? What about the car manufacturer? What an absurd thought. But \nthat is the equivalent of what these plaintiffs are arguing to recover \nfrom gun manufacturers and sellers.\n  Guns can be dangerous in the wrong hands, but so can cars. Why would \nthe manufacturer or seller of a gun who is not negligent, who obeys all \nof the applicable laws--we have a host of them--be held accountable for \nthe unforeseeable action of some criminal third party? They should not, \nand this bill would simply prohibit that.\n  If you buy a gun and someone comes into your house and attempts to \nattack you or your family and you pull out that gun and attempt to use \nit and it fails to work because it was defective, and that criminal \nharms you or your family, you should be able to sue the gun \nmanufacturer for a defective product. But if it fires as it is supposed \nto, as it was designed to, it operates like whatever widget is made in \nthis manufacturing world we are in, and it does what it is supposed to \ndo and it is a lawful product, you should not be able to be sued.\n  I don't understand how these lawsuits are being maintained. But we \nhave major cities in this country that have taken it as a policy to sue \nthe manufacturers for creating a product that works precisely as it is \nsupposed to work, that is designed according to the laws of the United \nStates, and it is sold according to the laws of the United States, and \nthey still want to sue them for an intervening criminal act. That is \ncontrary to our classical law of lawsuits and plaintiff lawsuits. It is \nsomething that I sense is being eroded, these classical principles of \nlitigation today. I think that is one reason we are beginning to have \nmovements to have court reform, lawsuit reform, around the country \nbecause courts have allowed things to go beyond what traditionally they \nwere ever allowed to do.\n  So it sort of makes these gun manufacturers a guarantor, a person who \nwould pay for all damages that might occur for a gun they manufactured. \nThat cannot be the law and must not be the law. These plaintiffs are \ndemanding colossal monetary damages and a broad range of injunctive \nrelief; that is, orders from the court concerning this. These \ninjunctions would relate to the design, manufacture, distribution, \nmarketing, and the sale of firearms. We already have laws that cover \nall of that.\n  By the way, we have had laws about all of that. We have debated other \nlaws the Congress and State legislatures have chosen not to pass. So \nthe attempt, in a very real sense, is to put pressure on these \ncompanies to do things the elected representatives have decided they \nshould not do or should not be required to do.\n  Some of the demands that are being made are the kinds of demands that \nlegislatures, not courts, should be deciding: one-gun-a-month purchase \nrestrictions not required by the State law, requiring manufacturers and \ndistributors ``to participate in a court-ordered study of demand for \nfirearms and to cease sales in excess of lawful demand,'' prohibition \non sales to dealers who are not stocking dealers with at least $250,000 \nin inventory, a permanent injunction requiring the addition of a\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\nsafety feature for handguns that will prevent their discharge by \n``those who steal handguns.''\n  That will be a pretty ingenious device, if you can make it work. It \nis going to be on every gun that is sold? It may be within the power of \nthis Congress to vote such a restriction if it can be done. It seems \nlike somewhere in my memory we voted on something such as that.\n  But to have a judge who is supposed to be a neutral arbiter in a \nlawsuit start entering injunctions to require these kinds of things is \nbeyond legitimate principles of law.\n  One of the most amusing demands was a prohibition on the sale of guns \nnear Chicago ``that by their design are unreasonably attractive to \ncriminals.'' Guns could not be sold near Chicago that are ``by their \ndesign unreasonably attractive to criminals.''\n  What would that mean? What kind of responsibility does a manufacturer \nhave? Should each court make that determination? Is that what they were \nelected to do? Is that the role of the court? No. It is a legislative \nrequirement.\n  These lawsuits are part of an anti-gun activist effort to make an end \nrun around the legislative system. That is the fact. Because their \nefforts to pass restrictive legislation have only partially succeeded, \nthey want to do more. So they are taking their cause to the judicial \nsystem hoping they will land in court before an activist judge who will \nsomehow allow their view of how guns should be sold and manufactured to \nbecome a part of a judge's order. Just impose it. One judge who may not \nbe elected--if it is a Federal judge, he has a lifetime appointment--\njust impose this by a court order. That is why people are concerned. So \nfar they have not been successful in winning these cases.\n  The Ohio Court of Appeals held that allowing this type of liability \nwould--they were correct about this--``open up a Pandora's box. For \nexample, the city could sue manufacturers of matches for arson, or \nautomobile manufacturers for traffic accidents, or breweries for drunk \ndriving.''\n  That is the same principle. I believe that judge in Ohio was correct. \nIn the city of Bridgeport v. Smith & Wesson Corporation, Judge Robert \nMcWeeny aptly stated that ``plaintiffs must have envisioned such \nsettlements as the dawning of a new age of litigation during which the \ngun industry, liquor industry and purveyors of junk food would follow \nthe tobacco industry.'' It is clearly an attempt to build on and expand \nthose kinds of theories of tobacco lawsuits to go even further than \nwhat we are dealing with here.\n  The Florida Supreme Court summed up the issue nicely when it refused \nto hear a plaintiff's appeal against the firearms industry in a \nlawsuit.\n  The plaintiff did not prevail in an appeal to the higher court in \nFlorida, and the court held this:\n\n       The power to legislate belongs not to the judicial branch \n     of Government, but to the legislative branch.\n\n  Hallelujah, Judge. I am glad you get it. Judges ought to be neutral \numpires, not activists. They should not be setting public policy. They \nshould not allow their courts to be used as a tool to further a \npolitical agenda, an agenda that has been rejected in the State \nlegislature or Congress.\n  However, all it will take is one activist judge or activist court to \ndestroy an entire industry in reality. So that is why the legislation \nis important.\n  Let me mention what this bill does and does not do. The bill is \nincredibly narrow. It only forbids lawsuits brought against lawful \nmanufacturers and sellers of firearms or ammunition if the suits are \nbased on criminal or unlawful misuse of the product by a third party.\n  I know it is hard to believe, but that is the theory of these \nlawsuits. That theory is you sold a gun lawfully, OK. You followed the \ncomplex Federal regulations that have a huge host of requirements. You \nfollowed the State legislature's requirements, often very complex, \nalso, to the T, and it comes in the hand of a criminal, and they use it \nfor a crime. Now the manufacturer and the seller are liable. What kind \nof law is that? We do not need that. These lawsuits are happening, and \nso all this would say is that those kinds of lawsuits cannot be \nbrought.\n  Manufacturers and sellers are still responsible for their own \nnegligent or criminal conduct and must operate entirely within the \ncomplex State and Federal laws. Therefore, plaintiffs are not prevented \nfrom having a day in court. Plaintiffs can go to court if the gun \ndealers do not follow the law, if they negligently sell the gun, if \nthey produce a product that is improper or they sell to someone they \nknow should not be sold to or did not follow steps to determine whether \nthe individual was properly subject to buying a gun.\n  The plaintiff can still argue that actions such as negligent \nentrustment, breach of contract, or warranty, or normal product \nliability involving actual industries caused by an improperly \nfunctioning firearm can be legitimately brought as a lawsuit and should \nbe able to be brought. Furthermore, any allegation that the bill \nburdens law enforcement is completely false. Gun manufacturers and \nsellers are already heavily regulated by hundreds of pages of statutes \nand regulations. The Government requires that all gun manufacturers, \nimporters, and dealers receive licenses. They have to have those \nlicenses. And they must keep all their records by serial number, and \neach gun has to have a distinct, separate serial number recorded before \nentering or leaving their inventory. That is, if they are manufactured \nin Massachusetts or someplace and they are shipped to Alabama, they \nship it by each one's serial number and it is recorded. If it is \nreceived by a distribution center in Alabama, it is recorded there, and \nif it is moved off to a gun store or a Wal-Mart where they sell guns, \nit is entered there. When it is sold, it is entered. That serial number \nis recorded against the name of the person who bought it. That person \nwho bought it must produce identification, must sign a sworn statement \nthat they have not been convicted of a crime, that they are not under \nthe influence of drugs, and a number of other things. They sign it. It \nis a Federal offense if they lie about it. And they do a background \ncheck.\n  So there are a lot of regulations set forth. The records have to be \nopen for inspection by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nwithout a warrant and at any time. They don't have a warrant. They can \ngo into these licensed dealers any time, any day, and examine their \nrecords. That is the burden we put on gun dealers.\n\n  They can also do annual inspections without a specific investigation \nor obtain a warrant as any other law enforcement agency can.\n  Mr. President, I think I overstated it. The ATF can without a warrant \nany time do an inspection if it is related to an investigation of a gun \nthat has been traced there, and they have an opportunity to do annual \ninspections at any time through the year as part of their enforcement \ndealings, and they do that. That guns are not heavily regulated is a \ncomplete myth. Gun dealers are carefully managed.\n  As a former U.S. attorney, I participated in the prosecution of a gun \ndealer for bad recordkeeping. He was most offended. Over a number of \nyears we have created even more regulation. He really felt put upon, \nbut he wasn't filling out the forms. He wasn't making people sign. He \nwas telling people not to put down that they lived out of State because \nthat affected whether the gun could be sold. He would tell them, don't \nfill that out, and things of that nature. He was not complying, and we \nprosecuted him. He went to jail and lost his ability to sell guns.\n  Licensed dealers have to conduct a Federal criminal background check \non their retail sales either directly through the FBI, through its \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check, NICS, or through State \nsystems that also use NICS. All retail gun buyers are screened to the \nbest of the Government's ability.\n  Additionally, the industry has voluntary programs to promote safe gun \nstorage and to help dealers avoid selling to potential illegal \ntraffickers in guns. Manufacturers also have a time-honored tradition \nof acting responsibly to issue recalls and make repairs if they become \naware of defects. Law-abiding manufacturers and dealers of firearms are \nnot threats to our society. They have not committed crimes by supplying \nour citizens with lawfully acquired firearms. It is essential that the \npeople who are guilty, people who commit the crime, who deserve \npunishment, receive the punishment. More\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nimportantly, this legislation is needed so that people who have \nsuffered a real injury from a real cause of action can be heard and \ntaken seriously while those who are trying to improperly spread the \nblame will not.\n  Mr. President, it is the responsibility of Congress to review our \ncivil litigation system, our court system, and see how it is working. \nIf over a period of years tactics and techniques are developed that \nexploit weaknesses or loopholes or gaps in that system or allow the \nsystem to be abused, then I think everybody would recognize that we \nought to take action to fix it. Every day, attorneys file lawsuits \nunder laws that we pass and the court's interpretation of those laws. \nCongress has every right to monitor this, and we have a duty once we \ndetermine a type of litigation is so legally unsound and detrimental to \nlawful commerce that it should be constrained to enact meaningful \nlegislation to constrain it and to stop abuse.\n  In the past, Congress has found it necessary to protect the light \naircraft industry, community health centers, aviation industry, medical \nimplant makers, Amtrak, computer industry members affected by Y2K \nproblems, and good Samaritans.\n  Senator McConnell offered a bill to protect a person who tried to \nsave another person, who was the victim of an accident, from dying. He \nbelieved that a person trying to do the best they can to protect \nsomeone else should not be sued, if they are somehow found to be faulty \nin a good Samaritan act.\n  Congress may enact litigation reforms when lawsuits are affecting \ninterstate commerce, and many of these lawsuits are trying to use State \ncourts to restrict the conduct of the firearms nationally. They are \ntrying to create legal holdings by the courts that would impact the \nentire industry nationally. In fact, it is the stated purpose of many \nof these groups. And a single verdict, even a single verdict, large \nverdict of an anti-gun plaintiff, could bankrupt or in effect regulate \nan entire segment of our economy and of America's national defense and \nput it out of business.\n  I do not know when there has been a better example of when this type \nof legislation is needed. We must pass this bill. It is long overdue. \nIt has 60 cosponsors. It is time for us to move forward and get it \ndone.\n  It is simply wrong when we as a Congress have approved the sale of \nfirearms in America and, through the Constitution, allowed the \nmanufacture and sale of firearms, to allow those manufacturers who \ncomply with the many rules we have set forth--they comply with those \nrules, to be sued for intervening criminal acts. They sell a gun and it \nends up in the hands of a criminal, unbeknownst to them. If they knew, \nif they had reason to know, if they were negligent in going through the \nrequirements of the law or failed to do the requirements of the law, \nthey can be sued. But if they do it right and it goes into the hands of \nsomeone who uses it for a criminal purpose, the manufacturer of that \ngun absolutely should not be subject to a lawsuit. It is a political \nthing that is going on out there, the filing of these lawsuits all over \nthe country in an attempt to crush an industry that this Congress and \nour Constitution have stated to be a legitimate industry.\n  I know Senator Reed has many wise comments on this, able Senator that \nhe is. We will disagree, but I certainly respect his views.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to S. 397, the \nso-called Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Like its \npredecessor which the Senate soundly rejected last year, this bill is \none of the most blatant special interest giveaways that I have seen \nduring my time in the Senate. At a time when more than 7.5 million \nAmericans are unemployed and our Nation faces a deficit of $333 \nbillion, war in Iraq and Afghanistan, inadequate homeland security \nfunding, and now a Supreme Court vacancy, to me the Republican \nleadership choosing to devote our precious time to a bill that would \ndeny victims of gun violence their day in court and protect the gun \nindustry is a travesty.\n  The gun lobby argues that this legislation would put an end to \nfrivolous lawsuits that claim gun companies should be liable simply \nbecause their guns are used in crimes. In fact, the bill would bar \nvirtually all negligence and product liability cases in State and \nFederal courts while throwing out pending cases as well as preventing \nfuture cases. The bill would provide this sweeping immunity to gun \ndealers, gun manufacturers, and even trade associations. Interestingly, \nthe NRA modified the bill so that this year they don't appear to be \ngranting themselves legal immunity as they did the last time around.\n  The track record for this bill in the last two Congresses has, \nthankfully, been one of failure. We can only assume that the gun lobby \nis hoping that the third time will be the charm. The gun lobby and its \nallies in Congress had to abandon their effort to pass similar \nlegislation in the 107th Congress, after the Washington area sniper \nattacks terrorized an entire region. Then last year, in one of the more \nbizarre twists in recent Senate history, the National Rifle Association \ninstructed the Republican leadership to kill the bill after a majority \nof Senators voted to add reasonable gun safety measures--to require \nbackground checks at gun shows, renew the assault weapons ban, and \nrequire child safety locks to be sold with handguns.\n\n  It is a good thing that the Senate defeated this bill because it \nwould have thrown out the civil lawsuits filed by the families of the \nvictims of the sniper attacks, even though the Washington State gun \ndealer who had the Bushmaster sniper rifle in his inventory could not \naccount for that weapon or more than 230 others. Instead, the families \nof the victims won a $2.5 million settlement from Bull's Eye Shooter \nSupply and Bushmaster, the assault weapons maker who negligently \nsupplied Bull's Eye despite its abysmal record of missing guns and \nregulatory violations.\n  At the heart here is not activist courts making law. The heart of \nthis is people who have been harmed by weapons, innocent people, people \nsuch as the victims of the Washington sniper--someone walking to their \ncar from the Home Depot and being shot and killed; a bus driver waiting \nto take his rounds in the morning, having a cup of coffee, reading the \npaper, with a wife and children at home, shot by snipers. Where did \nthey get those weapons? They got them through the negligence of a \nlicensed gun dealer. This legislation would effectively prevent those \nfamilies from recovering damages, compensation for the loss of a \nhusband and father, the loss of a wife. This is not about activist \njudges making law. This is about shutting the doors to the courts of \nAmerica, mostly State courts, to prevent those who have been harmed by \nthe negligence of others to be made whole. That is what this is about. \nThat is why it is so wrong.\n  With respect to the sort of activism of public policymaking, we all \nrecognize in this body that Federal law is one aspect, but State law is \nalso important. In fact, most tort law is based upon State law. State \nassemblies make up State laws. They decide causes of action. They \ndecide defenses. They do a lot of those things in conjunction with \nlitigation in their courts. This legislation preempts all 50 States. \nThis says to the State of Georgia, the State of Alabama, the State of \nRhode Island, the State of Michigan, you can't have the ability of your \ncitizens to go to court. Even if you believe it is appropriate and \nright in your State courts, we are preempting you. That is also wrong.\n  In addition to the monetary settlement for the victims of the \nfamilies that were the victims of the snipers, in the settlement, \nBushmaster agreed to inform its dealers of safer sales practices that \nshould prevent other criminals from obtaining guns, something \nBushmaster had never done before. What you have is a situation of \nnegligence, and this negligence can extend not only from the dealer but \nto the manufacturer. This legislation not only would deny the right of \na victim to come forward and ask for compensation, but also to reform \nthe system.\n  We have to recognize, too, that there are elaborate rules for the \ngovernance of weapons and firearms and tobacco, an agency of the \nFederal Government. But this is one industry that is virtually not \nsubject to any product liability, any consumer product safety\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\nrules, any other type of regulation. This legislation would undercut \nways in which a court could do justice. Because the Senate rejected \nthis legislation last year, these victims and their families had their \nday in court, and at least one manufacturer's commercial practices were \nimproved in ways that benefit all Americans. What could be more helpful \nto all of us if a manufacturer takes the time and the effort, \nappropriately, to inform his dealers about appropriate practices in \nselling weapons, about avoiding selling weapons to those people who \nmight be trafficking in weapons, avoiding selling weapons to those \npeople who might be irresponsible and reckless in the use of those \nweapons? That can only benefit all of us.\n  But despite all of these things, we find ourselves again in a \nfamiliar situation, one in which the NRA's pet project is again being \ngranted a virtually direct, nonstop ticket to the Senate floor. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee has held no hearings on this legislation, \nand no committee markups were ever scheduled. The bill's supporters \nknew it would be difficult to withstand the kind of scrutiny that might \nresult in careful, deliberate, and thorough committee hearings, so they \nbrought it straight to the Senate floor. Here we are today. Now it is \nup to us make sure that there is a full and vigorous debate, including \nnot only amendments to deal directly with aspects of this legislation \nbut also to address other issues with respect to violence in America \nand gun safety.\n  If we are going to grant blanket legal immunity to the firearms \nindustry, it is imperative that we address inadequacies in other areas \nwith respect to gun safety legislation. Mothers and fathers across \nAmerica go out of their way every day to protect themselves and their \nchildren from harm. How unsettling it must be for these families to \nthink that the gun industry, which is already exempt from Federal \nproduct safety regulations that apply to children's toys, \npharmaceuticals, and virtually every other product in this country, may \nnow receive legal protection that no other industry enjoys.\n  I listened closely to the Senator from Alabama talking about this as \nif a car manufacturer was being held responsible for the actions of \nothers. Well, they could be in certain situations. If a car dealer \nleaves his cars unlocked with keys in the ignition at night and someone \ncomes and takes that car, drives it away, causes damage, certainly the \nissue arises, was that car dealer using good common sense? Certainly, \nthat would be a case that would at least get to the notion of filing \nthe case.\n  This bill would prevent such a similar case from the gun \nmanufacturers and the gun dealers, but there is no attempt, at least \ntoday, to limit those types of liability to other manufacturers. I \nbelieve that shows how narrow this is and how it is focused to a very \nspecial interest. That is unfortunate.\n\n  As with any other business, there are good actors and bad actors with \nrespect to the gun industry. There are those who carefully follow the \nlaw and those who ignore it. But granting unprecedented legal immunity \nto the entire industry without requiring any additional \nresponsibilities to protect the public from reckless behavior would be \na grave mistake. It will only encourage those who already engage in \nquestionable conduct.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we work through this debate, to listen \nclosely and to try to recognize that we are taking unprecedented action \nwith respect to undermining the traditional system of common justice. \nFirst, we are usurping authority for State law that is traditionally \nthe purview of State assemblies and legislatures. Then we are granting \nan unprecedented immunity to one very particular industry. That might \nbe a precedent, unfortunately, for other industries that come forward, \nwhich would be a severe unraveling of the protections we all have.\n  All of this, again, begins not with someone going out to stage a \nlawsuit by being shot. That is the last thing that happens. The victims \nof this gun violence, who are the subject of these suits, didn't want \nto be victims. They didn't want to be in court. The bus driver waiting \nthere to start his run was not thinking, Oh, boy, someone is going to \nshoot me so we can start a case and change public policy. He was shot \nby a sniper who obtained a gun through the negligence of others. Yet \nthat family would have been denied their relief in court if this bill \nhad passed last year.\n  There was discussion about personal responsibility. There is personal \nresponsibility. It is important. It is fundamental to everything we do. \nWhat about the responsibility of the gun dealer to know how many \nweapons he has on hand, where they are, not to leave it out so it can \nbe taken? Apparently the youngest sniper, who was barely of age, just \npicked it up off a counter and walked out of the store with it, a rifle \nthat was used later to shoot and kill several people. Where is that \npersonal responsibility? And if you are the victim of that lack of \nresponsibility, how can you have your day in court if this legislation \npasses?\n  Now, we have a lot of work to do in this Congress. We should get on \nwith it. That is why it is amazing that we have left the Defense bill \nthat would provide the resources to protect our soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, airmen and airwomen across the globe to move to this very \nnarrow, special interest bill. I think it is extremely unfortunate.\n  A part of the rationale for this bill advanced by the proponents is \nthat there is a crisis. There is a crisis with respect to the industry. \nThey are about to lose their ability to manufacture. They are going to \ngo bankrupt. We won't have any weapons for our national security. That \nis not substantiated by any of the facts before us.\n  The gun lobby says it needs protection because it is faced with a \nlitigation crisis. The facts tell precisely the opposite story. There \nis no crisis. There is a crisis in Iraq. There is a crisis in \nAfghanistan. There is a crisis across the globe with international \nterrorists. That is a crisis. But it is not a crisis with respect to \ngun liability in this country. Yet we move from legislation dealing \nwith these huge crises, some of which have existential consequences to \nus, particularly if terrorists ever get their hands on any type of \nnuclear material, to a situation where there is no crisis.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would like to yield the hour allotted to me to the \nfloor manager, the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The only two publicly held gun companies that have filed recent \nstatements at the Securities and Exchange Commission contradict the \nclaim that they are threatened by lawsuits. Smith & Wesson filed a \nstatement with the SEC on June 29, 2005, stating that:\n\n       We expect net product sales in fiscal 2005 to be \n     approximately $124 million, a 5% increase over the $117.9 \n     million reported for fiscal 2004. Firearms sales for fiscal \n     2005 are expected to increase by approximately 11% over \n     fiscal 2004 levels.\n\n  That is their SEC report which they have to file subject to severe \npenalties for misstatement and mistruth. I believe that. It appears to \nbe a banner year for Smith & Wesson. There is no crisis.\n  They go on and say in another filing on March 10, 2005:\n\n       In the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred \n     $4,535 in defense costs, net of amounts received from \n     insurance carriers, relative to product liability and \n     municipal litigation.\n\n  What they said is--this company, with a banner year of increased \nsales, with projections for better sales--they incurred $4,535 in out-\nof-pocket costs to defend product liability and municipal litigation \nclaims and suits. That is a crisis? Sales are up. Litigation costs in \nthis particular area--out-of-pocket costs, to be accurate, of $4,500. \nThat is what they are telling the Federal regulators, under severe \npenalties for misstatements and even inaccurate statements. There is no \ncrisis.\n  In that same period for which they incurred $4,535 in out-of-pocket \ncosts, Smith & Wesson spent over $4.1 million in advertising. Maybe the \nreal crisis is they have to spend a lot on advertising. But that is not \na crisis situation. That is not sufficient to bring the Senate here to \ndebate a bill to give them protections from these types of suits.\n  Meanwhile, gun manufacturer Sturm, Ruger told the SEC in a March 11, \n2005 filing:\n\n       It is not probable and is unlikely that litigation, \n     including punitive damage claims,\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\n     will have a material adverse effect on the financial position \n     of the Company.\n\n  Essentially, what these two publicly reporting companies have said, \ndespite all of the discussion by others that they are on the verge of \nbankruptcy, is: There is no material adverse effect on our financials \nbased on this type of litigation. There is no crisis.\n  So at the same time the gun makers are reporting to the SEC that \nlitigation costs are not likely to have a material adverse effect on \nthe businesses, their trade associations have been rapidly inflating \nthe unsubstantiated estimates of litigation costs. Gun lobby claims of \nalleged litigation costs have risen in $25 million increments, with no \ndata of any kind to support these claims because most of these \ncompanies in the industry are privately held. But I would suggest if \nthe publicly held companies are offering their truthful admissions to \nthe SEC--unless the privately held companies are woefully unmanaged or \nare unusually involved in this type of litigation--then these estimates \nhave to be widely suspect.\n  Here are the claims of increased costs: April of 2003, estimated \nlitigation has cost the industry $100 million in the last 5 years; July \nof 2004, estimated litigation costs of $150 million; November of 2004, \nestimated litigation costs of $175 million; February of 2005, some \nestimates talk about $200 million.\n  Now, it does not seem to track when you have major companies saying \nthey have no material impact, paying out of pocket $4,500, and then you \nhave these wildly inflated estimates.\n  Number of lawsuits faced by the gun industry is, if anything, far \nless than many other industries. From 1993 to 2003, 57 suits were filed \nagainst gun industry defendants, out of an estimated 10 million tort \nsuits, according to the State Court Journal published by the National \nCenter for State Courts--57 out of 10 million. That is not a record of \nlitigants out of control.\n  The actual monetary awards faced by the gun lobby are even less. The \ngun lobby's record in court is far worse than the tobacco industry's, \nwhich for decades won every case brought against it. But the gun lobby \nhas not lost them all either. In fact, many of the cases my colleague \nfrom Alabama was citing were some appeals court cases that were turning \ndown plaintiffs who were unsuccessful at the trial court level. The \nresults of these cases are what one would expect as suits against any \nindustry: Some cases are dismissed, some cases are won by plaintiffs, \nsome are on appeal, others are the result of a settlement between the \nparties.\n  Now, the fact is, most of the legal defense costs faced by gun \nindustry participants have been covered by product liability insurance, \nwith very little funding coming out of pocket. Again, every industry in \nthe country has to insure itself against these risks. It seems to me \nthere is nothing to indicate the insurance claims against these gun \nlobbies and gun manufacturers are out of line with those. In this \nrespect, the gun lobby is no different than any other industry. \nMoreover, the power of the gun lobby to protect itself from litigation \nand promote its views is illustrated by the war chest it has put \ntogether for this specific purpose over the past several years.\n  In 1999, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and others in the \ngun lobby created what is known as the Hunting and Shooting Sports \nHeritage Fund by setting aside a small percentage of industry revenues. \nThe fund supports lobbying activities as well as industry public \nrelations initiatives emphasizing the positive aspects of firearms, and \nit helps cover the cost of retaining internal memos and other sensitive \ndocuments with a law firm in California so the gun lobby can avoid the \nkind of unwanted leaks and exposure that plagued the tobacco industry \nfor many years. Some reports indicate the fund has raised as much as \n$100 million.\n  We are going to be talking about a lot of victims of gun violence \nover the next few days, and I can tell you that none of them has access \nto a $100 million war chest to protect their legal interests or promote \ntheir point of view.\n  In any case, the purpose of lawsuits filed on behalf of victims is \nnot to bankrupt the industry. In fact, some of the cases filed have \nsought only injunctive relief, including reforms of industry trade \npractices that would make the public safer. This is not always about \nmoney. In some cases it is about safety for the general public.\n  It is telling that the new Senate version of the gun industry \nimmunity bill has been changed specifically to ban suits seeking \ninjunctive relief. The argument, of course, is there is a crisis, and \nthe crisis is the financial crisis of the gun manufacturers and the gun \ndealers, but yet this legislation was altered this year to avoid \ninjunctive relief, which has very little direct impact in terms of \nawards, punitive or otherwise.\n\n  Even when plaintiffs seek commonsense reforms in the industry that \ncould save lives, rather than have money damages, the gun lobby and its \nallies in Congress seek to shut the courthouse door in the face of \nthese victims.\n  The findings section of the bill states:\n\n       [T]he possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n     industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse \n     of the legal system.\n\n  That sounds reasonable until you consider that the very essence of \nthe cases the bill seeks to eliminate is that the harm suffered by \nvictims of gun violence is often not solely caused by others, but that \nspecific negligent conduct by defendants in the industry contributed to \nthat harm. That is a key point here. This is not a situation as to \nanyone in the industry--a manufacturer or dealer--who has followed all \nthe rules and has done everything correctly, and then someone else did \nsomething wrong. In order to bring a suit for negligence, you have to \npoint out, allege at least negligent activities on behalf of the \ndefendant, be he or she a manufacturer or dealer. So the core here is \nthe allegation that the defendant--those people this legislation seeks \nto immunize--did something wrong. Liability attaches if a court finds \nthey did something wrong.\n  Moreover, the bill would exclude many cases that do not seek to hold \nthe entire industry liable but instead focuses on specific dealers or \nmanufacturers based on their negligent contribution to specific \ninstances of harm to victims of gun violence. This is not just a \nsituation where the whole industry is sued. This is a situation where \nanybody in the industry who is sued gets the benefit of these \nprotections.\n  Unfortunately, this bill would overturn longstanding, widely accepted \nprinciples of civil liability law, which generally holds that persons \nand companies may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of their \nwrongful acts. By throwing out common law standards established \nthroughout our Nation's history by State courts, and substituting new \nstandards for negligence and product liability actions conceived by \nattorneys of the gun lobby, this bill would deprive Americans of their \nlegal rights in cases involving a wide range of industry misconduct.\n  Even if we concede, for the sake of argument, that some cases against \nthe industry might be frivolous, this bill applies the legislative \nequivalent of a weapon of mass destruction where a surgical strike \nwould be sufficient. The bill proposes a sweeping Federal intrusion \ninto traditional State responsibilities for defining and administering \nState tort law, yet there is no evidence that the State courts are not \nhandling their responsibilities competently in this area of law. There \nhas been no rash of questionable jury awards, and not a single decision \nor final judgment of any court that justifies this unprecedented \nlegislation.\n  Nevertheless, the bill's proponents seek to preempt the law of 50 \nStates to create a special, higher standard for negligence and product \nliability actions against gun manufacturers, gun dealers, and trade \nassociations.\n  We are being asked to do this for an industry that already enjoys an \nexemption from the Federal health and safety regulations that apply to \nvirtually every other product made in this country. There is no crisis. \nThere is no showing that the gun lobby is in danger of extinction as a \nresult of lawsuits.\n  We must look at the facts and not the rhetoric. Again, as to a \ncompany that spends out of pocket $4,500 a year, when their sales are \nincreasing by about 11 percent, that is not a crisis. There is nothing, \nI think, substantiated to suggest otherwise.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are going to engage in a series of discussions \nover\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nthe next several days here. But I think we have to be very clear, this \nlegislation would undercut State laws and State court practices that \nhave existed for as long as the country has existed. It would do so for \nthe benefit of a very special interest group. It would deny access to \ncourts for people who have been harmed, really harmed.\n  Let's take some of these cases. Take the case of Denise Johnson, the \nwife of the late Conrad Johnson. Conrad Johnson was the bus driver who \nwas the final sniper victim of the Washington area snipers. The \nsnipers' Bushmaster assault rifle was one of more than 230 guns that \ndisappeared from the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply gun store in Washington \nState. The gun store's careless oversight of firearms in its inventory \nraised serious questions of negligence that fully deserved to be \nexplored by the civil courts.\n  Two hundred thirty misplaced weapons--if that is not at least a \nsuggestion of some negligence, I do not know what is. This legislation, \nhad it been enacted last year, would have denied the Johnson family \ntheir rights in court, their rights to go to that alleged negligent \ndealer and say: Without your action, without your negligence, my \nhusband, our father, would be alive today.\n  But in addition to that, the manufacturer's actions also were \nquestionable. Despite questionable control activities in relation to \ntheir inventory at Bull's Eye--serious and well-known problems at the \ngun store--they were still able to acquire weapons from the \nmanufacturer. As I indicated before, the Johnsons were able to settle \ntheir claim in court. But if this legislation had passed last year, \nthey would have been thrown out.\n  Now, there are other examples that are prevalent that also would have \nbeen dismissed by this legislation had it been passed, and future cases \nif, in fact, we pass it in this session.\n  There is the case of David Lemongello and Ken McGuire, former police \nofficers of Orange, NJ. On January 12, 2001, Mr. Lemongello and Mr. \nMcGuire were shot several times by a violent criminal who should never \nhave had a gun. Because of the injuries he suffered, Mr. Lemongello \nwill never be a police officer again. The gun used in the shooting was \none of 12 guns purchased by 2 individuals on a single day from Will \nJewelry & Loan, a gun dealership in West Virginia.\n  Mr. James Gray, a felon, used a woman with a clean record to purchase \nall 12 guns at once with cash. He and the woman came into the gun shop \nwith thousands of dollars, and Gray pointed out guns he wanted, and \nthen had the woman purchase them in a clear example of a ``straw \npurchase'' to evade the law. In fact, the gun dealer was so concerned \nabout the suspicious transaction that, after taking the money and \ngiving him the gun, he called the ATF. But it was too late; the guns \nwere already destined for the illegal market. The actions of the gun \ndealer--who failed to follow sales guidelines recommended by the \nNational Shooting Sports Foundation--raise serious questions of \nnegligence.\n\n  The manufacturer of the gun, Sturm, Ruger, is a member of NSSF, yet \nit failed to require its dealers and distributors to follow the \nguidelines. At one point in the proceedings, the West Virginia gun \ndealer and the manufacturer of the gun asked Judge Irene Berger of \nKanawha County, West Virginia, to dismiss the case. She heard the gun \nseller's legal arguments and rejected each of them, applying the \ngeneral rule of West Virginia law to allow the case to proceed.\n  Here is a classic example. Someone comes in with another person, \npurchases 12 guns at once, selects the guns, and pays with cash, but \nmaking sure the other person is the one whose name is run through the \nFBI records check, and then drives away. Doesn't that raise suspicion \nin your mind if you are a conscientious dealer? Don't you do anything \nother than call ATF? That is negligence in many respects. Certainly a \nvictim of that crime eventually should have the right to take that case \nto court.\n  The gun industry bill would have overridden that judge's decision in \nWest Virginia and thrown out the case of the police officers. Again, \nthe Senate rejected this legislation last year, and in June 2004 \nOfficers Lemongello and McGuire won a $1 million settlement to \ncompensate them for their career-ending injuries. After the lawsuit, \nthe dealer and two other area pawnshops agreed to implement safer \npractices to prevent sales to traffickers, including a new policy of \nending large-volume sales of handguns. These practices go beyond the \nlaw and are not imposed by any manufacturers or distributors.\n  So here is another situation. It is not only the immediate \ncompensation to these police officers whose whole lives and careers \nhave been changed irrevocably; it is also making it safer for other \npeople so the next time someone wanders into this particular gun shop \nof this dealer, they won't be selling 12 or so handguns without \nseriously checking who is buying.\n  Today, as we face another attempt in the Senate to take away the \nrights of innocent victims of gun lobby negligence, there are still \nmany legitimate pending cases that will be thrown out by the bill \nbefore the Senate. We can always anticipate additional situations. In \nfact, there is a very strong likelihood that if this legislation \npasses, whatever steps are taken today by gun dealers and manufacturers \nwill be abandoned or lessened because effectively they have a free \npass. No one can sue them. They don't have to worry about the litigant \ngoing to court and saying, your sales practices or your behavior were \nnegligent. We have given them immunity. In fact, one might even \nanticipate more incidents.\n  But there are cases pending today that could be affected. For \nexample, in another case, Guzman v. Kahr Arms, a lawsuit was filed by \nthe family of 26-year-old Danny Guzman of Worcester, MA, who was \nfatally wounded when a 9 mm gun stolen from a gun manufacturer's plant \nwas stolen by a drug-addicted employee who had a criminal record. The \nmanufacturer, Kahr Arms, operated the factory without basic security \nmeasures to protect against thefts, such as metal detectors, security \nmirrors, or security guards. Guns were routinely taken from the factory \nby felons it had hired without conducting background checks. The gun \nused to kill Danny Guzman was one of several stolen by Kahr Arms \nemployees before serial numbers had been stamped on them, rendering \nthem virtually untraceable. The guns were then resold to criminals in \nexchange for money and drugs.\n  The loaded gun that killed Mr. Guzman was found by a 4-year-old \nbehind an apartment building near the scene of the shooting. Had Kahr \nArms performed drug tests or background checks on the prospective \nemployees or secured its facilities to prevent thefts, Danny Guzman \nmight be alive today. A Massachusetts judge has held that the suit \nstates a valid legal claim for negligence. But this bill would throw \nthe case out of court, denying Danny's family their day in court.\n  That is the reality of this legislation. That is what we are \nprotecting. We are protecting manufacturers who take no care in hiring \nemployees, yet give them access and proximity to weapons, and who \nemploy no effective security measures. That, at least, is negligence. \nAt least they should be tried in court. This legislation would immunize \nthat.\n  Ask yourselves again, What incentive would manufacturers such as Kahr \nArms have to spend any money on background checks, to spend any money \non security? None at all because, frankly, they have a free ride, a \npass. No one can touch them. And in this legislation we are not about \nto start regulating the manufacturing practices of gun manufacturers in \nthe United States.\n  Now, every industry has good actors and bad actors and the firearms \nindustry is no exception. There are manufacturers that produce high-\nquality products that feature necessary devices to make the firearms as \nsafe as possible. There are other manufacturers that create poorly \ndesigned, poorly constructed firearms that are favored by criminals, \nthat have no place in the home, at the shooting range, or on hunting \ngrounds. Likewise, there are licensed dealers who comply with both the \nletter and the spirit of our gun laws and do everything in their power \nto ensure firearms are sold only to lawful buyers. There are other \ndealers who routinely sell guns regardless of the age or criminal \nbackground of the buyer. Essentially, they wink and look the other way.\n\n  This small minority of bad apple dealers has a significant impact on \ngun\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\nviolence on our streets throughout the country. According to the \nFederal data from 2000, 1.2 percent of dealers account for 57 percent \nof all guns recovered in all criminal investigations; 57 percent of the \nguns recovered in criminal investigations pass through their hands. \nDoes that suggest there are some gun dealers who are negligent, who are \nnot following the letter or the spirit of the law? And the gun \nmanufacturers know who the problem dealers are because when guns are \nrecovered at crime scenes, they receive firearm tracing reports that \nshow which dealers sell disproportionally to criminals. But in too many \ncases, the gun industry refuses to police itself.\n  If this legislation passes, there will be less incentive to take \nprecautions, to take steps to prevent guns from getting in the hands of \nthose people who would use them irresponsibly.\n  The national crime gun trace data from 1989 through 1996 gathered by \nthe U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives indicates \nthe following gun dealers sold the highest number of crime guns in \nAmerica and exhibited crime gun tracing patterns indicative of drug \ntrafficking. Whereas most gun dealers have been associated with zero \ngun traces, guns sold by these suspect gun dealers turn up in the wrong \nhands over and over again.\n  For example, in Badger Outdoors, Inc., of West Milwaukee, Wi, the \ndealer sold 554 guns traced to a crime, and 475 of those guns had a \n``short time to crime'' as defined by ATF. The guns were involved in at \nleast 27 homicides, 101 assaults, 9 robberies, and 417 additional gun \ncrimes. The dealer also sold at least 1,563 handguns in multiple sales. \nFrom 1994 to 1996, straw purchaser Lawrence Shikes bought 10 guns from \nBadger. In one case, he immediately sold the gun to an undercover \nFederal agent who told Shikes he was a felon. Several weapons Shikes \npurchased have been recovered from a killer, a rapist, a convicted \narmed robber, a man who shot a police officer, and three juvenile \nshooting suspects.\n  So, again, a very small percentage, but still we are immunizing these \npeople also. This legislation doesn't make any distinction between \ncompetent, conscientious gun dealers. It is everyone. And we know \neverybody is not following the rules as scrupulously as they should.\n  To put a check on the behavior, if you are harmed and injured by this \nnegligence, go to court and say, I have been harmed, this defendant \ncontributed to my injury and I seek compensation, this legislation will \ntell that victim, go away; the courts are closed to you.\n  There are other cases. Realco Guns of Forestville, MD; Southern \nPolice Equipment, Richmond, Va; Atlantic Gun & Tackle, Bedford Heights, \nOH; Colosimo's of Philadelphia, PA; Don's Guns & Galleries in \nIndianapolis, IN. Throughout the country, the exception to the rule, \nand the rule is generally conscientious individuals follow the laws. \nBut this legislation protects these individuals as well as the \nconscientious dealers. Again, it is inappropriate, unfortunate, \nunsubstantiated.\n  Where is the crisis? All the public records we have of the gun \nmanufacturers say there is no material impact on the financial well-\nbeing. Those are reports submitted to the SEC, not press releases from \nlobbying groups. We are going to upset the traditions of tort law \nthroughout this country for a situation where no crisis exists.\n  Again, we have moved from consideration of one of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation we consider every year, the Armed \nForces authorization, to deal with this issue--no crisis, no substance, \nbut an industry-political motivation by the NRA and the gun lobby to \nprotect their members from bona fide allegations of negligence in \ncertain cases.\n  There is no explosion of suits. These are minimal, a fraction of the \ntort suits in this country. Yet we are here today to devote a huge \namount of time after moving away from the Defense bill to consider this \nlegislation. Procedurally, it is terrible. We should be talking now, as \nwe all hoped we would, about further benefits for our military \npersonnel, about improving their quality of life, improving their \nequipment, giving them the resources to defend us. Yet we are now \nstaked out, literally, to try to provide benefits for the negligence of \na few people in an industry that has no financial crisis and is in no \ndanger of going away.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there still remains a very serious \nproblem and a very serious threat to gun manufacturers in the United \nStates. Sure, a lot of these cases have not been successful because \nthey are so bogus, so contrary to classical rules that a person is not \nliable for an intervening action done by a criminal, an intervening \ncriminal act.\n  I will add, when I was a U.S. attorney, an individual walked off a \nveterans hospital grounds and was murdered. They sued the VA hospital \nfor wrongful death. I defended on the theory that the hospital could be \nliable under certain circumstances, but there was a strong principle of \nlaw which I cited that an intervening criminal act is not foreseeable. \nYou are not expected to foresee that someone will take a lawful product \nand use it to commit a crime or that they would commit a crime. This is \na settled legal principle.\n  We are eroding these things and we end up with all kinds of problems. \nThat is one of the things disrupting our legal system, particularly if \nthere is a political cause here, a group of people who absolutely \noppose firearms in any fashion. Mayors in major cities are encouraging \nthese lawsuits and pushing them. We end up with some real problems.\n  Let me share with our colleagues this letter from Beretta \nCorporation. It was mailed out in 2005 by Mr. Jeff Reh, general \ncounsel, written to the Vice President of the United States. He says a \nfew weeks ago the District of Columbia Court of Appeals issued a \ndecision supporting a DC statute that those manufacturers of semi-\nautomatic pistols and rifles are held strictly liable for any crime \ncommitted in the District with such a firearm.\n  It had not been used until the District of Columbia recently filed a \nlawsuit against the firearm industry in an attempt to hold firearm \nmakers, manufacturers, importers, and distributors liable for the cost \nof criminal gun misuse in the District.\n  The court of appeals, sitting en banc, dismissed many parts of the \ncase but did rule that:\n\n       Victims of gun violence can sue firearm manufacturers \n     simply to determine whether that company's firearm was used \n     in the victim's shooting, and if so, they become liable.\n\n  He goes on to say that such a decision ``will make firearm \nmanufacturers liable for all costs attributed to such shootings, even \nif the firearm involved was originally sold in a State far from the \nDistrict of Columbia and to a lawful customer.''\n  If you sell a gun to somebody in Minnesota and they bring it to DC \nand some criminal uses it to shoot somebody, the gun manufacturer now \nbecomes liable for that Beretta or Smith & Wesson or whoever made it. \nThey go on to say this decision ``has a likelihood of bankrupting not \nonly Beretta, but every maker of semiautomatic pistols and rifles since \n1991.'' There are hundreds of homicides committed with firearms each \nyear in DC, and others are injured. And the defendants, under this \nbill, would have no defense that they originally sold the pistol or \nrifle to a civilian customer. So they ask that this legislation be \nsupported.\n\n       Without it, companies like Beretta, Colt, Smith & Wesson, \n     Ruger, and dozens of others, could be wiped out by a flood of \n     lawsuits emanating from the District. This is not a \n     theoretical concern.\n       The instrument to deprive the United States citizens of the \n     tools through which they enjoyed a second amendment freedom \n     now rests in the hands of trial lawyers in the District. \n     Equally grave, control of the future supply of firearms \n     needed by our fighting forces and law enforcement officials \n     and private citizens throughout the country also rests in the \n     hands of these attorneys. We will seek Supreme Court review \n     of this decision, but the result of a Supreme Court review is \n     not guaranteed. Your help might provide our only chance of \n     survival.\n\n  It is the principle of the thing we are concerned about, first and \nforemost. Do we believe that a manufacturer who complied with the law \nand who sold a gun in Minnesota or in Kansas and sold it lawfully, \naccording to the rules of the State of Alabama or Minnesota and Federal \nGovernment rules, and that gun ends up in the District of Columbia, \nthey now become liable for an intervening criminal act? That is not a \nprinciple of law that can be defended,\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\naccording to justice or fairness. But we are in that mode now of using \nthe courts to effect a political agenda that goes beyond what the \nCongress and elected representatives are prepared to vote. In effect, \nit would bankrupt these companies and may be able to prohibit people \nfrom even having firearms or certainly denying them a place to go buy a \nnew firearm and ultimately denying them the right to purchase firearms.\n\n  So that is what we are concerned about. We are not trying to \noverreach here. We are trying to eliminate this political abuse of the \nlegal system to effect a policy decision not subject to being won in \nthe legislative branch.\n  Under this bill, I think it is very important to note that you can \nsue gun sellers and manufacturers who violate the law. It is crystal \nclear in the statute that this is so. To start off, one of the first \nthings it says is an action can be brought against a transferer--that \nis, a seller--of a gun by any party directly harmed by the product of \nwhich the transferee is so convicted for violating the law. It also \nsays this in paragraph 2:\n\n       These are actions that are allowed to be maintained by this \n     legislation and are not constricted.--An action brought \n     against a seller of the gun for negligent entrustment for \n     negligence per se.\n\n  It is some sort of negligent act that gave the gun to the customer. \nWe will leave it at that.\n  No. 3, an action can be brought against a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product, or gun, who knowingly violated a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product when that \nwas the proximate cause of the injury, such as the 12 guns being sold \nand mentioned by Senator Reed earlier. I suspect that violated a law. \nIt is certainly a violation of the law for a person to knowingly or \nnegligently entrust a gun to someone when they believe or have reason \nto believe that it is a straw purchase. That would be a violation of \nthe law. You have to produce an ID, sign a statement, say it is your \ngun, say you have not been convicted of a crime, say you are not a drug \naddict, where your residence is, and other laws that States and \ncommunities may have, such as waiting periods, before you can pick it \nup. You have to wait for the background check to see if those \nstatements you made are valid.\n  So you can still bring those lawsuits if you don't comply with that. \nLawsuits can be brought whenever the manufacturer or seller knowingly \nmade any false entry or failed to make, negligently or otherwise, an \nappropriate entry in any record required to be kept under Federal or \nState law with respect to the qualified product or if they aided or \nabetted or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious \noral or written statements with respect to any material fact to the law \nnecessary in the sale or other disposition of the qualified product. \nAnd if they can maintain a lawsuit also, if you aided and abetted or \nconspired to sell or dispose of a qualified product, knowing or having \nreasonable cause to believe the buyer of the qualified product was \nprohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm, which would include \na straw purchase, if you know you are selling it to this person and you \nknow it is going to that person, then you would know that would be \nimproper and it would be a negligent entrustment or violation of the \nstatute.\n  I think those are important exceptions, as are many others. So it \ndoesn't give immunity to gun dealers. That much we can say for sure. \nNow, it has been said that, well, these dealers--this little gunshop \ndown here did something wrong and they would have insurance and the \ninsurance company would pay. It is not so bad on them. But, Mr. \nPresident, that is a slippery slope, an unwise public policy argument \nthat I think we use too much. One of the things that raises questions \nin my mind about the effectiveness of a lot of litigation today is it \nis argued that it is going to punish this person who did something \nwrong. But in truth, the insurance company pays all of it probably--\nmaybe all of it, maybe a small deductible is paid by the wrongdoer, and \ninsurance company pays the cost of defending the lawsuit. It is not the \nwrongdoer. So the juries are told they are punishing this wrongdoer who \nmade an error, but really the insurance company pays it. What happens? \nThey raise the rates on everybody. So if one gun dealer has messed up \nand he gets sued, as he should be, and he has to pay a verdict, the \nweird way our system is working today is the insurance company pays the \nverdict, and everybody's rates go up--every gun dealer who complies \nwith the law, their rates go up too. It is something that has been \nbothering me as time goes by.\n  They are stating, as legal theories, broad powers and requesting \nbroad relief, similar to some of the things I mentioned here in the \nDistrict of Columbia in the Beretta letter. Sometimes the plaintiffs \nhave argued that the very sale of a large number of guns and pistols, \nwhen a manufacturer knows that some of those ``might'' end up in the \nhands of criminals, means that they become liable. What kind of law is \nthat? It is a stretch beyond the breaking point that if you comply with \nthe law, you sell a firearm to a lawful customer in your shop and they \nhave the proper identification, and you take all the proper steps, \nsomehow that you become liable if that person utilizes it unlawfully or \nsells it or gives it to somebody who utilizes it unlawfully.\n  That is not the way the American legal system works. Those are the \nkinds of lawsuits being pushed, I submit, for political reasons because \npeople are frustrated that they have not been able to get the \nlegislatures to eliminate firearms. Who should be liable? The person \nwho commits the crime. John Malvo--if he commits a crime using a gun, \nhe should be the one that pays and is sued in our system but, of \ncourse, people say Malvo doesn't have any money, so we will sue Wal-\nMart because Wal-Mart sold the gun to somebody and it eventually went \nthrough somebody's hands and they got it, or whatever store sold the \ngun. Or we will even sue Smith & Wesson in Boston because they sold the \ngun and somebody was injured with it. What kind of law is that? I am \nvery concerned about this theory. We have moved so far from our \nprinciple of liability. That is why it is quite appropriate here. And \nthere may be other instances with other businesses around the country \nthat are being unfairly held liable for actions that should not be \ntheir responsibility.\n  I will make a point about the serial number. I raised an issue I am \npersonally aware of. The manufacturers have to put a serial number on \nevery gun, which has to be recorded every step of the way as it moves \nfrom the manufacturer, to the distributor, to the subdistributor, to \nthe retail store, to the customer. They are recorded and kept up with. \nA statement is filed including the name, address, phone number, \ndriver's license, and a number of other things that are required by \nState and Federal law before it can ever be sold. It is now, and has \nbeen for many years, a crime to produce a gun that does not have that \nserial number, and it is a crime to erase it. It is a crime to sell a \ngun that doesn't have a serial number on it or has a number that has \nbeen erased. When I was a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted many cases--\n30, 40, or 50 cases--in which criminals, thinking they could somehow \navoid detection, would file off the serial number or somebody filed it \noff for somebody and delivered it to them, and both of them have \ncommitted a crime at that point. That is because we want to be able to \nidentify that weapon and not have it subject to moving around without \nbeing able to be identified.\n  I would just say, there are a lot of laws that we pass in our legal \nsystem to clamp down on the sale of guns because they are, indeed, a \ndangerous instrumentality. But our Constitution provides the right of \ncitizens to keep and bear arms. Our State and local laws provide that \nprotection to our citizens, and we set many restrictions on it. The \nproblem we are dealing with is the possibility that courts will create \nlegal liability on a manufacturer of a lawful product, a lawful product \nthat has been sold according to the strict requirements of Federal and \nState law, and that they somehow become an insurer of everything wrong \nthat occurs as a result of the utilization of that lawful product.\n  All we are trying to do is bring some balance. I think the statute \nhas been gone over for many years now. People on both sides of the \naisle understand; there are probably 60-plus votes of people who are \nprepared to vote for this\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\nlegislation. One reason it has that kind of broad support is that the \nbugs have been worked out of it. Things that would have gone too far \nhave been eliminated. People have had many months to review it. I think \nwe have a good piece of legislation.\n  I respect my colleagues who differ, but I strongly think it would be \nin the interest of good public policy to pass this legislation, and \nthat is why I support it.\n  I offer the letter from the Beretta Corporation and ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,\n\n                                       Accokeek, MD, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     Vice President of the United States, Eisenhower Executive \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: A few weeks ago, the Washington, \n     D.C. Court of Appeals issued a decision supporting a D.C. \n     statute that holds the manufacturers of semiautomatic pistols \n     and rifles strictly liable for any crime committed in the \n     District with such a firearm.\n       Passed in 1991, the D.C. statute had not been used until \n     the District of Columbia recently filed a lawsuit against the \n     firearm industry in an attempt to hold firearm makers, \n     importers and distributors liable for the cost of criminal \n     gun misuse in the District. Although the Court of Appeals \n     (sitting en banc in the case D.C. v. Beretta U.S.A. et al.) \n     dismissed many parts of the case, it affirmed the D.C. strict \n     liability statute and, moreover, ruled that victims of gun \n     violence can sue firearm manufacturers simply to determine \n     whether that company's firearm was used in the victim's \n     shooting.\n       It is unlawful to possess most firearms in the District \n     (including semiautomatic pistols) and it is unlawful to \n     assault someone using a firearm. Notwithstanding these two \n     criminal acts, neither of which are within the control of or \n     can be prevented by firearm makers, the D.C. strict liability \n     statute (and the D.C. Court of Appeals decision supporting \n     it) will make firearm manufacturers liable for all costs \n     attributed to such shootings, even if the firearm involved \n     was originally sold in a state far from the District to a \n     lawful customer.\n       Beretta U.S.A. Corp. makes the standard sidearm for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces (the Beretta M9 9mm pistol). We have long-\n     term contracts right now to supply this pistol to our \n     fighting forces in Iraq and these pistols have been used \n     extensively in combat during the current campaign, just as \n     they have seen use since adopted by the Armed Forces in 1985. \n     Beretta U.S.A also supplies pistols to law enforcement \n     departments throughout the U.S., including the Maryland State \n     Police, Los Angeles City Police Department and to the Chicago \n     Police Department. We also supply firearms used for self-\n     protection and for sporting purposes to private citizens \n     throughout our country.\n       The decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals to uphold the \n     D.C. strict liability statute has the likelihood of \n     bankrupting, not only Beretta U.S.A., but every maker of \n     semiautomatic pistols and rifles since 1991. There are \n     hundreds of homicides committed with firearms each year in \n     D.C. and additional hundreds of injuries involving criminal \n     misuse of firearms. No firearm maker has the resources to \n     defend against hundreds of lawsuits each year and, if that \n     company's pistol or rifle is determined to have been used in \n     a criminal shooting in the District, these companies do not \n     have the resources to pay the resultant judgment against \n     them--a judgment against which they would have no defense if \n     the pistol or rifle was originally sold to a civilian \n     customer.\n       When the D.C. law was passed in 1991, it was styled to \n     apply only to the makers of ``assault rifles'' and \n     machineguns. Strangely, the definition of ``machinegun'' in \n     the statute includes semiautomatic firearms capable of \n     holding more than 12 rounds. Since any magazine-fed firearm \n     is capable of receiving magazines (whether made by the \n     firearm manufacturer or by someone else later) that hold more \n     than 12 rounds, this means that such a product is considered \n     a machinegun in the District, even though it is semiautomatic \n     and even if it did not hold 12 rounds at the time of its \n     misuse.\n       The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (S. 397 and. \n     H.R. 800) would stop this remarkable and egregious decision \n     by the D.C. Court of Appeals. The Act, if passed, will block \n     lawsuits against the distributors and dealers of firearms for \n     criminal misuse of their products over which they have no \n     control.\n       We urgently request your support for this legislation. \n     Without it, companies like Beretta U.S.A., Colt, Smith & \n     Wesson, Ruger and dozens of others could be wiped out by a \n     flood of lawsuits emanating from the District.\n       This is not a theoretical concern. The instrument to \n     deprive U.S. citizens of the tools through which they enjoy \n     their 2nd Amendment freedoms now rests in the hands of trial \n     lawyers in the District. Equally grave, control of the future \n     supply of firearms needed by our fighting forces and by law \n     enforcement officials and private citizens throughout the \n     U.S. also rests in the hands of these attorneys.\n       We will seek Supreme Court review of this decision, but the \n     result of a Supreme Court review is also not guaranteed. Your \n     help in supporting S. 397 and H.R. 800 might provide our only \n     other chance at survival.\n           Sincerest and respectful regards,\n\n                                               Jeffrey K. Reh,\n\n                                                  General Counsel,\n                                         and Vice-General Manager.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is an important debate and \ndiscussion, but I ask unanimous consent to speak on a different topic \nand have it count against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Guaranteed Veterans Healthcare\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I had hoped at this time to come to the \nfloor to vote on an amendment that I introduced with Senator Tim \nJohnson and other colleagues, to make sure that veterans health care \nfunding is, in fact, secured and stable for the future through an \namendment which was supported by the American Legion--by many groups--\nthe Disabled American Veterans, Blind Veterans of America, Jewish War \nVeterans of the USA, AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed \nVeterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Vietnam Veterans--all of \nwhom want us to pass the Stabenow amendment which would make veterans \nhealth care funding mandatory, reliable, rather than having the \nsituation we are in with the VA coming to us with a shortfall right now \nand asking for emergency funding, then a debate on what we are going to \ndo for next year.\n  This is a very important amendment. It was pending prior to the vote \non whether to invoke cloture, or to bring one level of debate to a \nclose. If cloture had been invoked, this amendment would not be in \norder to be voted on. It would not have been in order, which is why, \namong other reasons, I voted not to proceed to invoking cloture.\n  There are a number of very important amendments that address the \nneeds of our troops and their families, and other important issues \nabout keeping us safe, securing nuclear materials, and other critical \nissues that were brought forward by colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. These are amendments that need to be debated and included, in \nmany instances, I would say, in the Defense reauthorization bill.\n  I am deeply disappointed that instead of proceeding with that work \nand getting it done in the next day or two, which we on this side of \nthe aisle committed to do--our leader indicated we would commit to stay \nhere and get that work done--instead of doing that, we saw the \nleadership put this aside and go to another issue that is of concern, I \nknow, to the gun industry.\n  But we are at war. We are at war. We have men and women who need our \nbest efforts, both those who are our troops serving us, as well as \nthose who have a veteran's cap on right now who have served us in other \nwars or come home from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I want to speak to the Defense authorization bill which I strongly \nsupport, as well as the amendment that I hope we will return to when we \ncome back to the Defense bill. I hope it will be very quickly because \nour men and women in the armed services are counting on us to get the \nwork done and make it the best product we can possibly make it in terms \nof our national defense and the Defense reauthorization.\n  I do support the 2006 Defense authorization bill. I believe providing \nthe equipment and resources our service men and women need to do their \njobs is one of our most important responsibilities, which is why I wish \nwe were debating that right now. This duty is especially important, as \nI said before, in a time of war. As everyone knows, our men and women \nin uniform are under tremendous stress as they either prepare to deploy \nor are currently serving their country in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am \npleased the Defense reauthorization bill will authorize a 3.1-percent \npay raise for military personnel and provide $70 million in additional \nfunds for childcare and family assistance services for our military \nfamilies.\n  I know Senator Murray has an additional amendment that relates to \nsupporting families and childcare, which I think is very important.\n  Foremost in the minds of the men and women in uniform with whom I\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\nvisit is the safety and security of their families. The bill that was \npulled in order to have this debate on gun manufacturers is a bill that \nalso authorizes $350 million in additional funding for up-armored \nvehicles, and $500 million for the Improvised Explosive Device Task \nForce.\n  It also continues our strong support for the Nunn-Lugar cooperative \nthreat reduction programs that work to keep weapons of mass destruction \nout of the hands of terrorists--an incredibly important effort that \nneeds to be fully funded and receive our full commitment in every way.\n  These and other important provisions of this legislation will help \nmake our country safer, make our troops safer and more capable as they \nserve us abroad.\n  I met with men and women from Michigan and across the country who are \nrecovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Some have suffered minor \ninjuries that will not have a dramatic impact on the rest of their \nlives. Others, because of their injuries, will need years of \nrehabilitation and will face considerable obstacles as they return to \ntheir civilian lives. We owe these men and women our continued support \nso they can recover from their injuries and lead productive lives.\n\n  Today's soldiers are tomorrow's veterans. America has made a promise \nto these brave men and women to provide them with the care they need \nand deserve. They deserve the respect and support of a grateful nation \nwhen they return home. We also owe it to the men and women who have \nfought America's prior conflicts to maintain a place for them in the VA \nsystem so they can receive the care they need. We need to keep our \npromises to our veterans, young and old.\n  Today, I was privileged to participate in a press conference before \nthe question came up about closing debate on these kinds of amendments. \nI was pleased that the current National Commander, Tom Cadmus, who is \nfrom Michigan, was there representing the American Legion. There were \nnumerous other veterans organizations represented, as I listed earlier \nin my comments. All of them were saying to us: Let's stop this taking \nfrom one pocket to put in the other, taking from Peter to pay Paul, \nwith our veterans. Let's keep the promise of veterans health care, \nperiod, and put veterans health care into a category that will allow \nthat to happen on an ongoing basis.\n  I believe we must consider the ongoing costs of medical care for \nAmerica's veterans as part of the continuing costs of national defense. \nThe long-term legacy of the wars we fight today is the care for the men \nand women who have worn the uniform and been willing to pay the \nultimate price for their Nation.\n  Senator Johnson and I and other colleagues are offering this \namendment, which is currently still pending on the Department of \nDefense reauthorization, to provide full funding for VA health care to \nensure that the VA has the resources necessary to provide quality \nhealth care in a timely manner to our Nation's sick and disabled \nveterans. The Stabenow-Johnson amendment provides guaranteed funding \nfor America's veterans from two sources. First, the legislation \nprovides an annual discretionary amount that would be locked in future \nyears at the 2005 funding level. Second, in the future--and \nimportantly--the VA would receive a sum of mandatory funding that would \nbe adjusted year to year based on changes in demand from the VA health \ncare system and the rate of health care inflation. In other words, it \nwould depend on the number of veterans rather than this arbitrary \ndebate now on inflationary increases.\n  We know the current formulation has not worked because the VA tells \nus that they are over $1 billion short now in funding for health care \nservices for our veterans. I think that is absolutely inexcusable, and \nit needs to be fixed permanently. The amendment that we have offered \ncreates a funding mechanism that will ensure that the VA has the \nresources it needs to provide a steady and reliable stream of funds to \ncare for America's veterans, and it will also ensure that Congress will \ncontinue to be responsible for the oversight of the VA health care \nsystem, as it does with other Federal programs that are funded directly \nfrom the U.S. Treasury.\n  In fact, this amendment would bring funding for veterans health care \ninto line with almost 90 percent of the health care funding that is \nprovided by the Federal Government. Almost 90 percent of federally \nfunded health care programs are in the mandatory category, not \ndiscretionary. Why in the world would we say to our veterans they don't \ndeserve the same kind of treatment in terms of the Federal budget for \nmandatory spending that other programs receive, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid?\n  The amendment also requires a review in 2 years by the Comptroller \nGeneral to determine whether adequate funding for veterans health care \nwas achieved. Depending on the outcome of this review, Congress would \nhave the opportunity to make changes to the law to ensure that veterans \nreceive the care they deserve.\n  The problem we face today is that resources for veterans health care \nare falling behind demand. In other words, we are creating more \nveterans than we are covering under our health care system. Shortly \nafter coming into office, the President created a task force to improve \nhealth care delivery for our Nation's veterans. The task force found \nthat historically there has been a gap between the demand for VA care \nand the resources to meet the need. The task force also found that:\n\n       The current mismatch is far greater . . . and its impact \n     potentially far more detrimental, both to the VA's ability to \n     furnish high-quality care and to support the system to serve \n     those in need.\n\n  The task force released its report in May of 2003, well before we \nunderstood the impact of our men and women fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and what that would mean to our veterans' health care \nsystem. If this mismatch between demand and resources was bad in May of \n2003, imagine what it is today. That is why we see this gap. That is \nwhy we need to address--and the Senate has now passed, twice--$1.5 \nbillion for emergency spending for veterans health care.\n  Over 360,000 soldiers have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nover 86,000 have sought health care up to this point from the VA.\n  There are an additional 740,000 military personnel who served in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. They are still in the service. This next generation of \nveterans will be eligible for VA health care and will place additional \ndemands on a system that is already strained.\n  In addition, each reservist and National Guardsman who has served in \nIraq is eligible for 2 years of free health care at the VA. I support \nthat. The administration has in its own way admitted that they do not \nhave sufficient resources to provide adequate care for America's \nveterans. While they would not until recently admit that there was a \nshortfall, they have for years attempted to ration care and cut \nservices at the expense of our Nation's veterans. This is just not \nacceptable.\n  In 2003, the VA banned the enrollment of new priority 8 veterans. For \nthe past 3 years I fought attempts by the administration to charge our \nmiddle-class veterans a $250 enrollment fee to join the VA health care \nsystem, and a 100-percent increase in prescription drug copays.\n  This year the administration also proposed slashing Federal support \nfor the State veterans homes from $114 million to $12 million. The \nheads of the Grand Rapids Home for Veterans and the D.J. Jacobetti Home \nfor Veterans in Marquette tell me these cuts would be devastating to \nthem in serving our veterans in Michigan. The fiscal year 2005 and 2006 \nVA health budgets are a case study in why Congress should guarantee \nreliable and adequate resources through direct spending. Last March, \nthe President submitted an inadequate fiscal year 2005 budget request \nfor VA health care to Congress. That fell $3.2 billion short of the \nrecommendation of the Independent Budget, which is an annual estimate \nof critical veterans health care needs by a coalition of leading \nveterans organizations. In fact, in February 2004, Anthony Principi, \nthen the Secretary of the VA, testified before Congress that the \nrequest the President submitted to Congress fell $1.2 billion short of \nthe amount he had recommended. It then fell to Congress to again \nincrease the amount provided to VA for health care. The final amount \nCongress provided to the VA for health care was $1.2 billion over the \nPresident's request. While above the President's request, it was\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\nstill not enough to meet the immediate needs.\n\n  In April of this year, I supported an amendment by Senator Murray to \nthe fiscal year 2005 supplemental to Iraq and Afghanistan to provide \n$1.9 billion for veterans medical care, specifically for those veterans \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  During the debate on the amendment, we were again told that the \nPresident's budget was sufficient. In fact, on April 5, Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Jim Nicholson sent a letter to the Senate that said:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in the 2005 budget to continue to provide \n     timely quality service. That is always our goal.\n\n  Mr. President, since April the story has changed, and we now know the \ntruth.\n  On June 23, 2005, the VA testified before Congress that they \nforecasted a 2.5-percent growth in demand--in other words, more \nveterans, as we have all been saying, more veterans coming into the \nsystem--when in fact the increased demand this year is 5 percent. They \nsaid 2.5 percent; it actually was 5 percent. This has left the VA with \na $1 billion shortfall. I was proud to support an amendment the \nfollowing week to the Senate's Interior appropriations bill that \nprovided an additional $1.5 billion for veterans health care. The \nfollowing day, on June 30, the House passed emergency supplemental \nlegislation that would cut this by $575 million, in line with the \nPresident's request.\n  At the time, our friends in the House suggested that the Senate was \nmaking up numbers. In fact, we wanted to be sure that the VA had enough \nfunds to cover the shortfall and to cover any potential shortfall of \nnext year. As it turned out, we received more bad news from the \nadministration a couple weeks ago, on July 14, when the administration \nrequested another $300 million for this year and a whopping $1.7 \nbillion for next year. The total shortfall for this year and next now \nstands at nearly $3 billion.\n  The Interior appropriations bill is currently in conference. I am \nhopeful that the bill will include $1.5 billion for this year, as the \nSenate has twice unanimously supported. Further, last week the Senate \nAppropriations Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, \nunder the able leadership of Senator Hutchison and Senator Feinstein, \nincluded extra funding to cover the 2006 shortfall in VA health care.\n  Mr. President, I recall all of these events to make two points. \nFirst, it is clear that the demand for VA health care is increasing, \nand a good portion of this increase can be attributed to men and women \nseeking care after they have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. Second \nis to show that despite the best intentions of the VA and Congress, the \nVA does not have a reliable, and dependable stream of funding to \nprovide for veterans health care needs. We should not have to pass an \nemergency funding bill to give our veterans the health care they have \nearned.\n  Imagine that. It is not acceptable. It has been over a month and \nCongress has still not resolved the $1.3 billion shortfall in VA \nmedical services for this year. We owe our service men and women more \nthan that.\n  In 1993, there were about 2\\1/2\\ million veterans in the VA system, \nand there are more than 7 million veterans enrolled in the system, over \nhalf of which receive care on a regular basis today. Despite the \nincrease in patients, the VA has received an average of a 5-percent \nincrease in appropriations over the last 8 years. At last count, at \nleast 86,000 men and women who have returned from Iraq have sought \nhealth care from the VA, and we can safely assume this number will \nreach hundreds of thousands. This bill gives the resources our troops \nneed to prepare and defend our country in Iraq. We must not forget them \nwhen they come home. We have an obligation to keep our promises to our \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I am very hopeful that we will quickly return to the \nDefense reauthorization bill and have the opportunity to show our \nveterans all across America that we will permanently keep our \ncommitment to them by passing the Stabenow-Johnson amendment. There are \nother important amendments that remain in front of us now because we \nhave discontinued the opportunity for us to improve on this bill, a \nbill I support, but a bill that needs to be the very best that we can \ndo for our men and women serving us today and for our veterans. I hope \nwe will quickly return to it and that we will get about the business of \ncontinuing to work on these critical amendments and quickly bring this \nto a close. And we can do it this week if there is the will to do it so \nthat we provide the very best to our men and women in service and those \nwho have come home and put on the veterans cap.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time under the 30 hours to \nSenator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. First, let me thank the Senator for yielding the time. I \nappreciate that very much. I want to make some brief comments.\n  My colleague and friend from Alabama made reference to the Beretta \nCompany and apparently their concern about legislation in the District \nof Columbia. I want to make a few points to clarify what I believe the \ncontext of this letter from Beretta is. First, the District of Columbia \nCouncil apparently passed strict liability legislation which is an \nexample of an elected body, not a judge, making up laws. We might \ndisagree with them, but the point is that this is an elected body doing \nthis; this is not judge-made law. As I understand it, the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia simply upheld the statute. They \nacted appropriately, procedurally correct, and the statute is in force. \nI do not know if this is the intent of the suggestion, but a lot of the \ndebate today has been about letting legislators and legislatures do \ntheir jobs without defying the court. In this situation of Beretta, \nthat is exactly what happened. The DC Council acted, the court of \nappeals said we have no reason to disagree substantively with what you \nhave done and the law stands.\n  But I think there are much more important points to be made in the \ncontext of this legislation. The proposed legislation is not simply \nattempting to eliminate claims of strict liability against gun \nmanufacturers, gun dealers, and trade associations. It goes all the way \nto wiping out a broad array of negligence claims. And the essence of \nnegligence is that the defendant, or the one who is being accused of \nnegligence, must fail to perform some duty, the duty to the injured \nparty.\n  There has to be some personal action, not simply doing something that \nhas been legislatively ruled to be wrong. In that context, one can look \nat the concerns of the Beretta Company about strict liability much \ndifferently than in this legislation, and I think it would be wrong to \nassume and argue that because they are concerned about strict liability \napplied entirely to the legislation before us.\n  Now I assume they oppose the legislation. But the issue is much \nbroader than strict liability; it is negligence. It is not a situation \nwhere a manufacturer or an individual will be held liable for something \nthey never did. The essence of negligence is you have to fail to \nperform a duty, and that is at the heart of the legislation before us, \nproviding broad exemptions and immunities for gun dealers, gun \nmanufacturers, and trade associations whose own conduct would at least \nlead to allegations in court of negligent behavior.\n  I wanted to make those two points, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask to speak on a nongermane topic for \napproximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the time \nwould be counted against the 30 hours; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No objection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\n                              Brian Harvey\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to honor Brian Harvey. He is a \nloving husband, father, grandfather, teacher, advocate, and a hero in \nthe fight to protect Americans from deadly asbestos.\n  Anyone who has followed the debate over asbestos in Congress will \nimmediately remember Brian for his booming voice, for the way he could \ncapture the attention of every person in a packed committee hearing \nroom and for his commitment to saving lives and bringing victims the \njustice they deserve.\n  This picture shows him doing what he did best: urging Congress to ban \nasbestos and to protect victims. Brian Harvey is my hero.\n  Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to report to the Senate that \nBrian passed away on Friday, July 22. Today, I want to extend my \ncondolences to his entire family, including his wife Sue, his daughter \nValerie, his stepchildren Ethan, Anne, and Amy, and his three \ngrandchildren. But mostly I want to share my thanks that Brian was \ngiven more time on this Earth than many asbestos victims and that he \nused that time to help others.\n  I was very lucky to work with Brian over the past 3 years. We came \ntogether at an important time in both our lives and in the history of \ncongressional action on asbestos. Back in 2002, Brian was defying the \nodds in fighting mesothelioma and looking for a way to share his \nexperience and to help others. At the same time, I was 1 year into my \neffort in the Senate to ban asbestos.\n  I was surprised and horrified to learn that asbestos was still being \nput in lots of commonly used consumer products on purpose. In my \nresearch, I learned about the deadly toll of asbestos diseases and \nabout the lack of prevention, research, and treatment. I wrote a bill \nto address those critical needs. I was very proud to have Brian Harvey \nat my side and at the podium as I introduced that bill in June of 2002.\n  Brian Harvey is my hero because he never hesitated to stand up and \nspeak truth to power. Whenever we had a hearing or press conference, \nwhenever Senators needed to understand the horror of asbestos disease, \nwhenever my legislation needed a little boost or a powerful push, Brian \nHarvey was the first person on a plane from Washington State all the \nway here to Washington, DC.\n  Like so many asbestos victims, Brian was exposed to asbestos through \nno fault of his own. Brian grew up in Shelton, WA, and like me he \nattended Washington State University. During his summers back in \ncollege, Brian worked at a paper products mill in Shelton, WA. That is \nwhere he was exposed to asbestos fibers, but the damage of that \nexposure would not be revealed until three decades later.\n  In September of 1999, Brian experienced shortness of breath and \nfatigue. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and the odds were stacked \nagainst him. Most people diagnosed with mesothelioma who do not receive \ntreatment die within 8 months. Those who do receive treatment increase \ntheir life expectancy to an average of only 18 months. Overall, a \nperson's chance of surviving 5 years is 1 in 20. Brian lived 6 years \nafter being diagnosed. He was truly one in a million.\n  Brian Harvey was lucky in many ways. He was diagnosed early. He got \nexperimental treatment at the University of Washington. He had skilled \ndoctors and medical professionals, and he had the support of his entire \nfamily and many friends. Many asbestos victims are not that lucky. \nBrian recognized that, and he used the time he was given to speak up \nfor others whose lives and families have been torn apart by asbestos.\n  Brian Harvey is my hero because he did not despair about his own \npersonal challenges. Instead, he shared those challenges with all of \nus, helping us to understand the threat and to inspire change in our \npublic policy. And he did it with an actor's presence and a deeply \nhuman personal touch. Brian used to say to me that the left side of his \nbody was made of Gore-Tex. And it was. But that did not explain Brian's \ntoughness or his determination.\n  That came solely from his heart.\n  Brian Harvey is my hero because he made a difference. He pushed \nCongress to treat victims fairly and to ban asbestos. While that work \nis still a work in progress, Brian's voice and passion echo as loudly \ntoday as they did that day 3 years ago when he stood beside me as we \nintroduced the bill for the first time. Brian Harvey is my hero because \nin the face of so many challenges that could have drained his energy, \nhe found the strength inside to fight the good fight.\n  Every time I stood up for asbestos victims, Brian Harvey was at my \nside. He was there on June 28, 2002, when I first introduced my bill. \nHe was by my side in June of 2003 when we stood together to call for \nfairness for asbestos victims. On March 5, 2003, Brian testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and with his passion and power he \ncalled for increased detection and fair compensation for asbestos \nvictims. Three months later, on June 24, 2003, the Judiciary Committee \nincluded my ban in its reform bill. On March 25, 2004, at a press \nconference to call for passage of my bill, Brian Harvey was there as \nwell.\n  It is very hard for me to picture the next hearing or press \nconference without Brian standing by my side. But I will continue the \nfight. When Brian and I met 3 years ago, the odds were against both of \nus. The medical odds were against Brian. Every day for him was a \ntriumph. And the legislative odds, the chance we could pass a bill, \nwere against both of us. We have made progress, but we are not there \nyet. I know it will be harder without Brian's advocacy, but I also know \nhe has done so much to bring that goal now within reach. I know \neventually we will ban asbestos, we will ensure victims are treated \nfairly, we will find new treatments for asbestos disease, and we will \nprotect future generations from this epidemic. When that day comes, all \nof us will have Brian Harvey to thank.\n  Again, I extend my thoughts and my prayers to Brian's lovely family \nand his many friends. Last week, when Brian was in the hospital, I \nspoke to his wife Sue and his daughter Anne. Brian was not well enough \nfor me to speak with him, but I talked to the nurse at his bedside. I \nasked her to tell Brian something that I have always wanted him to \nknow: You are my hero. Brian Harvey was given extra time on this planet \nto help other people. That is exactly what he did. Brian Harvey will \nalways be my hero.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tragedy At The Boy Scout Jamboree\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when people ask me what is the best \nthing about Alaska, I can talk about the mountains, I can talk about \nthe trees, I can talk about our great salmon. They are all very \nwonderful, very special. But the very best thing about Alaska is its \npeople. The spirit of voluntarism and civic engagement is what makes \nAlaska one of the best places in the Nation to live and to raise \nfamilies.\n  Alaskans not only invest their time and energy in their own children, \nthey also invest it in the development of their neighbors' children. \nThis spirit of giving manifests itself in the thousands of hours that \nadult volunteers contribute to youth activities, such as Scouting.\n  Scouting enriches the lives of young people in many parts of my State \nbecause adult volunteers give generously of their time to work with our \nyoung people. My two boys have proudly participated in Scouting in the \nMat-Su Western District as members of Troop 176 in Anchorage. I am very \nproud of the opportunities they have through Boy Scouts.\n  Now, as we know, last evening there were four adult volunteers who \nwere associated with the Western Alaskan Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica who lost their lives at the Boy Scout Jamboree which is taking \nplace at Fort A.P. Hill near Fredricksburg, VA. Accounts in the \nnewspapers this morning back home in Anchorage were riveting,\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\ntragic, and I think they hit all of us in a place in our heart we are \nalways going to remember.\n  Mr. President, the four gentlemen who were killed last evening were:\n  Ron Bitzer of Anchorage. Ron and his wife Karen had just recently \nmade the decision to move out of State. They were selling their home, \nand they were going to be moving out of State.\n  Michael LaCroix, who I had the privilege of working with on the Boys \n& Girls Club board. Mike was a small businessman and owned a very \nsuccessful business in Anchorage. He was with his son here in the \njamboree.\n  Michael Shibe of Anchorage was also here with two of his sons, twin \nboys.\n  The fourth individual was Scott Powell. Scott moved from Alaska, as I \nunderstand, just last year. He had served for more than 20 years as the \nprogram director of Camp Gorsuch, which is the Boy Scout camp in \nAlaska.\n  In my office today, we were talking about Scott Powell and the \nrecognition that just about every Boy Scout in Alaska and the moms and \ndads who go either to help out at the camp or go there for the end-of-\ncamp ceremonies knew, recognized, and loved Scott Powell. He touched \nthe lives of countless Alaskan youth.\n  All of these gentlemen are going to be terribly, terribly missed.\n  Another Alaskan volunteer, Larry Call, of Anchorage, was injured in \nthe incident. We understand he is hospitalized. Of course, we are \npraying for his speedy recovery.\n  I do not intend to dwell this afternoon on the tragic details of what \nhas happened. The fact is, these men are heroes and should not be \nremembered for the way they lost their lives but for how they lived \ntheir lives. This is a phrase that was coined by Vivian Eney, the widow \nof a U.S. Capitol Police officer, who lost her husband in a sudden and \nunexpected training accident.\n  The four Scout leaders who we pause to think about today will be \nremembered for the way they lived their lives. They will be remembered \nas heroes for the service they gave to the young people of Alaska.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nobserve a moment of silence so we may reflect upon the events that \noccurred last evening and so we may also express our love and our \nsupport for the Scouts and their family members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my message to the families of these \nfive outstanding leaders and to all of the Boy Scouts in Alaska and \naround the world is simple: Please know that the Senate and, indeed, \nthe Nation grieves with you on this very difficult day.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski for her \neloquent remarks and for taking this opportunity to reflect on the \ncontribution of these Boy Scout leaders to the moral and spiritual and \nemotional and psychological maturation of young boys.\n  The truth is, young boys today are having a harder time than girls in \nrelation to their graduation rate from college, their crime rate, their \nimprisonment rate. There are other problems occurring in boys. Boys are \nstruggling in our society today.\n  I am a strong believer in the Boy Scouts. I thank so much the Senator \nfrom Alaska for her kind remarks. I had the honor to be an Eagle Scout. \nEvery Thursday night, a group of us from Hybart, AL, met in Camden, AL, \nwhich was 15 miles north of Hybart. Hybart was just a little crossroads \ncommunity. My father had a country store. There were a couple little \nstores. People were farmers and carpenters and worked at the railroad \nor whatever.\n  There were nine boys there. Of those nine boys, eight became Eagle \nScouts. I don't think a single one had a parent who graduated \ncompletely from college. One became a Life Scout, he almost became an \nEagle Scout. And as I think of those kids with whom I grew up, they did \nwell. One is a Ph.D. now, teaching at the University of South Carolina. \nOne is a dentist in Charleston. One is a medical doctor, Johnny Hybart \nfrom Hybart. He is in Pensacola now, working at the hospital there. Bob \nVick is a CPA. Pete Miles is an engineering graduate and a former plant \nmanager at a major corporation. And Andy and Greg Johnson both \ngraduated from college, one in engineering and one in business, and are \nvery successful. Mike Hybart graduated with a horticulture degree from \nAuburn and is in the real estate business now.\n  It was a great pleasure for me to participate as a member of Troop 94 \nin Camden. As the Senator from Alaska read the names of Michael Shibe \nand Michael LaCroix and Ronald Bitzer and Scott Edward Powell, who were \nkilled serving their boys, I thought of people who meant so much to me: \nJohn Gates and Peyton Burford and Billy Malone and Dean Tait, and quite \na number of others, and Rev. Frank Scott, my Methodist preacher who \ntraveled with us on trips, and how much that meant to me and us as a \ncommunity and how it shaped our lives in ways that are really \nunknowable.\n  I also remember the most exciting trip I ever took; it was with Troop \n94 and we stayed at Fort A.P. Hill, Camp A.P. Hill, I believe it was \ncalled at the time. As our troop came to Washington, I do not think a \nsingle member of the troop had ever been to Washington. We were from \nrural Alabama. Our leaders decided it would be a big trip, and \neverybody planned it for a year or more, and we came up.\n  Our Scoutmaster, Mr. John Gates, was quite a leader, and Peyton \nBurford and the team of adults made it a highly successful trip. It was \nin the springtime, as I recall, and I do not think they had hot water \nat A.P. Hill. It was cold water, but they made you take a shower. We \nstayed in the old barracks that were vacant at the time. The Army was \nvery helpful to us in making that facility available. We were able to \nuse it as a base to come in to Washington and to tour the area during a \ntrip that was very, very, very meaningful to me and to others.\n  I have on my mantlepiece in my office here in Washington, on this \nvery day, a picture of that troop with all those kids--60 or more, I \nguess it was. A big chunk--maybe 12 or 14--at that time were Eagle \nScouts, and more than that became Eagle Scouts.\n  It was a very, very important part of our lives. The key to it was \ngood leadership. Our leaders, as those leaders in Alaska, gave untold \nhours to make those events meaningful. If you were not a good leader, \nyou would not be able to maintain a troop, and you would not be able to \nbring them from Alaska all the way down to A.P. Hill in Virginia as \npart of a Jamboree.\n  There are 32,000 Scouts at that Jamboree, I understand, with over \n3,000 leaders present. It is a very important and good thing that at \nthis very moment we think about the thousands and thousands of leaders \nin the Scouting program all over America who have meant so much to \nyoung people and have shaped their lives in so many positive ways that \nwould not have happened otherwise.\n  When you go to your Scout meeting--every Thursday night, as we did--\nyou say that oath: On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God \nand my country, to obey the Scout laws, to help other people at all \ntimes, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally \nstraight.\n\n  Some find that offensive. I can't imagine why. What kind of objection \ncould somebody have to ideals such as that. Every week you also recite \nthe Scout laws. A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, \ncourteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty--you don't hear that word \nmuch anymore--brave, clean and reverent. Those are good qualities. I \ndon't see anything in those qualities that violates the Constitution or \nshould in any way cause them to not be able to be supported by the \nmilitary on their bases.\n  I am thankful that the majority leader, Bill Frist, offered \nlegislation to make crystal clear that Scouts will be able to \nparticipate actively on our military facilities as they have for so \nmany years. Along with Senator Reed--a graduate of West Point he is--I \nserve on the board of West Point with him. Senator Reed chairs that \nboard. I remember one of the briefings we had about the young people \nwho graduate from West Point and go on to a military career. They said \nthe two groups of graduates that had the highest reenlistment rate, the \ntwo groups that made the Army a career in the highest\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\npercentage, were children of former military parents and Eagle Scouts.\n  There is some connection there, a connection in terms of duty and \nhonor and commitment to country and to our creator in a way that is \nspecial. The Scouts and our military do share some ideals.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to share these remarks. I \nappreciate the Senator from Alaska so much for her tribute to these \nfine leaders who gave their lives in service to the young men under \ntheir supervision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know we are currently debating the \nmotion to proceed on S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct. I am supportive of this legislation. I am happy to see 65 of my \ncolleagues join me in invoking cloture today so we can reach resolution \non the bill later this week. This is critical legislation for gun \nmanufacturers, some of whom work in my State and employ hard-working \nTexans. It is important for our economy and for our national security. \nI plan to speak about this issue in greater detail later, but I wanted \nto take a few moments to address another urgent matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business, and that the \ntime be discounted against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today, Chairman Specter of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee convened a very important hearing addressing \none of the most urgent matters confronting our Nation; that is, the \nneed to fix our broken immigration system. I want to speak a few \nminutes about a proposal that I have made, along with my colleague from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, together representing two border States, ones \nthat perhaps have the most experience with this issue because of our \nproximity to the border with Mexico.\n  In summary, this bill strengthens our border enforcement while it \ncomprehensively reforms our immigration system. Unfortunately, the \nongoing immigration debate has too often divided Americans of goodwill \ninto two camps--those who are angry and frustrated by our failure to \nenforce the law, and those who are angry and frustrated that our \nimmigration laws do not reflect reality. I have learned that those two \ngroups, both of whom deeply care about America and are committed to \nbuilding a system that works, share more in common than they or many \nother people actually realize. The only groups who benefit from the \ncurrent system are human smugglers, unscrupulous employers, and others \nwho profit at the expense of people who are trying to come into this \ncountry and work through illegal channels. Unfortunately, we know that \nthose channels are being investigated and potentially exploited by \nthose who want to come here to do us harm.\n  The reality is we need both stronger enforcement and reasonable \nreform of our immigration laws. It is my opinion that we, in the past, \nhave not devoted the funds, the resources, or the manpower necessary to \nenforce our immigration laws or to protect our borders. No discussion \nof reform is possible without a clear commitment to--and a substantial \nescalation of--our efforts to enforce the law.\n  Over a series of months now, as chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have come to believe \nthat increased enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. Any reform \nproposal must both serve our national security and our national \neconomy. It must be capable of securing our country, but it must also \nbe compatible with our growing economy.\n\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, I have worked closely with Senator Kyl, who chairs the \nTerrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to conduct a \nthorough review of our Nation's immigration laws. We have covered a \nwide variety of subjects, and we have had the opportunity to hear from \na diverse group of experts. From an analysis of how the immigration \nsystem failed on 9/11, to the role of our neighboring countries in \nraising living standards in their home countries, our hearings have \nlaid a foundation upon which we have developed a comprehensive \nsolution, one that will not result in yet another immigration crisis \nsome 10 or 20 years down the road.\n  We all know our immigration system has been broken for many years. \nFirst, the volume of illegal immigration continues to increase. \nAccording to the Pew Hispanic Center, there has been a dramatic \nincrease in illegal immigration since 9/11, approximately 30% since \n2000. That same organization estimates there are approximately 10.3 \nmillion illegal aliens in the United States currently.\n  Over the course of the 1990s, the number of illegal aliens increased \nby half a million a year, almost matching the number of visas that \nCongress has made available for legal immigrants. Last year alone, the \nBorder Patrol detained roughly 1.1 million aliens who had come across \nthe border. Professionals I have talked with on my travels to Texas and \nalong the border, people whose experience and professionalism I trust, \nestimate that we are only detaining perhaps one out of every three or \none out of every four people who are coming across our borders \nillegally.\n  Second, and for me the most alarming, is the information that \nsuggests that terrorists and other criminals, including smugglers, are \naware of the holes in our system. They may be--and I am confident that \nthey are--looking at ways to exploit these weaknesses.\n  In recent visits in McAllen, TX, and Laredo, TX, I learned from \npeople who have been long familiar with the movement of people back and \nforwards across our borders that the nature of illegal immigration has \nchanged dramatically. The number of aliens from noncontiguous \ncountries, sometimes called OTMs--in other words, people from countries \nother than Mexico--has doubled in the last year alone. Already this \nyear the Department of Homeland Security has apprehended about 100,000 \naliens across the southern border who are from noncontiguous countries.\n  While many of these individuals are coming from countries that you \nwould expect, countries in Central and South America, many come from \ncountries that have direct connections with terrorism. For example, we \nknow that the Border Patrol has apprehended at least 400 aliens from \ncountries with direct ties to terrorism.\n  Former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nAdmiral James Loy, stated that ``entrenched human smuggling networks \nand corruption in areas beyond our boarders can be exploited by \nterrorist organizations.'' He went on to state that ``several al-Qaeda \nleaders believe operatives can pay their way into the country through \nMexico and also believe that illegal entry is more advantageous than \nlegal entry for operational security reasons.''\n  I believe the vast majority of the people who come to this country, \neven those who come outside of our laws, come here for understandable \nreasons. That is, people who have no hope and no opportunity where they \nlive see this tremendous beacon of opportunity that America represents, \nand they want to come here to work and provide for their families.\n  At the same time, we have to acknowledge that our porous borders \nrepresent a national security vulnerability which can also be exploited \nby international terrorists. We know the current system benefits \nsmugglers and all too frequently leads to the deaths of immigrants \nwhose only crime was trying to find a better life for themselves and \ntheir families. Indeed, the greatest hazard to people who come to this \ncountry to find work is the fact that they have to, under current law, \nresort too often to an illegal entry into the country. They turn their \nlives over to people who care nothing about them and who are willing to \nleave them to die under the most extraordinarily bad circumstances. \nThey must work for employers who can exploit them because they know \nthey can't report labor law violations to the authorities. And they \nsuffer criminal acts, such as domestic violence, and they must endure \nthese acts because they believe they can't report the crime to law \nenforcement authorities or else they risk deportation.\n  I believe a reform proposal must encourage aliens to participate in \nthe legal process, to live within the law.\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\nUltimately, after they have completed their time of work in this \ncountry, most will return home to their countries and to their families \nand to contribute to their societies in their homeland. And those who \ndecide to live permanently must enter through the legal process.\n  When people who come to this country live outside of the law, they \nare vulnerable to exploitation and violence. They risk their lives, \nsometimes just to visit their families. I believe we must take away \nthis black market from smugglers and others who exploit these \nvulnerable immigrants by addressing deficiencies in our current system.\n  Identifying problems, of course, is not the most difficult part of \nour jobs. If this were easy, someone would have already done it. It is \nnot easy, but it merits our best efforts. The challenge that Senator \nKyl and I have assumed is to find a solution, to find workable results.\n  Last Wednesday, we introduced the Comprehensive Enforcement and \nImmigration Reform Act of 2005, a bill that we believe will restore \nAmerica's faith in lawful immigration and will meet the needs of our \ncountry, both from a security perspective and from the standpoint of \nour growing economy which needs the work provided by many immigrants.\n  The bill is based upon certain principles. First, we have to \nreestablish the rule of law. Second, we have to enact laws that are \ncapable of strong enforcement. That means they have to be realistic. \nThird, and most importantly, the law must be fair. If we address \ndeficiencies in the current immigration process, then we must require \nthat everyone who is here, even those who have come here just to \nprovide for their families, must go through normal legal channels.\n  The good news is that our bill provides them a direction and a way to \ndo that in a way that is not overly disruptive of their employment or \nof their family life. We believe it provides a path so that they can \nregain their status as legal temporary workers or, if eligible, as \nlegal permanent residents.\n  The men and women who secure our borders at the ports of entry, and \nfrequently at remote locations, should be commended for the job they do \nevery day. But we have not provided them with the resources they need \nto be able to give them any reasonable chance of success.\n  Last week, the Senate approved the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, which, to the credit of the Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, included increases for border security and \nimmigration enforcement.\n  Senator Kyl and I have introduced a bill that we believe builds on \nthat foundation. First of all, it authorizes 1,250 new Customs and \nborder protection officers over the next 5 years. It calls on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents \nover that same 5-year period. That same amount was authorized by \nCongress in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. It calls for the \nexpansion of a process called expedited removal, which is a fair and \neffective system for quickly removing those who are ineligible to enter \nour country. Right now, we only use expedited removal in a few \nlocations along the border. But our bill calls for the Department of \nHomeland Security to expand that process to all Border Patrol sectors, \nand we also provide for additional safeguards for aliens by requiring a \nsupervisory official with the Government sign off on any removal.\n  Let me say a quick word about expedited removal. Right now, because \nof a lack of detention facilities, we have what is commonly called a \n``catch and release'' program. For those we catch coming across the \nborder illegally, a criminal background check is done to determine \nwhether they are a threat to the American people; but if they don't \nappear on one of these watch lists or criminal background databases, \nthey are released into the U.S. and asked to return for a hearing. It \nshould not surprise any of us that this ``catch and release'' program \nresults in more people not showing up than do show up, and those who \nshow up for their hearing and are ordered removed then do not show up \nlater when they are asked to report for their deportation process.\n  So that is the problem that we simply have to remedy. And I believe \nthat expansion of the expedited removal process will deal with it in a \nway that is consistent with our laws and our values and our need for an \neffective border security program.\n  Our bill also addresses the release of aliens who come into the \ncountry from countries other than Mexico. It raises the minimum bond \namounts for these aliens from $1,500 to $5,000. That means that fewer \npeople from countries other than Mexico will be released, and those who \nare released will have a greater incentive to appear for their \nhearings.\n  Another important component of immigration reform is interior \nenforcement. We also need to deal with those who make it past the \nborder and into the interior of our Nation. Tackling illegal \nimmigration cannot be done in a piecemeal fashion. If we increase our \nability to apprehend illegal aliens at the border, we must have a place \nto put them. Once detained, lawyers and judges are necessary to ensure \nthat these people receive timely and fair hearings. Reform, therefore, \nmust evaluate the whole enforcement process, and we must remove \nobstacles that appear anywhere in the process.\n  The goal is simple: If we apprehend someone who has no legal right to \nbe in this country and is not entitled to any claim of asylum, then we \nmust have an effective and efficient means to remove them from the U.S.\n  The bill Senator Kyl and I have introduced will restore confidence in \nthe system. First, it authorizes an additional 10,000 detention beds. \nCurrently, there are only 23,000 detention beds. You will recall that a \nmoment ago I said last year alone immigration control authorities \napprehended 1.1 million people coming across our border illegally. Yet \nwe only have 23,000 detention beds. That leads to what I described \nearlier as the ``catch and release'' program, which has proven to be \ncompletely unworkable.\n  The intelligence reform bill called for an additional 40,000 beds \nover the next few years. The bill that we have introduced increases the \ntotal amount to 50,000 detention beds. Still, that is not enough to \ndetain everyone who comes across the border illegally. That is where \nexpedited removal comes into play--a process to remove aliens quickly \nso that we reduce the need for bed space.\n  Our bill also increases penalties for alien smuggling, document \nfraud, and gang violence by aliens. We know, as I said a moment ago, \nthat the nature of the people coming across our border, through our \nporous southern border, has changed. We are seeing many people who are \nviolent gang members coming from places in Central America. We know \nthat people are coming from Asia and from Europe, all around the world, \nand they are transiting through Mexico.\n  Alien smugglers are the people that make that happen. We have learned \nthat they consider human beings to be just another commodity. They are \njust as likely to smuggle arms, drugs or anything else that will make \nthem money. We need to make sure that we crack down on these alien \nsmugglers that facilitate this intrusion into our country illegally and \nshow that we are committed to tough punishment. Our bill accomplishes \nthat.\n  We provide greater tools for the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Department of State to require that countries accept their own \ncitizens back if they violate our immigration laws and they come into \nour country illegally.\n  Our bill also clarifies the authority of State and local officials to \nenforce immigration laws and authorizes the reimbursement of local and \nState officials for costs they incur in enforcing Federal immigration \nlaw.\n  Recently, I traveled to Victoria, TX, and met with a group of \nsheriffs down there. It so happened that the Minutemen who first \norganized in Arizona were organizing in Goliad, TX, and local law \nenforcement officials were concerned about having these citizen \nvolunteers engage in what essentially is a law enforcement process. \nThey said to me:\n\n       If the Federal Government would provide us additional \n     resources, we would be glad to help. We need some training, \n     but we would be glad to be cross-designated, if that is \n     important, to enforce both Federal immigration laws as well \n     as State and local laws. We would be glad to detain them in \n     our local jail\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\n     facilities pending their hearings, if necessary, but it is \n     going to take a little help from the Federal Government.\n\n  I told them that I welcomed their offer to assist because I believe \ninterior enforcement performed by many of these local law enforcement \nofficials is an important part of this puzzle.\n  Our bill also creates a new senior-level position at the Department \nof Justice committed to immigration enforcement.\n  The third piece of the enforcement puzzle deals with the employment \nof undocumented immigrants. The Congressional Research Service \nestimates that out of the roughly 10 million people who have come into \nour country in violation of our laws, about 6 million are currently in \nthe workforce. I believe that a vast majority of employers simply want \nan effective, user-friendly way to comply with the law. In other words, \nthey want a way to determine whether the person who shows up in their \nplace of business saying ``I would like to work for you'' is in fact \nlegally authorized to work in the United States. We must ensure that we \nprovide them an efficient, easy-to-use system that is airtight.\n  The example I often use is the following: if I show up at a \nconvenience store and buy something, I can present my debit card or \nVisa or Master Card. In a matter of seconds, the clerk can swipe the \ncard and it can authorize that purchase using modern technology. Why \ncan we not use something similar--maybe with a few more bells and \nwhistles--to allow employers to determine whether a person they want to \nhire is in fact eligible to work?\n  Since 1996, the Government has been testing an electronic \nverification system that provides instantaneous confirmation of an \nindividual's authorization to work in the United States. Our experience \nwith this program tells us that it can work but only if we give it \nsufficient resources. Our bill calls for an expansion of this \nelectronic verification system and requires all employers to \nparticipate.\n  But while we make sure that there is a way for employers to check, we \nalso have to make sure we crack down on employers who continue to \noperate in the black market of illegal labor. We have to crack down on \nthe criminals who sell and who create fake identity documents and \nSocial Security cards, which can also be exploited by terrorists.\n  Because our bill will create bright-line rules for employers, \ncompanies will be able to know whether they are in compliance or not. \nThat is an obligation we owe them. If we are going to ask them to \ncomply with the law, we have to give them a clear and simple way to do \nso. Our bill will further reduce identity theft and fraud by increasing \nthe penalties for false claims to citizenship or for filing false \ninformation with the Social Security Administration. It requires Social \nSecurity cards to be more secure and it imposes standards for the \nissuance of birth certificates, so someone may not simply counterfeit \nthese documents and make a false claim to citizenship.\n  Our bill also imposes certain obligations on countries who would like \nto make their citizens eligible to participate in this program. This \nwould address another big challenge that we have, and that is the \ndevelopment gap between the United States and other countries.\n  We, along with those other countries, have an interest in ending the \none-way flow of workers, which only results in the drain of highly \nmotivated workers from those countries and further impedes their \ndevelopment. Our proposal would not only require the sending countries \nto assist with border security, but it will require them to cooperate \nwith the United States in bridging the development gap between our \ncountry and theirs. Foreign Minister Derbez of Mexico has said that \n``[T]he Mexican government has to be able to give Mexicans . . . the \nopportunity to generate the wealth that today they produce in other \nplaces.''\n  I could not agree more. Other countries need for their young, \nenergetic risk-takers and hard workers to ultimately return home, to \nbring back to their countries the savings and skills they have acquired \nin the United States.\n  The bill we have introduced will require countries to enter into an \nagreement in which each country agrees to cooperate on border \nenforcement, to work to reduce gang violence and smuggling, to provide \ninformation on criminal aliens and terrorists, and to accept the return \nof nationals whom the United States has ordered removed.\n  Lastly, let me cover the temporary worker program. I mentioned a \nmoment ago that out of the 10 million or so people who have come to \nthis country illegally, about 6 million are in the workforce. I believe \nthe fact is many of these immigrants have come here to provide for \ntheir families, something all of us as human beings can empathize with \nand understand. Who among us would not do anything in our power, risk \nlife itself, to provide for our families, even if it happened to be \noutside of our laws?\n  We know many jobs being performed by immigrants in this country are \njobs American citizens are reluctant to fill. I can only think about \nroofers working with hot asphalt in south Texas during August as the \none example of that kind of job. Whether it is that or picking \nagricultural products, there are a lot of jobs, unfortunately, that \nAmericans simply are reluctant to fill. We know we have a need for the \nwork provided by many immigrants.\n  What we provide for in our bill is a temporary worker program. That \nis something I believe can best be characterized as a work-and-return \nprogram, not a work-and-stay program.\n  Some have said that is unrealistic, that you will never get people \nwho come to the United States to agree to return. I guess we can all \nhave opinions, but I have something even better than my opinion. The \nPew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan, impartial think-tank that looks at \nsome of these matters, has done a survey of almost 5,000 Mexican \nimmigrants who applied for matricula consular card, a Mexican identity \ncard, at Mexican consulates in the United States. They asked migrants \nto fill out a 12-page survey, and one of the questions they answered \nwas this: Would you agree to work in a temporary worker program in the \nUnited States if it was legally authorized, even though at the end of \nthat time period you would have to return home to your country of \norigin?\n  By a ratio of 4 to 1, 71 percent to 17 percent, these immigrants said \nthey would. I think that is solid evidence that people who are \ncurrently working in the shadows realize that they operate without the \nprotection of our labor laws, without the protection of our criminal \nlaws, and all too frequently they view law enforcement with suspicion \nrather than as an ally. They are looking for an opportunity to come out \ninto the sunshine and to secure the protection our laws provide.\n  Our bill does create a new temporary worker category that allows \nworkers who have a job offer from a U.S. employer to enter the country \nfor a period of up to 2 years to work in the United States. Before the \nemployer can hire the worker, the employer must advertise a position, \noffer it to any qualified American worker, and agree to pay at least \nminimum wage. The worker will go through background screening, will be \nissued secure biometric documentation, that they are who they say they \nare and are coming here to work and not for some other nefarious \npurpose.\n  We also create some financial incentives so that the worker, after \nthe period of their temporary visa expires, will return home with the \nsavings and skills they have acquired while working in the United \nStates.\n  I talked moments ago about the Pew Hispanic survey. Circular \nmigration is important both for the United States and for countries \nsuch as Mexico and the countries of Central America who are losing \ntheir young risk takers and the potential entrepreneurs, the people who \nare essential to the development of their own economy.\n  What economy could withstand the loss of the young men and women, the \npeople who are going to be the engines of those economies and the \nprosperity of those countries? The public officials in Mexico and \nCentral America with whom I talked do understand they need to have \nthese people come back with the savings and skills they have acquired \nin the United States, so they can develop a way forward for their own \npeople. In the end, it will benefit the United States because it will \ntake a lot of pressure off illegal immigration if people can find hope \nand opportunity and good jobs in their own country.\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\n  Finally, let me address what perhaps is the hardest issue: the people \nwho are here now who have come here outside of our laws.\n  According to the Pew Hispanic Center again, about a third of these \nindividuals have been here for more than 10 years. So we do know that \nsome have established roots in the United States, but we also know we \nhave to find some way to transition this population into legal status. \nIt must not, however, create a new path for people who have come here \noutside our laws. Our bill allows them to get back in line so they can \nreturn to the United States in a temporary worker program or, should \nthey choose, as legal permanent residents.\n  But we do it in a way that is premised upon fundamental fairness. I \nbelieve there are many people in America who would be deeply offended \nif we said: if you come to this country through legal channels, that is \nnice, but we are going to allow people who have come here illegally to \nhave a preference, and we are going to let them jump ahead of you in \nline.\n  Our bill provides a path for people to return to their country of \norigin and then, on an expedited basis, return to the United States. It \nwill not be disruptive. To secure their participation, it may be \nnecessary for them to know by the time they leave that they will be \neligible to come back immediately once they secure the proper \ndocumentation. And we need to address processing delays so that they \ncan obtain that proper documentation in a matter of days. If disruption \nis the only concern, then I see no reason why the model cannot minimize \nor eliminate that disruption.\n\n  This bill is a comprehensive bill, and I know my colleagues are as \nconcerned as I am about finding a workable solution to this problem. I \nspeak today to share with all of our colleagues, not just the people \nwho sit on the Judiciary Committee and who participated in the hearing \nthis morning, an overview of our proposal which I think has some real \npromise in achieving results.\n  I believe our constituents sent us here to represent them to solve \nproblems, not to engage in partisan or otherwise divisive rhetoric \ndesigned to pick a fight. Our proposal is one idea about how we can \nfind our way through this thicket, how we can thread the needle in a \nway that does not provide amnesty. I think our colleagues across the \nRotunda in the House of Representatives will be open to discussing our \nproposal, for it is consistent with their principles of reform.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the indulgence of my colleagues. I yield \nthe remainder of my hour to the Senator from Alabama.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I had an opportunity to be \npresiding this afternoon and to hear Senator Cornyn speak. I appreciate \nhis assuming the Chair for a moment so I could step down here and \ncompliment him and Senator Kyl for their work on this legislation.\n  They have introduced a comprehensive bill to improve our immigration \nsystem, focusing, as the Presiding Officer said in his remarks, on \nborder security, on interior security, on employment accountability, \nand on a legal status for temporary workers.\n  I am glad they have taken the time to work on this program. We have \ntalked about it many times over the last several months, and I know the \nhours they spent on this. I have not had an opportunity yet to see all \nthe specifics of the bill, but I know the principles they are working \non and I heard the speech. I believe in what they are trying to do, and \nI think it is terribly important that we as an entire Senate take this \nissue up and begin to deal with it.\n  We need to stop thumbing our nose at the rule of law and decide which \npersons from other countries should be allowed to work and study and \nlive in our country and create a legal status for them, and then \nenforce the law. We must do that. It is hypocritical for us to go \naround the world preaching about the rule of law to other countries \nwhen 10 million people or so are living illegally in this country.\n  Our failure to solve the problem also unloads huge health and \neducation costs on State and local governments and puts the immigrant \npopulation at risk.\n  So the Cornyn-Kyl bill stands for the rule of law by enforcing our \nborders and creating a solid temporary worker program so that we know \nwho is here, and that they are here within a clear legal framework.\n  The people of this country expect us to deal with this issue. This is \na difficult issue, but it is what we are sent here for: We are sent \nhere to deal with the major issues facing our country, and I can think \nof no more important issue for us to deal with than upholding the rule \nof law by securing our borders, protecting our interior, and making \nsure that people we welcome to live here and work here are here \nlegally, and that we then enforce the law.\n  But, as important as the Cornyn-Kyl bill is, we can do more. This \nbill enforces the borders and welcomes temporary workers. But we also \nneed to do a couple of other things. One of the other things we need to \ndo is to welcome foreign students, not just foreign workers. A second \nthing we need to do, with a half million to a million prospective \ncitizens who come to our country legally every year, is to help them \nbecome Americans. We need to help them to become a part of this country \nwhose most important accomplishment is admitting and welcoming people \nfrom all over the word, of every background, and helping those new \ncitizens become something new--Americans who are proud of where they \ncame from but prouder to say they are all Americans.\n  Foreign students who come to the United States to study at our \ncolleges and universities are a boon not only to our educational \nsystem, but also to our economy and to our foreign policy. But after \nSeptember 11, in an effort to increase our security--which is \nappropriate--we have been making it harder for international students \nto come to the United States. Earlier this year, the administration \nremoved one important hurdle by extending the Visa Mantis process, \nwhich clears foreign students and researchers who are studying advanced \nsciences.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator Lugar, Senator Coleman, and I, and \nothers have spent some time over the last year working with the \nadministration on the question of foreign students coming to the United \nStates. There were 570,000 foreign students who attended classes in the \nUnited States last year. Sixty percent of the postdoctoral students in \nthe United States last year were foreign students. One-half of the \nstudents in our graduate programs in computer sciences and in \nengineering are foreign students. Many of these students are here \nworking to help increase our standard of living. Many will return to \ntheir home countries after 4 years with a fresh perspective on our \ncountry and on what their own country could become.\n  When I visited the country of Georgia last March, which recently \nbecame a pro-Western democracy, I was reminded that most of the top \nofficials there had been students in the United States of America. They \nwere doing things there we could have never encouraged them to do. They \nwere doing them because they came here and learned what it meant to be \nan American and were using those principles in their own country of \nGeorgia.\n  Many other foreign students will stay here and, thanks to their \nstudies, they will invent new products or start new businesses, and \nthat creates jobs here at home. So we need to welcome these students \nwhen they are legally here in the United States.\n  Finally, we also need to do more to welcome and support legal \nresidents who are working to become American citizens. Each year we \nwelcome about 1 million new permanent legal residents, many of whom go \non to become citizens of the United States. To become an American is a \nsignificant accomplishment. First, you must live in the United States \nfor 5 years. Next, you must speak some English. Next, you\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\nmust learn about our history and government. Next, you must be of good \ncharacter. Next, you must swear an oath to renounce the old government \nfrom where you came and swear allegiance to the United States of \nAmerica and its Constitution. That is no small thing.\n  Between 500,000 and 1 million new citizens each year come in and \ncomplete that process and take that oath.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Schumer and I introduced a bill to codify \nthat oath of allegiance that new citizens swear to when they become \ncitizens. It is hard to believe that while the Pledge of Allegiance, \nthe National Anthem, and the American Flag are all prescribed by law, \nwe have been allowing the oath of allegiance, a binding pledge for new \ncitizens, to be determined merely by Federal regulators. We can do more \nto welcome these new citizens.\n  In the near future, in September, I hope to introduce legislation \nthat perhaps could become part of a comprehensive immigration bill. \nThis legislation would provide new incentives and support for legal \nimmigrants to learn English, our common language, and to learn about \nour Nation's history and government and values. I hope that effort to \nwelcome new legal immigrants and to help them become a part of our \nAmerican community will become a part of the Senate's overall approach \nto immigration reform.\n  Our country is unique in the world. We are not defined by common \nethnic background or origin. We and our ancestors came from every \ncorner of the world to be a part of this country because it was founded \non something much bigger, much grander than ethnic heritage or a tie to \nthe land. In the Declaration of Independence, our Founders wrote:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  This is what binds us together as Americans: a belief in our common \nvalues, values such as equal opportunity, the rule of law, and liberty. \nThat is why we welcome immigrants who swear allegiance to our country \nand to those values as new citizens. That is why our Nation of \nimmigrants has always succeeded and can succeed in the future.\n  If we are to continue to succeed, we must pass along these values \nthat comprise our American identity--pass them on to posterity--both to \nour children and to those new citizens who come to our shores from \ndistant lands.\n  In the coming months, this Senate will have a chance to reform our \nNation's immigration policy. The Cornyn-Kyl legislation is a \ntremendously important first step toward a comprehensive immigration \nbill. It is one whose principles I support. I look forward to working \nwith its authors as it moves through the Senate. I hope as we write \nthis comprehensive immigration legislation, though, we also remember to \nwelcome foreign students who add so much to our economy and spread our \nvalues to the world, and that we remember to welcome legal immigrants \nwho wish to join the American family and help them learn our common \nlanguage, learn our values, and become American citizens.\n\n  I hope the legislation that I will offer in September can help us \nalong that track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with Senator Alexander in \ncomplimenting you and Senator Kyl for the legislation that you have \njust described for us. The Senator from Texas, as I know, has taken the \nlead on this very important and complex subject. I salute you for it.\n  Some would say it is a thankless task, it can't be done, and will \nmake nobody happy. But I believe you have the right principles. If the \nright principles are applied with the right prescriptive language, we \ncan make great progress in this area, and I salute you for it.\n  Frequently have I quoted Senator Alexander in the phrase he has used: \nNo child should grow up in America who doesn't know what it means to be \nan American.\n  I think that is good for immigrants, too, as the Senator just said so \neloquently. I salute him.\n  I also thank the Senator from Texas for considering a critical \ncomponent of this legislation he has proposed, and that is the part \nthat deals with State and local law enforcement. I have just written a \nLaw Review article for Stanford University to deal with that area of \nthe law. Suffice it to say, local law enforcement does have complete \nauthority to detain people who are violating the criminal laws of the \nUnited States. But that has been confused. Clearing this up more, \nsetting up a mechanism so that they can participate if they choose, \nwould be helpful to enforcing the law. That is so because we have \n700,000 State and local law enforcement officers at every street corner \nand town in America. We have only 2,000 INS immigration officers inside \nthe border--not those on the Border Patrol and on the border, but those \ninside the border. So obviously we are not very serious about \nultimately reaching a lawful system if we exclude them.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, last week I offered an amendment to suspend \nthe 45-day congressional review of the President's final BRAC \nrecommendations pending completion of several vital studies pertaining \nto long-range security needs in the implementation of BRAC and \nredeployment of many units presently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan \nback to bases in the United States.\n  I also introduced a similar amendment yesterday that would allow \nCongress discretion to remove individual bases from the closure list \nbased upon the findings of these studies and results of the \nredeployments.\n  There are two separate options, one of which I hope comes to the \nSenate for a vote. I underscore the assertions I made last week. The \nunderlying purpose of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or \nBRAC, is not only good for our Armed Forces, it is good for American \ntaxpayers. We all want to eliminate waste and reduce redundancy in the \nGovernment, but when Congress modified the BRAC law in December of 2001 \nto make way for the 2005 round of base closings, it failed to envision \nthis country involved in a protracted war involving stretched manpower \nresources and the burden of large overseas rotational deployments of \ntroops and equipment. This is not the time to begin a new round of \ndomestic base closures and massive relocations of manpower and \nequipment.\n  I am aware, hearing that coming from a Member of Congress with a \nmajor base on the chopping block, that assertion may sound like another \npitch to defend a home State parochial interest. Regardless of the \noutcome for my base, I am very concerned about how this BRAC round will \naffect our Nation's overall military posture, not only in South Dakota \nbut around the country and around the world. This BRAC, in particular, \nhas serious implications both in the short term, because we are engaged \nin a war, and in the longer term because of the need to preserve \ncritical infrastructure as we enter a very uncertain future.\n  In essence, we cannot lose sight of the imperative of, in addition to \nsaving money, perhaps the most critical goal of BRAC should be to \nmaximize our Nation's warfighting capability. If we fail to follow that \nfundamental principle, the BRAC process will fail us and ultimately put \nthis country at risk.\n  This BRAC, in particular, not only has serious implications, it \nraises serious questions, especially in terms of its timing. In the \nshort term, our war in Iraq and Afghanistan has put great logistical \nstrain on our Active military\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nand Reserve Forces in terms of both manpower and resources. The \nrotational deployment of personnel and assets to overseas areas of \noperation has disrupted normal training and maintenance cycles and left \nmilitary families with uncertainty.\n  The drain of resources also raised questions as to our ability to \nrespond to additional flashpoints if a crisis should arise elsewhere in \nthe world. Yes, the military is performing its ongoing missions \nremarkably well under the circumstances, but is this the time to add to \nthose commitments by initiating a massive reshuffle of personnel, \nequipment, and missions between bases all over the country?\n  In the long term, these recommendations may pose an even more serious \nrisk to our security. As the DOD itself points out in the National \nDefense Strategy, published earlier this year:\n\n       Particularly troublesome is the nexus of transnational \n     terrorists, proliferation and problem states that possess or \n     seek WMD, increasing the risk of WMD attack against the \n     United States.\n\n  We simply do not know what dangers may emerge from military powers \nsuch as North Korea, China, Iran, or various rogue states in the next \n20 years or more. The threat of terrorism directed against targets in \nthis country should be indisputable after September 11.\n  There have been four prior BRAC rounds in the last 20 years. I \nbelieve it is readily apparent that the Pentagon's 2005 BRAC \nrecommendations go beyond reducing excess infrastructure and would, \ninstead, reduce critical infrastructure needed to fight the wars of the \n21st century.\n  Prior rounds have been successful in pulling much of the low-hanging \nfruit and in reducing waste.\n  This round begins to cut into the muscle. I want to show you a chart \nfrom 1958, for example. You see there was a large number of Air Force \nbases in the northern region of this country. Air Force bases were \ndotted all across the northern tier of the United States: Up in the \nNortheast, North Central Plains, areas such as that--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \n7, 8, 9, 10--a dozen Air Force bases or more in the northern tier of \nthis country.\n  Today, take a look at how that has changed. One can plainly see how \ndramatically that number has been reduced and will be further reduced \nin the 2005 BRAC round.\n  You saw the previous chart from 1958. All those bases have been wiped \nout. There are three left in the northern tier of the country. This \nBRAC round would eliminate Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and \nmake Grand Forks Air Force Base essentially a ``warm'' base, hopeful of \nan emerging mission but for all intents and purposes removes the \nprincipal mission that has been housed there for some time and leaves \nliterally only one major Air Force base in the northern tier of this \ncountry.\n  Of course, one of the flaws I see in this BRAC is not only the \nstripping of our air and naval bases in the northern tier, but I \nseriously question what I believe to be one of the Pentagon's most \napparent errors in judgment; and that is to consolidate high-value \nassets in fewer locations.\n  In light of the potential threats we face, I wonder whether we really \nwant to discard a tenet of military doctrine that we have lived by for \nthe past 60 years. It is called ``strategic redundancy.'' Put simply, \nit is the doctrine of dispersing high-value assets at different \nlocations in order to prevent their complete destruction in a single \nattack.\n  If you look at the statement here, this is from the Air Force \ndoctrine document, dated November 9, of 2004. It says:\n\n      . . . it is easier and more effective to destroy the enemy's \n     aerial power by destroying his nests and eggs on the ground \n     than to hunt his flying birds in the air.\n\n  If you look at what the potential threats are we face going forward, \nand what it means to this Nation to have strategic redundancy, to have \nthose assets dispersed in several locations around the country, and if \nyou look at how that fits in with the Defense Department's own military \nstrategy, you have to ask a question about some of the decisions that \nhave been made in this particular BRAC round.\n  Let's look at what it says right here. Again, this is the Department \nof Defense, in its March 2005 National Defense Strategy, when it stated \nits goal of ``developing greater flexibility to contend with \nuncertainty by emphasizing agility and by not overly concentrating \nmilitary forces in a few locations.''\n\n  I want to put up another chart. It has to do with principles and \nimperatives. Even in the Pentagon's deliberative briefing materials \nthat outline those ``principles and imperatives'' of this BRAC round, \nit stated that the Department needed secure installations optimally \nlocated, that support power projection, sustain the capability to \nmobilize and ``that ensure strategic redundancy.''\n  Now, unfortunately, Secretary Rumsfeld's recent BRAC recommendations \nto consolidate some of the Nation's most valuable U.S. air and naval \nplatforms at single installations would apparently abandon that basic \ntenet in favor of cutting costs.\n  Hopefully, we have not forgotten the shortsightedness we once had as \na Nation before Pearl Harbor. Now, folks might dismiss such lapses as \ndistant events from another time and another place that are not \napplicable to today's threats. See on this chart a scene from Pearl \nHarbor that took place 60-some years ago. Even in the DOD's Strategy \nfor Homeland Defense and Civil Support, released a few weeks ago--and, \nincidentally, this is a partial completion of one of the amendment's \nconditions--it notes that ``a significant element of mission assurance \nis continuity of operations--maintaining the ability to carry out DOD \nmission essential functions in the event of a national emergency or \nterrorist attack.''\n  It also goes on to state that ``an attack on DOD facilities could \ndirectly affect the Department's ability to project power overseas.'' \nOne well-positioned crater in a runway could ground the entire fleet of \nthis Nation's B-1 bombers during an emergency, if they are all \nstationed at one location. It should always come back to the intuitive \nlogic possessed by most Americans, and that is that we simply cannot \nallow analytical cost models to trump sound and proven security \nprecautions.\n  Strategic redundancy, obviously, still has a place in our planning, \nas demonstrated in the Pentagon's own planning documents. Why was it \nnot reflected in its BRAC recommendations?\n  Additionally, the risk of natural disasters is a constant reminder \nthat we should not put all our assets in a single location. This chart \nshows a tornado that passed within 1,000 feet of the F-16s and B-1 \nbombers stationed at McConnell Air Force Base back in 1991. Tornadoes \nhave wreaked havoc on Air Force bases in the past. The one I am going \nto show you in a moment is Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. We simply \ncannot afford to risk our Nation's security on the whims of a single \ndeadly tornado that could destroy or damage an entire fleet of \naircraft.\n  Finally, the GAO has also questioned the potential for cost savings \nestimated by the DOD, calling into question whether we want to risk \nour national security for questionable cost savings. want to read to \nyou what it says from the GAO study:\n\n       There are clear limitations associated with DOD's \n     projection of nearly $50 billion in savings over a 20-year \n     period. Much of the projected net annual recurring savings \n     (47 percent) is associated with eliminating jobs currently \n     held by military personnel. However, rather than reducing \n     end-strength levels, DOD indicates the positions are expected \n     to be reassigned to other areas.\n\n  As this implies, much of these cost savings are apparently illusory. \nTo quote the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, during his testimony before the BRAC Commission, he \nsaid:\n\n       Since 32 percent of BRAC savings come from personnel \n     reductions, this calls into question the entire savings \n     estimate--particularly since we are not reducing any \n     meaningful force structure.\n\n  I want to show another GAO chart. The GAO questions, one, the lengthy \npayback periods; inconsistencies in how DOD estimated costs for BRAC \nactions involving military construction projects; and uncertainties in \nestimating the total costs to the Government to implement.\n  GAO estimates upfront costs of an estimated $24 billion to implement \nthis round of BRAC. To again quote the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee before the BRAC Commission, he said this:\n\n       My observations are consistent with the testimony of \n     witnesses and Congressional\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\n     delegations around the country to date who have presented the \n     Commission firm evidence supporting similar observations of \n     questionable data and an internal collapse of the \n     quantitative analytical foundation in lieu of other guidance \n     provided by senior defense officials. These observations are \n     also consistent with issues raised by the Government \n     Accountability Office in its July I, 2005, report to the \n     Commission and to Congress.\n\n  Last week, when I was offering my amendment, the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Warner, made what I believe was a reasonable \nargument, that by suspending the 45-day review period until these \nconditions are met would cause anxiety among some communities by not \nknowing their ultimate fate or delaying the process of redeveloping the \nbase to civilian use.\n  Now, this may be the case for some communities, but I believe most \ncommunities desperately want to retain their bases because they are the \nlifeblood of their local economy. They would do anything--exhaust every \npossibility--to have these bases remain open. If anything, knowing that \nthis Congress has done all it could to have all the answers before \nmaking such a decision I think is tremendously important to these \ncommunities.\n  I also challenge the perception made by many that these communities \nwill have many opportunities to develop these closed bases and quickly \nrestore their economy. This will probably not be the case in rural \nareas around bases like Ellsworth Air Force Base and Cannon Air Force \nBase.\n  Some communities may actually prosper from a base closing, where land \nfor business or home development comes at a high premium and sells for \nthousands of dollars per square foot. Bases like Oceana, in Virginia, \nwill have no difficulty putting the land to profitable use.\n  As you can see in this picture, Oceana is surrounded by a sea of \ndevelopment and prosperity. The base is up here. The entire area around \nit is completely developed. The land is worth lots of money.\n  But other bases, like Ellsworth, in my State, as you can see in this \naerial photograph, are surrounded by miles and miles and miles of empty \nrangeland and have scant hopes of a booming development taking hold of \nthe former base. There is little doubt that the nearby community of \nRapid City would have no problems with the delay if it means ensuring \nthe right decision has truly been made.\n  There are too many unanswered questions regarding our Nation's long-\nterm security needs and the circumstances in which our military may \nhave to operate in the future to make irreversible decisions for which \nwe could pay a terrible price later. We will not be able to easily \nreplace or position these installations and units once this BRAC is \nfully implemented and we discover we have made a colossal mistake.\n  Let's take a breath and slow down. My two amendments, offered as \noptions, merely allow this Nation to have the full benefit of all the \ninformation we need before moving ahead to implement BRAC. The risk is \ntoo great.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if you could tell me the parliamentary \nstate of affairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 397.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in strong support of S. \n397, the gun liability bill.\n  Now, this legislation is a necessary response to the growing problem \nof junk lawsuits filed, no doubt, in part with the intention of driving \nthe firearms industry out of business.\n  These ill-advised suits attempt to hold manufacturers and dealers \nliable for the criminal acts of third parties, actions totally beyond \nthe control of the manufacturer. These types of lawsuits continue to be \nfiled in multiple States, seeking a vast array of remedies concerning \nthe marketing of guns and alleged design flaws. And they continue to be \nflawed.\n  The White House, in its Statement of Administration Policy, \nsummarized the current problem well. This is what they said:\n\n       The possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry \n     for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the \n     legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's laws, \n     threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional right and \n     civil liberty, sets a poor precedent for other lawful \n     industries, will cause a loss of jobs, and burdens interstate \n     and foreign commerce.\n\n  That is a heck of a good statement because that is exactly what will \nhappen if we allow these types of suits to continue.\n  This bill does nothing more than prohibit--with five exceptions--\nlawsuits against manufacturers or sellers of guns and ammunition for \ndamages ``resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse'' of \nnondefective guns and ammunition.\n  Now, let me repeat that: ``resulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse'' of nondefective guns and ammunition.\n  This bill is not a license for the gun industry to act irresponsibly. \nIf a manufacturer or seller does not operate entirely within Federal or \nState law, it is not entitled to the protection of this legislation.\n  Listen to a few comments from one judge who dismissed some of these \nsuits. In Ohio, a judge dismissed a gun liability lawsuit, and the \ncourt of appeals affirmed this decision saying:\n\n     to do otherwise would open a Pandora's box. For example, the \n     city could sue manufacturers of matches for arson, or \n     automobile manufacturers for traffic accidents, or breweries \n     for drunk driving.\n\n  Now, there is no reason the gunmakers should have to continue to \ndefend these types of meritless lawsuits. We must protect against the \npotential harm to interstate commerce here. The gun industry has \nalready had to bear over $200 million in defense costs thus far. That \nis ridiculous. It is immoral. It is wrong.\n\n  This legislation is not without precedent. In the 106th Congress, \nlegislation was introduced to address the possibility of junk lawsuits \nrelated to the Y2K computer problems. This bill sought to ``lessen the \nburdens on interstate commerce by discouraging insubstantial \nlawsuits.'' It sought to do so by preempting State law to provide a \nuniform standard for such suits. This bill merely seeks the same type \nof remedy using the same reasoning.\n  In the past, some have thrown out red herrings arguing against this \nbill and suggesting that negligent entrustment will be immunized. This \nis pure bunk. It is untrue. That argument doesn't deserve to see the \nlight of day. Those who make it ought to be ashamed of themselves. The \nbill provides an explicit exception for anyone who supplies a gun to \nsomeone they reasonably should have known was likely to use that gun in \na way that would injure another person.\n  Let me state that again. The bill provides an explicit exception for \nanyone who supplies a gun to someone they reasonably should have known \nwas likely to use the gun in a way that would injure another person. \nThe bottom line is that this is a reasonable measure to prevent a \ngrowing abuse of our civil justice system. We have had far too many \nabuses of that system. This is a chance for Members of this body to \nstand up and do something about it.\n  If we allow these kinds of suits to go forward with guns, then what \nis next? Holding manufacturers of knives responsible for stabbings? \nHolding manufacturers of baseball bats liable for beatings? We simply \nshould not force a lawful manufacturer or seller to be responsible for \ncriminal and unlawful misuse of its products by others.\n  Individuals who misuse lawful products should be held responsible, \nbut not those who make lawful products.\n  We have had through the years a desire by some to put gun controls on \nall kinds of guns, even though the second amendment gives us the \nfreedom to keep and carry arms. To be honest with you, it is an \nexplicit provision of the Constitution. We should not allow any misuse \nof guns, but we should not allow a change in the Constitution by mere \nstatute that takes away our right to keep and bear arms. That is a God-\ngiven right, in my book, especially in some of the areas of the country \nwhere people have to defend themselves. In my area of the country, we \nhad to defend ourselves in tremendous ways throughout the whole history \nof the West.\n  To make a long story short, we should not be abusing honest, decent, \nlaw-abiding people who want to collect, shoot, target practice, hunt, \nand own guns. We have been through it before.\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nIt is time to stand up and realize that the people who misuse guns are \ncriminals. Those criminals should be prosecuted. But to make gun \nmanufacturers responsible for the irresponsible acts of others, over \nwhich the gun manufacturers had no control, is just plain wrong.\n  I hope we can pass this bill. It would set a good standard to stop \nthe frivolous and abusive lawsuits that are occurring in this country \nin so many ways, but especially in this particular way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to speak on the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is amazing how we have reached this \npoint in Senate business today. We started this day debating the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. It is hard to imagine a more \nimportant bill for this Senate to consider and conclude this week. We \nare going to be gone for 4 or 5 weeks. The idea was, we would take the \nimportant amendments and decisions to be made about our military, our \nmen and women in uniform, their benefits, their equipment, and make the \ndecision this week before we went home. Then a decision was made by the \nRepublican leadership to interrupt the debate on the Department of \nDefense authorization bill and move to the pending bill.\n  What is this bill? It is a bill that is characterized as ``the gun \nindustry immunity bill.'' What does it mean? It means that those who \nare pushing for this bill want to carve out one industry in America and \nsay that the people who run the businesses that make the firearms and \nsell the firearms cannot be held personally responsible for their \nwrongdoing. That's right. If you and I get in an automobile going home \nfrom work, are negligent in our driving the car in any respect, and \nthere is an accident, we are held personally responsible. If the \nbusiness down the street from where you live sells a product that is \ndefective or dangerous, the person who owns the business, the person \nwho made the product can be held personally responsible. It is really \npart of life that we are responsible for our wrongdoing. The legal \nsystem of America says even people who are powerless have their day in \ncourt to hold accountable the businesses and people who have been \nguilty of wrongdoing.\n  Now comes to the floor the proposal by the Republican leadership that \nwe take one industry in America and say that it cannot be held \npersonally responsible for its wrongdoing. Why in the world would we be \ndoing this? How powerful must the group be that pushes through the \nlegislation that says they will be treated as an exception in the whole \nAmerican body of law? You know the group. They are well known. The gun \nlobby, the National Rifle Association. They are so powerful that they \npushed the Senate away from the Department of Defense authorization \nbill in the middle of a war. Think about that. How could you move the \nSenate from considering a bill to help the men and women in uniform in \nthe middle of a war? The only way you can do it is if you are a \npowerful lobby that snaps and Senators jump. That is what this is all \nabout.\n\n  Before we adjourn at the end of the week, the Republican leadership \nwants to make certain that if we can't keep our word to our troops in \nthe field, we keep our word to the lobbyists downtown for the gun \nlobby. We carve out a piece of American law and say they cannot be held \npersonally responsible. Their businesses can't be held responsible for \nwrongdoing.\n  Is it because there is some huge problem in the gun industry? Are \nthere businesses that sell guns that are about to go bankrupt because \nof all the lawsuits that are being filed against them? Not at all. \nListen to this. On June 29, 2005, the huge American gunmaker Smith & \nWesson said in a press release:\n\n       We expect net product sales for fiscal year 2005 to be \n     approximately 124 million dollars, a 5 percent increase over \n     the $117.9 million reported for the last fiscal year. \n     Firearms sales for the next fiscal year are expected to \n     increase by approximately 11 percent over the last year.\n\n  Then March of 2005, Smith & Wesson also said:\n\n       In the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred \n     $4,535 in legal defense costs, net of amounts received from \n     insurance carriers relative to product liability and \n     municipal litigation.\n\n  Four thousand five hundred thirty-five dollars? Does that sound like \na crisis in the gun industry that would cause us to move away from \nconsidering the Department of Defense authorization bill?\n  Listen to this from another gunmaker. This is a filing with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, March 11, 2005, from the gunmaker \nSturm, Ruger:\n\n       It is not probable and is unlikely that litigation, \n     including punitive damage claims, will have a material \n     adverse effect on the financial position of the company.\n\n  These companies are doing very well. They are making a lot of money. \nThey are selling a lot of guns. They aren't being sued. It isn't \ncosting them a heck of a lot of money when they are sued. Why are we \ndoing it? Why would we give this unprecedented sweeping immunity to any \nindustry in America, let alone an industry that makes firearms?\n  This bill closes the courthouse doors to victims with legitimate \nlawsuits. It says: If you are a victim of a gun dealer or a gun \nmanufacturer who sold a gun in commerce, where they might have known or \nshould have known that it was going to be used for bad purposes, you \ncan't go to the courthouse. The door is closed. Sorry. That is the way \nit is going to be. The gun industry is going to be treated like \nroyalty. They are above the law.\n  During the debate on this bill during the last Congress, the \nsupporters said a lot of cases about victims were frivolous. We were \ntold all these companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. None of that \nturned out to be true. Two high-profile cases settled. These \nsettlements would not have occurred had this bill been enacted last \nyear. One of them, Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, was the dealer and \nBushmaster was the assault weapon maker in the DC sniper case. I \nremember that case. These crazy snipers ran around town, killing people \nwilly-nilly, innocent victims. When it was all over, the company that \nmade the sniper rifle, the assault weapon, ended up settling with the \nfamilies, paying over $2.5 million because of their wrongdoing. And \nBushmaster agreed to inform its dealers of safer sales practices to \nprevent other criminals from obtaining guns.\n  It was only right that the victims had their day in court. It was \nonly right that a jury of fellow citizens decided their fate. It was \nonly right that this company was held accountable for sales practices \nthat ended up endangering the lives of innocent people. Had this bill \nnow on the floor been passed, there would have been no day in court for \nthe families who were killed by these DC snipers.\n  Is that justice, fairness, or is that what we should be doing on the \nfloor of the Senate instead of working to help the men and women in \nuniform who are engaged in a war across the ocean, risking their lives?\n  Listen to this case. Will's Jewelry and Loan, a West Virginia pawn \nshop, settled with Police Officers McGuire and Lemongello in June 2004 \nfor $1 million and agreed to change its practices to prevent sales to \nunderground traffickers, which includes instituting a policy of \navoiding large-volume sales. Will's had sold the gun used to shoot the \ntwo police officers to a straw purchaser.\n  It is not only the innocent victims filing who were shot in DC who \nwould be stopped from suing. This bill will stop policemen and their \nfamilies from suing those who were selling guns, putting them into \ncommerce and endangering the lives of the men and women in uniform who \nget up every morning and try to protect us in our communities.\n  Not surprisingly, law enforcement officials in our Nation oppose this \nbill, such as the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, as well as police officers from around \nthe country have signed a letter begging Congress: Don't\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\npass this bill. It will make America more dangerous. It will endanger \nthe lives of policemen.\n  Newspapers in 19 different States have editorialized against this \nbill. What is troubling to me is that we could go from a bill designed \nto help protect America by helping our men and women in uniform to a \nbill that makes America less safe, a bill that allows companies to make \nguns, which are junk, Saturday-night specials, destined to be used in a \nholdup or a killing by some crazed drug addict. We can protect those \ncompanies, but we cannot protect our men and women in uniform, whether \nthey are serving in our military or serving as our policemen. What a \ndramatic distortion of priorities.\n  The Senate should be embarrassed that we have done this. This is a \nweek that the Republican leadership will never be able to explain--that \nthey would leave that bill in the midst of a war in order to do this \ngrand favor for the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association. It is \nnot fair. It is not fair that all we do around here is carve out \nspecial treatment and special exceptions for a lot of people who, \nfrankly, don't need them. We started off with the bankruptcy bill so \ncredit card companies could make sure that those who end up in \nbankruptcy carry the credit card debt to the grave. We passed the class \naction bill so individuals filing environmental class actions would \nhave a difficult time going to court. We have a bill waiting in the \nwings that says to 10,000 asbestos victims a year, you victims who \nnever dreamed you would be dying from exposure to asbestos are going to \nbe limited when you go to court too. There are bills pending dealing \nwith the victims of medical malpractice.\n  And now comes this bill--the absolute icing on the cake--that we \nwould give to the gun lobby immunity from their own wrongdoing, that \nwhen they make guns that end up killing people, that should not have \nbeen made, without the appropriate warnings, the appropriate safety \ndevices, when they sell guns by the carload to people who were clearly \ndestined to sell them on the street, to be used by drug gangs, they \ncannot be held accountable.\n  There is no personal responsibility under this law. That is not \nAmerican. That is not what the system of justice is all about. It \ncertainly doesn't speak to the fairness that we believe is essential to \nthe American system of justice. When you think of all the things we \ncould be doing, instead of finding another special interest group to \ngive their lobbyists such good news that we passed their big bill--we \ncould be passing a bill that says we are going to stop giving tax \ncredit to companies that run jobs overseas. We could have done that \nthis week. No, we didn't have time. We had to help this special \ninterest group, the NRA. They could have been changing the Medicare \ndrug prescription bill so they would be able to bargain for lower \nprices for seniors. No, that is not on the priority list of the \nRepublican leadership. We could have been making certain that we don't \nprivatize Social Security, and instead make it last. That is not a high \npriority for the Republican leadership. The gun lobby is the highest \npriority this week--higher than our service men and women. They could \nhave protected the pensions and retirements of Americans who are scared \nthey won't have anything to rely on. No time for that. No time this \nyear to deal with it. We could have been dealing with portability of \nhealth insurance and the availability of health insurance for small \nbusinesses. No, we have to deal with helping the NRA. We could have \nbeen helping people with college loans, figuring out new ways that \nfamilies can finance the education of their children. Sorry, if you \ndon't have a big lobby with a lot of power such as the gun lobby, we \ncannot do that. We could have been talking about the outsourcing of \nmedical and financial records, destroying the privacy of individuals \nand families. No way. We could have talked about credit card companies, \ngiving more disclosures on credit cards such as when they increase your \ninterest rate. No, we don't have time. We have to protect the gun \nmakers and gun sellers from being held personally responsible in court. \nWe could have increased our energy availability, it could have been \npart of our energy bill. You can hardly find it.\n  The list goes on. When you talk about the values of the Republican \nleadership in the Senate, you know the values today. To think that the \nRepublican leadership would move away from the Department of Defense \nbill for our troops to a special interest bill for the gun lobby, so \nthat they are not held accountable for selling Saturday-night specials \nthat kill policemen and innocent people. That is the priority of the \nRepublican leadership. It is not the priority of the American people.\n  I look forward to voting against this bill. I hope a majority of my \ncolleagues will join me in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a majority of the Senate is going to \nvote for this bill. We have 61 cosponsors. It ought to have already \nbeen passed a long time ago. We will be pleased to get this bill done. \nIt is something that is needed.\n  Mr. President, there will be more opportunity tomorrow. What happened \ntoday was that I voted to invoke cloture on the Defense bill so we can \ncomplete the Defense bill, and that was not passed by the votes on the \nother side. So when cloture was not invoked, we went to this bill, \nwhich has strong bipartisan support and which will be passed.\n  However, some on the other side did choose to filibuster the motion \nto proceed, as they have a right to do. That is what we are doing \ntoday. Then we will have a filibuster of the bill and we will have \ncloture, which I believe will be invoked. Certainly the votes appear to \nbe there for it. I think we will get this bill done. There are other \nthings we need to do this week that can still be done.\n  Mr. President, does Senator Reed have any comments?\n  Mr. REED. Yes. Mr. President, we have had a long discussion today \nabout the legislation. I think some of the points the Senator from \nIllinois made are very pertinent.\n  First, there is the erroneous presumption that people who would be \nsued would be sued because of the actions of others, when in fact the \nnegligent suits lie in showing that first an individual had a duty to \nsomeone else--a victim--and that duty was not fulfilled. Essentially, \nthat is the essence of negligence. If you cannot show that, you cannot \nget into court. This is not about somebody being punished or imposed \nupon for the actions of others. It goes right to the actions of the \nindividuals--the seller, manufacturer or, in this case, trade \nassociations.\n  There is a perception also, I think, that has been given that the \nlegislation as drafted actually provides exceptions that will cover the \nmeritorious suits, the ones that should be before the court and \neliminate the frivolous suits. In fact, that is not the case. As \nSenator Durbin pointed out in the situation with respect to the \nWashington, DC snipers, there a gun dealer in Washington State was \ngrossly negligent. He had 230 unaccounted for weapons and they should \nhave been accounted for. He allowed a teenage boy to walk in and pick \nup a sniper rifle off the counter and walk out and didn't know it was \nmissing until it was discovered to be the weapon of the assassins here \nin Washington, DC. That suit would have been barred by this legislation \nif it had passed. The two police officers--Lemongello and his partner--\nresponded to a call and they were in a shootout. They were seriously \nhurt, both of them. It turns out that the criminal firing that gun got \nit from a gun trafficker who walked into a store, a gun dealership, \nwith another woman as a straw purchaser and acquired 12 weapons for \ncash and walked out the door. In fact, they were so obvious that the \ngun dealer called ATF and said he sold them the weapons, but watch out \nfor them, which is negligent to me. Both cases were settled. Those \ncases would be thrown out.\n  The lives of all of the families in Washington, DC, have already been \ntotally changed because of the loss of their loved ones. Conrad Johnson \nwas a bus driver, waiting to go on his bus run, and he was shot, \nleaving a wife and children. They would have been out of luck because \nthey could not have brought a suit like this. And there were others. We \nall lived in fear ourselves. We drove around here looking over our \nshoulders wondering\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nwhether the assassins were out here in Washington, DC. One woman who \nwas an employee of the FBI and was walking in the parking lot of Home \nDepot in suburban Virginia was shot. Those families, those victims, \ncould not have come to the court of justice if this bill passed.\n  There are other suits that are pending today. There is a case in \nMassachusetts, where a young man, Danny Guzman, an innocent bystander, \nwas shot and killed in front of a nightclub in Worcester. Six days \nlater, police recovered a 9 mm Kahr Arms handgun without a serial \nnumber behind an apartment building, near where Mr. Guzman was shot. In \nfact, I am told a 4-year-old child discovered the weapon first. \nBallistic tests determined that the gun was the one used to kill Danny \nGuzman.\n  This gun was one of about 50 guns that disappeared from Kahr Arms' \nmanufacturing plant. Some of the guns were removed from the plant by \nemployees that Kahr Arms hired despite criminal records and histories \nof drug addiction. The case is being pursued now. The issue is not what \nMr. Guzman did. It is what this company failed to do. They failed to \nhave background checks on employees who handled weapons. They failed to \nhave security devices that would monitor if these weapons would be \ntaken out of Kahr Arms. I am told, interestingly enough, Kahr Arms is \nowned by a holding company for the benefit of the Reverend Sun Myung \nMoon's Unification Church. So one of the beneficiaries of this bill, if \nit passes, will be Reverend Moon's financial enterprises because they \nwill be protected from allegations of recklessness, not just \nnegligence.\n  Now, the first exception to the bill is title 18 United States Code \nsection 924(h). This simply permits cases against sellers who sell guns \nthey know will be used to commit a violent or drug trafficking crime. \nFirst, in the Kahr case, the guns were not sold; they were taken \nsurreptitiously out of the factory. This exception would not apply.\n  Second, you have to show they knew that the guns would be used to \ncommit a violent or drug trafficking crime--not that they were \nnegligent in allowing guns in circulation, but that they had to know \nthey would be used in a violent or drug trafficking crime.\n  The next exception is negligent entrustment. This applies where a gun \ndealer knows, or should know, that a purchaser will shoot someone with \nthe gun, and that individual shoots a person. This exception only \napplies to a gun ``seller.'' Once again, Kahr Arms was not, in this \nsituation, a seller. Moreover, Kahr Arms did not entrust its guns to \nits employees. Rather, Kahr's employees removed the guns from the plant \nbecause of Kahr's negligent security, inventory tracking, and hiring of \nemployees with histories of criminal conduct and drug addiction. So \nthat exception doesn't apply.\n  There is another exception, negligence per se. Under this provision, \ngun sellers whose negligence causes injury could not be liable unless, \nat a minimum, they also violated a law or regulation which the court \nfound an ``appropriate basis'' for a negligence per se claim and which \nproximately caused the injury. The exception only applies to a gun \nseller, and the bill defines sellers to include only importers or \ndealers, not manufacturers.\n\n  Moreover, in many States--and Massachusetts is one--negligence per se \nclaims are not allowed under their practice and, therefore, the \nexception would not apply.\n  Knowing violation of the law exception: This exception applies where \na gun seller or manufacturer knowingly violates a State or Federal \nstatute when it makes a sale that leads to an injury. Here, Kahr Arms \ndid not violate statutes related to the sale or manufacturing of a gun. \nRather, Kahr's employees surreptitiously took the guns out.\n  Breach of contract or warranty exceptions once again do not apply. It \nmerely allows gun purchasers to sue if the seller or manufacturer did \nnot provide the product or service it promised in its sales contract. \nThis exception clearly does not apply.\n  Defective design is a narrow exception for actions for some deceptive \ndesign or manufacturing cases. But that exception does not apply.\n  Rather than being legislation that allows the good suits through and \nthe frivolous ones out, this legislation effectively denies people, \nsuch as the family of Danny Guzman, their day in court, and many \nothers. It would have denied the two police officers from New Jersey \ntheir day in court. It would have denied the victims of the snipers \ntheir day in court.\n  For these reasons and many others, I am opposed to the legislation \nand join others who are and look forward to continuing our discussions \nin the hours and days ahead.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague and will say, \nit is such a state we are in America that a company whose employees \nsteal the guns and go out and shoot somebody with them gets sued for \nit. That is a fact of what my friend is saying, that these companies \nought to be sued as a result of the theft of a gun by their employees.\n  If the law required them to do a background check and they failed to \ndo so, they clearly would be liable under this act. The fact of filing \noff a serial number is, in fact, a criminal offense for which I have \nprosecuted quite a number of criminals. In addition, it would trigger, \nof course, a civil liability.\n  Gosh, we can talk about it a lot, and I will be glad to continue to \ndiscuss it, but the basic fact is a lot of these lawsuits are claiming \nthat if they know, if manufacturers or distributors or sellers either \nknow or should know that some guns will be used illegally, they should \nbe responsible for it. That is not good law. This is against what we \nare about in this country.\n  All this legislation does is say if you sell the firearm according to \nlaw, if you manufacture it according to law and somebody commits an \nintervening criminal act with it and shoots somebody, you should not be \nsued. But we have this anti-gun crowd which doesn't care about general \nprinciples of law that have stood us in good stead for hundreds of \nyears. They have learned to manipulate the matter as effectively as \nthey can to maintain lawsuits. The letter from Beretta I read earlier \nindicates that in the District of Columbia, the gun manufacturers who \nsold a gun in Minnesota and it was transported some way to Washington, \nDC, and was used in a crime and somebody was shot, the gun manufacturer \nis liable for that. And, in fact, that one jurisdiction that allows \nthat kind of lawsuit can be enough to take down every gun manufacturing \ncompany in the United States. They have had some tough years and a lot \nof litigation going on.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken again, and unless my colleague would \nlike to reply, we will close. It has been a good debate, and I have \nenjoyed it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8932-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

HOLLY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize \nthe service of an outstanding leader and public servant. After more \nthan 32 years in uniform, MG John W. Holly will soon retire and move \ninto private life.\n  Four years ago, Major General Holly was appointed Program Director of \nthe Joint Program Office of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense. For the \npast year he has also served as the Deputy Director of the Missile \nDefense Agency, overseeing the direction of all other ballistic missile \ndefense programs in the agency.\n  The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System is not your run-of-the-mill \nweapons program. It is virtually global in scope, spanning 12 time \nzones, from the United Kingdom to the outer reaches of the Aleutian \nIslands. It has required upgrades to early warning radars from the Cold \nWar era and the development of the most advanced sea-going X-band radar \never built; this equipment was then linked with communication centers \nthroughout the United States and firing sites in Alaska and California. \nThis effort has also\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\ninvolved the development, testing, and deployment of an interceptor-\nand-kill vehicle that closes in on its target at speeds of up to 18,000 \nmiles an hour and hits within centimeters of its aim point.\n  Each of the major systems involved in this effort and many of their \ncomponent parts were built under different contracts, often by \ndifferent manufacturers, at different times, and with different \ntechnologies. The entire system is being developed and acquired by non-\ntraditional methods, which ensure we deploy effective defensive \ncapabilities to our troops as fast as possible. And, of course, all of \nthese pieces must work together as one, flawlessly, every time and on \nvery short notice.\n  Since the 1960s, Americans have dreamed of having this type of \ncapability, and in the past 3 years we have made remarkable progress. \nNone of this would have been possible if President Bush had not \nwithdrawn the United States from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in \nJune 2002. And much of our success can be attributed to the dedication \nand leadership of Major General Holly.\n  Major General Holly was ideally prepared for his responsibilities at \nthe Missile Defense Agency. His experiences at the platoon through \ncorps levels gave him an understanding of what it means to support our \nmen and women in uniform. His management experience in research, \ndevelopment, and acquisition--especially in rocket propulsion and \nguidance--honed his ability to integrate complex systems and move all \nof the essential parts through development at the same time.\n  In short, Major General Holly was the right man, in the right place, \nat the right time for our missile defense needs. Americans are deeply \nindebted to him for answering the call to serve.\n  Like many of my Senate colleagues, I often had the opportunity to \nmeet with Major General Holly. Many of those visits took place in \nAlaska. And like many of my Senate colleagues, I have always been \nimpressed with his integrity, commitment, and leadership skills.\n  Under Major General Holly's leadership, we have cut a new path \nthrough uncharted territory. He personally oversaw the emplacement of \nsilos and interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force \nBase, California. He showed what could be done if you provided the \nright guidance, tools, and motivation.\n  Americans owe Major General Holly a debt of gratitude for a lifetime \nof selfless service and for his profound contributions to our Nation \nand our security. Those of us in the Senate will miss his leadership \nand his counsel. We wish him and his family all the best in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8933-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEMOCRACY IN ETHIOPIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues an op-ed in today's edition of the Taipei Times by Berhanu \nNega, the chairman of Ethiopia's main opposition political party.\n  While the op-ed sheds light on the opposition's viewpoint throughout \nthe controversial elections, I want to second the author's call for \neveryone in Ethiopia to commit themselves to a peaceful resolution of \nthis crisis. Simply put, such a commitment is in the national interests \nof that country.\n  Let me close by indicating that the Senate continues to follow events \nin Ethiopia. I ask that a copy of the op-ed be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n\n                 [From the Taipei Times, July 22, 2005]\n\n                  Ethiopia Is Struggling for Democracy\n\n                           (By Berhanu Nega)\n\n       When we in Ethiopia's political opposition agreed to \n     participate in the election that the government called in \n     June, we were under no illusion that the process would be \n     faultless. After all, Ethiopia has never known democracy. The \n     dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam was Africa's most \n     blood-curdling Marxist regime, and was replaced by today's \n     ruling EPRDF, whose ``Revolutionary Democracy'' is but a more \n     subtle variation on the same theme.\n       So we knew that there would be problems with the election, \n     that voting would not be clean in the way Western countries \n     take for granted. Yet we nonetheless believed that the \n     opposition, led by the Coalition for Unity and Democracy \n     (CUD), would have room to maneuver and campaign, owing to the \n     government's desire for international legitimacy. So we \n     decided to test the waters and push for a real political \n     opening and a genuinely competitive vote. Many Ethiopians \n     appear to have agreed with this strategy.\n       The government did make some media available and engaged in \n     more than 10 live televised debates. So, at least at first, \n     there seemed to have been some intention on the government's \n     part to open up the process--if not completely, then \n     somewhat.\n       Now, however, it appears that the authorities wanted only a \n     small, managed opening, on the assumption that they could \n     control the outcome.\n       About a month before the election, the government began to \n     shut down the political space it had opened. Its election \n     campaign took on a vilifying tone, charging that the \n     opposition was bent on destroying ethnic groups \n     through genocide. Indeed, it called the opposition \n     ``interahamwe,'' invoking the memory of the Hutu militia \n     that slaughtered 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis in 1994. The \n     government also began to harass opposition parties, \n     especially in rural areas.\n       This was unpleasant, but tolerable. So we continued \n     campaigning. But things became nastier a week before the \n     vote. Attendance at an official pro-government rally in the \n     capital, Addis Ababa, was dwarfed by our rally the following \n     day, when millions of demonstrators peacefully demanded \n     change and showed their support for us. At that point, the \n     government realized that its democratic opening was slipping \n     out of its control.\n       Two days before the vote, our poll watchers and supporters \n     were searched, arrested, and given one-day trials, with most \n     sentenced to one or two months in jail. We feared that the \n     voting would take place without the presence of our poll \n     watchers. So we gave a press conference--all the opposition \n     parties together--the day before the vote, demanding that the \n     government release our party workers and allow people to vote \n     freely.\n       Although the government met neither of these demands, the \n     early results clearly showed that the opposition was gaining \n     a large number of seats. It became obvious that we were \n     winning in many constituencies and that we had won in Addis \n     Ababa, as well as in most of the major cities and the rural \n     areas.\n       What was surprising was the magnitude of the victory. In \n     Addis Ababa, top government officials, including the \n     ministers of education and capacity building, lost, as did \n     the speaker of the House of People's Representatives. In \n     rural constituencies, opposition candidates defeated such \n     EPRDF heavyweights as the ministers of defense, information, \n     and infrastructure, along with the presidents of the two \n     largest regions, Oromia and Amhara.\n       The government wasted little time in responding: the next \n     day, it declared itself the winner, with not even half of the \n     constituencies reporting their results.\n       No surprise, then, that the public erupted in anger. When \n     university students protested, the police moved in, killing \n     one. In demonstrations the following day, 36 more people were \n     killed. Soon after, our office workers were detained, and \n     Hailu Shawel, Chairman of the CUD, and senior CUD official \n     Lidetu Ayalew were put under house arrest. One hundred staff \n     members were taken from our head office in Addis Ababa alone, \n     and many more from regional offices. Up to 6,000 people were \n     jailed--CUD members and even ordinary citizens.\n       My fear is that the will of Ethiopia's people will be \n     stifled by government hard-liners. Doubts about the \n     authenticity of the final results will create a danger of \n     instability. Everyone--the government, the opposition, and \n     the public--must commit themselves to a peaceful resolution.\n       To restore calm before a recount can be held, confidence-\n     building measures are needed. The military must be taken off \n     the streets. The ban on public demonstrations must be lifted. \n     Those in jail must be released or given a fair trial. Those \n     held simply because they do not support the government must \n     be freed and allowed to participate in the democratic \n     process. The government-controlled media must be open to \n     diverse opinions; in particular, opposition access must be \n     guaranteed.\n       Equally important, the international community must send \n     observers--and thus a clear signal to the government that any \n     attempt to maintain power by force or intimidation is \n     unacceptable. The world must keep watching, just as it \n     watched in Georgia, Ukraine, Lebanon, and Palestine.\n       For the first time in our ancient history, we Ethiopians \n     have voted our conscience. Our people have played their part \n     with courage and discipline. They deserve the opportunity to \n     build a genuine democratic political system. That is their \n     only guarantee to live in peace and to achieve prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8933-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8933-S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASEAN AND BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I welcome the good news from Southeast \nAsia this morning that the illegitimate Burmese junta--the misnamed \nState Peace and Development Council, SPDC--has deferred its 2006 \nchairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN.\n  I appreciate and recognize the individual and collective efforts of \ncertain ASEAN member states for their support of substantive political \nreform in Burma.\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\n  This deferral serves as evidence that the illegitimate military junta \ndoes indeed respond to international pressure, particularly from its \nneighbors. In the wake of this news, I renew my calls for countries in \nthe region to pressure the junta to immediately and unconditionally \nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in Burma and \nto continue their calls for political reform in that country; the \nUnited Nations Security Council to discuss and debate the threat the \njunta poses to its own people and the entire region; and the community \nof democracies to continue to keep freedom in Burma a top priority.\n  The assertion by the SPDC that the deferral will allow the generals \nto focus on the ``democratization process'' in Burma is as hollow as it \nis false.\n  The international community--especially the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom--must be clear that the junta will be judged not by what \nit says but by what it does. So long as Suu Kyi and other innocent \nBurmese remain imprisoned and without a voice in the political \ndeliberations in Burma, there simply can be no credible democratization \nprocess in Rangoon.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8934-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ADA'S 15TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Over the years, I am \nproud of the progress our country has made in including people with \ndisabilities in public places and events. This sweeping legislation is \nperhaps one of the most significant pieces of legislation since the \n1964 Civil Rights Act. Under this bold law, people with disabilities \nwere ensured nondiscrimination in employment and public accommodations, \nincluding transportation and telecommunications. Implementation has not \nbeen easy, and it is still ongoing. While meaningful progress has been \nmade, there is still a great deal of work to do to achieve the bold \ngoal of the Americans with Disability Act.\n  We must continue to push hard to end discrimination and fully embrace \ninclusion, but today we should also celebrate the strides made since \n1990 on behalf of people with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8934-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8934-S8937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we celebrate the enactment of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act in 1990--one of the greatest civil \nrights laws in our history. Fifteen years ago, the Nation adopted the \nfundamental principle that people should be measured by what they can \ndo, not what they can't. The Americans with Disabilities Act began a \nnew era of opportunity for millions of disabled citizens who had been \ndenied full and fair participation in society.\n  For generations, people with disabilities were pitied as people who \nneeded charity, not opportunity. Out of ignorance, the Nation accepted \ndiscrimination for decades, and yielded to fear and prejudice. The \npassage of the ADA finally ended these condescending and suffocating \nattitudes--and widened the doors of opportunity for all people with \ndisabilities.\n  The 15th anniversary of this landmark legislation is a time to \nreflect on how far we have come in improving the ``real life'' \npossibilities for the Nation's 56 million people with disabilities. In \nfact, the seeds were planted long before 1990.\n  In 1932, the United States elected a disabled person to the highest \noffice in the land. He became one of the greatest Presidents in our \nhistory. But even Franklin Roosevelt felt compelled by the prejudice of \nhis times and hid his disability as much as possible. The World War II \ngeneration began to change all that.\n  The 1940s and the 1950s introduced the Nation to a new class of \nAmericans with disabilities--wounded and disabled veterans returning \nfrom war to an inaccessible society. Even before the war ended, \nrehabilitation medicine had been born. Disability advocacy \norganizations began to rise. Disability benefits were added to Social \nSecurity. Each decade since then has brought significant new progress \nand more change.\n  In the 1960s, Congress responded with new architectural standards, so \nwe could have a society everyone could be a part of. No one would have \nto wait outside a new building because they were disabled.\n  The 1970s convinced us that greater opportunities for fuller \nparticipation in society were possible for the disabled. Congress \nresponded with a range of steps to improve the lives of people with \nmental retardation, to support the right of children with disabilities \nto attend public schools, to guarantee the right of people with \ndisabilities to vote in elections, and to insist on greater access to \ncultural and recreational programs in their communities.\n  The 1980s brought a new realization, however, that when we talk about \nhelping people with disabilities, we can't just rely on government \nprograms. We need to involve private industry as well. Congress \nguaranteed fair housing opportunities for people with disabilities, \nrequired fair access to air travel, and made telecommunications \nadvances available for people hard of hearing or deaf.\n  The crowning achievement in these decades of progress was passage of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 and its promise of a new \nand better life to every disabled citizen, in which their disabilities \nwould no longer put an end to their dreams.\n  As one eloquent citizen with a disability has said, ``I do not wish \nto be a kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the State look after \nme. I want to take the calculated risk, to dream and to build, to fail \nand to succeed. I want to enjoy the benefits of my creations and face \nthe world boldly, and say, this is what I have done.''\n  Our families, our neighbors, and our friends with disabilities have \ntaught us in ways no books can teach. The inclusion of people with \ndisabilities enriches all our lives. My son Teddy continues to teach me \nevery day the greatest lesson of all that disabled does not mean \nunable.\n  As the saying goes, when people are excluded from the social fabric \nof a community, it creates a hole--and when there is a hole, the entire \nfabric is weaker. It lacks richness, texture, and the strength that \ndiversity brings. The fabric of our Nation is stronger today than it \nwas 15 years ago, because people with disabilities are no longer left \nout and left behind. And because of that, America is a greater and \nbetter and fairer nation.\n  Today in this country we see the signs of the progress that mean so \nmuch in our ongoing efforts to include persons with disabilities in \nevery aspect of life--the ramps beside the steps, the sidewalks with \ncurb-cuts to accommodate wheelchairs, the lifts for helping disabled \npeople to take buses to work or the store or to a movie.\n  Disabled students are no longer barred from schools and denied an \neducation. They are learning and achieving at levels once thought \nimpossible. They are graduating from high schools, enrolling in \nuniversities, joining the workforce, achieving their goals, enriching \ntheir communities and their country.\n  They have greater access than ever to the rehabilitation and training \nthey need to be successfully employed and become productive, \ncontributing members of their communities.\n  With the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, we \nfinally linked civil rights closely to health care. It isn't civil and \nit isn't right to send a disabled person to work without the health \ncare they need and deserve.\n  These milestones show us that we are well on the way to fulfilling \nthe promise of a new, better, and more inclusive\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nlife for citizens with disabilities--but we still have a way to go. \nToday, as we rightly look back with pride, we also need to look ahead.\n  We still face many challenges, especially in areas such as health \ncare and in home-based and community-based services and supports. Many \npeople with disabilities still do not have the health care they need.\n  A strong Medicare prescription drug benefit is essential for all \npeople with disabilities. Today, about one in six Medicare \nbeneficiaries--over six million people--are people with disabilities \nunder age 65. Over the next 10 years that number is expected to \nincrease to 8 million.\n  These persons are much less likely to be able to obtain or afford \nprivate insurance coverage. Many of them are forced to choose between \nbuying groceries, paying their mortgage, or paying for their \nmedication.\n  Families raising children with significant disabilities deserve \nhealth care for their children. No family should be forced to go \nbankrupt, stay in poverty, or give up custody of their child in order \nto get needed health care for their disabled child. They deserve the \nright to buy in to Medicaid, so that their family can stay together and \nstay employed.\n  People with disabilities and older Americans need community-based \nassistance as well, so they can live at home with their families and in \ntheir communities. We need to find a way to ensure this support is \navailable, without forcing families into poverty. This is today's \nchallenge to the Nation, and we need to work together to meet it.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act was an extraordinary milestone in \nthe pursuit of the American dream. Many disability and civil rights \nleaders in communities throughout the country worked long and hard and \nwell to achieve it.\n  To each of you, I say thank you. It is all of you who are the true \nheroes of this achievement, and who will lead us in the fight to keep \nthe ADA strong in the years ahead.\n  Sadly, the Supreme Court is not on our side. In the past 15 years, it \nhas restricted the intended scope of the ADA. Imagine you are a person \nwith epilepsy in a job you love and you get excellent personnel \nreviews. You are taking medicine that controls the seizures and you \nhave no symptoms. But your employer finds out you have epilepsy and \nfires you. Should you be able to sue your employer for discrimination? \nCongress intended you should--but the Supreme Court ruled you can't.\n  The Court continues to carve out exception after exception in the \nADA. But discrimination is discrimination, and no attempt to blur that \nline or write out exceptions into the law should be tolerated. Congress \nwouldn't do it and it is wrong for the Supreme Court to do it.\n  The ADA was a spectacular example of bipartisan cooperation and \nsuccess. Passed by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats alike took rightful pride in the \ngoals of the law and its many accomplishments.\n  I know that the first President Bush, Senator Bob Dole, and many \nMembers of Congress from both sides of the aisle consider their work on \nthe ADA to be among their finest accomplishments in public service. It \nis widely regarded today as one of the true giant steps in our ongoing \ntwo-centuries-old civil rights revolution.\n  The need for that kind of bipartisan cooperation is especially \ncritical today, as the Senate considers the nomination of John Roberts \nto fill Justice O'Connor's vacancy on the Supreme Court. Many people \nare generally aware of Justice O'Connor's role in a number of landmark \ndecisions on reproductive and civil rights. Few know, though, that she \ncast the deciding vote in Lane v. Tennessee in 2004, the 5-4 ruling on \nthe constitutionality of the ADA and whether Congress has the power to \nprohibit the exclusion of people with disabilities from public \nfacilities in communities across the country.\n  The four dissenting Justices, in the name of States' rights, believed \nthat Congress had no authority to do so. The case was brought by a \nparaplegic who complained that he was forced to crawl up the steps of \nthe local courthouse to gain entry to the building. Justice O'Connor's \nswing vote upheld the ADA and the right of Congress under the \nConstitution to pass this landmark law to protect persons with such \ndisabilities and guarantee their access to courts and other public \nfacilities.\n  The Senate's decision on the confirmation of Judge Roberts to the \nSupreme Court may very well determine whether the ADA will survive as \nwe know it. His views on a wide range of issues are little known, but \nsome of his views raise serious questions about his position on the \nrights of those with disabilities, and Senators have a clear \nresponsibility in the coming hearings to determine his views on these \nbasic issues.\n  Hopefully, the new Supreme Court will continue to support the right \nof Congress to act in this important area, so that the extraordinary \nprogress of the past 15 years will be sustained, not undermined. I \nintend to do all I can to see that it is.\n  Today, more than ever, disability need no longer mean the end of the \nAmerican dream. Our goal is to banish stereotypes and discrimination, \nso that every disabled person can realize the dream of working and \nliving independently, and being a productive and contributing member of \nour community.\n  That goal should be the birthright of every American--and the ADA \nopened the door for every disabled American to achieve it.\n  A story from the debate on the ADA eloquently made the point. A \npostmaster in a town was told to make his post office accessible. The \nbuilding had 20 steep steps leading up to a revolving door at the only \nentrance. The postmaster questioned the need to make such costly \nrepairs. He said, ``I've been here for 35 years, and in all that time, \nI've yet to see a single customer come in here in a wheelchair.'' As \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act has proved so well, if you build \nthe ramp, they will come, and they will find their field of dreams.\n  So let's ramp up our own efforts across the country. We need to keep \nbuilding those ramps, no matter how many steps stand in the way. We \nwill not stop today or tomorrow or next month or next year. We will not \never stop until America works for all Americans.\n  I ask all Senators to join me today in committing to keep the ADA \nstrong. It is an act of conscience, an act of community, and above all, \nan act of continued hope for the future.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a topic that has \ngreat importance to me and to the citizens of New Jersey. Fifteen years \nago, Congress passed historic civil rights legislation based on the \nfundamental principle that this great Nation of ours benefits from the \ntalents of every citizen. The passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) began an era of opportunity for 54 million \nAmericans. In the 15 years since, this landmark legislation has thrown \nopen doors and provided equal opportunities for people with \ndisabilities. The ADA has brought the American dream within reach of \nmillions of Americans.\n  I regret that I was unable to mark the fifteenth anniversary of the \nADA with my Senate colleagues. Last night, I joined the family of \nDwayne Reeves, a Newark school police officer killed in the line of \nduty, for the officer's wake. My deepest sympathies and my prayers are \nwith his family as they grieve this senseless and tragic loss.\n  In the 15 years since the passage of the ADA, we have witnessed \ndramatic changes throughout the Nation--from greater public \naccommodation at places of business and commercial establishments to \nthe expansion of government services for disabled citizens and the \nstunning advances in transportation and telecommunications technology. \nCitizens who could not fully participate in their communities are now \nable to go to the park, visit a movie theater, or attend a ballgame. In \nmy home State of New Jersey, beach communities from Sandy Hook to Cape \nMay have installed wheelchair access ramps and provide beach \nwheelchairs for disabled individuals, ensuring that all citizens can \njoin family and friends for a relaxing day at the beach. These steps \nhave enabled many citizens to contribute to their communities, make the \nmost of their abilities, and live their lives to the fullest.\n  Yet we must not be content to stop here. There is still much work to \nbe\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\ndone to ensure that all Americans, especially those who were \ndiscriminated against until 15 years ago, are given an equal chance at \nusing all of America's tools for success. This is why I, along with my \ncolleague Senator Harkin and so many others, have worked to improve and \nexpand the Ticket to Work, Workforce Investment Act, and Vocational \nRehabilitation programs. These programs provide unparalleled \nopportunity to Americans with disabilities by equipping them with the \nskill sets necessary to work in education, science, business, \ngovernment and other fields that weren't previously accessible. In \naddition, I plan to continue my efforts to defend and strengthen the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act because equal opportunity \ndoes not exist without equal access to education.\n  The ADA is about ensuring that every American can participate fully \nin all of the daily activities that many of us take for granted. \nWhether it is using the phone, going out to dinner, or commuting to \nwork on public transportation, the ADA ensures that all citizens have \nthe ability to carry on their personal affairs. Fifteen years ago, we \nsaid yes to inclusion, yes to independence, and yes to integration into \nevery aspect of society for people with disabilities. We have made a \nlot of progress since that day. Let us make sure we continue down this \npath by providing equal opportunity and ensuring that our Nation \nbenefits from the unique abilities of all Americans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks the 15th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, a truly momentous occasion that the \nSenate marked yesterday by voting 87-0 in support of a resolution \nrecognizing and honoring this anniversary. On this anniversary, we \ncelebrate one of the great, landmark civil rights laws of the 20th \ncentury--a long overdue emancipation proclamation for people with \ndisabilities.\n  We also celebrate the men and women, from all across America, whose \ndaily acts of protest, persistence and courage moved this law forward \nto passage 15 years ago.\n  We have made great progress in America in the last 15 years, and \nevidence of that progress can be found all around us. It has changed \nlives--and changed our Nation. It has made the American dream possible \nfor tens of millions of people with disabilities.\n  But, our work is not yet complete in fulfilling the four great goals \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act: equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for \npersons with disabilities. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate \nthe anniversary of the ADA than by rededicating ourselves to these \ngoals. I look forward to working with my fellow Senators and the \ndisability community to building on the progress that we have made over \nthe past 15 years. Toward that end, I ask unanimous consent to print in \nthe Record a ``Statement of Solidarity'' from over 700 disability \nrights and civil rights organizations, led by the American Association \nof Persons with Disabilities and the National Council on Independent \nLiving, that highlights the many challenges we face as we continue on \nthe path that leads to liberty and justice for all. I hope that my \nfellow Senators will review this document carefully, as I believe it \nraises a number of important issues that we should consider as we once \nagain rededicate ourselves to realizing the full promise of the ADA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Statement of Solidarity on 15th Anniversary of Americans With \n                     Disabilities Act July 26, 2005\n\n       Fifteen years ago today, with bipartisan support in \n     Congress and broad endorsements from the civil rights \n     coalition, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), calling for the \n     ``shameful wall of exclusion'' to come tumbling down. As we \n     mark this significant anniversary, we celebrate improvements \n     in access to polling places and the secret ballot, government \n     services and programs, transportation, public places, \n     communication and information technology. Parents pushing \n     strollers, workers delivering packages, and travelers pulling \n     roller bags have grown accustomed to curb cuts, ramps, and \n     other accessibility features less common in 1990. Our country \n     is more accessible today thanks to the ADA, and all Americans \n     are better off.\n       Although substantial progress has been made, we are \n     reminded every day of the significant remnants of the \n     ``shameful wall of exclusion'' that continue to prevent this \n     great country from realizing the full promise of the ADA.\n       The majority of Americans with disabilities continue to \n     live in poverty and unnecessary isolation.\n       Most adults with disabilities are either not working or not \n     working to their full potential, robbing the economy of the \n     contributions of tens of millions of would-be workers.\n       Children and youth in special education continue to drop \n     out of school in alarming numbers before obtaining a regular \n     high school diploma.\n       The promises of higher education, accessible and affordable \n     housing and transportation, quality affordable healthcare, \n     and a living wage continue to elude many adults with \n     disabilities and their families.\n       The ADA is slowly driving policy changes that have enabled \n     more people with significant mental and physical disabilities \n     to live independently in the community, but the ongoing \n     institutional bias in the Medicaid program keeps too many \n     people trapped in nursing homes and other institutions, \n     unable to enjoy the freedoms and personal choices about where \n     and how to live that other Americans take for granted.\n       New technologies are increasing the independence and \n     productivity of many Americans. Yet, advances in technology \n     alone are not guaranteed to improve the lives of people with \n     disabilities. As we develop applications like Voice-over-\n     Internet-Protocol (VOIP) telephony, wireless \n     telecommunications, widespread broadband internet \n     connectivity, new medical devices, new computer applications, \n     and a plethora of new genetic tests, it is critical that \n     these technologies be designed and used in a way that \n     increases the inclusion, independence, and empowerment of \n     Americans with disabilities as well as America's growing \n     senior population.\n       The ADA has begun to change the landscape of our cities and \n     towns, but a civil rights law alone does not create the kind \n     of transformation of attitudes that Americans with \n     disabilities, their families, and allies are fighting to \n     achieve. This kind of change requires widespread discussion, \n     education, and consciousness-raising.\n       In 2005, how do fears, myths, and stereotypes continue to \n     artificially limit understanding and acceptance of disability \n     as a form of human diversity?\n       What role do the mass media and entertainment industries \n     play in forming public perceptions of disability, and how can \n     decision makers in these important fields be influenced to \n     produce more content that depicts the actual life experience \n     and first person perspectives of people with disabilities?\n       What can be done to further improve accessibility at the \n     design stage of new products and programs?\n       How can disability awareness and disability-friendly \n     practices create more productive places of business and \n     learning?\n       What concrete actions can worship communities and sports \n     and recreation programs take to foster full participation of \n     children, youth, and adults with disabilities in these \n     activities?\n       Why do so many Americans continue to view disability as a \n     fate worse than death, and how do these views affect \n     surrogate medical decisionmaking and the application of new \n     genetic testing technologies?\n       These questions form the basis of an American conversation \n     that still needs to take place.\n       Widespread social change cannot simply be legislated, and \n     it will not occur without bold leadership from all sectors of \n     American society.\n       Public and private employers, in particular, must make a \n     serious, concerted effort to recruit and advance qualified \n     workers with disabilities within their labor force.\n       Election officials must take the necessary actions to \n     ensure that every adult is able to enter his or her polling \n     place and cast a secret and independent vote.\n       School administrators and university presidents must \n     embrace their responsibility to deliver a world-class \n     education to all their students.\n       It is time for leaders across America--business owners, \n     little league coaches, moms and dads, sheriffs and clergy--to \n     reject exclusion, paternalism, and segregation and to take \n     personal responsibility for removing barriers to full \n     participation that still exist in every community in this \n     country.\n       With the aim of making America work better for everyone, \n     the undersigned organizations pledge to build on the progress \n     of the last 15 years and join together to promote the full \n     participation and self-determination of the more than 50 \n     million U.S. children and adults with disabilities. We \n     believe that disability is a natural part of the human \n     experience that in no way should limit the right of all \n     people to make choices, pursue meaningful careers, live \n     independently, and participate fully in all aspects of \n     society. We encourage every American to join us in this \n     cause, so that our country may continue on the path that \n     leads to liberty and justice for all.\n       Signed by 743 organizations.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to remember an important \noccasion that represents 15 years in our Nation's history and welcome \nthe opportunity to speak on these issues which are near and dear to my \nheart. On July 26, 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\nwith Disabilities Act, ADA, with bipartisan support in Congress under \nthe leadership of then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, my predecessor \nfrom Kansas, and thanks in large part to the dedication and hard work \nof my current colleague, the good Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, as \nwell as current Senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Daniel Inouye of \nHawaii.\n  Today we must continue to dismantle, brick by brick, the ``shameful \nwall of exclusion'' that existed in the United States previous to the \nexistence of the ADA. And, building on our 15 years of experiences in \ntearing down the wall of exclusion, we must continue to bring to \nrealization the full promise of the ideas entailed in the ADA. To carry \non this significant legacy, we must recognize that, today, we face new \nchallenges and new policy considerations.\n  It is estimated that there are now in America 50 million citizens \nwith some sort of disability. An amazing individual from Kansas who \nvisited D.C. last week to tell his story is 7-year-old Matthew Whaley. \nMatthew was denied access to the local recreation department's baseball \nleague because he happened to have cerebral palsy. However, because of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, he is now showing off his All-Star \nbaseball skills as an outfielder.\n  When I think about what Congress needs to accomplish for people with \ndisabilities over the next few years, to continue to achieve the dream \nthat should have been, and that the ADA began to make possible, I \nconsider what policies we need to change to ensure that Matthew, and \nothers with disabilities, can continue to make a positive difference in \nthis world.\n  We must consider America's aging population. According to the U.S. \nCensus, by the year 2050, 21 percent of America's total population will \nbe age 65 and over. It is understood that the probability of having a \ndisability increases with age. This means that America's population \nwith disabilities will continue to grow.\n  It is imperative that we look for ways to meet the needs of this \npopulation and ensure that they can continue to live independent, \nfulfilling lives. Just recently, I spent time with a constituent of \nmine who embodies this idea--a man named Rick Davidson from Olathe, KS. \nRick is a motivational speaker for at-risk youth, has traveled across \nthe country meeting with lawmakers on disabilities' policy issues, and \nis attending college for an associates degree in Web design. Rick has \nlived a healthy and active life as a quadriplegic for almost 18 years--\ndoctors initially estimated that Rick had just 16 years to live.\n  Another way we can make a positive impact for the future is through \nsupporting endeavors such as the New Freedom Initiative--a \ncomprehensive program to promote the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in all areas of society by increasing access to assistive \ntechnologies, expanding educational and employment opportunities, and \npromoting increased access to daily community life.\n  In the context of changing public policy, we must also examine how \neffectively government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are \nserving the needs of individuals with disabilities. For example, the \nMedicare Program's benefit for mobility devices has an ``in the home'' \nrestriction which limits coverage to only those mobility devices that \nare necessary within a patient's home. Unfortunately, this does not \naddress the needs of a patient who would use this device to obtain \naccess to his or her community, work, school, physician's office, \npharmacy, or place of worship. In view of this, I recently signed on a \nletter requesting that Medicare's mobility device ``in the home'' \nrestriction be modified to improve community access for Medicare \nrecipients with disabilities. I am also a cosponsor of legislation that \nwould offer lower income families who have children with disabilities \nthe opportunity to acquire health care coverage through the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  Along these lines, Congress must address the issue of accessibility \nto long-term care for the elderly and those with disabilities. \nCurrently, we have a Medicaid system that spends approximately two-\nthirds of its dollars on institutional care and approximately one-third \non community services. This antiquated policy effectively removes \ndisabled and elderly individuals from their community, family, and \nfriends. Even from a cost perspective, this system does not make sense. \nAccording to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the \ncost of nursing home care ranges from $30,000 to $80,000 per year, \nwhile the annual cost of home and community care is much lower.\n  The bottom line is that Congress must work to align the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs with goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nAfter all, we live in America and in this country we celebrate \nindependence, self-determination, uniqueness, and a sense of community. \nWe must maintain these ideals for our children as well. This year, I \nintroduced the Prenatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act. For some \nconditions that can be detected in the womb, we are aborting 80 percent \nor more of the babies who test positive. The effect of this type of \n``weeding out'' is the creation of a sort of new eugenics, a form of \nsystematic, disability-based discrimination. The latter process is to \nthe detriment of our society.\n  In addition to the many abilities that persons with disabilities \nhave, these individuals so often have a perspective the rest of us \ndon't have. We learn compassion, heroism, humility, courage, and self-\nsacrifice from these special individuals--and their gift to us is to \ninspire us, by their example, to achieve these virtues ourselves.\n  In our discussion of fostering independence, we must keep in mind the \nimportance of guaranteeing all individuals their right to vote. Our \ncitizens with disabilities deserve equal access and an equal voice in \nour democratic process. Initiatives such as the Help America Vote Act, \nenacted in 2002, created vital grant programs ensuring electoral \nparticipation by persons with disabilities and making polling places \naccessible to persons with disabilities. Congress must continue to look \nfor ways to expand access to our electoral system for persons with \ndisabilities.\n  While we can change public policy to reflect the ideas embodied in \nthe ADA, it is just as important to seek change at the individual \nlevel. Every human being has the ability to change their own ideas and \nactions in their daily life as they meet an elderly person or a person \nwith disabilities. As Americans, we have a God-given duty to love each \nand every person, and treat them, not as a means to an end, but as an \nend in and of themselves. As a Nation, we are so blessed with the \npresence of individuals who are different than us, and who have the \nability to teach us; to teach us about love, about compassion, and \nabout what it means to have strength and courage from within.\n  My vision for America is to continue to build on the momentous legacy \nof the ADA, where we as citizens continue to celebrate the breadth of \nexperience and life lessons that persons with disabilities offer us.\n  Over 137,000 individuals with disabilities reside in my State of \nKansas. My hope for them is the same as my hope for all Americans who \nhave disabilities: that we as a society and as a government do \neverything in our power to foster their independence, to nurture their \nsoul and to embrace their contributions to society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8937-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8937-S8940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment No. 1389 to postpone the current round of domestic military \nbase closures.\n  The threats confronting the United States today are vastly different \nfrom those during the Cold War, and we must shift our defense posture \nto address new and emerging enemies. I do not dispute that closing and \nrealigning excess military capacity is critical to that endeavor. \nHowever, I fear we are rushing to conclude this process before having \nall pertinent national security information to make a well-informed \ndecision. In short, I believe we have put the cart before the horse.\n  While I support delaying this base closure round, I do not dismiss \nthe important work of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The \nCommissioners and their staff should be commended for their diligent \nefforts to carefully review and evaluate each recommendation made by \nthe Pentagon.\n  Having said that, I believe closing military installations without \nthoughtful consideration is short-\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nsighted. Before implementing this round of base closures critical \nissues should be resolved to ensure we have not irrevocably damaged our \nability to confront threats at home and abroad. The amendment requires \nspecific benchmarks be fulfilled before the current round of domestic \nbase closures is completed. I believe these requirements are logical \nand necessary in light of the threats facing the United States.\n  The ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are our most urgent \nnational security concern, but the United States must be prepared to \naddress other potential enemies. According to a recent Defense \nDepartment report, China has expanded its military reach enabling them \nto threaten Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. military in the Pacific. \nFurthermore, China continues to both improve and expand its nuclear \narsenal and has the capacity to field advanced missiles able to strike \nthe United States.\n  China is not our only national security concern, as both Iran and \nNorth Korea have refused to relinquish their nuclear weapons programs. \nU.S. intelligence experts agree North Korea has developed multiple \nnuclear weapons, while Iran, an active state sponsor of terrorism, \ncontinues to pursue chemical and biological weapons.\n  Before completing this round of base closures, I believe it is \nprudent and sound policy to analyze all pertinent information that may \nimpact our national security. For instance, the Department of Defense \nis undertaking a monumental shift in overseas deployments, which is \nlong overdue. However, the Commission on Review of Overseas Military \nFacility Structure of the United States, commonly referred to as the \nOverseas Basing Commission, has indicated the Pentagon's plan to rotate \nsoldiers back to the United States from overseas installations may be \nflawed. The Overseas Basing Commission argues if a crisis arises \nabroad, the military does not have enough sea and air transportation to \nrotate forces rapidly enough to respond. Furthermore, the Commission \nbelieves the Pentagon has understated the costs to redeploy troops to \nAmerican soil. Finally, and most troubling, the Commission argues the \nplan could result in extended and more frequent rotations, which could \nstrain U.S. military personnel and their families to the point where \nthe United States is incapable of maintaining an all-volunteer force.\n  In addition, currently tens of thousands of brave men and women are \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and like all Americans, it is my \nsincere hope that these soldiers return home as soon as possible. \nHaving said that, I recognize immediately withdrawing American troops \nfrom Iraq could result in chaos and undermine the tremendous efforts \nmade by all our service members. However, I question the timing of this \nround of base closures given that our Nation is at war and so many of \nour soldiers are supporting this effort. Until these troops have \nfinished their important mission, and have returned home safely, it \ndoes not make sense to close military installations at home.\n  Finally, we should not move forward with this round of base closures \nuntil the Defense Department completes the Quadrennial Defense Review \nand presents its findings to the President and Congress. The QDR is \nintegral to U.S. military strategy as it assesses our future military \ncapabilities and identifies emerging threats. It makes little sense to \nrestructure our defenses until Congress has access to this vital piece \nof information.\n  I believe that these questions must be answered before we proceed \nwith closing domestic military installations. We must reorganize our \nmilitary force in order to respond to the threats of the 21st century. \nThe challenge is to do so in a manner that is not detrimental to our \nnational security and the men and women who proudly serve our country.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an \namendment to the fiscal year 06 National Defense Authorization Act, S. \n1042, that authorizes the Navy to convey approximately 230 acres of \nopen space land along the eastern boundary of Marine Corps Air Station \nMiramar to the county of San Diego in order to provide access to the \nhistoric Stowe Trail.\n  The Stowe Trail at one time functioned as the primary road leading to \nthe historic town of Stowe, and now links the Goodan Ranch and Sycamore \nCanyon Preserves in the north with the Mission Trails Regional Park and \nSantee Lakes Regional Recreation Area further south.\n  According to county records, up until the 1930s when access to this \nportion became restricted for military use, the Stowe Trail had served \nfor some 80 years as the principle thoroughfare between the towns of \nSantee and Poway.\n  The 230 acres of land that would be conveyed by the Navy under this \nprovision include diverse plant and animal life and environmentally-\nsensitive habitats and would provide a natural wildlife corridor \nbetween the two preserves, as well as with the Santee Lakes Recreation \nArea.\n  Under the control of the County of San Diego, this land will become \npart of an extensive open space trail system that will not only \nincrease recreational opportunities in the region, but will also \nprovide a buffer zone that will mitigate against potential encroachment \nthat could impact the essential military missions at Marine Corps Air \nStation Miramar.\n  It is important to point out that this proposed land conveyance is \nthe fruition of a process set in motion jointly by the San Diego County \nBoard of Supervisors and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in 2002.\n  Both sides have worked together closely since that time to ensure \nthat the result will be a win-win situation for both county and the \nMarines.\n  For example, as part of the land conveyance process, the County of \nSan Diego has fully committed to compensate the Navy by paying the full \nfair market value for this property.\n  I would therefore ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \nSenate to consider this amendment, and that the amendment be agreed to.\n  I would also ask that this statement and the relevant amendment be \nplaced together in the Congressional Record.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1406\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1406 \nthat authorizes the Secretary of Defense, in the event of an overseas \nemergency, to transfer $200 million in defense articles, services, \ntraining and other support to the State Department to address the \ncrisis. The funding would be used by the Office of Stabilization and \nReconstruction at the State Department, a new office that has been \ncreated to organize the civilian side of the military/civilian response \nin post-conflict situations. The authority provided is permissive. It \ndoes not require such a transfer.\n  The Secretary of Defense requested the authority contained in this \namendment in his submission of legislation to be considered by the \nCongress. The Department of Defense needs a capable civilian partner \nthat is prepared to go into hostile environments to assist the military \nin stabilizing a post-conflict situation. It also needs to be able to \nhand off a stabilized situation to civilian leadership. Without such a \ncapacity, the military ends up performing tasks that civilians could \nand should be carrying out. As a consequence, the resources of the \nArmed Services are stretched thin and deployments of military personnel \nhave to be extended beyond expectations.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has for some time been deeply \ninvolved in building the capacity of the State Department to play a \nleadership role in this area. Through legislation, hearings, and \nmeetings of a policy advisory group of experts, we have called for the \norganization of a corps of civilians who are willing and able to \nundertake difficult missions in wartorn countries. The Office of \nStabilization and Reconstruction, led by a Coordinator, Ambassador \nCarlos Pascual, is now up and running and doing an excellent job.\n  My amendment reflects continued Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nattention to the issue. On June 16, we held a hearing on stabilization \nand reconstruction entitled ``Building Peace in a Hostile \nEnvironment.'' Ambassador Pascual participated as did two witnesses \nfrom the Defense Department, Ryan Henry, Principal Deputy in the Office \nof the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and LTG Walter Sharp, \nDirector of Strategic Plans and Policy at the Joint Staff. James\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\nKunder, Assistant Administrator for Asia and the Near East, testified \non behalf of USAID.\n  Both Defense Department witnesses urged the committee to support the \ntransfer authority contained in my amendment. Mr. Henry stated that it \nis in the Defense Department's interest to help the Stabilization and \nReconstruction office ``fill the gap in its ability to deploy in a \ncrisis.'' General Sharp said that General Myers, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, supports such a request because it would ``greatly \nimprove Ambassador Pascual's ability to rapidly deploy in a crisis.''\n  As most Members know, the foreign affairs budget is under \nconsiderable pressure. The Senate has just finished debating H.R. 3057, \nthe State-Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. The 302(b) \nallocations for this bill were some $1 billion below the President's \nrequest. On the House side, the corresponding amount is some $3 billion \nbelow the President's request. When conferenced, the appropriated \nfunding levels for foreign affairs will once again fall short of the \namount that the President of the United States says he needs to conduct \na strong foreign policy at a time of great complexity and danger.\n  Tight budgets yield painful compromises. During consideration of H.R. \n3057, Senators Corzine and DeWine offered an amendment to appropriate \n$50 million to support African Union peacekeeping efforts in Sudan. \nThey took the funding from the Conflict Response Fund that is to be \nused in emergencies by the new Office of Stabilization and \nReconstruction. The amendment was accepted.\n  That development has made the passage of this amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense bill even more crucial. The amendment does not \nmake the transfer of services and other support automatic. Rather, the \nSecretary of Defense is authorized to transfer the support only if he \ndetermines that an emergency exists that requires the immediate \nprovision of such assistance. He must also determine that such \nassistance is in the national security interests of the United States.\n  The Department of Defense has asked for the authority. It recognizes \nthat coordination between the State Department and USAID during \ninternational emergencies can actually save money and lives. It \nreflects a new kind of cooperation between the military and the \ncivilian component of our Government that a number of Members have \nspent much time and effort trying to promote. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1407\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 1407 that strikes \nsection 1008 from the bill under consideration.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Defense Department to \npay its fair share of the costs of building safer embassies. Section \n1008 allows Defense Department participation in the program only to the \nextent that unreimbursed services provided by State to DOD exceed \nunreimbursed services provided by DOD to State. It is a complicated \nformula that, in the end, will probably result in no contributions from \nthe Department of Defense. There is no other agency that has similar \nlegislation.\n  More than 61,000 American Government employees from 30 agencies work \nat our embassies and consulates. The Departments of Justice, Homeland \nSecurity, Commerce, Treasury, Health & Human Services, Agriculture, and \nevery other agency that has personnel overseas are contributing to the \ncost-sharing program. After an interagency negotiation, all executive \nbranch departments, including the Defense Department, agreed to \ncontribute to the cost-sharing program. But section 1008 would \nessentially vitiate that agreement on the part of the Department of \nDefense.\n  The Senate has a deep interest in the safety and well-being of our \ncitizens working overseas. Defense Department employees are second in \nnumber only to the State Department in many of our embassies. We all \nknow that U.S. facilities are a prime target for terrorists. The 1998 \nbombings of two American embassies in Africa made it clear that the \nthreat can erupt in unexpected places.\n  The United States has some 251 embassies and consulates overseas. \nMany of them do not meet security standards. They are not set far \nenough back from busily traveled streets, and they are not constructed \nto minimize damage if attacked. The capital construction program \nfocuses on replacing 150 embassies, prioritized according to a formula \nthat encompasses the threat they face. New embassy compounds are being \nbuilt on a construction schedule that can be cut almost in half if the \ncost-sharing program is fully implemented.\n  The cost-sharing program allocates construction expenses among \nagencies on the basis of future occupancy and the need for space \nspecially designed for security purposes. After the State Department, \nthe military ranks among the top contributors expected to participate \nin the program. Defense Department nonparticipation would stretch the \nembassy construction timetable by several years, prolonging the risks \nto embassy workers from all agencies.\n  President Bush has designed an interagency cost-sharing program with \na rapid construction timetable. He understands the risks and is working \nto address them. The cost-sharing program has been embraced by all \nCabinet officers, including Secretary Rumsfeld. We in the Congress \nshould not agree to a measure that will disrupt this timetable. We \nshould not slow a process that directly addresses the threat of \nterrorism toward embassies, which are the most visible and accessible \nU.S. targets overseas.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our military is first in the world, \nbecause of the quality and training of our personnel and because of the \ntechnological sophistication of our equipment and weaponry. A large \nportion of the best civilian scientific minds in the Defense Department \nare nearing retirement age--yet the legislation before us cuts funding \nfor the military's basic research in math and science.\n  Amendment No. 1401 that I am offering with the Senator from Maine and \nothers will ensure that the Department maintains its support for \nscientific research and development. It includes $10 million, to double \nthe funding for the Department's current ``SMART Scholars'' program, \nwhich is essentially an ROTC program for the agency's civilian \nscientists. It increases by $40 million the Department's funding of \nbasic research in science and technology, to ensure that its investment \nin this field is maintained and our military technology remains the \nbest in the world. The $50 million total cost of the amendment is \noffset by a $50 million reduction in Department-wide administrative \nfunding.\n  Our amendment provides sufficient funding for the full cost of \ncollege scholarships and graduate fellowships for approximately 100 \nscience, technology, engineering, and math students. It increases basic \nresearch on an equal basis in the Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, and \nNational Defense Education Program. It is supported by more than 60 of \nthe most prestigious institutions of higher education in America.\n  Defense Department-sponsored research has resulted in stunningly \nsophisticated spy satellites, precision-guided munitions, stealth \nequipment, and advanced radar. The research has also generated new \napplications in the civilian economy. The best known example is the \nInternet, originally a DARPA project.\n  Advances in military technology often have their source in the work \nof civilian scientists in Department of Defense laboratories. \nUnfortunately, a large percentage of these scientists are nearing \nretirement. Today, nearly one in three DOD civilian science, technical, \nengineering, and mathematical employees is eligible to retire. In 7 \nyears, 70 percent will be of retirement age.\n  Another distressing fact is that the number of new scientists being \nproduced by our major universities at the doctoral level each year has \ndeclined by 4 percent over the last decade. Many of those who do \ngraduate are ineligible to work on sensitive defense matters, since \nmore than a third of all science and engineering doctorate degrees \nawarded at American universities go to foreign students.\n  It is unlikely that retiring DOD scientists will be replaced by \ncurrent private industry employees. According to\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nthe National Defense Industrial Association, over 5,000 science and \nengineering positions are unfilled in private industry in defense-\nrelated fields.\n  The Nation confronts a major math and science challenge in elementary \nand secondary education and in higher education as well. We are tied \nwith Latvia for 28th in the industrialized world today in math \nperformance, and that is far from good enough. We have fallen from 3rd \nin the world to 15th in producing scientists and engineers. Clearly, we \nneed a new National Defense Education Act of the size and scope passed \nnearly 50 years ago.\n  At the very least, however, the legislation before us needs to do \nmore to maintain our military's technological advantage. The pending \nbill irresponsibly cuts science and technology research by 17 percent. \nIt increases funding for the SMART civilian ROTC science program but to \nonly one-third of the Defense Department's request. Last year, over 100 \n``highly rated'' SMART Scholar applications were turned down because of \ninsufficient funding. Our amendment has sufficient funds to support \nevery one of those talented young people who want to learn and serve.\n  It also increases the investment in basic research in science and \ntechnology. Investments by DOD in science and technology through the \n1980s helped the United States win the Cold War. But funding for basic \nresearch in the physical sciences, math and engineering has not kept \npace with research in other areas. Federal funding for life sciences \nhas risen four-fold since the 1980s. Over the same period, \nappropriations for the physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics \nhave remained essentially flat. Funding for basic research fell from \nfiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 2004 by more than 10 percent in real \nterms.\n  The Defense Science Board has recommended that funding for Science \nand Technology reach 3 percent of total defense spending, and the \nadministration and Congress have adopted this goal in the past. The \nBoard also recommended that 20 percent of that amount be dedicated to \nbasic research, but the pending bill would cut funding for such \nresearch by 17 percent. We must do better, and this amendment does \nthat.\n  The amendment's offset reduces the defensewide administrative fund \nunder the Secretary of Defense. It does not affect operations and \nmaintenance funding for the Army, Navy, or Air Force. For example, it \nwould reduce by 2\\1/2\\ percent the $2 billion that the bill gives the \nSecretary for his ``business and financial management'' transformation \nproposal--an area that the Government Accountability Office has deemed \nat ``high-risk'' for waste.\n  We can't afford not to pass this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8940-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. An important new study issued last week finds that \nexempting association health plans from State oversight will lead to \nincreased health insurance fraud against small businesses and their \nworkers.\n  The author of the study, Assistant Professor Mila Kofman at \nGeorgetown University, is one of the Nation's leading experts on \nprivate health insurance fraud, and the report provides evidence of the \npotential harm that the pending association health plan legislation \nwill have on patients and working families.\n  It finds that exempting association health plans from State oversight \nwill ``create a regulatory vacuum'' and have the ``unintended \nconsequence of widespread fraud threatening the coverage and financial \nsecurity of millions of Americans.''\n  The report notes the 30-year history of health insurance scams \ninvolving associations and multiemployer arrangements after the \nCongress exempted such arrangements from State oversight in 1974. \nWidespread fraud resulted from the exemption, and Congress acted to \nrestore State authority and oversight in 1982. In the years when the \nFederal Government was responsible for oversight of the plans, \nwidespread fraud took place and large numbers of businesses and workers \nvictimized.\n  Insurance fraud involving such plans continues, but without State \noversight and enforcement, the numbers would have been much worse. \nStates have shut down many illegal arrangements, and saved millions of \ndollars for consumers in recent years. We can't afford to take away \nState authority now, and give plans broad exemptions from oversight.\n  According to a study by the Government Accountability Office, the \nmost common way for insurance scams to proliferate is by selling \ncoverage through associations--many of which are the same bona-fide \nprofessional and business associations that would be shielded from \noversight under this legislation.\n  The pending bill would create large loopholes and shield plans from \noversight. It relies largely on self-reporting and self-regulation, and \nmakes it far more difficult for regulators to shut down fraudulent \nplans.\n  The bill's convoluted regulatory structure would also create \nwidespread confusion about who actually regulates association plans--\nthe Federal Government or States, and this confusion will invite scams \nto proliferate.\n  We need to make affordable health insurance for working families a \ntop priority, but this study shows the serious consequences of \nexempting association health plans from State and oversight and \nenforcement. The result is predictable: mounting medical bills, greater \nbankruptcy, medical care denied or delayed, and coverage lost. It is \nwrong for Congress to turn back the clock to the days of widespread \nfraud against small businesses and their employees by exempting \nassociation plans from appropriate oversight and enforcement, and I \nurge my colleagues not to take this damaging step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8940-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8940-S8941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEDICAL DEVICE USER FEE STABILIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Medical Device \nUser Fee Stabilization Act of 2005.\n  The bill makes needed corrections in the Device User Fee Act we \npassed in 2002. Most important, it extends this worthwhile program \nbeyond September 30. It ensures stable growth for individual user fees \nby limiting increases to 8.5 percent a year in 2006 and 2007, and it \nraises the threshold for businesses to be eligible for the reduced \nsmall business fees from $30 million to $100 million.\n  The user fee program has provided much needed support for the Food \nand Drug Administration over the past 3 years to expedite its review of \nmedical devices. The FDA has improved its ability to review devices \nmore quickly, and laid the groundwork for further progress as well. \nUnfortunately, however, fees on individual applications have climbed \nrapidly in the past 3 years--much faster than anticipated.\n  Our bill maintains this valuable program and limits the rate of \ngrowth in fees. It strikes a fair balance between the competing \ninterests of FDA and the various industries. The agency is not \nguaranteed the growth in fees that it received under the original \nlegislation to meet the need to expedite its reviews. It makes sense to \nlimit fee increases in response to the concern that the fees have \nclimbed too quickly and are discouraging innovation in these valuable \ndevices. That is why we call the bill the User Fee Stabilization Act.\n  The bill also clarifies the provision in current law on the \nidentification of the makers of single-use medical devices. Adverse \nevent reports should not be inaccurately attributed to the wrong \ncompany, and doctors should not be misled about the source of the \ndevice.\n  Since many so-called single-use devices are often reprocessed and \nused again, the legislation requires reprocessors of single-use devices \nto identify their role in preparing the device. When the manufacturer \nof the original device is identified on the device, the reprocessor \nmust do so as well. When the manufacturer of the original device has \nnot done so, the bill permits the use of detachable labels on the \npackage of the reprocessed device, so that the label can be placed in \nthe patient's medical chart.\n  These provisions will become effective 12 months after the date of \nenactment, and they are a reasonable compromise of the interests of the \nFDA, the original manufacturers, and the reprocessors.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi for his leadership in producing this much-\nneeded legislation, and I welcome the strong, bipartisan support for \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\nin our Health Committee. I urge all my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation, so that this valuable medical device program can \ncontinue effectively beyond September 30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8941-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHANGING LIVES: THE IMPACT OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words on the \nimpact of Special Olympics. As many of you know, individuals with \nintellectual disability face an array of challenges in their efforts to \nsecure opportunities to lead quality lives. These challenges affect \nevery aspect of their lives, including their ability to participate in \na meaningful way in their communities and society at large.\n  The Special Olympics were created to address the use of sports as a \nvehicle for demonstrating the dignity and capability individuals with \nintellectual disability can achieve. Over the 37 years of Special \nOlympics history, there is extensive documentation of competition \nwaged, medals won, and barriers overcome around the world. Athletes, \nfamilies, coaches, volunteers, and spectators have witnessed many small \nand large miracles through Special Olympics.\n  One such miracle is Rose Marie Garrett of Baton Rouge, a three-time \nparticipant in Special Olympics World games who in 2001 was named \nLouisiana's Special Olympian of the Year. At age 49, Rose Marie was \ndiagnosed with Dandy-Walker syndrome, a congenital brain malformation \nthat impairs motor development due to a blockage of spinal fluid to the \nbrain. Despite her lifetime of struggle with the physical problems \ncaused by Dandy-Walker syndrome, Rose Marie was able to rise above this \nbarrier and take charge of her life. Not only did she successfully \nparticipate in the Special Olympics, but did so while holding a job at \nthe YMCA. However, Rose Marie did not stop her lifetime of hard work \nwith her achievements in the Special Olympics. She has become a strong \nadvocate for this valuable program, and teaches bowling to children, \ndisabled and non-disabled alike. Her message to those working to \novercome difficult hurdles is ``Work hard and go for your goal. If at \nfirst you don't succeed, try, try again. Never give up. I didn't.\n  Rose Marie is just one of the many success stories in the Special \nOlympics. In 2004, they commissioned a study of the impact of Special \nOlympics programs on the lives of its athletes in the United States. \nThis study included survey research of current and former athletes, \ncoaches, and family members from a representative sample of U.S. \nathletes and coaches. It is the most comprehensive assessment to date \nof the impact of the Special Olympics experience on the lives of people \nwith intellectual disabilities. In the Special Olympics Impact Study \nand the Special Olympics Athlete Participation Survey, we see that \nSpecial Olympics has enabled athletes to not only train for sporting \nevents, but also train for life. Through their voices, U.S. Special \nOlympics athletes have provided Special Olympics with a very positive \nreport card on the impact that Special Olympics has on their lives.\n  It is my hope that every person faced with intellectual disabilities \nwill have the opportunity some time in their life to participate in the \nSpecial Olympics. As exemplified by Rose Marie's experience, overcoming \nathletic challenges can lead to a successful life. Special Olympics is \na program that supports an inclusive and productive society and I look \nforward to watching what all these individuals will accomplish in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8941-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8941-S8942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF J.J. HAMILTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npublicly congratulate J.J. Hamilton on his retirement as Director of \nAviation at the Burlington International Airport.\n  J.J. and I have been friends since our days together at St. Michael's \nCollege, and it has been a great pleasure working with him over the \nyears on aviation, expansion, and economic development issues at the \nairport in Burlington.\n  J.J. has been with the airport for 21 years, serving for the past 15 \nas its top manager. Under his direction, the Burlington airport has \nbeen transformed from a sleepy, one-gate operation into an award-\nwinning, 10-gate facility that is a wonderful gateway to our great \nState of Vermont. The airport has grown to become an important engine \nin our State's economy.\n  Perhaps the best words to describe J.J.'s leadership in Burlington \nare ``measured and responsible.'' As head of Vermont's largest airport, \nand one that is municipally owned, he has had to delicately balance the \nurge for large-scale expansion with his financial responsibility to the \ncitizens of Burlington. When opportunities have arisen to attract new \nair service, J.J. has been careful to make sure that it is sustainable \nand that the airport grows appropriately to meet the new demand. And \nwhen the airport has sought to expand its business offerings, he has \nworked cooperatively with the neighbors, the National Guard, and the \nbusinesses that are based at the airport or that rely on the airport to \noutline the significance of the development.\n  I am proud to have worked with J.J. and others to bring the \ninnovative, low-cost air service to Burlington that has fueled record \npassenger growth at the airport. From JetBlue and Independence Air to \nthe parking expansions to the new gates, J.J. has diligently moved \nforward not just to compete with the Albanys and Manchesters of the \nworld for passengers, but to make Burlington a destination unto itself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a May 11, 2005, Burlington Free Press \neditorial on J.J.'s accomplishments in Burlington be included at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection,the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The Burlington Free Press, May 11, 2005]\n\n                          Building An Airport\n\n       J.J. Hamilton has a solid 21-year record at the Burlington \n     International Airport, 16 of them as director, transforming a \n     one-gate operation into today's 10-gate facility that \n     generates $12 million in revenues.\n       The growth at the airport has occurred gradually over the \n     years, at a pace that has met Vermont's needs and changing \n     lifestyles. Along the way, Hamilton has been there to make a \n     public pitch for significant improvements such as expanding \n     the parking garage.\n       Hamilton has presided over one of the most welcoming and \n     attractive small airports U.S. travelers will ever find. \n     Where else do you find comfortable rocking chairs set up in \n     front of picture windows that look out onto runways and \n     spectacular mountain views? Long lines are rare, and visitors \n     are treated to a taste of Vermont with displays of local art, \n     scenic murals and a well-stocked souvenir shop.\n       In 1997, the airport's garage was built and main terminal \n     expanded for $19.9 million; a $25 million expansion was \n     launched five years later. The improvements have encouraged \n     additional airlines to use the facility, securing Burlington \n     International's 2002 distinction as the second-fastest-\n     growing airport in the nation.\n       Decisions by airlines such as People Express in the 1980s \n     and JetBlue and Independence Air in recent years have added \n     to Burlington International Airport's luster.\n       For many years, Vermonters drove to Manchester, N.H., \n     Albany, N.Y., or Boston for cheaper flights out of New \n     England. Today, with several low-cost carriers operating out \n     of Burlington, the expanded 1,651-space garage is often \n     crowded with travelers choosing their home airport.\n       This is especially important for a relatively small state \n     like Vermont, where a healthy business climate requires easy, \n     affordable air service--not to mention the revenues linked \n     directly and indirectly to air travel.\n       Hamilton's decision to step down as director leaves a void \n     at the airport that might be tough to fill for several \n     reasons.\n       First, his careful stewardship has established a high bar. \n     The airport set a record for the most significant growth \n     period in the airport's history during Hamilton's tenure, \n     with nearly 635,000 people boarding flights last year.\n       Second, Hamilton's annual salary of $85,885 isn't highly \n     competitive with many similar positions elsewhere in the \n     United States, making it that much harder to recruit the best \n     and brightest to fill his shoes. The director of the Albany \n     International Airport in New York, for example, earns \n     $106,000 annually.\n       That is not an unusual problem in Vermont, where salaries \n     tend to lag behind those of more urban areas. More often than \n     not, people accept the lower salary in exchange for a higher \n     quality of life. In some cases, out-of-state applicants \n     argue--successfully--for more money.\n       The city ought to be somewhat flexible with the incoming \n     director's salary, but cautiously so. A high wage doesn't \n     guarantee competence.\n       Hamilton, 64, has agreed to stay on until his job is \n     filled, and possibly longer. But Vermonters wish him well as \n     he moves on.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Again, Mr. President, I want to thank J.J. for his many \nyears\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\nof dedicated service to the City of Burlington and its airport. \nMarcelle and I wish him and Janet all the best in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8942-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, on May 3, 2005, Secretary of Education \nMargaret Spellings announced the selection of 141 outstanding American \nhigh school seniors as the 2005 Presidential Scholars. The Presidential \nScholars Program serves to honor outstanding students for their \naccomplishments in academics or the arts, as well as for their \nleadership, character and civic contributions to their schools and \ncommunities.\n  The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in \n1964 by Executive order of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The \nPresidential Scholars Program annually selects one male and one female \nstudent from each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto \nRico, American students living abroad, 15 at-large students, and up to \n20 students in the arts. The students are selected on the basis of \noutstanding scholarship, service, leadership, and creativity through a \nrigorous selection and review process administered by the Department of \nEducation. Over 5,000 of the Nation's top students have been honored as \nPresidential Scholars since this prestigious program's founding.\n  Of the 141 exceptional students recognized from across the United \nStates for 2005, I would especially like to recognize three students \nfrom the great State of Illinois for their accomplishments.\n  I send my congratulations to the following students for their \naccomplishments in academics: Kelly A. Zalocusky from Belleville High \nSchool East in Belleville, IL, and her teacher Philip C. Short; and \nEdgar P. Woznica from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, IL, and his \nteacher Ramzi Farran. For her accomplishments in the arts, I would like \nto congratulate Marcella J. Capron from Loyola Academy in Wilmette, IL, \nand her teacher Leslie Yatabe.\n  Please join me in congratulating the 2005 Presidential Scholars for \ntheir accomplishments in academics and the arts. I wish them all the \nbest in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8942-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8942-S8943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD VETERINARY ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords's speech \nbefore the World Veterinary Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Members of the House of Delegates, the World Veterinary \n     Association, other international guests, friends and \n     colleagues . . . I'm honored to be a part of this historic \n     gathering. I'm especially pleased to welcome my fellow \n     veterinarians from around the world and to be addressing \n     those participating in the first gathering of the World \n     Veterinary Association in the United States since 1934.\n       Seventy-one years ago, the AVMA and the World Veterinary \n     Association met to discuss the hot issues of the day . . . \n     poultry diseases, advances in food animal medicine, food \n     safety and global disease surveillance. Today we are meeting \n     once again and discussing the issues of our day . . . poultry \n     diseases, advances in food animal medicine, food safety and \n     global disease surveillance.\n       Thre thousand nine hundred seventeen veterinarians attended \n     that 1934 meeting in New York City at the Waldorf Astoria \n     hotel; many from the same countries that are joining us \n     today. To each I extend our most sincere welcome . . . \n     especially to our colleagues from Afghanistan and Iraq . . . \n     I hope that you find this experience to be one of the most \n     memorable of your career.\n       Well, here we are, 71 years later. And while we may have \n     different languages and customs, different ways communicating \n     with our clients and treating our patients, we have come \n     together once again precisely because we have more in common \n     than ever before. We are united in our quest for a better \n     world and better medicine for both animals and humans. We are \n     united in our concerns, we are unified in our challenges and \n     we are unified in the celebration of our achievements. We are \n     what veterinary medicine is all about.\n       When I told my wife, Pat, that I was giving this speech, \n     she reminded me of something Muriel Humphrey once told her \n     husband, Hubert, this country's vice president and a favorite \n     son from this great state. She said, ``Hubert, a speech \n     doesn't have to be eternal to be immortal.'' I'll try to \n     remember that.\n       I come before you today slightly imperfect. As many of you \n     know, I just had a knee replacement.\n       My recent surgery got me thinking . . . do any of us truly \n     appreciate our knees? Really appreciate the foundation they \n     provide? I know I didn't . . . not until both gave out on me. \n     I quickly came to realize, however, that my knees must work \n     together in unity in order for me to complete the tasks I \n     take for granted. I just assumed they'd provide a solid \n     foundation without much attention from me. I was sadly \n     mistaken.\n       Paying attention to our profession's basic principles is \n     what I'd like to talk to you about today. We all assume that \n     our professional unity and our rock solid foundation are \n     perpetual. They're not. Without attention and care, our \n     foundation can slowly begin to erode. That's why I am \n     dedicating my presidency to the care and nurturing of our \n     professional unity . . . the essential cornerstone of our \n     great profession.\n       Traditionally, past AVMA presidents have used this time to \n     present you with a roster of very specific recommendations \n     for new programs and initiatives.Many of those \n     recommendations have resulted in impressive and important \n     changes within the AVMA.\n       But different times call for different approaches. I come \n     before you today with a total commitment to spending my year \n     at the helm of this great organization working to reaffirm \n     our unity.\n       As president elect, I've spent much of the past year \n     speaking to a wide variety of veterinary associations and \n     student organizations. In May, when I gave the commencement \n     address at Auburn, I was reminded of my own graduation. I was \n     reminded of my classmates and my professors. Of the long \n     hours and challenges that we faced and survived. I think back \n     to the unity we felt as a class and our coordinated effort to \n     help each other. Doing whatever it took to ensure that each \n     individual met the challenges of the curriculum and \n     graduated.\n       Unity got us through school . . . and a C+ mean average \n     didn't hurt.\n       And on our graduation day, we became veterinarians. Not \n     equine veterinarians. Not bovine veterinarians. Not small \n     animal veterinarians. We became veterinarians . . . members \n     of a select group of professionals that dedicate their lives \n     to ensuring the highest standards in animal and public \n     health.\n       Why is unity more important today than ever before? Aesop \n     said it better than I ever could . . . ``we often give our \n     enemies the means for our own destruction.''\n       Today our profession is facing challenges, the likes of \n     which we've never seen before. From town hall to Capitol Hill \n     . . .  from the classroom to the laboratory . . .  from the \n     farm to the dinner table . . .  our attention is being pulled \n     in a myriad of directions. In light of those challenges, we \n     must remain focused . . .  we must stay united. While we may \n     practice in different disciplines involving different species \n     of animals, we must be one vision, one voice. We must \n     maintain the highest standards in medicine and public health, \n     encouraging and assisting others in accomplishing the same. \n     While we may practice in different parts of the world, we \n     must foster unity with our fellow veterinarians from around \n     the globe. Good medicine knows no boundaries . . .  knows no \n     borders. We must cooperate and collaborate with our fellow \n     veterinarians worldwide . . .  to make this world a better \n     place for animals and humans, alike.\n       Has there always been perfect unity within the profession? \n     If you look back in the annals of our convention or in the \n     Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, you \n     will see many instances where we did not all agree. We are a \n     diverse profession and there are bound to be differences in \n     opinion. But I would argue that the French essayist, Joubert, \n     was right when he said, ``the aim of argument, or of \n     discussion, should not be victory, but progress.''\n       Some of the differences our profession is experiencing \n     today may just be a reflection of what is happening to \n     society as a whole.\n       For example, we've moved away from an agricultural society. \n     In the past 20 years, many of our colleagues have chosen a \n     metropolitan setting, where they concentrate on companion \n     animals. As a result, the number of food animal graduates has \n     slowed to a trickle. The reality, however, is that food \n     animal practitioners are more important to society than ever \n     before. There is an acute shortage of food animal \n     veterinarians during a time when the world is threatened by \n     zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. At the same time, we \n     are experiencing the same crisis level shortages of public \n     health veterinarians. Most new graduates are not choosing a \n     career in this essential segment of veterinary medicine. The \n     profession must find ways to encourage undergraduates to \n     enter food animal and public health practice.\n       In an attempt to resolve the critical food animal \n     veterinary shortage, AVMA has been working on a number of \n     strategies and initiatives.\n       For example, as many of you know, the AVMA helped fund a \n     study to estimate the future demand and availability of food \n     supply veterinarians and to investigate the means for \n     maintaining the required numbers.\n       AVMA also approved and financially supported the \n     development of benchmarking tools for production animal \n     practitioners by the National Commission on Veterinary \n     Economic Issues. These benchmarking tools are designed to \n     provide our current practitioners with help in ensuring that \n     their practices are financially successful. That, in turn, \n     will assist in attracting future veterinarians to food animal \n     practice.\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\n       The government relations division of the AVMA is diligently \n     working to convince Congress to provide federal funding for \n     the National Veterinary Medical Service Act. If fully funded, \n     that act could go a long way toward encouraging recent \n     graduates to practice food animal medicine in under-served \n     areas and provide veterinary services to the federal \n     government in emergency situations. Just last month, the \n     Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee approved \n     $750,000 for a pilot program. We applaud the efforts of \n     Representatives Pickering and Turner . . . and Senators \n     Cochran and Harkin . . . all of whom sponsored the original \n     bill. And I want to thank the Appropriations Subcommittee, \n     especially Senator Brownback for his kind words and \n     commitment to veterinary medicine.\n       AVMA is also lobbying our federal legislators to pass the \n     Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act . . . an important piece \n     of legislation that will provide us with sorely needed public \n     health and public practice veterinarians. Today's public \n     health practitioners play an invaluable role in U.S. \n     agriculture, food safety, zoonotic disease control, animal \n     welfare, homeland security and international standards and \n     trade. Without an adequate number of public health \n     veterinarians, the wellbeing of our nation--yes, even the \n     world--is at risk. Senator Allard has been invaluable and \n     unwavering in his dedication to moving this act forward \n     through the complicated legislative process. I intend to \n     do everything I can as president to provide support to \n     Senator Allard's effort to pass the veterinary workforce \n     expansion act.\n       On the international education level, AVMA has been \n     committed to the global unity of the profession for decades. \n     The AVMA Council on Education has partnered with Canada since \n     the accreditation system was developed and has accredited six \n     foreign veterinary colleges. We are working with six \n     additional schools. We're extremely proud of those colleges. \n     As more inquiries come forward, it's self evident that the \n     world looks to us as the gold standard in educational goals \n     and expectations.\n       At the same time, I will be supporting the efforts of our \n     specialty organizations to attract and train the new \n     practitioners they need. Currently, there are 20 veterinary \n     specialty organizations comprising 37 distinct areas of \n     expertise under the AVMA umbrella.\n       The AVMA economic report on veterinarians and veterinary \n     practices has revealed a substantial difference between the \n     incomes of specialists and non-specialists practicing in \n     similar disciplines. I will, as president, encourage the \n     development of additional in-depth financial surveys that, \n     hopefully, will motivate our undergraduates to further their \n     education and achieve specialty status . . . thus helping \n     ensure that public demand for advanced veterinary medical \n     services are being met while, at the same time, increasing \n     our economic base.\n       Hopefully, these additional specialists will serve as a \n     resource for our veterinary colleges who are becoming \n     increasingly understaffed.\n       In the past fifteen years, we've seen a shift in the \n     demographics of our profession. I'll bet there were plenty of \n     raised eyebrows when McKillips College, in 1903, and the \n     Chicago Veterinary College, in 1910, graduated our country's \n     first female veterinarians. It's hard to believe that as \n     recently as 1963 the profession included only 277 female \n     veterinarians.\n       We're proud of the fact than an increasing number of our \n     graduates are women. Their contributions and leadership have \n     strengthened our profession. However, the recent AVMA-Pfizer \n     study confirmed lower mean female incomes within the \n     profession. Now is the time to explore solutions to that \n     problem, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that \n     this issue is thoroughly investigated and addressed.\n       To achieve unity, I firmly believe that we must be \n     inclusive, not exclusive. The public has always been well \n     served by the diversity in our practice areas. Now, we must \n     diversify our membership. The AVMA . . . with more than \n     72,000 members representing 68 constituent organizations in \n     the House of Delegates . . . must now seek to represent every \n     race, creed and color. As a profession, we must mirror the \n     public, and they us. We must become a profession more \n     reflective of the population we serve.\n       Over thirty years ago, Dr. H.J. Magrane, then president of \n     the AVMA, spoke often and passionately about the need for \n     inclusion and equality in our profession. As a profession, we \n     have still not made the advances in diversity that are \n     necessary.\n       As the great social scientist Margaret Mead said . . . . \n     ``in diversity . . . we will add to our strength.''\n       In order to achieve our diversity goals, we must initiate \n     both practical and creative ideas to arrive at an enriched \n     membership. It's up to us . . . all of us . . . to reach out \n     to young people and to nurture their interests and talents so \n     that we become the shining example of professional diversity. \n     We need to be involved in youth groups, in churches, and in \n     our public schools . . . and united in our quest, so that \n     others say, ``we must emulate the AVMA.''\n       Once in veterinary school, our students . . . all our \n     students . . . need to know that we, as a profession, are \n     there to mentor and to help them through the special \n     challenges they face. None of us got to where we are today \n     without at least one special person . . . one special \n     veterinarian . . . who took us under his or her wing and \n     proved to be our own, personal cornerstone. We can do no less \n     for those who are striving today to become members of our \n     profession.\n       In what programs is the AVMA currently involved concerning \n     diversity? First, at its April 2005 meeting, the Board \n     approved the establishment of a Task Force on Diversity. That \n     task force will recommend steps that we must take to meet our \n     goals in diversity.\n       But here's something you can do in the immediate future. \n     Tomorrow, our convention will offer a full day diversity \n     symposium, including an appearance by Doctor Debbye Turner, \n     veterinarian, former Miss America and contributor to the CBS \n     early show. I hope many of you will plan on spending part of \n     your day attending these important meetings, if time permits.\n       Diversity will also be an integral part of the 2006 \n     Veterinary Leadership Conference. Each of these opportunities \n     is designed to help us achieve the diversity we've talked \n     about for so long.\n       So what's on our want list for 2005? As I've mentioned, \n     critical shortages exist in food animal and public health \n     veterinarians. But we also are desperately in need of \n     teachers and researchers. We need policy experts and homeland \n     security professionals. We need legislative leaders, and we \n     need veterinarians who are visionaries and who can lead us in \n     this era of globalization. There exists such critical \n     shortages in so many areas that some days I wonder if our \n     small numbers can, in fact, make a difference.\n       But then I am asked to speak somewhere. And I look at the \n     enthusiastic faces in my audience . . . established \n     veterinarians who are deeply involved in their state and \n     local associations, students who live and breathe only to \n     count off the days until they can touch their dream, high \n     school students with straight A's who are anxious to know \n     what else they have to do to make it into veterinary school, \n     third graders with a commitment to animals that rivals the \n     grit and determination of a Jack Russell terrier . . . and I \n     know that we will not only survive . . . but thrive.\n       As I've said, my presidency will be dedicated to re-\n     energizing the unity that has always been our strength and \n     foundation. As another president from the northeast, John F. \n     Kennedy, once said, ``Let us not be blind to our \n     differences--but let us also direct attention to our common \n     interests.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, our common interests are so much \n     greater than our differences. Like the society and world \n     around us, we are changing. And change is never easy. But \n     with your help, and our combined dedication and attention to \n     preserving and protecting our unity of purpose, we will \n     thrive and remain one of the most admired and respected \n     professions in the world.\n       During the coming year, I will be looking to you for help. \n     I will listen . . . and I will participate. I will follow \n     your lead . . . and I will lead to enlighten. I implore each \n     of you to participate in this great organization and make it \n     your own. For you are the teachers . . . you are the \n     visionaries . . . you are veterinary medicine.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8943-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL HERITAGE FELLOWSHIP\n\n  Mr. OBAMA.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ncommunity in\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July \n14-17, the residents of Buffalo gathered to celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Buffalo is a vibrant and active community in eastern North Dakota \nwith a population of more than 200 people. Despite its small size, \nBuffalo holds an important place in North Dakota's history. Buffalo, \nlike most small towns in North Dakota, got its start when the railroad \nstretched throughout the State. In 1883, the postmaster, Charles A. \nWilder, named the community Buffalo in honor of the secretary of the \nNorthern Pacific Railway, who was born in Buffalo, NY.\n  Buffalo has a very active historical society that has worked to \nrestore two unique properties, the Old Stone Church and the 1916 High \nSchool, both of which are listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces. The restoration of the Old Stone Church, in particular, has \nreceived national attention. In 1999, it was awarded a National Trust \nfor Historic Preservation Honor Award. Buffalo is the only community in \nNorth Dakota to ever receive the award, and it is the smallest \ncommunity in the Nation to ever receive the award. The restoration of \nthis prairie church united the community and preserved an important \npiece of our State's history. The residents of Buffalo can be extremely \nproud of their efforts to preserve these historic places.\n  For those who call Buffalo home, it is a comfortable place to live, \nwork, and play. Today, Buffalo is home to a cafe, gas station and \nrepair shop, bank, day care, heritage museum and much more. The \ncommunity had a wonderful celebration that included an all school \nreunion, parade, car show, street dance, fireworks, and games.\n  I ask the Senate to join in me congratulating Buffalo, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Buffalo and all the other historic small \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit \nalive for future generations. It is places such as Buffalo that have \nhelped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this \nfine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Buffalo has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8944-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE TOWNS OF MOORESTOWN AND CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMoorestown and Chatham, NJ, on being named two of the best places in \nthe country to live. It is only fitting that an acclaimed national \nmagazine recognized what I have always known--New Jersey is a great \nState in which to live.\n  Moorestown and Chatham received these top honors based upon the \nfollowing criteria: business climate, economic well being, quality of \nlife, and a positive environment in which to work and raise a family. \nNew Jersey's tourism industry, scenic beauty, low crime rate, high-\nquality education, community spirit, parks and recreation, make my \nState attractive for many families and businesses.\n  Moorestown, a 15-square-mile, tree-lined, suburban town, was named \nthe No. 1 place to live in America. This lovely little hamlet, located \nin Burlington County, prides itself on its historic buildings, charming \ncustoms, and social conscience. One of its nicest traditions is its \n``Random Act of Kindness Week,'' a time when its citizens are \nencouraged to practice the virtue of good deeds, not only for the \nneediest, but for their next-door neighbors as well. Only moments away \nfrom Philadelphia, it has a booming economy with numerous manufacturing \nfacilities, high-tech firms, and defense contractors. Moorestown is \nalso home to many cultural arts venues and recreational facilities. As \nmany of the families that have lived there for generations will tell \nyou, this town is truly the perfect place to raise a family and call \nhome.\n  One of our other great towns, Chatham, NJ, was ranked the ninth most \ndesirable place to live in the country. This small wonder of Morris \nCounty, sits on the banks of the Passaic River, and is home to many of \nthe historic manufacturing plants of the late 1800s and early 1900s. \nToday, Chatham relies on many major technology and communications firms \nto help boost this small metropolis to the forefront of the Nation. \nChatham is a great place to raise a family as well, with its many fine \nschools and close proximity to New York City. It is also home to a \nnational wildlife refuge, which residents fought to protect from \ndevelopers.\n  It is no surprise that my home State of New Jersey is the only place \nwith two towns in the top 10 list. Moorestown and Chatham both deserve \nthese high honors. I applaud the local officials, enterprising business \nmen and women, and the committed citizens of these great towns. I am \nproud to represent them in the U.S. Senate, and wish them all the best \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8944-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8944-S8945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          A TRIBUTE TO THE AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nrise today and to honor the work of the Women's Missionary Society of \nthe African Methodist Episcopal Church, whose annual conference will be \nheld in my home State of Kansas. As you may know, the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church has a magnificent and marvelous history in this \ncountry. The A.M.E. Church was the first African American Church \nfounded in this Nation. Borne out of the struggle to worship our \nalmighty and benevolent Father without persecution, the A.M.E. Church \nwas founded in order that African Americans could worship freely. And \nunlike the churches of their time, the co-founder, Bishop Richard \nAllen, insured that any person regardless of race, creed, or color \ncould worship in church.\n  It is with that spirit and the spirit of benevolence toward one \nanother that the Women's Missionary Society was formed. Through the \nvision of Mrs. Sarah Allen, the wife of Bishop Richard Allen, there was \nformed the Women's Missionary Society of the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church in an effort to mobilize and encourage women in the \narea of missions. Today the missionary society is still committed to \nspreading the principles of Christian love and boasts a membership of \nover 800,000 worldwide. It is their charge and duty to serve God in all \nthey do and to assist in the progression of serving all people \nworldwide.\n  Indeed, the Women's Missionary Society has a wonderful 130 year \nhistory within the A.M.E. Church. In early 1900s the Kansas/Nebraska \nConference Branch Women's Missionary Society was formed. At this time, \nKansas/Nebraska conference began to serve and meet the needs of the \nchurch and the community. During their 130 year history, the Missionary \nSociety encountered many social challenges. And holding true to their \nlegacy, they learned to adjust, adapt, and to be of service to the \nA.M.E. Church and the African American community. As a conference, they \nsponsor and hold workshops and seminars to educate the A.M.E. Church \nand the community on social issues that affect the Black community \ndaily.\n  The Kansas/Nebraska Missionary Society has had several Episcopal \nsupervisors who met the challenges of mission with the A.M.E. Church \nand the African American community in general. Today, the missionary \nsociety has opened a new chapter of missions with a Supervisor who has \na global mission to serve abroad as well as at home, Reverend Dr. \nCecelia Williams Bryant, who is affectionately known as ``Rev. C.''\n  Holding true to the A.M.E. Church legacy, Rev ``C'' is a true \nvisionary. Under the direction of Rev. ``C,'' the missionary society \nwill create opportunities for those in need, obtain resources for the \nchanging needs and work to address the concerns of people throughout \nthe world. They will also offer aid and assistance to women's \norganizations throughout the world as well. They also plan to pray and \nenthusiastically send the message throughout the Nation and the world \nthat prayer will and can make a difference.\n  On the evening of September 6, 2005, at St. John African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church, Topeka, KS, the Kansas/Nebraska Conference Branch \nWomen's Missionary Society of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \nwill proclaim ``The Healing of the Nations'' as they explore and tell \nthe story of the women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India \nand the Boothheel of Missouri.\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is quite evident that the Kansas/Nebraska Women's \nMissionary Society is ready to accept the challenges to move forward \nand continue to serve this Nation and the world in the areas of \nmissions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8945-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE COMMUNITY OF COLMAN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of Colman, \nSouth Dakota. On August 13, 2005, Colman citizens celebrate their \ncommunity's proud past as well as their hope for a promising future.\n  Located in Moody County, Colman is a small community nestled amongst \nthe fertile farmland of eastern South Dakota. The town got its start \nwith the help of the railroad, specifically the Milwaukee line, as it \nmade its way into the western United States. Platted in 1880, Colman \nwas originally named Allenson, in honor of the Allen family who donated \nthe town site in 1880. Not long thereafter, however, it was renamed \nColman, honoring the town's prosperous Colman Lumber Company.\n  Colman experienced a great deal of economic prosperity in the early \n20th century. Although only a fraction of the businesses Main Street \nonce boasted are still in operation, it is clear Colman was a lively, \nself-sufficient city with a variety of goods and services to offer. The \nbustling community included a grain elevator, a flourishing mill, both \na dairy and dairy delivery service, a trucking service, a doctor, a \nweekly newspaper, and a theater that showed movies every night of the \nweek. One of Colman's oldest businesses is the Farmers Cooperative \nElevator, which is still in use today. Although it was established in \n1898, the structure was destroyed and had to be rebuilt in 1941. \nAdditionally, Colman's first school was a one-room building near the \nwestern outskirts of the town.\n  On January 28, 1901, the first issue of The Colman Argus was \npublished by Bert H. Berry. In April of that year, Berry sold the \nweekly paper to F.F. French, who owned and edited it until his death in \n1931. French's son, F. Philo French, continued to print the publication \nfor the next 26 years, and then passed it on in 1957 to his widow, Lulu \nFrench, who eventually sold the paper in 1971, upon her retirement.\n  In the last three decades, Colman has evolved into a peaceful and \nquiet community that is great for retirees, those raising children, and \neveryone in between. The curtailment of the railroad, in addition to \nthe improvement of roads and alternate routes that sidestepped Colman, \ncaused people to travel to larger towns in the State to conduct their \nbusiness. Nevertheless, technology and progress can never touch the \nfirm resolve and remarkable work ethic that is characteristic of the \ngreat people of this country's heartland. The innovation and \ndetermination of the individuals who had the courage to make a home for \nthemselves on the plains of the Dakotas serves as inspiration to all \nthose who believe in the honest pursuit of their dreams. Colman's proud \n560 residents celebrate their city's vibrant 125 year history and the \nlegacy of the pioneer spirit on August 13th, 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8945-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Brandon, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1797.

A bill to amend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1992 to establish programs to \nenhance protection of the Chesapeake Bay, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of five \nmeasures to sustain and indeed renew the Federal commitment to \nrestoring the water quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. Joining me in sponsoring one or more of these measures are \nmy colleagues from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, Senators \nWarner, Allen, Mikulski, and Santorum.\n  In his 1984 State of the Union message, President Ronald Reagan \ncalled the Chesapeake Bay a ``special national resource'' and pledged \n$10 million a year for 4 years to ``begin the long, necessary effort to \nclean up'' the Bay. Today, despite more than 2 decades of effort and \nthe investment of hundreds of millions of dollars on the part of \nFederal, State, and local governments and the private sector, the goal \nof a clean, restored Bay appears elusive. For the past 3 years, the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation has given the Chesapeake Bay a failing grade \nof 27 out of 100 on its annual report card--far short of the ``70'' \nlevel believed necessary for the Bay to be declared ``saved.'' The \ncontinued flood of sediments and nutrient pollution from sewage \ntreatment plants, farms, urban runoff, and air deposition, combined \nwith continued rapid growth in population and development in the \nwatershed, is offsetting the progress that has been made to date in \nrestoring the Bay. The Bay remains an ``impaired water body'' under the \nClean Water Act, and Chesapeake Bay Program scientists are forecasting \nanother summer of very low oxygen levels in the deep waters of the Bay, \nfurther stressing oysters, crabs, and other living resources. As author \nand naturalist Tom Horton points out in a recent National Geographic \narticle,\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\n``No one had illusions that the work of the Chesapeake Bay Program, a \nmassive Federal-State restoration effort, begun in 1983 and unmatched \nanywhere in the world, would be quick or easy. But no one anticipated \nthat 22 years later we would still be struggling.''\n  If the Bay is to be restored, we must redouble our efforts. Nitrogen \npollution from all sources will have to be substantially reduced, \nthousands of acres of watershed property must be preserved, significant \nefforts must be made to restore living resources, and buffer zones to \nprotect rivers and streams need to be created. Likewise, assistance to \ncommunity organizations, local governments, and educational \ninstitutions at all levels must be expanded dramatically to help foster \nlocal stewardship and entice more of the 16 million residents who live \nin the watershed to play active roles in the efforts to restore the \nBay.\n  The five measures that we are introducing are an important part of, \nbut by no means the entire, solution for addressing the Bay's problems. \nEarlier in this Congress, Members from the Bay-area States, from both \nparties, joined with me in a letter to President Bush, urging him to \nmake restoration of Chesapeake Bay a top environmental priority and to \ncommit $1 billion in his budget as a down-payment towards restoring the \nBay's water quality. We called upon the Secretary of Agriculture to \nrelease $100 million provided under the 2002 Farm Bill for farmers to \ntest new, innovative techniques for reducing agricultural nutrient \npollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Under Senator Warner's \nleadership, we succeeded in getting a provision in the Senate-passed \nSAFETEA legislation, which would provide more than $70 million for the \nBay area States and local governments to mitigate the impacts of storm-\nwater runoff from highways and related impervious surfaces. We have \nfought to prevent a significant cut in funding for the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund. And we have continued to press the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that the Clean Water \nAct is fully enforced. All these are critical components of a more \ncomprehensive effort on the part of the Federal, State and local \ngovernments and the private sector that will be needed over the course \nof the next few years to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n  The first measure, the Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization and \nEnvironmental Accountability Act of 2005, would reauthorize and enhance \nEPA's Chesapeake Bay Program and would increase the program's \naccountability for improving the health of the Bay. The Chesapeake Bay \nProgram, which has guided the clean-up effort for the past two decades, \nexpires this year and must be reauthorized. Originally authorized in \nthe Water Quality Act of 1987 and reauthorized in the Estuaries and \nClean Water Act of 2000, the Chesapeake Bay Program provides support \nand coordination for Federal, State, and local efforts in developing \nstrategies and action plans, conducting system-wide monitoring and \nassessment, implementing projects to restore and protect the Bay and \nits living resources, and communicating with the public about the Bay \nand efforts to restore and protect it.\n  Last year, Senator Mikulski, Senator Warner, and I asked the \nGovernment Accountability Office to conduct a review of the Bay Program \nthat would assess the overall restoration progress reported for the \nBay; determine how progress is measured in the Bay watershed; and \nevaluate the effectiveness of Chesapeake Bay Program efforts to ensure \nthat proper measures are being used. That study is nearing completion. \nIts preliminary findings recommend a number of improvements to the \nProgram, which we have incorporated in this measure. The Chesapeake \n2000 Agreement provides goals for the Bay, but the GAO found that EPA \nhas not developed a plan to achieve these goals. Bay restoration has \nalso been hampered by a lack of interim goals and time frames against \nwhich progress can be assessed. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday requires the EPA Administrator to develop an implementation plan \nfor reaching the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, including a \ntimeline with specific annual goals for nutrient and sediment \nreduction, associated costs, and measures for assessing progress, and \nto prepare an annual report for Congress that describes the \naccomplishments of the previous year and the reductions likely to occur \nin the future. The legislation also directs the Administrator to \npublish and widely circulate annual ``tributary report cards'' that \ndescribe the progress made in achieving the nutrient and sediment \nreduction goals for each major tributary or tributary segment in the \nBay watershed. These ``report cards'' will provide the public with a \nclear and accurate picture of the progress toward restoring the Bay, \nwhich is currently lacking. In addition, the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget is to submit an annual report on Chesapeake Bay \nProgram funding.\n  The second measure, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal \nAssistance Act, would establish a grants program in the Environmental \nProtection Agency to support the installation of nutrient reduction \ntechnologies at major wastewater treatment facilities in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed. I first introduced this measure during the 107th \nCongress, and provisions of the legislation were included as part of S. \n1961, the Water Investment Act of 2002, reported favorably by the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee. Unfortunately, no \nfurther action was taken on that legislation.\n\n  Despite important water quality improvements over the past decade, \nthe overabundance of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus continues to \nrob the Bay of life-sustaining oxygen. Recent modeling of EPA's Bay \nProgram has found that total nutrient discharges must be reduced by \nmore than 40 percent from current levels to restore the Chesapeake Bay \nand its major tributaries to health. To do so, nitrogen discharges from \nall sources must be reduced drastically below current levels. Annual \nnitrogen discharges into the Bay will need to be cut by at least 100 \nmillion pounds from the current 275 million pounds to less than 175 \nmillion pounds. Municipal wastewater treatment plants, in particular, \nwill have to reduce nitrogen discharges by nearly 75 percent.\n  In December 2004, the Chesapeake Bay Commission issued a report \nentitled ``Cost-Effective Strategies for the Bay''; of the six most \ncost-effective strategies listed in that report, upgrading wastewater \ntreatment plants is Number One. There are more than 300 significant \nmunicipal wastewater treatment plants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. \nThese plants contribute almost 60 million pounds of nitrogen per year--\none-fifth--of the total load of nitrogen to the Bay. Upgrading these \nplants with nutrient removal technologies to achieve nitrogen levels of \n3 mg/liter would remove as much as 30 million pounds of nitrogen in the \nBay each year, or 30 percent of the total nitrogen reductions needed. \nNutrient removal technologies have other benefits, as well. They \nprovide significant savings in energy usage, 20-30 percent, in chemical \nusage, more than 50 percent, and in the amount of sludge produced, 5-15 \npercent. Furthermore, the benefits from upgrading sewage treatment \nplants have an immediate result on the Bay's water quality, unlike \nother methods that primarily affect nutrients in ground water and may \ntake years to produce results. This legislation would provide grants \nfor 55 percent of the capital cost of upgrading the plants with state-\nof-the-art nutrient removal technologies capable of achieving nitrogen \nlevels of 3 mg/liter. Any publicly owned wastewater treatment plant \nwhich has a permitted design capacity to treat an annual average of 0.5 \nmillion gallons per day within the Chesapeake Bay watershed portion of \nNew York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, Virginia, \nand the District of Columbia would be eligible to receive these grants. \nAs a signatory to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, the EPA has an \nimportant responsibility to assist the states with financing these \nwater infrastructure needs.\n  The third measure, the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot \nProgram Act, would establish a new environmental education program in \nthe U.S. Department of Education for elementary and secondary school \nstudents and teachers within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. There is a \ngrowing consensus that a major commitment to education to promoting an \nethic of responsible stewardship and\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\ncitizenship among the 16 million people who live in the watershed is \nnecessary if all of the other efforts to save the Bay are to succeed. \nExpanding environmental education and training opportunities will lead \nnot only to a healthier Chesapeake Bay ecosystem but also to a more \neducated and informed citizenry, with a deeper understanding of and \nappreciation for the environment, their community, and their role in \nsociety as responsible citizens.\n  One of the principal commitments of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement is \nto ``provide a meaningful Bay or stream outdoor experience for every \nschool student in the watershed before graduation from high school'' \nbeginning with the class of 2005. There are more than 3.3 million K-12 \nstudents in the watershed, and despite important efforts by Bay area \nstates and not-for-profit organizations, only a very small percentage \nof these students have had the opportunity to engage in meaningful \noutdoor experiences or receive classroom environmental instruction. \nMany of the school systems in the Bay watershed are only at the \nbeginning stages in developing and implementing environmental education \ninto their curriculum, let alone exposing students to outdoor watershed \nexperiences. What's lacking is not the desire or will, but the \nresources and training to undertake more comprehensive environmental \neducation programs.\n  This legislation would authorize $6 million a year over the next four \nyears in Federal grant assistance to help close the resource and \ntraining gap for students in the elementary and secondary levels in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed. It would require a 50 percent non-Federal \nmatch, thus leveraging $12 million in assistance. The funding could be \nused to help design, demonstrate or disseminate environmental curricula \nand field practices, train teachers or other educational personnel, and \nsupport on-the-ground activities or Chesapeake Bay or stream outdoor \neducational experiences involving students and teachers, among other \nthings. The program would complement the NOAA Bay Watershed Education \nand Training Program that we established several years ago.\n  The fourth measure, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act, would \ncontinue and enhance the USDA Forest Service's role in the restoration \nof the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Forest loss and fragmentation are \noccurring rapidly in the Chesapeake Bay region and are among the most \nimportant issues facing the Bay and forest management today. According \nto the National Resources Inventory, the States closest to the Bay lost \n350,000 acres of forest between 1987 and 1997--almost 100 acres per \nday. More and more rural areas are being converted to suburban \ndevelopments, resulting in smaller contiguous forest tracts. These \ntrends are leading to a regional forest land base that is more \nvulnerable to conversion, is less likely to be economically viable in \nthe future, and is losing its capacity to protect watershed health and \nother ecological benefits, such as controlling stormwater runoff, \nerosion and air pollution. Restoring and conserving forests is \nessential to sustaining the Bay ecosystem.\n  Since 1990, the USDA Forest Service has been an important part of the \nChesapeake Bay Program. The Service has worked closely with Federal, \nState, and local partners in the six-state Chesapeake Bay region to \ndemonstrate how forest protection, restoration, and stewardship \nactivities can contribute to achieving the Bay restoration goals. With \nthe signing of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the role of the USDA \nForest Service has become more important than ever. Among other \nprovisions, this Agreement requires the signatories to conserve \nexisting forests along all streams and shoreline; to promote the \nexpansion and connection of contiguous forests; to assess the Bay's \nforest lands; and to provide technical and financial assistance to \nlocal governments to plan for or revise plans, ordinances, and \nsubdivision regulations to provide for the conservation and sustainable \nuse of the forest and agricultural lands.\n  This legislation codifies the role and responsibilities of the USDA \nForest Service to the Bay restoration effort. It requires an evaluation \nof the urban and rural forests in the watershed. It strengthens \nexisting coordination, technical assistance, forest resource \nassessment, and planning efforts for urban, suburban and rural areas of \nthe Chesapeake Bay watershed. It authorizes a small grants program to \nsupport local agencies, watershed associations, and citizen groups in \nconducting on-the-ground conservation projects. It establishes a \nregional applied forestry research and training program to enhance \nurban, suburban and rural forests in the watershed. Finally it \nauthorizes $3.5 million for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2010, a \nmodest increase in view of the six-State, 64,000-square-mile watershed.\n  The fifth measure, the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed Monitoring, \nEducation, Training, and Restoration Act, would enhance the authorities \nof the Chesapeake Bay Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, to address the goals and commitments of the \nChesapeake 2000 Agreement with regard to living-resource restoration \nand education and training. It builds upon provisions contained in the \nHydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2002, and addresses \nseveral urgent and unmet needs in the watershed. To help meet Bay-wide \nliving resource education and training goals, it codifies the Bay \nWatershed Education and Training, or B-WET, Program--the first \nfederally funded environmental education program focused solely on the \nChesapeake Bay watershed--that we initiated in the Fiscal 2002 \nCommerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill; it establishes an \naquaculture education program to assist with oyster and blue crab \nhatchery production; and it codifies the ongoing oyster restoration \nprogram and authorizes a new restoration program for submerged aquatic \nvegetation.\n  To better coordinate and organize the substantial amounts of weather, \ntide, habitat, water-quality and other data collected and compiled by \nFederal, State, and local government agencies and academic institutions \nand to make this information more useful to resource managers, \nscientists, and the public, this bill also establishes an integrated \nobserving system for the Chesapeake Bay. This system will build on and \ncoordinate existing monitoring and observing activities in the Bay and \nits watershed, and will include development of an internet-based system \nfor integrating and disseminating the vast amounts of information \navailable.\n  These measures would provide an important boost to our efforts to \nrestore the Chesapeake Bay. They are strongly supported by the \nChesapeake Bay Commission and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bills and supporting letters be \nprinted in the Record. I urge my colleagues to join with us in \nsupporting the measures and continue the momentum contributing to the \nimprovement and enhancement of our Nation's most valuable and treasured \nnatural resource.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) \n     wishes to submit this letter in support of the package of \n     proposed legislation that you have prepared to further the \n     ongoing efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay and the \n     tributaries that feed it. We believe that the series of \n     legislative proposals you are submitting, in conjunction with \n     the infusion of new and critical federal funding support, are \n     key elements of reinvigorating the Bay restoration effort.\n       The bills we have reviewed and support are the following:\n       The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance \n     Act. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     to provide assistance for nutrient removal technologies to \n     States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n       Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are the two largest \n     problems threatening the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay \n     and its rivers and streams. Consequently, in the Chesapeake \n     2000 Agreement (C2K), the Bay states committed to reduce \n     nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus pollution) by \n     millions of pounds each year. One of the most effective tools \n     in reducing this pollution is upgrading sewage treatment \n     plants with modern, nutrient pollution removal technologies. \n     Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia have all provided new and \n     additional funding to assist in the implementation of these \n     technologies; however, proposed cuts to existing federal \n     funds designated for wastewater treatment upgrades \n     jeopardizes the success of these state initiatives.\n       The federal government must make a greater commitment to \n     funding. Grant funding, as proposed in this bill, to assist \n     in the design, construction, and operation of these \n     technologies is a critical part of successfully achieving the \n     C2K pollution reduction goals and restoring the Bay.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization and \n     Environmental Accountability Act of 2005. A bill to amend the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require environmental \n     accountability and reporting and to reauthorize the \n     Chesapeake Bay Program.\n       There has been much criticism and questioning in recent \n     years about the implementation of the multijurisdictional \n     Chesapeake Bay Program. There is no doubt that the members of \n     the Program, from state partners to the federal Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), have not moved forward as \n     aggressively as the resource demands, failing to meet \n     deadlines for water quality improvement actions that the \n     signatories themselves established in C2K. In contrast, the \n     Program has provided essential technical data and the \n     underlying science critical to our understanding of the \n     problems facing the Bay and the watershed rivers and streams. \n     The Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization and Environmental \n     Accountability Act of 2005 places a clear mandate on EPA to \n     develop and implement a plan for achieving the nutrient \n     pollution reduction goals of C2K and measure progress through \n     actual water quality improvements. The legislation also \n     requires Bay watershed states to report annually on their \n     progress implementing the plan. Finally, the legislation \n     provides for a much needed assessment by the Office of \n     Management and Budget on the potential benefits of federal \n     monies dedicated to the restoration effort combining into a \n     single fund. This assessment complements the current \n     financing authority efforts of the C2K signatories, an effort \n     looking to develop a vehicle to not only better leverage \n     state and federal monies, but also obtain additional funds. \n     Absent a substantial increase in investment in the Bay, \n     restoration efforts are likely to fail.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program \n     Act: A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 to establish a pilot program to make grants to \n     eligible institutions to develop, demonstrate, or disseminate \n     information on practices, methods, or techniques relating to \n     environmental education and training in the Chesapeake Bay \n     watershed.\n       We cannot expect the next generation to be responsible \n     stewards of the Bay and the rivers and streams that \n     crisscross its watershed unless we invest in education. We \n     must provide our youth with the knowledge and tools that \n     enable them to choose to be stewards of our natural \n     resources. C2K recognized this need and set a goal of \n     providing every student in the Bay watershed a meaningful \n     field experience before he or she graduates from high school. \n     One single experience alone with the Bay or a river or \n     stream, however, is not adequate to educate students on \n     environmental issues and instill in them a sense of \n     stewardship. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot \n     Program Act will help to accomplish this goal by providing \n     much needed funding for designing and implementing \n     environmental curricula, participation in on-the-ground \n     restoration projects, interactive opportunities with among \n     students, and outdoor educational experiences. These tools \n     and others are key to increasing public environmental \n     awareness and developing educated and responsible stewards of \n     the Bay.\n       The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed Monitoring, Education, \n     Training and Restoration Act. A bill to establish programs to \n     enhance protection of the Chesapeake Bay, and for other \n     purposes.\n       This legislation proposes a series of important initiatives \n     from the integration of data\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n     to the establishment of an oyster and submerged aquatic \n     vegetation restoration program. In addition, a critical \n     element is the establishment of the watershed education and \n     training program, which complements the initiatives contained \n     in the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program \n     Act.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Program Act of 2005. \n     A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \n     program to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to \n     restore and protect forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, \n     and for other purposes.\n       Forests provide habitat for wildlife, filter polluted \n     runoff, and help moderate stream water temperature. Because \n     of their importance in improving water quality, the Bay \n     states have committed to restoring thousands of acres of \n     forested buffers in the watershed. In addition, they are one \n     of the most cost-effective ways to reduce nitrogen and \n     phosphorus pollutions. Yet, the Chesapeake Bay watershed is \n     continuing to lose forests, in both urban and rural areas, at \n     alarming rates. Preservation and restoration of forests and \n     forest buffers, as encouraged by this legislation, are \n     critical elements in Bay restoration efforts.\n       This package of legislative initiatives will do much to \n     strengthen and reinvigorate our efforts to Save the Bay. CBF \n     is grateful to you, Senator, for your constant and unwavering \n     commitment to the restoration of waters of the Bay watershed \n     and for your long and distinguished leadership on these \n     issues.\n       If CBF can provide you with any additional assistance with \n     the important initiatives evidenced by these bills, please \n     let me know.\n       With sincere appreciation for all you have done for the \n     Bay, I am,\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                              Roy A. Hoagland,\n\n                                     Vice President, Environmental\n     Protection & Restoration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                                     July 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Federal funding has played a crucial \n     role in supporting the Chesapeake Bay restoration. Thanks in \n     large part to your efforts, federal funds have supported \n     nearly one-fifth of the pojects currently underway and served \n     as a catalyst for countless more.\n       In October 2004, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Blue Ribbon \n     Finance Panel issued a report that underscored the enormous \n     challenge facing the Chesapeake and concluded, `` . . . \n     restoring the Chesapeake Bay will require a large-scale \n     national and regional approach, capitalized by federal and \n     state governments and directed according to a watershed-wide \n     strategy.'' The report called for a $15 billion federal and \n     state investment over the next four years to restore the Bay. \n     While $15 billion is an enormous sum, failure to take action \n     and to make the investments needed to restore the health of \n     our nation's largest and most productive estuary will be even \n     more costly. A commitment of this size will require the \n     substantial involvement of all partners, including the \n     federal, state, and local governments and the private sector.\n       With this financial need firmly in focus, we are writing to \n     convey our tri-state Commission's strong support for your \n     Chesapeake Bay legislative package. Together, these five \n     bills promote the kinds of enhanced funding and technical \n     assistance that are needed to meet the goals of the, \n     Chesapeake 2000 agreement (C2K) and restore the Bay. We hope \n     that the 109th Congress will join us in our support of:\n       1. The Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization and \n     Environmental Accountability Act.\n       2. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance \n     Act\n       3. The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education Pilot Program \n     Act\n       4. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act\n       5. The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed Monitoring, Education, \n     Training, and Restoration Act\n       The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance \n     Act is of particular interest to this Commission. As a \n     signatory to C2K, we have committed to reducing the Bay's \n     nitrogen loads by 110 million pounds. Meeting this goal will \n     restore the Bay waters to conditions that are clean, clear, \n     and productive. Last December, the Commission issued a report \n     entitled ``Cost-Effective Strategies for the Bay''; of the \n     six most cost-effective strategies listed in that report, \n     upgrading wastewater treatment plants is Number One. The Act \n     provides grants to upgrade the major wastewater treatment \n     plants in the Bay's six-state watershed with modern \n     nutrient removal technologies. It will allow the region to \n     demonstrate that state-of-the-art nutrient removal is \n     possible on a large scale. It will result in the removal \n     of as much as 30 million pounds of nitrogen each year, or \n     30 percent of the reduction that is needed. Furthermore, \n     the benefits from upgrading sewage treatment plants have \n     an immediate result on the Bay's water quality, unlike \n     other methods that primarily affect nutrients in ground \n     water and may take years to produce results in the Bay. \n     Only the Federal government is in the position to trigger \n     such remarkable reductions. It is an opportunity that must \n     not be ignored.\n       Reauthorizing the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     Chesapeake Bay Program is critical to the success of efforts \n     to restore the Bay. This program provides support and \n     coordination for Federal, state, and local efforts developing \n     strategies and actions plans, assessing progress throughout \n     the watershed, implementing projects to protect the Bay and \n     its living resources, and communicating with the public.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Forestry Act will help to \n     control pollution by establishing forests and riparian \n     buffers that can filter and absorb sediment and nutrient \n     runoff while providing valuable habitat for animals and birds \n     and food and shelter for fish. Enhanced support for the Bay \n     Program of the Forest Service will ramp up its ability to \n     provide interstate coordination, technical assistance, and \n     forest assessment and planning services that are otherwise \n     limited or unavailable in our region.\n       Finally, let us emphasize the important support for \n     education that this package provides. Sustaining our hard-won \n     progress in the restoration of the Bay will ultimately rest \n     in the hands of citizens and communities throughout the \n     watershed. Expanding environmental education and training \n     opportunities for a variety of ages, from kindergarten to \n     adult community education and outreach, will lead to a \n     healthier Bay and to a more educated and informed citizenry, \n     yet these kinds of activities are woefully underfunded. The \n     monies provided by the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Education \n     Pilot Program Act and the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Watershed \n     Monitoring, Education, Training, and Restoration Act will \n     substantially improve our ability to keep our commitments on \n     track and reach the C2K goals.\n       The federal government has been a strong partner in efforts \n     to restore the Bay, and your five-bill package maintains and \n     enhances the federal commitment to the Bay. The Commission \n     commends your dedication now and over the past two decades to \n     the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Please instruct us as to \n     how we can further support these measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Senator Mike Waugh,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 1495. A bill to prohibit Federal agencies from obligating funds \nfor appropriations earmarks included only in congressional reports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, along \nwith my friend from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, is very simple. The \nObligation of Funds Transparency Act of 2005 would prohibit Federal \nagencies from obligating funds which have been earmarked only in \ncongressional reports. This legislation is designed to help reign in \nunauthorized, unrequested, run-of-the-mill pork barrel projects.\n  As my colleagues may know, report language does not have the force of \nlaw. That fact has been lost when it comes to appropriations bills and \nreports. It has become a standard practice to load up committee reports \nwith literally billions of dollars in unrequested, unauthorized, and \nwasteful pork barrel projects.\n  According to information compiled from the Congressional Research \nService (CRS), the total number of earmarks has grown from 4,126 in \nfiscal year 1994 to 14,040 in fiscal year 2004. That's an increase of \n240 percent. In terms of dollars, the earmarking has gone from $26.6 \nbillion to $47.9 billion over the same period. The practice of \nearmarking funds in appropriations bills has simply lurched out of \ncontrol.\n  At a conference in February, 2005, David Walker, the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States, said this: ``If we continue on our \npresent path, we'll see pressure for deep spending cuts or dramatic tax \nincreases. GAO's long-term budget simulations paint a chilling picture. \nIf we do nothing, by 2040 we may have to cut federal spending by more \nthan half or raise federal taxes by more than two and a half times to \nbalance the budget. Clearly, the status quo is both unsustainable and \ndifficult choices are unavoidable. And the longer we wait, the more \nonerous our options will become and the less transition time we will \nhave.''\n  Is that really the kind of legacy we should leave to future \ngenerations of Americans?\n  Referring to our economic outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan testified before Congress that: ``(T)he dimension of the \nchallenge is enormous. The one certainty is that the resolution of this \nsituation will require difficult choices and that the future \nperformance of the economy will depend on those choices. No changes \nwill be easy, as they all will involve lowering claims on resources or \nraising\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\nfinancial obligations. It falls on the Congress to determine how best \nto address the competing claims.''\n  It falls on the Congress my friends. The head of the U.S. \nGovernment's chief watchdog agency and the Nation's chief economist \nagree--we are in real trouble.\n  We simply must start making some very tough decisions around here if \nwe are serious about improving our fiscal future. We need to be \nthinking about the future of America and the future generations who are \ngoing to be paying the tab for our continued spending. It is simply not \nfiscally responsible for us to continue to load up appropriations bills \nwith wasteful and unnecessary spending, and good deals for special \ninterests and their lobbyists. We have had ample opportunities to \ntighten our belts in this town in recent years, and we have taken a \npass each and every time. We can't put off the inevitable any longer.\n  Here is the stark reality of our fiscal situation. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the unfunded federal financial \nburden, such as public debt, future Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid payments, totals more than $40 trillion or $140,000 per man, \nwoman and child. To put this in perspective, the average mortgage, \nwhich is often a family's largest liability, is $124,000--and that is \noften borne by the family breadwinners, not the children too. But, \ninstead of fixing the problem, and fixing it will not be easy, we only \nsucceeded in making it bigger, more unstable, more complicated, and \nmuch, much more expensive.\n  The Committee for Economic Development, the Concord Coalition, and \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities jointly stated that, \n``without a change in current (fiscal) policies, the federal government \ncan expect to run a cumulative deficit of $5 trillion over the next 10 \nyears.'' They also stated that, ``after the baby boom generation starts \nto retire in 2008, the combination of demographic pressures and rising \nhealth care costs will result in the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security growing faster than the economy. We project that by the \ntime today's newborns reach 40 years of age, the cost of these three \nprograms as a percentage of the economy will more than double--from 8.5 \npercent of the GDP to over 17 percent.\n  Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has issued warnings \nabout the dangers that lie ahead if we continue to spend in this \nmanner. In a report issued at the beginning of the year, CBO stated \nthat, because of rising health care costs and an aging population, \n``spending on entitlement programs--especially Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security--will claim a sharply increasing share ofthe nation's \neconomic output over the coming decades.'' The report went on to say \nthat, ``unless taxation reaches levels that are unprecedented in the \nUnited States, current spending policies will probably be financially \nunsustainable over the next 50 years. An ever-growing burden of federal \ndebt held by the public would have a corrosive. . . effect on the \neconomy.''\n  Where is it going to end? We have to face the facts, and one fact is \nthat we can't continue to spend taxpayer's dollars on wasteful, \nunnecessary pork barrel projects or cater to wealthy corporate special \ninterests any longer. The American people won't stand for it, and they \nshouldn't--they deserve better treatment from us. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1498. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain water distribution facilities to the Northern Colorado Water \nConservancy District; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy \nDistrict has contacted me, along with other members of the Colorado \nCongressional Delegation, seeking the introduction and passage of \nFederal legislation authorizing the title transfer of specific features \nof the Colorado-Big Thompson Project from the Untied States to \nNorthern. This title transfer will be similar to a bill that I carried \nduring the 106th Congress, which transferred other Bureau of Rec \nfacilities to Northern. The projects involved in the proposed title \ntransfer are those single-purpose water conveyance facilities used for \nthe distribution of water released from Carter Lake Reservoir: the St. \nVrain Supply Canal; the Boulder Feed Canal; the Boulder Creek Supply \nCanal; and the South Platte Supply Canal.\n  The entire project, called the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, was \nbuilt from 1938 to 1957, and provides supplemental water to more than \n30 cities and towns. The water is used to help irrigate over 600,000 \nacres of northeastern Colorado farmland.\n  The proposed legislation will divest Reclamation of all present and \nfuture responsibility for and cost associated with the management, \noperation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation and replacement of, and \nliability for the transferred facilities. This responsibility will \nbecome that of the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District.\n  The legislation will eliminate the duplication of efforts between the \nDistrict and Reclamation in issuing and administering crossing licenses \nand other forms of permission to utilize the land on which the \nfacilities are located. Finally, the legislation will provide for \nenhanced local control over water facilities that are not of national \nimportance, and allow these facilities to be used for more efficient \nand effective water management. Local control, especially in the case \nof matters in relation to water, has always been a major component of \nmy philosophy. I am proud to introduce this bill which will serve to \nfurther that intent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1499. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to provide for \ncompetitive and reliable electricity transmission in the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Kentucky \nCompetitive Access Program (KCAP) bill that would allow Kentucky \nelectric distribution companies to purchase cheaper power. This means \nlower rates for many Kentucky consumers served by the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority (TVA). I am pleased Senator McConnell has joined me in \nintroducing this bill.\n  Kentucky has some of the cheapest electric power available in the \nNation. However, some Kentucky consumers in TVA are paying higher \nelectricity rates than Kentucky consumers outside of TVA.\n  Kentucky electric distribution companies served by the TVA can not \nprovide their customers with access to Kentucky's inexpensive power. \nThis is because under existing federal law the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) has limited authority over TVA and can not \nrequire it to transmit the cheaper power to most, if not all, of the \nKentucky distributors. The legislation removes this restriction and \nprovides the FERC with the authority to require TVA to transmit power \nto all Kentucky distributors.\n  In addition to allowing Kentucky customers to access less expensive \npower, the legislation would not harm TVA or result in higher rates to \nTVA's remaining customers. The Kentucky distributors, in total, \nconstitute only about 6 percent of TVA's revenues and load. Further, \nTVA is experiencing load growth of about 3 percent per year which \nshould quickly result in the replacement of any load lost in Kentucky. \nThus, the departure of some portion of the Kentucky distributors should \nnot result in any significant cost shift to remaining TVA system \ncustomers.\n  All Kentuckians deserve to choose where they receive their power. \nThis bill will not only give them that choice, but it will also create \na more competitive environment among Kentucky distributors and allow \nour businesses and residential consumers to keep more money in their \npockets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1502. A bill to clarify the applicability of State law to national \nbanks and Federal savings associations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Preservation of Federalism in Banking Act, to clarify the \nrelationship between\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\nState consumer protection laws and national banks.\n  This legislation responds to a sweeping new rule issued by the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that regulates national \nbanks. The OCC's new rule gives the agency unprecedented authority to \npre-empt state laws, thereby shielding national banks and their non-\nbank and state-chartered bank affiliates from many important consumer \nprotections. It also potentially limits the ability of states to \nenforce many related laws. The most important immediate consequence of \nthe OCC rule has been the preemption of state anti-predatory lending \nlaws.\n  I feel strongly about the need to address predatory lending, which \ncan trap people in endless cycles of debt and escalating fees. Many \nStates, such as my own state of New Jersey, have enacted tough laws to \ndeal with the problem. Unfortunately, the OCC's ruling substantially \nundermines these laws by regulatory fiat. That will leave many \nconsumers unprotected, and it shifts too many responsibilities to a \nsingle agency here in Washington that is not equipped to handle them. \nAfter all, according to its own website, the OCC ``does not have the \nmandate to engage in consumer advocacy''.\n  Although the OCC has a long and successful record of regulating for \nsafety and soundness, it has little experience dealing with abusive \nlocal practices, such as predatory lending. Believe it or not, the OCC \nactually is proposing to handle all consumer complaints through a \nsingle, lightly staffed call center in Houston. This is totally \nunrealistic. Each year, State officials receive thousands of related \ncomplaints, which usually are very local in nature. These officials are \nat the forefront of the enforcement effort, identifying and combating \nnew practices as they arise. The OCC's system simply could not fill \nthis role without major changes.\n  The OCC rule also raises concerns about regulatory charter \ncompetition, the viability of a broad range of State laws, and the \nability of consumers and State officials to seek remedies in court. \nThis concern is only reinforced by two other developments.\n  First is a general counsel opinion by the Office of Thrift \nSupervision that attempts to extend federal preemption beyond a \nthrift's corporate family. That effort would nullify the application of \nstate consumer protection laws over independent, third-party agents of \nfederal thrifts, and is particularly threatening to state insurance and \nsecurities efforts.\n  And second is the FDIC's consideration of a rule that would allow \nState-chartered banks the same preemptive privileges for out-of-State \nbranches as those of national banks. These two recent developments only \nreinforce concerns of a ``race to the bottom'' scenario.\n  The OCC rule has provoked strong opposition from governors, attorneys \ngeneral, banking supervisors, and many consumer advocacy groups, not to \nmention the public. The OCC received over 2,600 letters in response to \nits rules, and more than 90 percent opposed them.\n  The Preservation of Federalism in Banking Act is a reasonable \nresponse to the OCC rule. The bill will clarify that national banks \nmust comply with certain state consumer protection laws, such as anti-\npredatory lending laws and privacy acts.\n  While the OCC has long had the statutory responsibility to regulate \nthe activities of national banks, it has never denied the ability of \nStates to protect their citizens. The OCC historically has used its \nauthority under the National Bank Act in a reasonable way to shield \nnational banks from State banking laws that intrude on the OCC's \ncongressionally-granted powers. While we should continue to support the \nappropriate use of the agency's authority, it is important that we \nimmediately intervene to reverse the OCC's regulatory overreach and \nprevent the agency from preemption all state consumer protection laws \nand State authority to enforce related laws.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce healthcare costs, expand access to \naffordable healthcare coverage, and improve healthcare and strengthen \nthe health care safety net, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, wherever I travel, Americans tell me the \nsame things about our health care system: it costs too much, leaves too \nmany without insurance, and does too little to help those in need.\n  America has the world's best hospitals, doctors, nurses, and medical \nresearch labs. But we do not always provide the best care. And we \ncertainly do not provide it at an affordable price. We face real \nproblems. And we need to act.\n  Two years ago, I appointed a task force to investigate what Congress \ncould do. Under the leadership of Senator Judd Gregg, the task force \nreported back with a series of comprehensive recommendations. The \nPresident has also proposed some very constructive policy initiatives. \nWe took all of these proposals into account when we wrote this bill.\n  The legislation we propose today will build upon our record of \naccomplishment on health care. The Republican Congress has created a \nMedicare drug benefit for seniors, made tax-free, portable Health \nSavings Accounts available to all Americans, and has begun the process \nof moving our medical system into the information age.\n  This week, we will pass and send to the President a long-overdue \nmeasure to encourage doctors and hospitals to report medical errors \nvoluntarily. The measure will save lives, and it will improve health \ncare quality.\n  But we still have more to do.\n  The legislation we are proposing today focuses on three broad areas: \nreducing costs, expanding health coverage, and improving the quality of \ncare. In this bill--``The Healthy America Act of 2005''--we provide \ncomprehensive solutions that will improve health care for every \nAmerican.\n  Let me begin by speaking about cost. Every year, Americans see their \nhealth care costs soar. Just 15 years ago, less than 1 out of every 10 \ndollars Americans spent went for health care. In 10 years, almost one \nout of every five dollars you spend will go towards health care.\n  Rising life expectancies and the cost of new technologies, \ntreatments, and medical procedures all drive up costs. But we can do \nmore to hold them in check. And we must.\n  Rapidly rising health costs threaten our Nation's small business \nowners, and our largest corporations. They can harm our economy; cost \njobs, and hurt Americans from all walks of life. During the past few \nyears, for example, health care costs have grown three to four times \nmore quickly than wages.\n\n  First, we need to reform our broken medical liability system. Under \nour current medical system, doctors face enormous incentives to order \nunnecessary tests and procedures simply to avoid the risk of lawsuits.\n  It's expensive, it's wasteful, and unnecessary, and, most of all, \nit's dangerous. It needs to change and, under this bill, it will.\n  Hospitals, doctors, patients, and insurers all shoulder some \nresponsibility for rising costs. To keep costs down, we need to put the \npatient at the heart of health care. That's why we propose reforms to \nlet patients own and control privacy-protected electronic medical \nrecords, cut down on fraud in our Medicare and Medicaid programs, \nreduce medical errors, and reduce unnecessary regulations and mandates.\n  Lower costs alone will help many Americans get the care they need and \ndeserve. But we also have to look at ways to cover more Americans who \nwould still find themselves left behind.\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\n  Through changes to tax laws, we can make it easier for lower-income \nindividuals and small businesses to purchase affordable, high quality \nhealth insurance.\n  And we can also provide more options for those who take charge of \ntheir own health care by making flexible spending accounts more \nflexible and health savings accounts even more affordable for \nindividuals and small businesses.\n  Finally, the Federal Government can help support State high-risk \npools that help provide health coverage to individuals who couldn't \notherwise afford care.\n  America is a caring Nation and we must recognize that not everyone \nhas equal ability to take care of his or her own health. That's why we \nneed to expand our safety net for the truly needy.\n  Many of those without health insurance--particularly children--\nqualify for benefits under existing programs but do not receive them. \nBy providing grants to faith-based and community organizations, we can \nhelp more families sign up their children for available health \ncoverage.\n  We also need to expand the availability of health care services to \nindividuals in need by expanding Community Health Centers and Rural \nHealth Clinics to more rural areas and poor counties.\n  We should also act to make prescription drugs more affordable for \nlow-income Americans and provide legal protections and loan forbearance \nthat will make it easier for health care practitioners who volunteer \ntheir time and services to provide needed care in community health \ncenters and free clinics.\n  Every American should have health care that's available, affordable, \nand always there.\n  And we must hold fast to this principle: patients should sit at the \ncenter of the health care system, not the government, not insurance \ncompanies, and certainly not predatory trial lawyers.\n  The system should free providers to focus on caring for their \npatients: not dealing with regulations, bureaucrats, or lawyers.\n  Today, we've put forward a plan that will take a major step towards \ncentering America's health care system on the patient.\n  We have the vision for what American health care should look like. \nNow we only need the courage to make it happen.\n  I want to thank Senator Gregg, and all of the members of the Task \nForce who worked so diligently on this legislation. I also want to \nrecognize the contributions of the other cosponsors of this \nlegislation: Senators Mitch McConnell, Mike Enzi, Lisa Murkowski, and \nJim DeMint, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care costs are growing rapidly, putting health \n     insurance and needed care out of reach for too many \n     Americans.\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\n       (2) Rapidly growing health care costs pose a threat to the \n     United States economy, as they make American businesses less \n     competitive and make it more difficult to create new jobs.\n       (3) Growing health care costs are compromising the \n     stability of health care safety net and entitlement programs.\n       (4) There are a series of steps Congress can and should \n     take to slow the growth of health care costs, expand access \n     to health coverage, and improve access to quality health care \n     for millions of Americans.\n\n              TITLE I--MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE\n\n                  Subtitle A--Medical Liability Reform\n\n     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patients First Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the current health \n     care liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism \n     for resolving claims of health care liability and \n     compensating injured patients, and is a deterrent to the \n     sharing of information among health care professionals which \n     impedes efforts to improve patient safety and quality of \n     care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals;\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 103. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.\n\n       The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit \n     shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or \n     1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of \n     reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, \n     whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for \n     commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after \n     the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of \n     the following:\n       (1) Upon proof of fraud;\n       (2) Intentional concealment; or\n       (3) The presence of a foreign body, which has no \n     therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of \n     the injured person.\n\n     Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the \n     date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that \n     actions by a minor under the full age of 6 years shall be \n     commenced within 3 years of manifestation of injury or prior \n     to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever provides a longer \n     period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for \n     any period during which a parent or guardian and a health \n     care provider or health care organization have committed \n     fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on \n     behalf of the injured minor.\n\n     SEC. 104. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, the \n     full amount of a claimant's economic loss may be fully \n     recovered without limitation.\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care \n     lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered may be \n     as much as $250,000, regardless of the number of parties \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit, an award for future noneconomic damages \n     shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not \n     be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. \n     An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall \n     be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by \n     amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such \n     reduction shall be made before accounting for any other \n     reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards are \n     rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the \n     combined awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic \n     damages shall be reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility. A separate judgment shall be \n     rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to \n     such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact \n     shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each \n     party for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 105. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to \n     Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall \n     supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect \n     against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of \n     reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid \n     to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in \n     which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in \n     the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall \n     have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage \n     recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to \n     the claimant based upon the interests of justice and \n     principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all \n     contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health \n     care lawsuit exceed the following limits:\n       (1) 40 percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (2) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (3) 25 percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the \n     claimant(s).\n       (4) 15 percent of any amount by which the recovery by the \n     claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.\n       (b) Applicability.--The limitations in subsection (a) shall \n     apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, \n     mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative \n     dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a \n     minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to \n     authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum \n     permitted under this section.\n       (c) Expert Witnesses.--\n       (1) Requirement.--No individual shall be qualified to \n     testify as an expert witness concerning issues of negligence \n     in any health care lawsuit against a defendant unless such \n     individual--\n       (A) except as required under paragraph (2), is a health \n     care professional who--\n       (i) is appropriately credentialed or licensed in 1 or more \n     States to deliver health care services; and\n       (ii) typically treats the diagnosis or condition or \n     provides the type of treatment under review; and\n       (B) can demonstrate by competent evidence that, as a result \n     of training, education, knowledge, and experience in the \n     evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease or injury \n     which is the subject matter of the lawsuit against the \n     defendant, the individual was substantially familiar with \n     applicable standards of care and practice as they relate to \n     the act or omission which is the subject of the lawsuit on \n     the date of the incident.\n       (2) Physician review.--In a health care lawsuit, if the \n     claim of the plaintiff involved treatment that is recommended \n     or provided by a physician (allopathic or osteopathic), an \n     individual shall not be qualified to be an expert witness \n     under this subsection with respect to issues of negligence \n     concerning such treatment unless such individual is a \n     physician.\n       (3) Specialties and subspecialties.--With respect to a \n     lawsuit described in paragraph (1), a court shall not permit \n     an expert in one medical specialty or subspecialty to testify \n     against a defendant in another medical specialty or \n     subspecialty unless, in addition to a showing of substantial \n     familiarity in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), there is a \n     showing that the standards of care and practice in the two \n     specialty or subspecialty fields are similar.\n       (4) Limitation.--The limitations in this subsection shall \n     not apply to expert witnesses testifying as to the degree or \n     permanency of medical or physical impairment.\n\n     SEC. 106. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The amount of any damages received by a \n     claimant in any health care lawsuit shall be reduced by the \n     court by the amount of any collateral source benefits to \n     which the claimant is entitled, less any insurance premiums \n     or other payments made by the claimant (or by the spouse, \n     parent, child, or legal guardian of the claimant) to obtain \n     or secure such benefits.\n       (b) Preservation of Current Law.--Where a payor of \n     collateral source benefits has a right of recovery by \n     reimbursement or subrogation and such right is permitted \n     under Federal or State law, subsection (a) shall not apply.\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\n       (c) Application of Provision.--This section shall apply to \n     any health care lawsuit that is settled or resolved by a fact \n     finder.\n\n     SEC. 107. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise \n     permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded \n     against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is \n     proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person \n     acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that \n     such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury \n     that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain \n     to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for \n     compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no \n     punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in \n     such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be \n     included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court \n     may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive \n     damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a \n     finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing \n     affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, \n     that the claimant has established by a substantial \n     probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for \n     punitive damages.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Patient Safety and \n     Quality Improvement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 142. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report \n     entitled To Err is Human that described medical errors as the \n     eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as \n     many as 98,000 people dying as a result of medical errors \n     each year.\n       (2) To address these deaths and injuries due to medical \n     errors, the health care system must identify and learn from \n     such errors so that systems of care can be improved.\n       (3) In their report, the Institute of Medicine called on \n     Congress to provide legal protections with respect to \n     information reported for the purposes of quality improvement \n     and patient safety.\n       (4) The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of \n     the Senate held 4 hearings in the 106th Congress and 1 \n     hearing in the 107th Congress on patient safety where experts \n     in the field supported the recommendation of the Institute of \n     Medicine for congressional action.\n       (5) Myriad public and private patient safety initiatives \n     have begun. The Quality Interagency Coordination Taskforce \n     has recommended steps to improve patient safety that may be \n     taken by each Federal agency involved in health care and \n     activities relating to these steps are ongoing.\n       (6) The research on patient safety unequivocally calls for \n     a learning environment, rather than a punitive environment, \n     in order to improve patient safety.\n       (7) Voluntary data gathering systems are more supportive \n     than mandatory systems in creating the learning environment \n     referred to in paragraph (6) as stated in the Institute of \n     Medicine's report.\n       (8) Promising patient safety reporting systems have been \n     established throughout the United States and the best ways to \n     structure and use these systems are currently being \n     determined, largely through projects funded by the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality.\n       (9) Many organizations currently collecting patient safety \n     data have expressed a need for legal protections that will \n     allow them to review protected information and collaborate in \n     the development and implementation of patient safety \n     improvement strategies.

United States;\n       Whereas on February 22, 1797, President Washington \n     personally conferred upon Captain John Barry, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, the rank of Captain, with \n     ``Commission No. 1'', United States Navy, dated June 7, 1794;\n       Whereas John Barry served as the senior officer of the \n     United States Navy, with the title of ``Commodore'' (in \n     official correspondence), under Presidents Washington, John \n     Adams, and Jefferson;\n       Whereas as commander of the first United States naval \n     squadron under the Constitution of the United States, which \n     included the U.S.S.

Res. 211\n\n       Whereas an estimated 1 in 20 children suffers from the \n     developmental disorder dyspraxia;\n       Whereas 70 percent of those affected by dyspraxia are male;\n       Whereas dyspraxics may be of average or above average \n     intelligence but are often behaviorally immature;\n       Whereas symptoms of dyspraxia consist of clumsiness, poor \n     body awareness, reading and writing difficulties, speech \n     problems, and learning disabilities, though not all of these \n     will apply to every dyspraxic;\n       Whereas there is no cure for dyspraxia, but the earlier a \n     child is treated the greater the chance of developmental \n     maturation;\n       Whereas dyspraxics may be shunned within their own peer \n     group because they do not fit in;\n       Whereas most dyspraxic children are dismissed as ``slow'' \n     or ``clumsy'' and are therefore not properly diagnosed;\n       Whereas more than 50 percent of educators have never heard \n     of dyspraxia;\n       Whereas education and information about dyspraxia are \n     important to detection and treatment; and\n       Whereas the Senate as an institution, and Members of the \n     Senate as individuals, are in unique positions to help raise \n     the public awareness about dyspraxia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate designates August 19, 2005, as ``National \n     Dyspraxia Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) all Americans should be more informed of dyspraxia, its \n     easily recognizable symptoms, and its proper treatment;\n       (B) the Secretary of Education should establish and promote \n     a campaign in elementary and secondary schools across the \n     Nation to encourage the social acceptance of dyspraxic \n     children; and\n       (C) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (i) endeavor to raise awareness about dyspraxia;\n       (ii) consider ways to increase the knowledge of possible \n     therapy and access to health care services for people with \n     dyspraxia; and\n       (iii) endeavor to inform educators on how to recognize \n     dyspraxic symptoms and to appropriately handle this disorder.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to say just a few words on \nthe resolution I have submitted concerning dyspraxia, a developmental \ndisorder that affects 1 in 20 American children each year. My intent is \nto increase the public's awareness of this disability and to encourage \neach of my colleagues to do the same.\n  Let me share a few facts with you. Dyspraxia is caused by the \nmalformation of the neurons of the brain, resulting in the inability of \none's senses to respond efficiently to outside stimuli. It may manifest \nitself in various areas, such as movement, language, perception, and \nthought, causing difficulty in both work and play. One in twenty \nchildren suffers from this disorder. Seventy percent of those affected \nare male, and in children suffering from extreme emotional and \nbehavioral difficulties, the incidence is likely to be more than 50 \npercent. Dyspraxic children fail to achieve the expected levels of \ndevelopment. Due to difficulties, these kids are often shunned from \ntheir peer groups because they do not fit in. There is no cure for \ndyspraxia, but the earlier a child is diagnosed the greater the chance \nof developmental maturation. However, many times these children are \ndismissed as ``clumsy'' and ``slow'' and are never given a chance to \nimprove, finding it hard to succeed under such harsh speculations. The \npublic's unawareness of dyspraxia is the chief reason that children and \nyoung adults go undiagnosed, unable to recognize a cause for their \nstruggles. More than 50 percent of our educators are unaware that this \ndisability even exists. With such alarming statistics, the number of \nchildren recognized cannot be expected to increase.\n  One of my former interns has a younger brother that suffers from this \ndisorder. Borden Wilson is actually a success story. At age 4, Borden's \nparents noted that he was not able to perform tasks appropriate for his \nage. His\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\nspeaking ability was limited, even with encouragement. After going \nthrough a battery of tests performed by various specialists, the \nproblem was identified as dyspraxia. While working with speech and \noccupational therapists, Borden's parents became familiar with \ntechniques geared to improve his motor capabilities. Though \nadvancements were seen, Borden still lagged behind his peers and low \nself-esteem soon set in. Borden is 17 years old now and through the \nhard work of teachers, therapists, and family, he has overcome many of \nhis problems and is successful in both school and extracurricular \nactivities. I am pleased to announce that Borden now maintains a 4.5 \ngrade point average, has received his school's Scholar Athlete Award \nfor the last 2 years, and placed in the 97th percentile on his \nCalifornia Achievement Test. Additionally, he has received All-District \nhonors in both football and track.\n  Borden's superior achievements should serve as our inspiration to \npromote awareness of dyspraxia. With proper diagnosis and treatment, \nall of these children can experience the same level of success that \nBorden has been able to achieve. I hope that my colleagues will come \ntogether in support of this important legislation to raise \nconsciousness of this disability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8987-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 212--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE PUBLICATION OF THE \n   VIDEO GAME ``GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS'' TO DETERMINE IF THE \nPUBLISHER DECEIVED THE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE RATINGS BOARD TO AVOID AN \n                         ``ADULTS ONLY'' RATING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Res. 47\n\n       Whereas the Africa-America Institute (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``AAI'') was founded in 1953, to help \n     build human and institutional capacity in Africa and to \n     promote mutually beneficial relations between the United \n     States and Africa through education;\n       Whereas 2 of the most prominent founders of AAI were \n     leading African-American educators and intellectuals, Horace \n     Mann Bond, the first Black president of Lincoln University, \n     and Leo Hansberry, the Howard University scholar and \n     historian renowned today as the ``father of African \n     studies'';\n       Whereas with funding from the government, the private \n     sector, and philanthropic sources, AAI has advanced its \n     mission on the dual premises that higher education is the \n     highest leveraging point for achieving sustainable gains all \n     along the education pipeline, and that investments in \n     education generate high rates of return by multiplying the \n     impact of development achievements across sectors of global \n     importance, such as health, education, trade, investment, \n     peace, and security;\n       Whereas the 22,000 education program alumni of AAI come \n     from 52 African countries, including extraordinary \n     individuals such as Wangari Maathai, recipient of the 2004 \n     Nobel Peace Prize;\n       Whereas alumni of AAI are leaders in African education, \n     business, government, and nongovernmental organizations \n     working to change economic and social structures in African \n     communities, societies, and nations for the better;\n       Whereas a 2004 impact assessment commissioned by the United \n     States Agency for International Development (in this \n     resolution referred to as ``USAID'') found ``USAID's multi-\n     million dollar investment in long-term training'' programs \n     that were managed and run by AAI ``for over 40 years produced \n     significant and sustained changes that furthered African \n     development in measurable ways'';\n       Whereas, as a corollary to its work aimed at expanding \n     educational opportunities for Africans, AAI has also served \n     as a source of reliable and balanced information on Africa \n     for American public and private sector leaders;\n       Whereas Members of Congress and their staff are among those \n     who have helped achieve and continue to build on this legacy, \n     fulfilling the education mission of AAI by working with \n     partners in Africa, the United States, and other parts of the \n     world on behalf of Africa;\n       Whereas competing in the information age requires high \n     levels of technical knowledge and skills, but the level of \n     need and demand for higher education and technical training \n     in Africa exceeds the capacities of education sectors in most \n     African countries;\n       Whereas, consistent with the aspirations and goals of the \n     African Union's ``New Partnership for Africa's Development'', \n     AAI has stepped up to meet these new challenges with the \n     creation of the ``African Technology for Education and \n     Workforce Development'' initiative (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``AFTECH''), a collaborative effort designed \n     to harness the power of information technologies to deliver \n     the highest quality global educational content to Africans \n     where they live;\n       Whereas, in order to improve and expand upon the reach and \n     impact of AFTECH, and to raise awareness in the United States \n     of the converging global interests that warrant greater \n     United States public and private engagement with, and \n     investment in Africa, AAI used the occasion of its 50th \n     anniversary in 2003, to launch the AAI ``Education \n     Partnership Campaign: 50,000 New Leaders in\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\n     Five Years'', with a goal of raising $25,000,000 in private \n     and public sector support to educate and train 50,000 \n     Africans during the 5-year campaign;\n       Whereas, with the Republic of Namibia in the vanguard, a \n     growing number of African nations are choosing to invest in \n     their people by directly supporting the advanced education, \n     professional training programs, and other education resources \n     that AAI has to offer;\n       Whereas AAI works with sponsoring African governments to \n     identify and leverage additional funding wherever feasible, \n     and assists countries with making the case to multinational \n     companies doing business within their borders that investing \n     in the human capital of African countries through education \n     is in their mutual interest; and\n       Whereas AAI can boast of a remarkable history and \n     unparalleled program track record, and is building on its \n     past to meet current and future challenges facing Africa as \n     well as the United States: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) pays tribute to the Africa-American Institute for its \n     more than 50 years of dedicated service, nurturing and \n     unleashing the productive capacities of knowledgeable, \n     capable, and effective African leaders through education;\n       (2) embraces the mission and supports the work of AAI; and\n       (3) urges Members of Congress and others to join the AAI \n     ``Education Partnership Campaign: 50,000 New Leaders in Five \n     Years'', a major initiative toward achieving closer United \n     States-Africa relations that advance mutual national and \n     global interests and a high yield investment in Africa's \n     capacity to build a future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S8988-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1580.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Bleeding Kansas \n     National Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 262. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area is a \n     cohesive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, and \n     recreational resources that--\n       (A) together represent distinctive aspects of American \n     heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, \n     and continuing use;\n       (B) are best managed through partnerships between private \n     and public entities; and\n       (C) will build upon the Kansas rural development policy and \n     the new homestead act to recognize inherent strengths of \n     small towns and rural communities--close-knit communities, \n     strong local business networks, and a tradition of \n     entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (2) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area reflects \n     traditions, customs, beliefs, folk life, or some combination \n     thereof, that are a valuable part of the heritage of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, cultural, or \n     historic features, or some combination thereof.\n       (4) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area provides \n     outstanding recreational and interpretive opportunities.\n       (5) The Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area has an \n     identifiable theme, and resources important to the theme \n     retain integrity capable of supporting interpretation.\n       (6) Residents, nonprofit organizations, other private \n     entities, and units of local government throughout the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area demonstrate support \n     for designation of the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area \n     as a national heritage area and for management of the \n     Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area as appropriate for \n     such designation.\n       (7) Capturing these interconnected stories through \n     partnerships with National Park Service sites, Kansas State \n     Historical Society sites, local organizations, and citizens \n     will augment the story opportunities within the prospective \n     boundary for the educational and recreational benefit of this \n     and future generations of Americans.\n       (8) Communities throughout this region know the value of \n     their Bleeding Kansas legacy, but require expansion of the \n     existing cooperative framework to achieve key preservation, \n     education, and other significant goals by working more \n     closely together.\n       (9) The State of Kansas officially recognized the national \n     significance of the Bleeding Kansas story when it designated \n     the heritage area development as a significant strategic goal \n     within the statewide economic development plan.\n       (10) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance is a nonprofit \n     corporation created for the purposes of preserving, \n     interpreting, developing, promoting and, making available to \n     the public the story and resources related to the story of \n     Bleeding Kansas and the Enduring Struggle for Freedom.\n       (11) Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance has completed a \n     study that--\n       (A) describes in detail the role, operation, financing, and \n     functions of Territorial Kansas Heritage Alliance, the local \n     coordinating entity; and\n       (B) provides adequate assurances that Territorial Kansas \n     Heritage Alliance, the local coordinating entity, is likely \n     to have the financial resources necessary to implement the \n     management plan for the Heritage Area, including resources to \n     meet matching requirement for grants.\n       (12) There are at least 7 National Historic Landmarks, 32 \n     National Register properties, 3 Kansas Register properties, \n     and 7 properties listed on the National Underground Railroad \n     Network to Freedom that contribute to the Heritage Area as \n     well as other significant properties that have not been \n     designated at this time.\n       (13) There is an interest in interpreting all sides of the \n     Bleeding Kansas story that requires further work with several \n     counties in Missouri interested in joining the area.\n       (14) In 2004, the State of Kansas commemorated the \n     Sesquicentennial of the signing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, \n     opening the territory to settlement.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are as \n     follows:\n       (1) To designate a region in eastern Kansas and western \n     Missouri containing nationally important natural, historic, \n     and cultural resources and recreational and educational \n     opportunities that are geographically assembled and \n     thematically related as areas that provide unique frameworks \n     for understanding the great and diverse character of the \n     United States and the development of communities and their \n     surroundings as the Bleeding Kansas National Heritage Area.\n       (2) To strengthen, complement, and support the Fort Scott, \n     Brown v. Board of Education, Nicodemus and Tallgrass Prairie \n     sites through the interpretation and conservation of the \n     associated living landscapes outside of the boundaries of \n     these units of the National Park System.\n       (3) To describe the extent of Federal responsibilities and \n     duties in regard to the Heritage Area.\n       (4) To further collaboration and partnerships among \n     Federal, State, and local governments, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the private sector, or combinations \n     thereof, to conserve and manage the resources and \n     opportunities in the Heritage Area through grants, technical \n     assistance, training and other means.\n       (5) To authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n     to the local coordinating entity to assist in the \n     conservation and interpretation of the Heritage Area.\n       (6) To empower communities and organizations in Kansas to \n     preserve the special historic identity of Bleeding Kansas and \n     with it the identity of the Nation.\n       (7) To provide for the management, preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the natural, historical, \n     and cultural resources within the region for the educational \n     and inspirational benefit of current and future generations.\n       (8) To provide greater community capacity through inter-\n     local cooperation.\n       (9) To provide a vehicle, particularly in the four counties \n     with high out-migration of population, to recognize that \n     self-reliance and resilience will be the keys to their \n     economic future.\n       (10) To build upon the Kansas rural development policy, the \n     Kansas agritourism initiative and the new homestead act to \n     recognize inherent strengths of small towns and rural \n     communities--close-knit communities, strong local business \n     networks, and a tradition of entrepreneurial creativity.\n       (11) To educate and cultivate among its citizens, \n     particularly its youth, the stories and cultural resources of \n     the region's legacy that--\n       (A) reflect the popular phrase ``Bleeding Kansas'' \n     describing the conflict over slavery that became nationally \n     prominent in Kansas just before and during the American Civil \n     War;\n       (B) reflect the commitment of American settlers who first \n     fought and killed to uphold their different and \n     irreconcilable principles of freedom and equality during the \n     years of the Kansas Conflict;\n       (C) reflect the struggle for freedom, experienced during \n     the ``Bleeding Kansas'' era, that continues to be a vital and \n     pressing issue associated with the real problem of democratic \n     nation building; and\n       (D) recreate the physical environment revealing its impact \n     on agriculture, transportation, trade and business, and \n     social and cultural patterns in urban and rural settings.\n       (12) To interpret the effect of the era's democratic ethos \n     on the development of America's distinctive political \n     culture.\n\n     SEC. 263.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during \n     the American Revolution because of the strategic location of \n     the State between the British armies headquartered in New \n     York City, New York, and the Continental Congress in the city \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n       (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n     period of the American Revolution personally commanding \n     troops of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, \n     including 2 severe winters spent in encampments in the area \n     that is now Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of \n     the National Park System;\n       (3) it was during the 10 crucial days of the American \n     Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, \n     that General Washington, after retreating across the State of \n     New Jersey from the State of New York to the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the \n     Delaware River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on \n     to win crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State \n     of New Jersey;\n       (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the \n     retreat, described the events during those days as ``the \n     times that try men's souls'';\n       (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in \n     the State of New Jersey, including--\n       (A) several important battles of the American Revolution \n     that were significant to--\n       (i) the outcome of the American Revolution;

and\n       (B) offer outstanding opportunities for conservation, \n     education, and recreation;\n       (8) the National Register of Historic Places lists 251 \n     buildings and sites in the National Park Service study area \n     for the Crossroads of the American Revolution that are \n     associated with the period of the American Revolution;\n       (9) civilian populations residing in the State of New \n     Jersey during the American Revolution suffered extreme \n     hardships because of--\n       (A) the continuous conflict in the State;\n       (B) foraging armies; and\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n       (C) marauding contingents of loyalist Tories and rebel \n     sympathizers;\n       (10) because of the important role that the State of New \n     Jersey played in the successful outcome of the American \n     Revolution, there is a Federal interest in developing a \n     regional framework to assist the State of New Jersey, local \n     governments and organizations, and private citizens in--\n       (A) preserving and protecting cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the period;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Western Reserve \n     Heritage Areas Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 302. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING THE WESTERN \n                   RESERVE, OHIO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The area that encompasses the modern-day counties of \n     Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, \n     Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and \n     Ashland in Ohio with the rich history in what was once the \n     Western Reserve, has made a unique contribution to the \n     cultural, political, and industrial development of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The Western Reserve is distinctive as the land settled \n     by the people of Connecticut after the Revolutionary War. The \n     Western Reserve holds a unique mark as the original \n     wilderness land of the West that many settlers migrated to in \n     order to begin life outside of the original 13 colonies.\n       (3) The Western Reserve played a significant role in \n     providing land to the people of Connecticut whose property \n     and land was destroyed during the Revolution. These settlers \n     were descendants of the brave immigrants who came to the \n     Americas in the 17th century.\n       (4) The Western Reserve offered a new destination for those \n     who moved west in search of land and prosperity.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed S. \n161, the Northern Arizona Land Exchange and Verde River Basin \nPartnership Act of 2005. It is my hope that this bill will be \nconsidered quickly by the House of Representatives and sent to the \nPresident for his signature in the near future.\n  I want to thank Senator Kyl and his staff for their work in helping \nto develop this compromise legislation. I also want to thank Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman, and their staffs on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, for their efforts in reaching an agreement \non this legislation during the last Congress and helping to move it \nthrough the legislative process. In addition, I want to recognize the \nwork of Congressmen Renzi and Hayworth who have championed this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  Late last year, after several years of negotiation and compromise, \nthe Senate passed by unanimous consent a nearly identical measure. This \nbill provides a sound framework for a fair and equal value exchange of \n50,000 acres of private and public land in Northern Arizona. It also \naddresses water issues associated with the exchange of lands located \nwithin the Verde River Basin watershed by limiting water usage on \ncertain exchanged lands and by supporting the development of a \ncollaborative science-based water resource planning and management \nentity for the Verde River Basin watershed.\n  The Arizona delegation and a broad array of local area officials are \nstrongly supportive of the legislation because it will offer \nsignificant benefits for all parties. Benefits will accrue to the U.S. \nForest Service and the public with the consolidation of checkerboard \nlands and the protection and enhanced management of extensive forest \nand grasslands. The communities of Flagstaff, Williams, and Camp Verde \nalso will benefit in terms of economic development opportunities, water \nsupply, and other important purposes.\n  While facilitating the exchange of public and private lands is a very \nimportant objective of this legislation, and indeed, was the original \npurpose when we began working on it several years ago, the provisions \nconcerning water management are perhaps even more important. Since \nintroducing the original legislation over 2 years ago, I have heard \nfrom hundreds of Arizonans and learned first-hand of the significant \nwater issues raised by the transfer of Federal land into private \nownership. We have modified the bill to take into account many of the \nconcerns raised during meetings held throughout northern Arizona, \nincluding removing certain lands entirely from the exchange.\n  There is growing recognition of the need to develop and promote the \nwise management of Arizona's limited water supplies, particularly with \nthe extended drought coupled with rapid population growth. As such, the \nbill passed by the Senate would not only limit water usage on the \nexchanged lands, but also provide an opportunity to encourage sound \nwater management in northern Arizona through the creation of a \ncollaborative, science-based decision-making body to advance essential \nplanning and management at the State and local level in Northern \nArizona.\n  To be successful, this effort will require the involvement of all the \nstakeholders with water supply responsibilities and interests. It will \nalso require a solid foundation of knowledge about available resources \nand existing demands. We are fortunate to have an existing model of \ncollaborative science-based water resource planning and management with \nthe Upper San Pedro Partnership in the Sierra Vista subwatershed of \nArizona. In my view, the establishment of a similar, cooperative body \nin the Verde Basin will be a vital step in assuring the wise use of our \nlimited water resources.\n  Again, I want to thank all of the parties involved with this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/26/senate-section/article/S9052-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING A PORTION OF THE WHITE SALMON RIVER AS A COMPONENT OF THE \n                 NATIONAL WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS SYSTEM\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n FURTHERING THE PURPOSES OF THE SAND CREEK MASSACRE NATIONAL HISTORIC \n                     SITE ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nDIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE TO CONVEY CERTAIN LAND TO LANDER \n  COUNTY, NEVADA, AND THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO CONVEY CERTAIN \n     LAND TO EUREKA COUNTY, NEVADA, FOR CONTINUED USE AS CEMETERIES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.
