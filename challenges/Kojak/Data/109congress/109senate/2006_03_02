Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment on an \nimportant provision on methamphetamine that is in the PATRIOT Act but \nnot a lot of attention has been focused on it over the last several \ndays, a very important provision.\n  At 3 o'clock today the Senate will vote on passage of the PATRIOT Act \nconference report, and after a lot of months of debate we will finally \ndeliver a PATRIOT Act that is stronger and tougher and more effective \nagainst terrorists on American soil, while at the same time protecting \nour civil liberties.\n  It has not been easy. It has taken a long time. But now we are on the \nverge of a tremendous success with the passage of a very important bill \nthat will benefit the American people.\n  The Combat Meth Act is legislation Senator Talent introduced last \nyear, and I and many of our colleagues are a cosponsor of that \nlegislation. Senator Talent's leadership has been instrumental in \npushing this bill forward, and it is something of which we can all be \nvery proud.\n  I have worked with the House leadership to encourage Members to get \nthis done because meth is a crisis that has been building in all of our \nStates. It is highly addictive, cheap, and easily available.\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n  In the last 10 years meth has become America's worst drug problem. I \nsay that, even putting it before marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, in \nthat the use of it has increased so significantly and it is so terribly \naddictive.\n  Last year Tennessee ranked No. 2, tied with Iowa and just behind \nMissouri, in the number of meth lab seizures. Through tougher laws and \ntougher enforcement over the last year and a half Tennessee is starting \nto see a turnaround, and that is one of the reasons I am so convinced \nthis legislation will have a dramatic impact in a short period of time.\n\n  It was in March of last year that Tennessee signed its Meth Free \nTennessee Act, a much needed law that required retailers to take cold \nmedicines and sinus medicines containing pseudoephedrine off the \nshelves and put them behind the counter where they can be closely \nmonitored. As a result of this powerful new approach, lab seizures have \ndeclined dramatically, down 40 percent in May and another 60 percent in \nJune.\n  In addition, district attorneys across the State have told me of the \ntremendous impact it has made and they joined Governor Bresden in \nlaunching the Meth Destroys campaign. Through videos and brochures and \nbulletin boards and other means of public relations, the Meth Destroys \ncampaign is reaching out to schools, to church groups, to parents, to \ncivic organizations, to educate the public on the grave dangers of this \nhighly addictive drug, methamphetamine.\n  Now with the imminent passage of the Combat Meth Act here in the \nSenate today at 3 o'clock, everyone's job is going to get a whole lot \neasier.\n  We learned that when one State restricted access to the precursors, \nmeth cooks simply crossed over to the adjoining State, bought their \ningredients and brought them back. Law enforcement told us again and \nagain that they needed uniform law to be able to cut off this access to \nand purchase of these ingredients.\n  Senator Talent and Senator Feinstein introduced the Combat Meth Act \nto restrict access to cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine and \nephedrine across all 50 States. Under the Combat Meth Act, meth users \nwill no longer be able to jump from State to State, cruise from State \nto State in order to buy these ingredients.\n  Once again I thank Senator Talent and Senator Feinstein for pushing \nhard to get this done. It will have a direct impact in a short period \nof time. Lives will be saved, communities will be better protected \nbecause of their commitment. I urge all of our colleagues to vote for \nthe PATRIOT Act, which includes the Combat Meth Act, this afternoon. It \napplies directly to the well-being and safety of our neighbors and \nfellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1594-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on December 29 of last year I received a \nletter from the Secretary of the Treasury, John Snow, asking that \nCongress increase the Federal deficit. This is extremely important, \nobviously; that is, whether we should and the degree to which we should \nincrease the Federal debt limit. But we don't have any scheduled debate \non this and I don't think, frankly, the leadership wants to schedule \ndebate on whether we should and the degree to which we should increase \nthe Federal debt. I think the reason is pretty clear. It is because it \nis embarrassing. It is an embarrassment that our Federal debt is \ngrowing so much and at a rapid rate.\n  I say that in part because the Secretary says the United States will \nhit the limit in the middle of this month. That is not too many days \naway. I hope very much this body exercises its responsibility to do \nwhat it should do and let's have a discussion on our fiscal situation: \nHow great is the debt? What should be done about it? How big is the \ndeficit and what should be done about that? Where are we? Where are we \nheaded? What are the implications?\n  These are very real questions that affect the financial security of \nthe United States and which affect very greatly individual Americans. I \nvery much hope we have that debate of the points I think we should \nconsider. It is our responsibility to address the implications of our \nhuge Federal debt and deficits. We have a responsibility to do that. \nThat is our job. It is much more our job to address that than it is \nsome other things I think we do here in the Senate, and I am going to \ndo what I can to urge my colleagues and urge, frankly, anybody \nlistening and watching to begin to think about what is going on here \nbecause this is critical.\n  Let's review some of the facts about the debt limit. Currently, our \nTreasury, the U.S. Treasury, is authorized to issue debt totaling over \n$8 trillion. That is the current statute. Last year's budget resolution \nproposed an increase in that authorization of $781 billion. That is an \nincrease. That would be the fourth largest debt limit increase in the \nNation's history.\n  If I might briefly indicate in a graphic way literally what that \nmeans. This basically is a chart showing the amount of Federal debt \nlimit increases the Congress has enacted over various years going back \nnot too long ago--1986 up to the present.\n  The red bars here indicate the amount of the debt increase Congress \nhas enacted because our Federal debt was going up so quickly. You can \nsee there was a big increase back in 1990. That was the time when, \nfrankly, our country was under a little bit of pressure and the debt \nwas going up. Between 2000, 2001, we did not have any debt increases. \nBut what has happened lately?\n  You can see all these huge increases in the last 4 years. In 2002, \nthe Congress increased the national debt by $450 billion.\n  Here is a whopper. In 2003, Congress increased the Federal debt by \nclose to $1 trillion. The next year it increased the Federal debt by \n$800 billion, four-fifths of a trillion dollars in 1 year. Last year it \ndid not have to increase the debt because the $800 billion carried us \nover through 2005, but here again we have to increase the Federal debt \nby $781 billion.\n  The debate point is that in the last years there have been big \nincreases in the Federal debt. Why? Because we have been borrowing so \nmuch in this country, Congress has authorized and the President has \nproposed very large expenses.\n  More striking, though, is that total increase has occurred since the \nyear 2002.\n  During this administration, America's debt, the total deficit, has \nincreased by $3 trillion. You can imagine. Since 2002, if you add up \nall the increases in the Federal debt, our Federal debt has increased \nby $3 trillion. That is not the level now; it is close to $9 trillion \nif it is increased further. But this is the increase--and those \nincreases have occurred only in the last 4 years. That is a 40-percent \nincrease in the entire Federal debt accrued by our\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\ncountry in its entire history. Forty percent of the increase in the \nFederal debt has occurred in the last 4 years.\n  Who is lending the Federal Government these funds? Ask yourself that \nquestion. That is a lot of debt out there. Some of it is internal. The \nU.S. Government borrows from Social Security, and we all know that \npretty soon those chickens are going to come home to roost. We can't do \nthat much longer. We will have to start paying back all that is due to \nSocial Security--and that is an awful lot. Much of the borrowing is \nfrom American citizens and businesses.\n  But what is more alarming is the trend where much more of the debt is \nheld by foreigners and central banks in foreign countries; that is, the \namount of debt held by foreign governments is much worse. Five years \nago foreigners held about $1 trillion of our Federal debt.\n  What is that number today? It is double. In over 5 years the amount \nhas doubled. The number held by foreigners has now doubled to $2.2 \ntrillion.\n  Today, Japan holds two-thirds of a trillion dollars of our foreign \ndebt. China holds a quarter of a trillion dollars. China's reserve is \nscheduled to be about $1 trillion by the end of this year.\n  The rate of increase in Federal debt held by foreigners--simply by \nforeign banks, central banks--is alarming. I tend not to be an \nalarmist. In fact, sometimes people say: Max, you are kind of easy \ngoing, you don't get too upset, and so on. But I am quite concerned \nabout these trends. They are worse.\n  I might also add that the debt held by foreigners after World War II \nwas extremely high, too. It was. But the composition of that debt--\ninvestments held by foreigners--was just that: investment in \ninfrastructure in the United States and capital assets; that is, \ninvestments foreigners made in the United States after World War II. \nThe composition was not much debt. It is securities to finance the \nborrowing by Uncle Sam, and we have to pay back the interest on that \nborrowing.\n  The question is, How long can we continue to borrow all of that \nmoney? That is the basic question.\n  What are the implications to our foreign policy as foreigners \nincrease their holdings of U.S. debt? What does that mean? What might \nhappen?\n  Try to be wholly analytical about this. What does that mean? What \npercentage of the American taxes are being used to pay interest on that \ndebt? How much are American taxpayers paying to foreigners directly \nthrough interest on the national debt?\n  I think that should be debated. That is something I think is quite \nconcerning, particularly with the large numbers.\n  These are just some of the issues I think we should debate. We also \nshould remember--this is not rocket science--that ordinarily there are \nlimits on debt. Ordinarily, credit card companies or businesses or \nbanks just do not automatically increase debt, which is happening in \nthis country in the last 4 years as I showed in that chart. It has been \nautomatic. We have increased the debt.\n  Think a little bit about the limits an institution holds on a family \nand what the family wants to borrow. What about a credit card and a \nmaximum balance. Most Americans have credit cards. Most Americans know \nthere is a maximum balance on that credit card. You can only borrow so \nmuch. After a certain limit, you can't borrow any more. That is it.\n  Wouldn't it be great if each individual could say: We are going to \nask the credit card company to increase the debt, and do it as the \nCongress is doing right now. We will just increase the debt limit. A \nperson can't ask a bank willy-nilly to increase the maximum allowance \non a credit card. There is a good reason for that. There have to be \nlimits. We have to live within our means.\n  Take an ordinary business, a bank loan to a business. The bank pays a \nlot of attention to how that business is being run, whether it is being \nrun well. It pays a lot of attention.\n  One could ask: Is the Treasury or foreigners or someone who holds the \ndebt asking how well we are running our business?\n  I urge the majority leader to schedule time to hold a thorough debate \non this issue.\n  This is real. This is really real. We all know this cannot continue. \nWe really do not know at what point, if we continue to increase the \ndebt, there might be some cataclysmic event. We just don't know that. \nBut we do know that with every debt limit increase we are accelerating \nthe time when something nasty or bad might happen economically.\n  Already, some countries are starting to move out of dollars into \nother currencies. China is on the margin of looking at holding \ncurrencies other than the dollar. Many countries worldwide are becoming \nmore self-sufficient. They don't need the United States as much now as \nthey once did. They are becoming more independent. They are going more \nin their own direction. They are doing what they think makes sense for \nthem economically.\n  Clearly, the bottom line is we have to live within our means. Every \ntime we increase the debt limit we are not within our means.\n  I urge us to have a debate so we can know what we really should be \ndoing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1595-S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DEBT AND TAXES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the New York Times, in its Monday edition \neditorial, said:\n\n       There's nothing Congressional Republicans would like more \n     than to escape the inescapable need to raise the Nation's \n     debt limit. The upcoming increase, from $8.18 trillion to \n     nearly $9 trillion, will be the fourth major hike in the last \n     5 years.\n\n  The editorial went on to say:\n\n       It will come as no surprise if Senate leaders squelch \n     debate on the debt limit until Congress is ready to begin its \n     next week-long recess on March 17. Then, up against the \n     Treasury's default deadline, the increase would be put to a \n     voice vote so that no individual would have to go on record \n     as approving the measure--\n\n  Increase in the debt.\n  If anybody thinks that the New York Times is just imagining that \nthere will be an attempt to avoid a debate on this massive increase in \nthe Nation's debt, this is what the chairman of the Finance Committee \nsaid:\n\n       Senator Grassley told Reuters that the goal would be to get \n     the debt limit legislation passed with the least debate.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I would like to see a bill on any Thursday night just prior \n     to a recess.\n\n  Why do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to avoid a \ndiscussion of the Nation's debt? Perhaps it is revealed in this chart \nwhich shows what is happening to the Nation's debt under their \nleadership.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have controlled Washington \npolicymaking since 2001. They have controlled the Senate. They have \ncontrolled the House. They have controlled the White House.\n  Here is their record on debt. At the end of the President's first \nyear, the debt was $5.8 trillion. I think it is fair to leave out the \nfirst year. He is not responsible for the first year.\n  Look at what happened since. The debt has gone up each and every \nyear--and up dramatically. At the end of this year, it is predicted, if \nthe President's budget is adopted, that the debt will have reached $8.6 \ntrillion.\n  Every Member of this body will recall when the President embarked on \nthis fiscal strategy. He told us not only that he would not increase \nthe debt but that he would have maximum paydown of the debt. He said \nhis plan would virtually eliminate the Nation's publicly-held debt.\n  There is no elimination going on here. Instead, the debt has \nexploded. We anticipate that it will be $8.6 trillion at the end of \nthis year, if the President's further 5-year program is adopted. The \ndebt will skyrocket to $12 trillion in 2011, at the worst possible time \nbefore the baby boomers retire.\n  One of the results of their disastrous fiscal strategy is the debt \nheld by foreigners has exploded at an even more alarming rate. It took \n42 Presidents--all the Presidents pictured here--224 years to run up $1 \ntrillion of external debt. This President has more than doubled that \namount in 5 years.\n  This is the legacy of debt that will haunt this country for \ngenerations to come. This is the hard reality. This is a fiscal plan \nand a fiscal strategy that\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nhas failed--failed miserably, and failed by any measure.\n  The Senator from Montana raised a question of who is holding our \ndebt. Here it is: Japan--we now owe them $685 billion. We owe China \nover $250 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over $230 billion. And in \nfourth place--who would have ever believed this--we now owe the so-\ncalled Caribbean banking centers over $100 billion.\n  Now it comes to this year and a further continuation of the \nRepublican plan to load the Nation with debt. I do not know how else \nyou can term it because here is what has happened.\n  By the way, from 1998 to 2001, there was no need to increase the \nNation's debt limit. In fact, we were paying down the Nation's \npublicly-held debt under the administration of President Clinton. But \nin 2002, we had to raise the debt $450 billion; in 2003, we had to \nraise the debt $984 billion; in 1 year, 2004, another $800 billion \nincrease in debt; and now, in 2006, they are seeking to raise the debt \nanother almost $800 billion.\n  You add this up and the debt will have already increased under this \nPresident by $3 trillion. When he came into office it was more than $5 \ntrillion. And we now know, if his next 5-year plan is adopted, he will \nadd another $3 trillion to the debt.\n  This is not a sustainable strategy or plan, and it is time for \nCongress to face up to it. It is time to begin the debate on what we do \nto confront these rapidly growing debts.\n  I hope very much that we will have a chance for a full debate on the \ndebt limit and to consider stringent pay-go legislation, the device \nwhich we have had in the past to provide budget discipline.\n  It simply says: If you want more spending, you have to pay for it. If \nyou want more tax cuts, you have to pay for them. That is a basic \nnotion that we used with great effect in the 1980s and 1990s to reduce \nwhat were then record deficits and debt levels--levels that have been \ngreatly exceeded by the massive runup of debt under this \nadministration. I hope we have that opportunity. The Nation deserves as \nmuch.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1596-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1596-S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some of the \nrecent developments in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  We have a lot of activity today. There is a hearing in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as some dissidents who are in town to talk \nabout the state of affairs in Iran.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Iranian Government's track record \nwith respect to supporting acts of terror inflicted upon innocent \npersons and inflicting damage on peaceful relations among Middle \nEastern countries is abysmal. Iran's bad activities in the Middle East \nand, candidly, bad actions in the world--at the head of the list, from \nmy perspective, is promoting terrorism activities and Islamic fascism \nideology that undergirds that terrorist activity in the Middle East--\nhave secured a designation by the U.S. Department of State as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran supports terrorist organizations such as \nHezbollah, the entity behind the 1983 suicide terrorist attack against \nU.S. military and civilian personnel in Lebanon. Hamas is another \norganization that they are now supporting, the Palestinian Islamic \nJihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \nCommand. All of these are reprehensible organizations that the Iranian \nGovernment is directly sponsoring as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Additionally, Iran has been implicated in the 1996 attack on U.S. \nmilitary personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia.\n  Iran's reach into Iraq, which many of us have been complaining about \nfor a couple of years and which is now being recognized by our \nGovernment, by our Department of State, and which is now being \nrecognized by the world--Iran is one of the fomenters of terrorism \nwithin the country of Iraq. Iran's connection to the Supreme Council \nfor the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the organization's Badr Brigades \nmeans that Iran has a hand in shaping the allegiances of both Iraq's \npolice and military forces.\n\n  Iran's human rights violations, in addition to their terrorist \nactivities, are no less chilling. The State Department reported that \nthe Government of Iran engages in widespread use of torture and other \ndegrading treatment and the Iranian Government continues to \ndiscriminate against religious and ethnic minorities. They do not \ndiscriminate as to who they discriminate against. Other Muslim sects--\nwhether Sunni or Suffi or Jews or Christians, they discriminate against \nthem all.\n  Iran's record of degradation of women is appalling and should not be \ntolerated by the international community. Iranian women are severely \noppressed and their voices are constantly suffocated by the government. \nThere are numerous examples of Iranian women who have been arrested and \nseverely beaten for the simple fact they are females. One example is \nDr. Roya Toloui, a women's rights activist and the editor of a \npublication that is now banned in Iran. She was arrested last summer in \nthe wake of a 2005 July demonstration in the town of Mahabad. Dr. \nToloui was held in prison for 66 days. While she was there, she was \nraped and she was tortured. Though she has since been released from \nprison, Dr. Toloui is in constant fear of rearrest and of death.\n  The State Department also noted Iran's continued restrictions on \nworkers' rights. In short, the Government of Iran oppress its people \nand terrorizes the world and is a threat to the security of this \ncountry and to the security of democracies throughout the West.\n  The one additional aspect that has now taken a lot of press is Iran's \npursuit of nuclear capability. This is very unsettling when you have a \nregime with this kind of track record to be in pursuit of nuclear \ncapability. Iran, of course, is permitted to pursue peaceful nuclear \nresearch under the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Its \nrecord on transparency and the true purpose of its program, obviously, \nis very much in doubt. In November of 2003 the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency reported that Iran has been developing an undeclared \nnuclear enrichment program for 18 years and had covertly imported \nnuclear material and equipment. Furthermore, the IAEA reported that \nIran had conducted over 110 unreported experiments to produce uranium, \nmetal, and separated plutonium, and had possession of designs clearly \nrelated to the fabrication of nuclear weapons.\n  In 2005, in August, following the election of President Ahmadinejad, \nIran announced that the ongoing negotiations under the terms of the \n2004 Paris agreement, the agreement that suspended activities brokered \nby the EU-3, were ``satisfactory'' according to Iran. Then they \nannounced they were resuming the conversion of raw uranium into gas for \nenrichment. In January of 2006, Iran removed the IAEA seals on the \nresearch enrichment plant in Natanz.\n  Recently, the IAEA board voted 27 to 3 to report Iran to the U.N. \nSecurity Council, and in so doing noted Iran's many failures and \nbreaches of its obligations to comply with the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty. Iran's aggressive behavior and concealment of ongoing nuclear \nactivities can only lead to one conclusion, and that is that Iran is \nseeking to enrich uranium to use for nuclear weapons.\n  In response to this nuclear gambit, I believe we need smart sanctions \nfor the U.N. to impose. For example, the U.N. should consider imposing \na travel ban on Iran's leaders, banning international flights from \nIranian air, banning the transportation of cargo carried by Iranian \nGovernment-owned ships, and possibly to pursue legal action against \nIranian leaders responsible for human rights and terrorism abuses, as \nwell as executions.\n  I recently introduced legislation with my colleague, Senator Norm \nColeman, that seeks to empower the forces of democracy in Iran and \nsupport efforts to foster peaceful change within Iran. It is S. 333, \nthe Iran Freedom and Support Act. It seeks to make it harder for the \nGovernment of Iran to have access to revenue and foreign investment. \nResources that those investments accrue are used by the Iranian \nGovernment to support terrorist organizations and to pursue nuclear \nactivity as well as to repress its people.\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\n  The bill also codifies sanctions, controls, and regulations currently \nin place against Iran by Executive order. It codifies those in statute. \nThe bill declares it should be a policy of the United States to support \nthe Iranian people in their prodemocracy movements. We believe, and the \nbill says, that the people of Iran are entitled to self-determination, \nto free and fair elections, and we want to provide the resources in \nhelping those groups attain those free and fair elections. We \nauthorized $10 million in this bill, but thanks to the effort on the \nsupplemental the administration has sent up to the Congress, they have \nrequested $75 million for prodemocracy efforts in Iran. I hope the \nintroduction of our legislation last year perhaps gave some \nencouragement to ask for such funding. They have asked for $75 million. \nI will amend our bill to ask for $100 million for those efforts.\n  The Iran Freedom and Support Act is a nonviolent way to try to effect \nchange in Iraq. I agree with the President and all who have talked \nabout keeping our military options on the table, but it is vitally \nimportant to try to use our diplomatic options first and foremost. At a \ntime when the threat from Iran is real, it is not only real to this \ncountry, not only real to the Middle East and Iraq, but it is, \nobviously, real to their own people in the way they treat them.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It is something I hope we \ncan do. It is important in spite of what the President has done. I \nsupport his policies that we show the Congress is 100 percent behind \nhis effort to do something about the nuclear gambit Iran is engaged in \nright now. I am hopeful we can pass this legislation in a timely \nfashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from \nPennsylvania on underscoring the urgency that surrounds the threat to \nour Nation and the entire world community with Iran.\n  I listened to my esteemed colleague talk about the Iranian repression \nof women. I thought to myself, how sad; Iran was a country that at \ntimes led that part of the world in its respect for women and women's \nrights at a time few talked about it. And how low they have sunk.\n  It was 100 years ago Iran's constitutional revolution was the first \ngenuine democracy in the Middle East, over half of the population of \nthat part of the world. When we look where we are today, I have a touch \nof sadness in my heart as I reflect upon the plight of the Iranian \npeople.\n  Make no mistake, as my colleague from Pennsylvania noted, Iran is a \nnation with painful rhetoric, rhetoric of its president, who says: Our \ngoal is to destroy Israel. We should take people at their word that is \nthe goal.\n  This is not, by the way, the rantings of a madman. This is the clear \npolicy of the regime backed by the ruling mullahs. It is the clear \npolicy, not the rantings of some wild man. Take him at his word, that \nis his goal, his objectives, and Iran's goal and objective.\n  Painful rhetoric is backed by their concrete actions. They are the \nlargest state sponsor of state-supported terrorism in the world. It is \nnot just cheap rhetoric; it is a disconcerting and frightening reality \nwe have to deal with.\n  Now we have a regime that is clearly in pursuit of nuclear weapons. \nWe are dealing with a lot of security issues out there today. There is \nlots on the agenda dealing with concerns about port security. Let's not \nlet this issue slip away.\n  Some say Washington is a town of a thousand issues and few \npriorities. This is a priority and continues to be a priority. As I \nsaid before, they have been clear about their regime and their desire \nto destroy Israel and the western civilization.\n  At the conference where Ahmadinejad talked about destroying Israel, I \nremember the picture behind him vividly, a picture of an hourglass. In \nthis hourglass, the ball is dropping through. This is posted not by \naccident but by design. In the hourglass, the fragile glass ball is \nfalling through the glass, about to be shattered. That is Israel. But \nalready lying on the floor of the shattered glass is a shattered USA.\n  That is the vision, that is the plan. We have to understand that. \nClearly, the vitriolic rhetoric is backed by a clear vision and plan \nand it merits immediate action by the international community.\n  All in all, the Tehran regime's previous and ongoing activities \nindicate that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an unprecedented threat \nto American national security as well as to the existence of the State \nof Israel. Have no doubt about it; if Iran were to use a nuclear weapon \nin the Middle East, we are not protected, even being thousands of miles \naway. We will all be impacted by that. We are all in this. The outcome \nof Iran's vision and the destruction of Israel is unacceptable. Common \nsense and responsibility demand that action be taken now. Time is not \non our side.\n  The scenario we face with Iran today has many parallels to the 1930s \nwhen the League of Nations failed to confront the aggression of the \ndictatorships in Japan, Italy, and Germany. Hitler said what he would \ndo and the international community chose to ignore that very clear red \nflag. In ``Mein Kampf,'' Hitler meant what he said. When he had the \nopportunity, he acted on that.\n  The President of Iran has not written a book such as ``Mein Kampf,'' \nbut he has been very clear about what his intentions are, public about \nhis intentions to destroy Israel and the rest. And at the same time he \nis pursuing a strategy to campaign to obtain nuclear capacity. Will the \ninternational community continue to wring its hands and allow this \nmurderous regime to align its intentions with its capabilities or will \nit take action? The answer must be yes. The answer must be now. And the \nUnited States must be part of leading that charge.\n  The IAEA has taken some action. There is a meeting of the board of \ngovernors March 6. They must continue to put pressure on Iran. But that \nis not enough. The reality is, negotiations are not enough. There is a \nRussian proposal on the table. The European three have been negotiating \nwith Iran. The problem with this, it may seem as if there is something \nthere, but when you pursue this negotiation you are presuming that the \nother side wants a solution. They are negotiating with someone who is \nnot looking for a solution to divert a crisis but playing a cat-and-\nmouse game to buy time. You have to realize enough time for talk and we \nhave to take action. Talk is what the other side wants as it buys time. \nIt is clear they are not looking for a solution to avert a crisis. They \nhave a vision. They have a path.\n  They have demonstrated time and again they are not serious about \nnegotiating. They deserve no further opportunities to prevent them from \nbeing held to account for their intransigence. I think it is high time \nthe international community called the Iranian bluff. They have had \nmore than enough opportunities to negotiate and have brazenly violated \nevery agreement. The Security Council must take strong action. This \nneeds to be the focus of our policy now and in the immediate future.\n  While all of us recognize that actions must be taken to deal with the \nimminent threat of Iran's nuclear intentions, a true long-term solution \nto the problem with Iran lies in efforts to promote a free and \ndemocratic society. As Secretary Rice has noted:\n\n       Attempting to draw neat, clean lines between our security \n     interests and our democratic ideals does not reflect the \n     reality of today's world. Supporting the growth of democratic \n     institutions in all nations is not some moralistic flight of \n     fancy; it is the only realistic response to our present \n     challenges.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Bush made a direct \nappeal to the Iranian people and voiced our country's support for their \nright to freedom. Here in Congress, we need to act to convert moral \nsupport into concrete actions to help foster democratic change in Iran.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Santorum, for his introduction of the \nIran Freedom and Support Act of 2005. I am a cosponsor of that \nlegislation. He has talked about that and clearly seeks to support the \nroots of democratic change in Iran. We need to support democracy in \nIran. And supporting them is not being an American voice preaching \nmoralistically about democracy; it is an opportunity to connect with \nthe Iranians around the world, not just there. There are folks who have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nfighting for freedom in Iran. Some are still in Iran. We need to figure \nout a way to connect with Iranian voices, with dissidents in Iran and \naround the world, to let them know we are there to support freedom, we \nare there to support democracy.\n  I urge passage of Senator Santorum's bill. It is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Finally, I would note that March 20 and 21 is the Iranian new year. I \nsay that because the regime is repressing the celebration of the \nIranian new year. I want to conclude my comments by wishing the Iranian \npeople a happy new year, one in which, hopefully, they will be closer \nto freedom, closer to freedom in the year to come. And we will take \nthose steps necessary to help make that happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota. \nI think he is right on target. He is putting the burden where it should \nbe, and that is directly on the United Nations to do what is right with \nregard to Iran.\n  Our President has tried to put the Europeans out front to negotiate \nwith the Iranians. I believe they have been less than forthcoming about \nwhat they were doing the last 2 years with nuclear capabilities. Now it \nis time for us to all step in as world leaders and say to Iran: You \nmust stop making nuclear weapons. And further, if you do not, there \nwill be repercussions.\n  But it will take the entire world community, led by the United \nNations, to make an impact on Iran. The United States cannot do this \nalone. We do not trade with Iran. We need the people who are trading \nwith Iran to say there will be consequences if a nuclear weapon is \nproduced in that country.\n  So I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I hope very much the United \nStates will step forward with the other leaders of the world to say we \nare of one mind.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a moment because today is Texas \nIndependence Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time for morning business has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to read the \nletter of William Barret Travis from the Alamo. This is a tradition I \ncontinue that was started by Senator John Tower to commemorate Texas \nIndependence Day, and that is today, March 2.\n  Today is the 170th anniversary of the signing of the Texas \nDeclaration of Independence, a document that was signed by, among \nothers, my great-great-grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, and also his \nfriend, Thomas J. Rusk, who first held the Senate seat I now hold. They \nboth hailed from Nacogdoches, which is the oldest town in Texas--the \ntown in which my mother grew up and the town in which I now own the \nhome my grandfather built.\n  It is a very historic time for Texas. We celebrate Texas Independence \nDay every single year because we know that fighting for freedom has \nmade a difference in what Texas is. We love our history. We fought for \nfreedom. We were a republic for 10 years, and then we came into the \nUnited States as a State.\n  The defense of the Alamo by 189 courageous men, who were outnumbered \n10 to 1, was a key battle of the Texas Revolution. The sacrifice of COL \nWilliam Barret Travis and his men made possible GEN Sam Houston's \nultimate victory at San Jacinto, which secured independence for Texas.\n  From the Alamo, Colonel Travis wrote to his countrymen the following:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n       William Barret Travis, Lt. Col, Commander.\n\n  Colonel Travis's are the words of a true patriot. And his letter did \ninspire Texans to ultimate victory. In fact, his holding of the Alamo \nfor so long did allow Sam Houston to muster his troops for the last \nstand at San Jacinto.\n  To show you one other example of how Texans love their history, the \nminister who opened our Senate today with prayer from Lovers Lane \nMethodist Church in Dallas, TX, showed me, at breakfast this morning, \nthe ring he wears which is a replica of the ring of William Barret \nTravis that he wore at the Alamo. He put the ring around the neck of \nthe daughter of one of those who was able to survive and leave the day \nbefore the onslaught that killed all of those men at the Alamo. So \nSusanna Dickinson's daughter had that ring around her neck--she was \nabout 8 years old at the time--and that is why we know what the ring \nsignified.\n  Another example of how history continues to inspire us: I, just 2 \nweeks ago, commissioned the newest amphibious ship of the U.S. Navy. It \nis an amphibious assault ship, the first of its class, the USS San \nAntonio. The USS San Antonio has in its motto the words from William \nBarret Travis's letter ``Never surrender, never retreat.''\n  That is a great ship which is going to carry marines into battle. It \nwill carry our marines with the very best of technology, the very best \nsafety measures we can possibly give them. And the quote ``Never \nsurrender, never retreat'' will carry them into battle to help protect \nthe freedom of Americans for years to come.\n  I am proud to be the sponsor of the ship the USS San Antonio. It \nrepresents the spirit of our armed services today, just as 170 years \nago when we fought for our independence from Mexico and later became a \ngreat State of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Lobbying Reform\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the very important \nsubject of lobbying reform. When you think of our role in our \nconstitutional system and how important it is that that role\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nbe held in high regard and confidence by the American public, this \nissue certainly takes center stage as a very important one that we need \nto address. Again, it goes to the heart of who we are and what we are \nabout and the heart of the crucial task of having the confidence of the \nAmerican people in our system.\n  Obviously, in the last year, in particular, that has been shaken--\nshaken by some very real and serious scandals that have touched the \nCongress. Because of that, we need to address these issues of lobby \nreform, campaign finance reform, and other related issues very boldly \nand very directly.\n  Again, why do we need to do this? For a very simple reason. This goes \nto the heart of our credibility, the heart of the central issue: Do the \nAmerican people have confidence in our integrity, in our ability to put \ntheir interests ahead of the interests of narrow or special interests?\n  I come to this set of issues with quite a bit of experience from \nLouisiana. These sorts of issues have been at the center of our \npolitical debate for quite some time because, quite frankly, we have \nfought our own challenges in terms of integrity and credibility. We \nhave had a political culture and a political history riddled with \ncorruption and cronyism. Many of us are working very hard to get beyond \nthat. Before I came to the House of Representatives in 1999, I served \nin the Louisiana legislature. While I was there for about 7 years, \nthese sorts of issues--reform issues, lobby reform, campaign finance \nreform--were at the very top of my agenda because, again, what could be \nmore important than building the confidence of citizens in the \nintegrity of their Government? Certainly, when I stepped into the \nLouisiana legislature in January 1992, that credibility and that \nintegrity absolutely needed bolstering.\n  When I first went to the legislature in 1992, we had a Governor named \nEdwin Edwards. We had an explosion of legalized gambling issues and \nlegalized gambling concerns. That only fueled the need to address these \ncentral, ethical lobby and related issues. Issues such as the influence \nof gambling and gambling contributions came to the floor, and the \ninfluence of gambling entities on elected officials. Because of all \nthis, I filed several formal ethics complaints against our then-\nGovernor, Edwin Edwards. Many of those were successful to help draw \nattention to the very real problems that were persistent. And then \nseveral years later, that was actually followed by Federal prosecution \nof then-former Governor Edwards on gambling-related charges, and he now \nstill serves a significant sentence in Federal prison.\n  Other issues came before us, such as gambling contributions. We had \nan infamous incident of the president of the State Senate handing out \ngambling contribution checks on the floor of the Senate. This caught \neverybody's attention, and the good part of the incident--the only good \npart--is that it ushered in more reform, more cleaning house, if you \nwill.\n  So I was very involved in those issues for exactly the same reason. \nThey went to the heart of what we are about. They went to the heart of \nvoters' and citizens' confidence. They went to the heart of the \nquestion of our integrity.\n\n  In part, because of that background and that experience, I was very \ninterested in being involved in these ethics reform and lobby reform \nefforts on Capitol Hill. Very early on, I joined the working group in \nthe Senate that was focused on these important issues. The group \nconsisted of Senators Santorum, McCain, Lott, Kyl, Lieberman, Obama, \nIsakson, Dodd, Feingold, and Collins. It was a very strong, very \nsincere bipartisan working group to look hard at these crucial \nquestions and to come up with a strong package that could gain \nbipartisan consensus support, and that we could pass through the \nSenate.\n  In working with this group, we discussed a lot of issues and tried to \nhone in on the key abuses and, therefore, the key reforms we thought we \nneeded to address. That led to our releasing a statement in favor of \nmeaningful lobby reform, particularly with regard to the following \nareas: The revolving door between private lobbying and public service; \nprivately funded travel, which has clearly been abused in the past; \ngifts from lobbyists; improved lobbying disclosure; earmarks and the \nabuse of earmarks and the need for transparency and some limit in terms \nof those earmarks; strengthened ethics guidelines, training, and \nenforcement.\n  Again, I compliment all of my fellow Senators who worked on that \nimportant group--Senators Santorum, McCain, Lott, Kyl, Lieberman, \nObama, Isakson, Dodd, Feingold, and Collins. We all worked together in \na very aggressive and sincere way. I think we have made a lot of \nheadway. That headway is being exhibited this week and even more next \nweek.\n  This past Tuesday, the Senate Rules Committee, chaired by Senator \nLott, voted out a consensus package of important reforms. Now, today, \nthe other committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs, chaired by Senator Collins, will take a look \nat their side of these matters--those matters in this general category \nthat fall under their jurisdiction. I think they are going to come out \ntoday with a strong and significant package in terms of matters that \ncome from their jurisdiction. Of course, as I said, Senators Lott and \nCollins were very active, very forceful, and contributing members to \nthe working group.\n  I look forward to supporting these two packages that will come \ntogether next week on the Senate floor. But as I do, I also look \nforward to strengthening the package, perhaps here on the Senate floor, \nperhaps through separate legislation, on other crucial questions, which \nI truly believe we also need to address in a bold and direct and \nforceful way to gain the confidence of the American people.\n  I want to highlight three of those additional issues today. The first \nhas to do with a very important matter of Indian tribe campaign \ncontributions. Now, this, as everyone knows, is not some theoretical \nconcern. This issue has been at the heart of the recent scandals that \nhave plagued the Congress and the country with regard to lobby reform \nand campaign contributions. So this is not a theoretical or abstract \nconcern.\n  What is the problem? The fundamental problem, as I see it, is that \nthe rules are very different and very tilted for Indian tribes, as \nopposed to other entities such as corporations. How is that true? Let \nme give you a few examples. The first is that Indian tribes are treated \nas ``persons'' under Federal campaign finance law, and because of that \nthey are allowed to contribute up to $2,100 per election to a \ncandidate. But they are not considered what are called ``individuals'' \nunder the law. For that reason, there is no aggregate limit in terms of \nhow much money they can give to Federal political campaigns overall in \nan election cycle.\n  For other entities, such as corporations, there is absolutely an \noverall limit of $101,400. That is a lot of money but understand that \ntribes have no such limit, so they can go beyond that and give \nabsolutely as much as they want, without limit, to Federal campaigns.\n  The second area of difference I think is even more significant, and \nthat is because most Indian tribes are unincorporated, they are not \nsubject to any rules or ban on using corporate treasury funds to fund \nall of this or to any rules with regard to mandatory disclosure of the \nsource of the funds they use and where they go. That is a huge \ndifference.\n  Corporate PACs, of course, have to collect money in very certain \nways. They cannot write a check out of the corporate treasury. An \nIndian tribe can and, in doing so, doesn't have to disclose in any \nmeaningful way where the money came from or where it is going.\n  The second issue I want to highlight is the ability of some \nincumbents, some Members of Congress, in the House and Senate, to pay \ntheir spouses or dependent children for work on their own political \ncampaign. Why is that a problem? It is a fundamental problem, in my \nopinion, because it gives Members of Congress the ability to increase \ntheir salary if they want to abuse that right to write checks to their \nown personal bank account from their campaign account by ``hiring'' a \nspouse or even a dependent child or both.\n\n  Again, this is not a theoretical concern; this has been a practice in \nthe past and is, to at least a limited extent, a practice now. There \nmay be some spouses or some kids who do a lot\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nof work for that paycheck, who do a full day's work for a full day's \npaycheck. But, clearly, this is an area that is wide open to abuse and, \nin fact, in my opinion, has been abused in the past.\n  So how do we fix it? I think it is pretty simple. I think to gain the \nconfidence of the American people and to do ourselves a favor, we fix \nit in a very simple and direct way, which is by completely banning \nspouses or dependent children from being on the payroll of a Member's \ncampaign or on the payroll of a Member's leadership PAC.\n  The final issue that I quickly want to highlight is the issue of \nMembers' spouses being able to lobby Congress. Again, I think in the \nreal world, in the heartland of America, this causes average citizens \nand average voters a lot of concern. The concern, again, is obvious. A \nMember's spouse has a unique ability to lobby, No. 1. No. 2, that \nrelationship, if a Member's spouse is on the payroll of a lobbying \nfirm, means that the lobbying firm is writing a check, which basically \ngoes directly into the family banking account of that Member.\n  How do we address this? We need to be very careful to address it \nresponsibly and carefully and also to take into account the fact that \nsome spouses may have been a true lobbyist with true expertise, earning \nan honest day's work, before they were ever spouses of a Member of \nCongress. So I believe the way to address it is to ban that activity if \nthe spouse was not a registered lobbyist a year or more before the \nMember was elected to Congress or the marriage between the spouse and \nthe Member occurred.\n  I think that is a responsible, fair way to address a very real \nconcern, a very real issue in the hearts and minds of the American \npeople.\n  I close by again saying I appreciate all of the work of my fellow \nmembers of the working group on which I serve. I look forward to that \nlegislation coming to the floor next week, and I also look forward to \nus addressing other crucial issues that may not be in that underlying \npackage, such as campaign contributions of Indian tribes, such as \nspouses and dependent children being on the payrolls of campaigns, and \nsuch as lobbying by Member spouses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time? The Senator from \nAlaska.\n\n\n                   Permanent Postponement of S. 1977\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to ask a \nrequest of the joint leadership. Last year, I introduced S. 1977 to \nrepeal a provision of the 1977 reauthorization of the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act of 1972. My bill was designed to address the concerns on \nthe west coast about the impact of high energy prices on their \neconomies, their businesses, and their consumers.\n  Upon its introduction, S. 1977 was immediately met with press \nreleases condemning it. I believe the purpose of my legislation was \ndeliberately misinterpreted. By repealing this provision, this bill \nwould ensure that the Cherry Point refinery in the State of Washington \ncould maintain its current capacity.\n  The Cherry Point refinery processes 225,000 barrels of crude oil per \nday. About 60 percent of the crude oil processed at the refinery comes \nfrom my State of Alaska, and 70 percent of its refined product is \nconsumed by businesses, vehicles, and industries located in Washington \nState.\n  S. 1977 deals solely with the construction or expansion of marine \nterminals and docks in Puget Sound specifically at Cherry Point. It has \nnothing to do with the number or size of tankers in Puget Sound. The \nCoast Guard controls that through regulation. The existing provision of \nlaw under consideration limits the expansion of docks which is vital to \nthe area's economy. If this provision is enforced, it will eventually \nreduce crude oil delivery at the Cherry Point refinery by about 10 \npercent, reducing fuel capacity for the entire region by about 704,000 \ngallons per day of refined product.\n  My intention on introducing this legislation was to ensure stable \nsupplies of fuel for the Pacific Northwest at the existing capacity. It \nwould not have increased capacity at all.\n  Some have litigated this issue in the press, politicized this issue, \nand leveraged it for personal political publicity. Some Washingtonians \nhave appealed to me because they don't like to see a conflict between \nour State and their State. They contacted me privately and sought to \nwork this out.\n  In particular, one letter convinced me that despite my good \nintentions, the bill may not be the best policy for the people of \nWashington right now. But they contacted me.\n  Because of my private consultation with the author of the letter, \nwhich I do appreciate very much, I have come to the floor to ask that \nthe joint leadership institute procedures to bring about the permanent \npostponement of this legislation and indicate we will never take it up.\n  It is my understanding that this is the only procedure available as \nit is not possible for me to ask to withdraw it. I have never, in my 38 \nyears in the Senate, asked to pull legislation or have any bill I \nintroduced be permanently postponed. But that is my intention now.\n  For years, I have fought for Alaska's right to determine our State's \nfuture and to develop our own energy resources, particularly in the \nAlaska Coastal Plain. I defer to this policy now, and I believe the \npeople of Washington will have to make this decision. It is a decision \nthat will have to be made. But based on the private conversations and \nthe letter I mentioned, I yield to the concerns of Washingtonians on \nthis legislation. I still believe S. 1977 is the right policy, but I \nrespect the rights of those living in Washington State to make the \ndecision as to when that policy should be pursued. Consistent with my \npersonal philosophy, again I ask that the leadership find a way to \npermanently postpone consideration of S. 1977.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Appointing Conferees\n\n  Mr. President, still another day has gone by. It is now Thursday, and \nwe have been unable to appoint conferees for the pension reform bill. \nThis is a shame. Up to 40 million Americans are concerned about what we \ndo in the Senate. They may not wake up every morning thinking about it, \nbut there are millions of Americans who are worried about their \npensions, and they should be.\n  It is so important that we get this matter to conference and come \nback with a bill that will help those 40 million Americans. We passed a \nbill out of this body on a bipartisan basis; 97 of the Senators voted \nfor it. Not only was it a bipartisan vote, it was a bipartisan effort \nto get it to the floor. We need to do things on a bipartisan basis. \nThis pension reform bill is an indication of how we can work together, \nbut it shouldn't break down now.\n  There is a dispute over whether the conference should have seven \nRepublicans or eight Republicans. That is what it amounts to, whether \nit has seven Republicans going to conference or eight Republicans. \nThere is a two-vote difference. Because of the majority, 55 to 45, we \nhave agreed to a two-vote difference, but it is not right that we are \nnot going to conference because the majority doesn't want an extra \nSenator.\n  I need an extra Senator. I need 8 to 6. I have Senators who are \nheavily engaged in this matter and who have worked hard: Senator \nKennedy, Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski, and, of course, Senator \nBaucus who does the finance aspect of this and has worked very hard. \nSenator Rockefeller has worked hard on this. There isn't anything \nunreasonable about saying: Mr. Leader, instead of going for seven \nRepublicans, go with eight, go with nine. They have already agreed to \ngo with nine, they just wanted the difference to be 9 to 6. They wanted \na difference of three. I can't do that. I will go with nine. If they \nwant nine Senators from the current seven, fine, I will go along with \nthat.\n  In yesterday's Congress Daily the majority said they didn't want an \n8-to-6 ratio because, ``How do you break a tie?'' I took my math \ntraining at Searchlight Elementary School. We\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nhad one teacher who taught all eight grades and it wasn't that great, I \nam sure. But I even know that really doesn't make sense. Remember, how \ndo you break the tie if the vote is 8 to 6?\n  We know that can't be the real reason for the delay because we know \nthe majority's first proposal was 7-5. You would have to have the same \nconcerns about 7-5, so that can't be the reason.\n  I understand another reason for the delay could be the majority's \ninsistence that they get a three-vote margin conference. We can't start \nsomething like that around here. There are five Republicans, and I \nunderstand and appreciate that. We have agreed to a two-vote margin. \nThat is fair. We have never had a conference committee that I am aware \nof with a three-vote margin, certainly not in this session of Congress. \nI am hard pressed to remember that it ever happened, so that can't be \nthe reason.\n  So there must be something else going on. There must be pressure \ncoming from people downtown, as we refer to the special interest groups \nthat are interested in legislation. There must be pressure coming from \nthese special interest groups to appoint particular Members to this \nconference, to ensure that they get the result they seek at the end of \nthe conference. It is like fixing a jury. Sometimes you work too hard \nand you wind up with a bad result.\n  I had a case once where I represented the North Las Vegas Police \nDepartment. They had been accused of false arrest. So we go to pick the \njury, and the plaintiff's attorney--I was representing the defendant--\nused up all their voir dire during the voir dire examination of the \njury, and then we have a period of time after that wherein you can \nperemptorily challenge a juror. You don't have to have a reason, you \njust get rid of them. He used all of his peremptory challenges, and \nsomebody stood and talked who had been a police officer. He didn't want \nthat guy on the jury, but he had used up all of his challenges. He \ncouldn't get rid of a juror who was a police officer, who would tend to \nside with me. He worked a little too hard in coming up with a jury that \nhe thought would be OK and wound up trying too hard. So sometimes you \ntry to play with the jury too long and you wind up being hurt.\n  In that case, I got a defense verdict. I won the case. I don't know \nif that was the reason, but I am sure it didn't hurt me to have a \nformer police officer during that jury deliberation.\n  So I really don't know how to explain this deadlock. The downtown \ninterests, the special interests say they obviously can't have that \nRepublican or that Democrat on this conference because they don't agree \nwith whomever it is on this issue.\n  This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 97 affirmations. Ninety-\nseven Senators said it is a good bill. This is not a Republican \nconference; it is a Senate conference. Is it going to make that much \ndifference if it is 8-6 or 9-7, compared to 7-5? I don't think so.\n  In the past, we would appoint conferees based strictly on seniority. \nIf the majority leader doesn't want to do that, then have him pick \nbased on some other principle. We will probably stick with the \nseniority rule over here, but not necessarily. There is little \nconsideration of how anyone would vote. I haven't asked those I would \nlike to be on the conference committee--Senator Kennedy, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski--how they \nare going to vote. I do know that Senator Harkin and Senator Mikulski \nboth believe there should be pension reform, but they are experts in \ndifferent areas of this very complex piece of legislation that is so \nimportant that we complete. We will appoint people to this conference \nand let them do what they think is right. We need to move on.\n  It should not have taken 9 months to consider the bill in the first \nplace, and it shouldn't take us 2 months to go to conference. Democrats \nhave cooperated on this every step of the way--Senators Baucus and \nGrassley, Kennedy and Enzi--the chairman and ranking members of the \ncommittees. We are ready to go to conference 5 minutes from now. If the \nmajority leader walked through these doors and said: I move that we go \nto conference, the ratio will be 8-6, 9-7, it is done. They could start \nmeeting today. We are not delaying this legislation.\n  I don't understand all the reasons that we are not going forward with \nthe conference, but I have to tell you, it looks somewhat suspicious to \nme when they are saying, instead of having seven Republican Senators, \nwe want eight, for some reason. That is wrong. We need to stop playing \naround with this. Up to 40 million Americans, I repeat, are counting on \nus to do this the right way and to do it quickly.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized at 2:15 p.m. for up to 15 minutes to make some final remarks \non this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate took further steps \nto reauthorize the PATRIOT Act without the fundamental checks and \nbalances that so many of us believe are needed. To bring us back to \nfirst principles, I read aloud the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. \nAnd to remind us of the broad, bipartisan support for amending the \nPATRIOT Act all over this country, I read the eight statewide \nresolutions that have passed in the last few years expressing concerns \nabout the PATRIOT Act. I also read some of the nearly 400 local \nresolutions that have passed--the four resolutions from my own State of \nWisconsin. Today I want to continue by reading some additional items to \ntake my colleagues back to how hard we fought in November and December \nto stop the flawed conference report, and how many Americans wanted us \nto do better than we have done this week.\n  Let me start with a few editorials. The resolutions passed by State \nand city governments that I read here on the floor yesterday are not \nthe only way by which Americans have expressed their concerns about the \nPATRIOT Act. The Fourth Estate has weighed in too, with many newspapers \nrunning editorials or columns criticizing the PATRIOT Act's effect on \nAmericans' freedom. And not just a few newspapers, but dozens and \ndozens, from all across the United States. From major national \nnewspapers to small, local newspapers. Papers in big cities and small \ntowns. All concerned about the erosion of civil liberties under the \nPATRIOT Act. I am going to read just a few representative editorials.\n  From the Orlando Sentinel, August 17, 2005; headline: Fighting the \nterrorists.\n\n       Our position: Patriot Act changes need to be tough but \n     protect against abuse of power.\n       The U.S. House and Senate have taken different approaches \n     to renewing the USA Patriot Act, the sweeping anti-terrorism \n     law that otherwise would expire at year's end. The Senate's \n     more thoughtful, bipartisan approach deserves to prevail when \n     members begin meeting next month to reconcile their competing \n     proposals.\n       The House proposal leaves the Patriot Act's expanded \n     surveillance and law-enforcement powers largely intact. It \n     does not accommodate legitimate concerns raised by both \n     liberals and conservatives about inadequate checks on those \n     powers.\n       The Senate proposal, passed unanimously, includes what \n     Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter called ``responsible changes \n     to safeguard civil liberties.'' It would continue to let the \n     government obtain secret court orders to seize medical, \n     financial, library and other records, but only records tied \n     to suspected terrorists or spies, or people in contact with \n     them. It would require the government to notify targets of \n     secret search warrants after seven days, though a judge could \n     extend that deadline.\n       Also under the Senate proposal, two of the most \n     controversial Patriot Act provisions--to seize records \n     secretly and conduct roving wiretaps--would expire in 2009 \n     unless renewed. That would encourage Congress to re-evaluate \n     those provisions in four years.\n       The Senate proposal would not stop the government from \n     using the powers in the Patriot Act to go after terrorists. \n     But its changes would better protect ordinary Americans from \n     possible abuse of those powers.\n\n  Next, The Los Angeles Times; editorial, ``Checks on the Patriot \nAct,'' from November 21, 2005.\n\n       The Patriot Act, a 4-year-old federal law that gave \n     investigators unprecedented power to search for and chase \n     terrorists, is a case study in bad lawmaking. Angry and \n     anxious to respond to the atrocities of 9/11, Congress\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\n     hastily approved a measure that exposed an indeterminable \n     number of Americans to unreasonable searches and intrusive \n     snooping for the sake of the war on terror. The law provided \n     few of the legal system's usual checks to protect against \n     investigators abusing the new capabilities.\n       The measure eventually generated outrage on both sides of \n     the political spectrum, as well as from corporations, \n     libraries and retailers forced to report secretly on the \n     activities of employees and customers. Nevertheless, in their \n     haste to wrap up business before the Thanksgiving recess, \n     lawmakers were poised last week to reauthorize the Patriot \n     Act, which is due to expire at the end of the year, with only \n     minor changes.\n       That was the outcome sought by the White House and its \n     allies in the House. A bipartisan group of six senators \n     stopped the bill, however, by threatening a filibuster. They \n     demanded that House and Senate negotiators produce a \n     reauthorization bill with more of the safeguards that the \n     Senate had approved earlier this year.\n       The senators' demands are modest, recognizing that law \n     enforcement agencies do need enhanced powers to battle \n     elusive and technologically sophisticated groups of \n     terrorists. But the public also needs to be able to review \n     how those powers have been used. And people need more \n     assurance that the information vacuumed up by their \n     government is actually connected to a suspected terrorist or \n     spy.\n       In particular, the bill should do away with the automatic, \n     permanent gag orders that allow investigators to hide forever \n     their demands for records from banks, libraries, doctors and \n     other sources. And the most controversial provisions of the \n     Patriot Act should be extended for a much shorter period than \n     the seven years suggested by House and Senate conferees.\n       When Congress approved the Patriot Act, it put its trust in \n     prosecutors and investigators to use their expanded powers \n     responsibly. It now appears that trust was misplaced. \n     Authorities have gone on a snooping frenzy since 2001, \n     issuing more than 30,000 secret demands for records per year, \n     according to the Washington Post. And unless the law is \n     changed, no one will ever know whether those records should \n     have been gathered, or what has been done with them.\n       Americans want to trust their government. It is their \n     government's foundation, its system of checks and balances, \n     that enables that trust.\n\n  Now, from The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, entitled, ``True patriots: \nSome in Congress won't let terror limit freedom,'' from November 30, \n2005.\n\n       Long before the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the so-called \n     Patriot Act that was passed in reaction and fear, a man with \n     stellar patriotic credentials who championed the cause of \n     liberty had words of wisdom for his fellow Americans: ``They \n     that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little \n     temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.''\n       What Benjamin Franklin said in his own day remains a \n     telling commentary for our time. Indeed, these words could \n     have been written specifically about the Patriot Act, which \n     went too far in trying to accomplish a legitimate goal: to \n     remove some of the bureaucratic and legal barriers that stood \n     in the way of hunting down terrorists.\n       But increasing government power while decreasing judicial \n     oversight was a troubling exercise in a free country, and \n     Congress realized as much when it passed the Patriot Act, \n     including sunset provisions that could be considered in \n     calmer days. That time has come and plenty of true patriots \n     have stood up and offered suggestions that would make the \n     Patriot Act more respectful of civil liberties and the \n     American ideal of freedom.\n       This is one issue that provides common ground for liberals \n     and conservatives. When a government has the power to search \n     a suspect's premises without his knowledge and can retrieve \n     personal business and library records of people without \n     showing any connection to terrorism, then the alarms that go \n     up are for Americans regardless of party. That is why, for \n     example, former Republican Rep. Bob Barr, the scourge of \n     President Clinton, finds himself on the same side of the \n     fight as the American Civil Liberties Union.\n       Despite the bipartisan qualms about reauthorizing the \n     Patriot Act without proper amendment, the Bush administration \n     has not been sympathetic. Trust us, it says implicitly. But \n     because paranoia animates policy for this White House, the \n     use of the Patriot Act is bound to go too far and impinge on \n     basic civil liberties. This is an administration, after all, \n     that feels threatened when Sen. John McCain and others want \n     to outlaw torture.\n       Sadly, ordinary Americans can't naively trust their freedom \n     to such hands. The Patriot Act needs to have reasonable \n     checks and balances written into it. Of the two bills to \n     reauthorize the act, the Senate version accomplishes this \n     better than the House measure. A tentative agreement has been \n     reached on reconciling the bills, but principled opposition \n     remains.\n       Six senators--three Republicans (Larry Craig of Idaho, John \n     Sununu of New Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) and \n     three Democrats (Richard Durbin of Illinois, Russell Feingold \n     of Wisconsin and Ken Salazar of Colorado)--have emerged to \n     resist accepting a version of the Patriot Act that doesn't \n     meet their legitimate concerns.\n       This isn't about being pro-terror but pro-American. It is \n     possible to keep essential liberty and obtain safety. For \n     Americans to deserve both, the true patriots on Capitol Hill \n     need support.\n\n  From the New York Times, just recently, on February 11, 2006, \nentitled, ``Another Cave-In on the Patriot Act.''\n\n       The Patriot Act has been one of the few issues on which \n     Congress has shown backbone lately. Last year, it refused to \n     renew expiring parts of the act until greater civil liberties \n     protections were added. But key members of the Senate have \n     now caved, agreeing to renew these provisions in exchange for \n     only minimal improvements. At a time when the public is \n     growing increasingly concerned about the lawlessness of the \n     Bush administration's domestic spying, the Senate should \n     insist that any reauthorization agreement do more to protect \n     Americans against improper secret searches. When the Patriot \n     Act was passed after Sept. 11, 2001, Congress made some of \n     its most far-reaching provisions temporary so it would be \n     able to reconsider them later on. Those provisions were set \n     to expire last December, but Congress agreed to a very short \n     extension so greater civil liberties protections could be \n     added. This week, four key Republican senators--later backed \n     by two Democrats--said that they had agreed to a deal with \n     the White House. It is one that does little to protect \n     Americans from government invasions of their privacy.\n       One of the most troubling aspects of the Patriot Act is the \n     ``gag order'' imposed by Section 215, which prohibits anyone \n     holding financial, medical and other private records of \n     ordinary Americans from saying anything when the government \n     issues a subpoena for those records. That means that a person \n     whose records are being taken, and whose privacy is being \n     invaded, has no way to know about the subpoena and no way to \n     challenge it. Rather than removing this gag order, the deal \n     keeps it in place for a full year--too long for Americans to \n     wait to learn that the government is spying on them. Even \n     after a year, someone holding such records would have to meet \n     an exceedingly high standard to get the gag order lifted. It \n     is not clear that this change has much value at all.\n       The compromise also fails to address another problem with \n     Section 215: it lets the government go on fishing \n     expeditions, spying on Americans with no connection to \n     terrorism or foreign powers. The act should require the \n     government, in order to get a subpoena, to show that there is \n     a connection between the information it is seeking and a \n     terrorist or a spy.\n       But the deal would allow subpoenas in instances when there \n     are reasonable grounds for simply believing that information \n     is relevant to a terrorism investigation. That is an \n     extremely low bar.\n       One of the most well-publicized objections to the Patriot \n     Act is the fact that it allows the government to issue \n     national security letters, an extremely broad investigative \n     tool, to libraries, forcing them to turn over their patrons' \n     Internet records. The wording of the compromise is unclear. \n     If it actually says that national security letters cannot be \n     used to get Internet records from libraries, that would be an \n     improvement, but it is not clear that it does.\n       In late December, it looked as if there was bipartisan \n     interest in the Senate for changing the worst Patriot Act \n     provisions and standing up for Americans' privacy rights. Now \n     the hope of making the needed improvements has faded \n     considerably.\n\n  Clearly the PATRIOT Act touched a nerve, and has continued to do so \nfor 4 years now. While I support a strong fight against terrorism, we \ncannot sacrifice our citizens' basic liberties in that fight. To do so \nwould weaken this country.\n  Next I want to turn back to some PATRIOT Act resolutions. It was not \njust State and city governments that passed resolutions these past \nseveral years. Colleges and universities across the United States have \nbecome actively involved in the PATRIOT Act debate as well. Across the \ncountry, 53 resolutions have been passed on 44 campuses advocating for \nsubstantial changes to the PATRIOT to protect the civil liberties of \nthe American people. From Mt. Holyoke, a small private all-women's \nliberal arts school in South Hadley, MA, to the University of Texas at \nAustin, one of the largest public universities in the United States, \nstudents and faculties alike are coming together to pass these \nresolutions. Resolutions have been passed on college campuses in states \nfrom California to Kentucky. I will now read a few of these campus \nresolutions.\n\n       A resolution concerning the protection of students' civil \n     rights in the wake of the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n\n\n            University of Texas at Austin Student Government\n\n       WHEREAS: The United States Congress passed the Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act; \n     Public Law 107-56) on October 25, 2001, championed by U.S. \n     Attorney General John Ashcroft;\n       WHEREAS: The 4th amendment of the Bill of Rights \n     establishes: The right of the people\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\n     to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be \n     violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable \n     cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly \n     describing the place to be searched, and the persons or \n     things to be seized.\n       2. WHEREAS: According to Mayor Pro Tem Jackie Goodman's \n     Austin City Council resolution regarding the PATRIOT Act, \n     ``fundamental rights granted by the United States \n     Constitution are threatened by actions taken at the Federal \n     level, notably by passage of certain sections of the `U.S.A. \n     P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act,' other acts and executive orders which, \n     among other things:\n       Grant potential unchecked powers to the Attorney General \n     and the U.S. Secretary of State to designate legal domestic \n     groups as ``terrorist organizations'' by overly broad \n     definitions, and implying restrictions to Constitutionally \n     protect First Amendment rights of speech and assembly by \n     reference, such as political advocacy or the practice of a \n     religion; while lifting administrative regulations on covert, \n     surveillance counter-intelligence operations;\n       Violate the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution \n     through the expansion of the government's ability to wiretap \n     telephones, monitor e-mail communications, survey medical, \n     financial and student records, and secretly enter homes and \n     offices without customary administrative oversight or without \n     showing probable cause;\n       Give law enforcement expanded authority to obtain library \n     records, and prohibits librarians from informing patrons of \n     monitoring or information requests;\n       Violate the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n     Constitution in establishing secret military tribunals, and \n     in subjecting citizens and non citizens to indefinite \n     detention without being allowed an attorney, without being \n     brought to trial, and without even being charged with a \n     crime;\n       Authorize eavesdropping on confidential communications \n     between lawyers and their clients in federal custody;''\n       WHEREAS: In the October 1997 edition of Global Issues, \n     available as Vol. 2, No. 4 of the USIA Electronic Journal, \n     then Senator John Ashcroft (R-MI) wrote in an article \n     entitled, ``Keep Big Brother's Hands Off the Internet,''\n       The FBI wants access to decode, digest and discuss \n     financial transactions, personal e-mail, and proprietary \n     information sent abroad--all in the name of national \n     security. . . This proposed policy raises obvious concerns \n     about American's privacy. . . The protections of the Fourth \n     Amendment are clear. The right to protection from unlawful \n     searches is an indivisible American value. Two hundred years \n     of court decisions have stood in defense of this fundamental \n     right. The state's interest in crime-fighting should never \n     vitiate the citizens' Bill of Rights. . .\n       The administration's interest in all e-mail is a wholly \n     unhealthy precedent, especially given this administration's \n     track record on FBI files and IRS snooping. Every medium by \n     which people communicate can be subject to exploitation by \n     those with illegal intentions. Nevertheless, this is no \n     reason to hand Big Brother the keys to unlock our e-mail \n     diaries, open our ATM records, read our medical records, or \n     translate our international communications. . .\n       WHEREAS: Eva Poole, President of the Texas Library \n     Association, the oldest and largest organization representing \n     Texas libraries, including university and academic libraries, \n     stated in a personal e-mail by request:\n       The USA PATRIOT Act is just one of several troubling \n     policies that compromise the public's privacy rights. \n     Enhanced surveillance powers permitted under the provisions \n     of the Act license law enforcement officials to peer into \n     Americans' most private reading, research, and \n     communications. Several of the Act's provisions not only \n     violate the privacy and confidentiality rights of those using \n     public libraries, but take no consideration of constitutional \n     checks and balances as it authorizes intelligence agencies to \n     gather information in situations that may be completely \n     unconnected to a potential criminal proceeding.\n       Librarians do not know how the USA PATRIOT Act and related \n     measures have been applied in libraries because the gag order \n     bars individuals from making that information public. Equally \n     troubling is the fact that librarians are not allowed to \n     comment on FBI visits to examine library users' Internet \n     surfing and book-borrowing habits. I oppose any use of \n     governmental power to suppress the free and open exchange of \n     knowledge and information.\n       WHEREAS: The Student Governments of the University of \n     California at Berkeley and Santa Barbara, University of \n     Alaska Fairbanks, University of Washington, Washington State \n     University, University of Wisconsin and Southern Oregon \n     University have passed resolutions denouncing the USA PATRIOT \n     Act;\n       THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Student Government of the \n     University of Texas at Austin has been, and remains, \n     absolutely committed to the protection of civil rights and \n     civil liberties for all of its students and affirms its \n     commitment to embody democracy and to embrace, defend, and \n     uphold the inalienable rights and fundamental liberties \n     granted to students under the United States and Texas \n     Constitutions;\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Student Government of the \n     University of Texas at Austin firmly calls upon the Austin \n     Police Department, University of Texas Police Department, \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation and Joint Terrorism Task \n     Force to refrain from and, in certain cases, discontinue the \n     surveillance of individuals, groups of individuals, and \n     organizations based solely on their participation in \n     activities protected by the First Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution, such as political advocacy or the \n     practice of a religion without reasonable and particularized \n     suspicion of criminal conduct unrelated to the activity \n     protected by the First Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Student Government respectfully \n     requests that Dr. Fred Heath, Vice Provost of General \n     Libraries, direct all UT libraries to post in a prominent \n     place within the library a notice as follows:\n       ``WARNING: Under Section 215 of the federal USA PATRIOT Act \n     (Public Law 107-56), records of books and other materials you \n     borrow from this library may be obtained by federal \n     agents. This law also prohibits librarians from informing \n     you if records about you have been obtained by federal \n     agents.

Mr. President, every day children across this country \nlearn about the role of their Government and how it is intended to \nfunction. I have also collected a handful of textbooks used by children \nfrom elementary school up through high school to see what they have to \nsay about the role of Government. In looking at these books, I notice \nthat each of them at different reading levels discuss the Government as \na whole, the importance of the Constitution as the foundation of our \nGovernment, and the importance of checks and balances and separation of \npowers. Each of these books, at whatever learning level or reading \nlevel, teaches that the Government does not have endless, unchecked \npowers over the people it is intended to protect.\n  I started my presentation after cloture was invoked by reading the \nConstitution of the United States. I wish to conclude for now by \nreading a very brief portion of one of these books. It is entitled \n``National Government, a Kids' Guide.'' ``Separation of Powers.''\n\n       The people who wrote the U.S. Constitution wanted to make \n     sure that the leaders of the government did not have too much \n     power. The writers spread the power among three separate \n     branches of government that work together to govern the \n     country. This is called separation of powers.\n       The executive branch is lead by the president of the United \n     States. This part of the government is responsible for making \n     sure the laws are carried out, or executed.\n       The legislative branch is made up of the people in the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives. Together, the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives are called the United States \n     Congress. The legislative branch makes the laws.\n       The third branch is the judicial branch, which is led by \n     the Supreme Court. The judges--called justices--of the \n     Supreme Court explain the laws and decide if any laws are not \n     fair.\n       Each branch of the government has its own job to do, but \n     the three branches have to work together. The people who \n     wrote the Constitution were very careful to make sure that \n     each branch of the government could check up on the others. A \n     system called checks and balances keeps different parts of \n     the government from having too much power.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be \nrecognized at 12:30 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak until 12:30, with the time to be charged to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the hour has almost arrived. I understand \nthat in a little less than 3 hours, we will finally be voting for the \nfinal time on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. This is critical \nfor the defense of our country, the security of our Nation.\n  I am pleased we have the opportunity now to approve it, and I predict \nit will be approved overwhelmingly. The question is, What took us so \nlong? We could have done this at least 2 weeks ago. Indeed, we could \nhave done it 2 months ago. Such is the process in the Senate that \nsometimes the wheels grind slowly.\n  The problem is the war on terror. Our enemy does not treat the war \nnecessarily the same way some people in this country do. They are very \nflexible. They are very agile. They do not tell us what they are going \nto do in advance. Sometimes they are very patient and wait a long time \nto strike, and when they do strike, it can be with great speed and \nlethalness, which means that our ability to fight the terrorists has to \nbe equally agile.\n  Good intelligence has a short shelf life. Yet that is basically our \nmain weapon in the war on terror. This is not a war we fight with \nplanes, tanks, and ships, but with good intelligence to find out where \nthe terrorists are, who they are, what they are up to, and, if we can, \nfind out whether we are able to stop their terrorist attacks before \nthey occur. That takes good intelligence. It takes agility to be able \nto get that intelligence, cooperate among the various law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies.\n  Before September 11, several of us had provisions of law we believed \nwere important to amend in our statutes to provide tools to fight \nterrorists. Little did we know how important those would soon become. \nSenator Feinstein and I have been ranking member and chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security for many \nyears, since I came to the Senate. We held a lot of hearings on the \nsubject. We had a lot of ideas about what we wanted to propose.\n  Shortly after September 11, a lot of these things made their way into \nthe PATRIOT Act which we were able to approve. Some Members said the \nPATRIOT Act was approved hastily. Actually, a lot of the ideas of the \nPATRIOT Act had been around for some time, had a lot of debate and \nhearings, but there did not seem to be a reason to get them passed; \nthat is, until September 11, and then, indeed, we did act quickly. But \nI submit there is a difference between acting hastily and acting \nquickly.\n  Nevertheless, some of the provisions were sunsetted. Regarding things \nwe did then and some subsequent amendments to statute, we wanted to \ntake another look down the road to make sure we did not act too \nhastily. Our action today will make it clear that by reauthorizing \nthese provisions, we intended them to be in effect. We know the \nterrorists have not stopped their war on terror, and therefore we dare \nnot stop the tools to fight terrorism, many of which are embodied in \nthe PATRIOT Act. So it is important to reauthorize these provisions and \nnot have them expire or sunset.\n  There is a certain amount of pride of authorship I confess to since a \nlot of the provisions we are reauthorizing today are provisions which I \nwrote or helped to write in coauthorship with some of my colleagues. \nLet me mention some of these because these are important, one of which \nhas been known as or has come to be known as the Moussaoui fix, which \nis named after Zacarias Moussaoui, sometimes referred to as the 20th \nhijacker. In the 108th Congress, Senator Schumer and I introduced the \nMoussaoui fix, which allows the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to monitor \nand search suspected lone wolf terrorists such as Zacarias Moussaoui.\n  Now, lone wolf terrorists exist because in today's world, you do not \nget a little card that says: I am a proud member of al-Qaida. It is a \nvery loose-knit organization. Some have likened it to a franchise where \nall over the world there are little bands of people--cells--who would \ndo harm to the West generally and the United States in particular and \nwho share the same goals and ideals of al-Qaida, frequently have \ncommunication with members of al-Qaida, train in the same way, and \nconduct the same kinds of terrorist activities, sometimes in \nconsultation or concert with al-Qaida. But it is not like a club, it is \nnot like you are a member of the KGB of the Soviet Union, which is what \nthe threat was when we wrote the FISA act.\n  Because the FISA act refers to foreign intelligence organizations or \nterrorist organizations, we found that with people such as Zacarias \nMoussaoui, who we could not prove was a card-carrying member of any \nparticular terrorist group but we figured he was a terrorist and up to \nno good, we did not have an ability under FISA to seize and search his \ncomputers even though we had the ability to arrest him. This was 2 \nweeks before September 11. Had we been able to get into the computer, \nwe might well have discovered the information we later found that could \nhave pointed us in the direction of an attack on September 11.\n  Well, that is what the object of the Zacarias Moussaoui fix was: to \nenable us to add the lone wolf terrorist to the other situations in \nwhich a FISA warrant could be obtained. And it filled a gap in our laws \nthat, as I said, might well have uncovered the September 11 conspiracy \nhad it been in place at the time.\n  It was reported out of a unanimous Judiciary Committee and passed out \nof the Senate 90 to 4 in 2003. In 2004, it was added to the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, with the general \nPATRIOT Act sunset applied to it. Like the other PATRIOT provisions, \nthe Moussaoui fix was set to expire at the end of last year. Today, we \nwill extend the sunset on that critical provision of law for another 4 \nyears.\n  Another was the material support enhancements. In 2004, I introduced \na bill that, among other things, clarified and expanded the statute \nprohibiting the giving of material support to a designated foreign \nterrorist organization. These changes helped address perceived \nambiguities in the law that had led the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nto strike down parts of it as unconstitutionally vague. The changes \nalso expanded the law to bar giving any type of material aid \nwhatsoever--including providing one's self--to a terrorist group.\n  This legislative proposal also was enacted into law later that year \nas part of the intelligence reform bill, and also was subjected to a \nsunset. Again, today, with the PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference \nreport, we repeal that sunset. We make the 2004 material support \nenhancements permanent features of our law, as they should be.\n  Another part of the original PATRIOT Act I helped author was the so-\ncalled pen registers and trap-and-trace authority. Now, the authority \nfor pen registers and trap and trace is critical for antiterror \ninvestigations. It has been around for years in connection with other \nkinds of investigations, and it obviously was an important tool to \nfight terrorism.\n  What these authorities do is allow investigators to discover what \ntelephone numbers are being dialed into and out of a suspect's \ntelephone. As I said, they already had this authority in connection \nwith other kinds of crimes. It certainly made sense to have it track \nterrorists. An important feature here was to get one court order from a \njudge in one place and not have to hop all around the country wherever \nthe telephone was used and get a separate court order in that State. \nThat requirement made it totally useless.\n  So this one court warrant for trap and trace and pen registers was \nenacted. I am very glad to see the conference report repeals the sunset \non this authority--in other words, the automatic ending of the \nauthority--and makes permanent for antiterror investigations this pen \nregister and trap-and-trace authority, another critical tool to fight \nterrorism.\n  For the past 2 years, I have also been a cosponsor of legislation \nthat my colleague, Senator Feinstein, helped to coauthor on seaport \nsecurity and mass transportation security. This is especially \ninteresting in view of the debate and concern right now about seaport \nsecurity with which we are all familiar.\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\nThis particular legislation increases the penalties for and, by the \nway, also the scope of the criminal offenses for attacks on seaports \nand shipping. It also consolidates and updates the laws with regard to \nattacks on railroads and other mass transportation facilities.\n  Now, these proposals also had been amended into the intelligence \nreform bill in 2004 by the House of Representatives but have been \ndropped in conference. Today these important provisions, which I helped \nto coauthor, are enacted into law through the conference report of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  There is another rather interesting, rather esoteric--one of the \nthings lawyers debate about--but an interesting and important provision \nof the PATRIOT Act we are going to be dealing with today. When the \nfinal draft of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization was introduced in the \nJudiciary Committee the night before the committee acted on it, for the \nfirst time a proposed three-part test was inserted into the bill--a \ntest for determining whether a section 215 order is relevant to a \nterrorism investigation. There has been a lot of debate about these \nsection 215 orders, but these are critical to obtain records that might \nhelp in the investigation of a potential terrorist.\n  Several of us expressed reservations about this three-part test and \nwhether it would impede the use of these section 215 warrants and \nimpede important investigations and thought it required further study.\n  Well, during the next weeks and months, we became persuaded \nessentially that this three-part test would simply either make \nimpossible or certainly delay needed investigations and, therefore, \nshould not be enacted. It raised more questions than it answered, \ncomplicated this investigative tool that was being used, after all, at \nthe very preliminary stages of an investigation--not the stage at which \nyou ought to be proving probable cause to introduce evidence into the \ntrial.\n\n  Well, the test remains in the conference report, but with changed \nlanguage. I think it is much better in its current form. The form of \nthe test remains in the conference report, but investigators are no \nlonger required to use that test. Instead, they are simply permitted to \nuse that test to obtain a presumption that a 215 order is relevant to a \nterror investigation, which is fine.\n  Usually, when we create a legal presumption that a standard has been \nmet, it is easier to satisfy the presumption than it is to satisfy the \nunderlying legal test. I do not believe that is the case here. \nRelevance is a simple and well established standard of law. Indeed, it \nis the standard for obtaining every other kind of subpoena, including \nadministrative subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas, and civil discovery \norders.\n  So I cannot imagine that investigators will ever bother using the \ncomplicated three-part test in order to get a presumption when they can \nsimply plead relevance and that will suffice for their investigation. I \nmight be wrong, and they might find this test useful. It is there \nshould they decide they can use it. But I am pleased to see the \nconference report is not impeding investigations by mandating the use \nof that test.\n  We are not betting important antiterror investigations on the issue, \nI guess, is another way to say it. I think it would have been clearer \njust to eliminate the test, but it does not--other than, in my view, \ncluttering up section 215 of the PATRIOT Act because it is not \nmandatory, I do not think it is going to cause any harm. Investigators \nare not going to be impeded in their investigations because of it. I \nthink that is an important change we made.\n  The conference report also does something that is important for \nStates, like my own State of Arizona, that have attempted to improve \nthe ability to prosecute and defend against certain kinds of serious \ncrimes. In the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, \nCongress made an offer to the States in effect saying: If you will \nprovide qualified counsel, lawyers, in capital cases to the defendants \nin those cases during the stage of the case after conviction but during \nappeal--it is the so-called postconviction review stage of litigation--\nthen the Federal Government would apply a streamlined and expedited \nprocedure to review the habeas corpus petitions that are normally filed \nduring that period of time from the conviction in the State court.\n  The Federal courts would be required to abide by timelines in ruling \non these cases, and they would be barred from staying Federal petitions \nto allow further exhaustion or broadly exempting claims from procedural \ndefault requirements on the grounds of the perceived inadequacy or lack \nof independence of the State's procedural rules. The bottom line is \nthat if the defendants are represented by good counsel, by good \nlawyers, then they should be able to comply with the provisions of the \nlaw and not plead, in effect, they have to delay the law as they are \nhaving their appeals reviewed.\n  Arizona did its part to comply with this statute. It enacted a system \nto provide qualified counsel to capital defendants on State \npostconviction review. It spent a lot of money doing it. But to date, \nit has not received the benefits of the system. It is because the \ndecision about whether a State is entitled to the benefits of this \nchapter 154 relief--including the time deadlines--is made by the same \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals that would be bound by those deadlines. \nAnd it has repeatedly refused to extend to Arizona the benefits of the \n1996 law's special habeas chapter. By the way, it has also been very \nslow in many of these cases, and that has been a real problem.\n  The good thing about today's conference report is that it includes a \nprovision that would shift the decision of whether a State is eligible \nfor this expedited review of capital cases away from the regional \ncourts of appeals to the U.S. Attorney General, with a review of his \ndecision in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. That \ncourt hears no habeas cases; therefore, it has no conflict of interest \nas the other circuit courts would. This will allow the Federal \nGovernment to keep its end of the bargain that it made with the States \nback in 1996 and will allow States like Arizona to finally take \nadvantage of the streamlined and expedited procedures to which it is \nentitled.\n  I will conclude in this fashion. I think that by what I have just \nsaid it is clear there are a variety of important provisions in this \nconference report, this PATRIOT law we are reauthorizing. In some cases \nwe are saying this is now going to be permanent law. We do not need to \ncome back and reauthorize it every 4 years. In other cases, we are \nsaying there are important provisions of other laws that need to be put \nin the PATRIOT Act and made permanent law. And we have done that. In \nother cases, as I mentioned, we wrote particular provisions into the \nPATRIOT Act, and it is important that we reauthorize those provisions. \nAnd there were other provisions, in addition to pen registers and trap \nand trace that I mentioned before, as well as the material support, \nwhich were parts of the original act.\n\n  We established several crimes as part of the PATRIOT Act that would \nserve as predicate crimes for further investigation, and these were \nvery important because in the early stages of an investigation into a \nterrorist you may not have all of the scope of the activity of this \nindividual well in mind. You may know he has been guilty of what you \nthink of one particular crime, but you need to be able to use that as a \npredicate to expand your investigation into other things he may have \ndone.\n  So, for example, we establish that violations of the Federal \nterrorism statutes could serve as a predicate offense allowing the \nDepartment of Justice to apply to courts for authorization to intercept \nwire or oral communications pursuant to title III when investigating \nsuch offenses. We establish that the felony violations of the Federal \ncomputer crimes statutes, the so-called hacking statutes, might serve \nas a predicate offense, allowing the Department of Justice to apply to \ncourts for authorization to intercept wire or oral communications \npursuant to title III when investigating such offenses.\n  We provide for the detention, for up to 7 days, of aliens the \nAttorney General has reasonable grounds to believe were engaged in \nconduct that threatened the security of the United States or aliens who \nare inadmissible; that is to say, they are not supposed to be coming \ninto the United States or are deportable from the United States on the \ngrounds of terrorism, espionage, sabotage, or sedition.\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\n  There are a variety of other provisions that are included in the \nPATRIOT Act. The key thing to remember here is, as I said before, our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence officials need to have adequate tools \nto fight terrorism because we provide those tools when we send the \nmilitary into harm's way. We have an obligation to do that. And they \nfight important fronts in the war on terror. But so much of this war on \nterror relates to intelligence gathering and law enforcement activity, \ninvestigating potential crimes of these individuals. We have to give \nthem the tools they need to fight these terrorists.\n  The PATRIOT Act does that. It is one of our tools. The FISA law is \nanother one of those tools, the Surveillance Act. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is what FISA stands for. We have \nactivities such as the NSA surveillance that is another important tool \nthat deals with al-Qaida terrorists who are calling into or out of a \nforeign country. There are other mechanisms we are using to fight the \nterrorists.\n  But one of the bedrock laws now that we use is the PATRIOT Act. That \nlaw passed not long after 9/11 because we understood this world had \nchanged and that it was time to apply to terrorism many of the same \nkinds of techniques in law enforcement authorities that we already \ndeemed very useful in investigating other kinds of crimes. Our idea \nwas, if it is good enough to investigate money laundering or drug \ndealing, for example, we sure ought to use those same kinds of \ntechniques to fight terrorists. We have done that.\n  Today, actually, is a very important day because many of the \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act go into permanent law. Others are \nreauthorized for 4 more years. They provide critical support to the \npeople we want to protect us in this war on terror. I am delighted we \nwill be adopting the PATRIOT Act conference report today. My only \nregret, as I said, is we could not have done it before now. But we can \nat least celebrate the fact that the Senate has done its duty for the \nAmerican people to help make them secure in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Appointment of Pension Conferees\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning the minority leader came to \nthe floor to once again call into question our good faith efforts on \nthe pensions bill. He now claims our longstanding offer of a 7-5 ratio \non the conference committee ``looks suspicious.'' I can't help but feel \nthat what is beginning to look suspicious is this continuing pattern of \nobstruction on ground that seems to be ever shifting.\n  We originally considered proposing a 5-3 ratio but, to accommodate \nhis caucus, we ultimately offered a 7-5 ratio. After a 2-month delay, \nthis was rejected. The Democratic leader was unable to make a decision \namong members of his caucus. I understand those challenges, but that is \nwhat leadership is all about. Now he wishes to further delay with an \narbitrary dispute over the ratio of conferees and this new, equally \ndisingenuous charge of ``fixing the jury,'' which is absurd.\n  As the minority leader well knows, I have been working for years to \nfix the pensions problem. The American people deserve it. People don't \nunderstand why these games are being played.\n  The clock is ticking. People's lives are at stake. The first quarter \nof the physical year ends on March 31, 31 days from now. Within 2 weeks \nof that happening, companies have to make contributions to their \npension plans. The pensions of millions of hard-working Americans are \nat stake. That is why these games don't make sense.\n  We have two committees with an equal stake in this bill. They should \nhave an equal number of conferees on the committee. The conference \ncommittee should fairly represent the two committees of jurisdiction. \nThe minority leader knows his proposals won't allow for that. I am for \na fair conference but, equally importantly, I am for getting to \nconference so that we can address these challenges. The American people \nare waiting.\n  I know the Democratic leader says he wants to move forward as well. \nBut remember, we passed this bill in November of last year, and we are \nstill trying to do something very simple; that is, to get to conference \nso that we can pass the legislation.\n  I am baffled by the minority leader's inability to decide which five \nSenators from his caucus could join with our seven Senators so that we \ncan appoint a conference and do the Nation's business. I am equally \nconfused about why, in refusing to make that decision, he instead feels \nthat he should decide on his own, unilaterally, the ratio of conferees \nwith no regard for treating the two committees of jurisdiction fairly. \nIf anyone is trying to fix the jury, it appears to be the minority \nleader by having one committee with more representatives than the \nother. We go back and forth every day, and that clock is ticking.\n  The airline provisions of the bill are necessary to keep additional \npension obligations from being terminated and left at the doorstep of \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. As Chairman Grassley has \nsuggested, in remarks that I will include in the Record, if we cannot \nmake some progress shortly, we may need to look at pulling these \nprovisions out and moving them on some other vehicle. That should not \nbe necessary, but continued obstruction would leave us with no other \nchoice. We are simply running out of time.\n  I plead with the Democratic leader to put forth his five. We have \nbeen ready for the last 2 months to put forth our 7 so we can get to \nconference and provide answers and a resolution to what millions of \nAmericans are waiting for.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the above-referenced \ndocument.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Dow Jones Newswires]\n\n     U.S. Senator Grassley: Senator Reid Undermining Pension Talks\n\n                    (By Rob Wells and John Godfrey)\n\n       Washington (Dow Jones).--A top U.S. Senate Republican on \n     Thursday accused Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, of \n     undermining talks for a final pension overhaul bill, thereby \n     helping the bill's critics.\n       ``It's playing right into the hands of Ford (F) and General \n     Motors (GM), because they negotiated benefits, both health \n     and savings, they can't keep their promise to,'' said Senate \n     Finance Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, at the National \n     Summit on Retirement Savings, an industry and government \n     seminar.\n       He said these companies ``don't want these reforms because \n     they're going to have to pay up'' through higher pension \n     contributions.\n       The bill would change pension funding rules and increase \n     premiums paid by companies to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation. The measure has divided business and labor \n     groups, many of whom argue that it would be too strict.\n       The Senate has been attempting to name negotiators since \n     December to a House and Senate conference to write a final \n     pension overhaul bill.\n       Grassley accused Reid of delaying final pension talks by \n     not formally naming Democratic negotiators. Part of the \n     delay, however, stemmed from internal Republican \n     disagreements over who would lead negotiations.\n       Reid and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., have \n     been in a standoff over the number of Democrats who will be \n     part of the talks.\n       Grassley, departing from his prepared remarks, sharply \n     criticized Reid for the delay. ``They're being held up \n     because one person in U.S. Senate can't make up his mind \n     which two or three Democrats ought to be on a conference \n     committee,'' Grassley said.\n       If Congress fails to act on the pension bill, companies \n     will have to begin using the relatively pessimistic benchmark \n     of the 30-year Treasury bond in pension calculations. The 30-\n     year bond rate would begin to apply after April 15, although \n     higher payments wouldn't occur until January 2007. Currently \n     companies are using a blend of corporate bond rates in such \n     calculations.\n       The airline industry also has a major stake in the bill \n     since the Senate version would give a special break from \n     pension funding rules for underfunded airline pension plans.\n       Grassley and other bill advocates say it's vital Congress \n     completes work on the bill by the April 15 deadline.\n       Without action by then, ``it's putting into jeopardy \n     airlines being able to fly'' Grassley said, which would \n     ``ruin the economy if we don't get something done.''\n       Further delays may force negotiators to move pieces of the \n     bill, such as the airline provision, in separate tax \n     legislation to meet the April 15 deadline, he said.\n       A telephone call to Reid's office wasn't immediately \n     returned.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business and that this time be counted against the Republican \ntime in the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Port Security\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have had a chance to listen to the \ndebate on the PATRIOT Act in my office. I had not planned to speak. But \nhearing continued attacks on the President on security issues, \nparticularly port security, while some from the other side seem intent \non stopping one of the most important security pieces of legislation we \nhave, the PATRIOT Act, compelled me to come to the floor to straighten \nout the facts.\n  It is important that we have an honest and fair debate. I appreciate \nthose on the other side who have participated in the debate in an \nhonest way. But I have heard enough of my colleagues from the other \nside use information and perhaps take different positions than they did \nonly a year or so ago. I am compelled to point some of these things \nout.\n  I will give one example. This week in a Commerce Committee hearing, \nwe were talking about port security. Senator Boxer said:\n\n       Our ports are a soft target. Al Qaida told us that when we \n     found that out through [their] documents. . . . . So you take \n     the Dubai situation plus our lack of action on security. . . \n     . . And I'm going to oppose this deal.\n\n  That is fair enough unless we put it in perspective. This week, \nSenator Boxer actually voted to filibuster the PATRIOT Act, which is \ndedicated in large part to security in our ports. An entire title of \nthe PATRIOT Act is focused on port security. Originally introduced as \nthe bipartisan Reducing Crime and Terrorism in America's Seaports Act \nof 2005, title III strengthens criminal sanctions and takes a number of \nsteps to improve our Nation's ability to secure our ports and to thwart \nterrorism. Yet Senator Boxer voted to filibuster the enactment of this \nessential port security provision the day after lamenting the \nvulnerability of American ports.\n  The truth is, to anyone who has watched this over time, very often \nour Democratic colleagues, with all due respect, block the very thing \nthey blame Republicans for--in this case, blaming the President. Not \nonly did Senator Boxer vote to filibuster the PATRIOT Act, but after \nthe 9/11 attacks, Senator Boxer was one of four Democratic cosponsors \nof a bill that would have specifically permitted noncitizens to serve \nas airport security screeners. Senator Boxer cosponsored legislation to \nallow noncitizens to do for air travel what essentially the Coast Guard \ndoes for port security. Now she wants to block foreign companies from \nusing American workers to manage our port terminals. It is difficult to \nreconcile the two positions.\n  Republicans want a fair and nonpartisan 45-day security review and a \ngood but honest debate. It is not fair or honest to take a position \nthis week that was very different than one that had been taken before. \nTo Republicans, port security is not a passing political issue but a \ncornerstone of our commitment to protect the American people. That is \nwhy Republicans are working to pass the PATRIOT Act. We demand a fair \nand impartial 45-day security review of the proposed acquisition of the \nP Navigation Company of Britain by the Dubai Ports World.\n  I don't mean to be unfair to Senator Boxer, but it is an example of \nfolks maybe taking a different position, trying to blame the President \nfor something, in fact, that they have blocked in the past.\n  This is from an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, February 26:\n\n       . . . Now there is a Republican in the White House, and of \n     all the grandstanding surrounding the Dubai Ports World deal, \n     none tops Boxer's performance. She said last week that she \n     would support legislation preventing any foreign firm, state-\n     owned or not, from buying port operations. Memo to Boxer: 13 \n     of the 14 container terminals at the ports of [Los Angeles] \n     and Long Beach, the biggest port complex in the United \n     States, are run by foreign-owned companies. She later told \n     The Times that she meant such deals should get greater \n     scrutiny, not be banned. Still, this is the sort of proposal \n     one would expect from a Senator from a landlocked state like \n     Vermont, not one where international trade plays a vital role \n     in the economy.\n\n  The article goes on to talk about the 180-degree switch of opinions. \nAgain, I don't mean to pick on one Senator. My plea to the other side, \nand my side as well, as we look at this vital issue of security in our \ncountry, don't look for political opportunities to blame one side for \nsomething we actually created ourselves. On the security issue, there \nis no better example of colleagues who have blocked security in many \nways and now are attempting to suggest the President is not strong on \nsecurity. President George Bush is the world leader in the war on \nterror and has probably done more to secure the borders of our homeland \nthan any President or any Member of Congress. It is time we give him \nthat respect.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate passed a bill \nnegotiated by the junior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, to \nstrengthen civil liberties protections in the PATRIOT Act. In light of \nthe improvements contained in the Sununu bill, I will now vote in favor \nof the pending conference report.\n  As I have emphasized many times, Democrats support the basic \nauthorities contained in the PATRIOT Act. We voted for the original act \nin 2001. We unanimously supported the reauthorization bill that passed \nthe Senate last summer. In recent months, we have been vigilant to \nensure that no provision of the act would expire during ongoing \nnegotiations over a long-term extension of the law. But our support for \nthe PATRIOT Act doesn't mean a blank check for the President.\n  Last December, a bipartisan group of Senators joined together to \ninsist that the reauthorization bill which had been returned from the \nHouse-Senate conference be improved. We defeated that conference \nreport, we did it purposefully, and it was done on a bipartisan basis.\n  I note that some of my ``admirers''--I use that caustically--have run \nads in the State of Nevada trying to embarrass me, saying that I and \nthe Democrats are not for the PATRIOT Act. That was raw politics at its \nworst. What we tried to do, on a bipartisan basis, was to have a better \nconference report. That is what is happening. Some would say it has not \nbeen improved enough. I could argue that, but it has been improved.\n  Republicans and Democrats declared back then that Congress can \nprovide the Government with the powers it needs to protect Americans \nand, at the same time, ensure sufficient checks and oversight to \nprevent abuses of these powers. Security and liberty are neither \ncontradictory nor mutually exclusive.\n  Our insistence that the PATRIOT Act be improved has borne fruit. We \nstood up to the White House to demand a more balanced approach to \nantiterror tactics, and we have succeeded. Some say we didn't improve \nit enough, but there is no question that we improved it. Thanks to the \ncourageous stand of Senator Sununu and a handful of other Republicans, \nalong with the longstanding efforts of Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, \nand other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, the Senate will soon \npass a stronger, better PATRIOT Act.\n  The current bill is far from perfect. It falls short of the \nunanimously supported Senate bill we passed last summer. I would have \npreferred additional improvements in the conference report, but the \nversion of the PATRIOT Act we will soon reauthorize is a vast \nimprovement over the law we passed hastily in 2001.\n  For example, under the original PATRIOT Act, people who received a \nGovernment request for business records under section 215 were barred \nfrom discussing the request with anyone--their wives, sons, daughters, \nbusiness partners--no one. But now, for the first time, recipients of \nsuch a gag order will be able to challenge it before a judge.\n  In addition, the new bill will restrict Government access to library \nrecords. The bill makes it clear that libraries operating in the \ntraditional role, including providing Internet access, are not subject \nto national security letters.\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n  Finally, under the Sununu bill we passed yesterday, individuals or \nbusinesses that receive a national security letter will not be required \nto tell the FBI the identity of a lawyer they may consult to obtain \nadvice or assistance. It seems so obvious that it is the right thing to \ndo, but we had to fight for that.\n  Even before the Sununu improvements, the conference report included a \nnumber of crucial provisions to ensure congressional and public \noversight of the Government's expansive powers under the PATRIOT Act. \nWe insisted that the House accept 4-year sunsets instead of 7-year \nsunsets on the most controversial provisions of the act. In the \noriginal bill, we set sunsets. It is so important, as we look back and \nrecognize why we did that. It is so important that we did that. Because \nof that, we were forced to improve this legislation. I again say that \nmaybe it is not to the satisfaction of some, but it is certainly \nimproved.\n  The conference report also requires extensive congressional public \nreporting and mandates audits by an independent inspector general. That \nwasn't there before.\n  I will continue to work for additional improvements in the act.\n  I wish to say at this time that Senator Russ Feingold is a person for \nwhom I have great admiration. We are so fortunate that he is a Senator. \nAcademically, no one in the Senate has a record that is superior to \nhis. He is a Rhodes scholar, someone who stands for principle. I \ndisagree with him on this legislation. I can support this legislation \nnot going with all of the improvements that he, as a matter \nof principle, has caused the Senate to review.\n\n  I believe it is unfortunate that this good man, the Senator from \nWisconsin, was not able to offer even two amendments. We asked the \nmajority leader: How about two amendments? Don't fill the tree. He will \ntake 15 minutes on each amendment. We were turned down. That is why I \nvoted against cloture yesterday. That is a bad way, in my opinion, to \nrun this Senate.\n  So I want the record to be spread with my words that Russ Feingold is \na fine lawyer. I congratulate and applaud him for his work on this \nissue and other issues.\n  I will continue to work with him to seek additional improvements to \nthe act. For example, I know he worked hard on an issue that is so \nimportant. Let's go back to the Senate-passed version of section 215, \nunder which a Government request for medical records and other \nsensitive personal information must have a more direct connection to a \nsuspected terrorist or spy.\n  Second, I remain extremely concerned about the lack of meaningful \nchecks on Government overuse or abuse of national security letters. The \nWashington Post reported last November that the FBI issues more than \n30,000 such letters in a year, with no judicial supervision. So we need \nmore oversight of the Government's power to issue these secret \nsubpoenas--30,000 of them. How many is that a day? How many is that a \nweek? How many is that a month? It is unfortunate that we were unable \nto get ahold of this and change this.\n  Third, I still don't believe it was appropriate to include in the \nconference report sections not included in either the House or Senate \nbills limiting the right of habeas corpus in cases having nothing to do \nwith terrorism. I will oppose any further weakening of the great writ.\n  There is a hue and cry out there that we have to do something about \nearmarks. What they always talk about are appropriations earmarks, \nwhich include a fraction of a percentage of the spending of this \nGovernment.\n  I do not back away or apologize for the earmarks I have placed in \nappropriations bills. I have a responsibility. I know better than some \nbureaucrat in Washington, DC, how the Forest Service should spend its \nmoney on the forests in Nevada. I know better than some bureaucrat from \nthe Bureau of Land Management how money should be spent in Nevada. And \n80 percent of the Federal lands controlled by the Bureau of Land \nManagement are in Nevada. I know better than some bureaucrat in \nWashington, DC, how the money should be spent on roads and highways and \nbridges and dams in my State.\n  I believe in the Constitution. I believe the Constitution sets forth \nthree separate but equal branches of Government, and by our folding on \nthis earmark procedure and not doing our jobs, we are caving in and not \nfollowing the Constitution. There are ways we can improve the way \nearmarks are placed on bills, and I am happy to work on that. I have \nworked with the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and his staff to make sure this earmarking legislation that \nwill be on the floor is not going to hurt what this body does. But my \npoint is that earmarking is more than the Appropriations Committee. Is \nthis an earmark that they stick in a conference report, where it is not \nin the House or Senate bill, that changes one of the basic rights \nAmericans have guaranteed by our Constitution--a writ of habeas corpus? \nYes. It is wrong. So if you want something about earmarks, let's not \njust focus on the Appropriations Committee.\n  I have talked about the flaws, and I am satisfied, in spite of them, \nthat the conference report, as improved by Senator Sununu, is a step in \nthe right direction and certainly better than the original PATRIOT Act.\n  Let me say a word about the relationship between the current debate \non the PATRIOT Act and the continuing controversy over unlawful \neavesdropping by the National Security Agency. On the same day we voted \non the PATRIOT Act conference report last December, when the conference \nreport wasn't allowed to go forward, the New York Times reported that \nthe President had authorized a secret program to eavesdrop on American \ncitizens without warrants required by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. That story had a clear impact on the vote that day, \nas it well should have. There was some question why we were even having \nthis protracted debate over the PATRIOT Act, since the President seemed \nto believe he was free to ignore the laws we enact anyway. But, in \nfact, no one is above the law--not even the President of the United \nStates. One lesson of the NSA spying scandal is that Congress must \nstand up to the President and must insist on additional checks on the \npowers exercised by the executive branch. That is what we are doing \ntoday with this PATRIOT Act.\n  In addition to what we have here with the PATRIOT Act and NSA spying, \nnow we have this Dubai port security, I think, scandal, on which the \nfinal decision was made by the Secretary of the Treasury, not the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. Whenever this administration is faced \nwith a decision that affects the business community or the national \nsecurity, the homeland security of this country, they always go with \nbusiness.\n  Why wasn't the Secretary of Homeland Security the one who signed off \non that? These companies control the perimeters of these facilities; \nthey decide who does the background checks. The debate over the PATRIOT \nAct and over NSA wiretapping and the Dubai port situation is all about \nchecks and balances. That is what this is about. They go to the heart \nof our system of separation of powers.\n  Today, we give the Government the tools it needs to help protect our \nnational security, while placing sensible checks on the arbitrary \nexercise of Executive power.\n  So today, when this bill passes, I hope everybody will understand \nthat I am saying that I am voting for this conference report because I \nthink it improves the original PATRIOT Act, not because it is perfect. \nIt is far from perfect.\n  I hope this administration--even though the President is in faraway \nIndia--gets the word that what is going on in this country with what I \nbelieve are constitutional violations is inappropriate. We need to get \nback to doing what is right for this country, following the \nConstitution and reestablishing the legislative branch of Government as \na separate and equal branch of Government.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how long am I recognized for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized for up to 35 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 2362 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                             prescribed PSE\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, in a colloquy \nregarding the intent of the Combat Methamphetamine Act of 2005.\n  Section 701 of the PATRIOT Act of 2005 establishes restrictions on \nthe sales of precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine. \nAs you know, the methamphetamine abuse and trafficking problem is \ngrowing in our country, and this legislation will help to combat the \nepidemic.\n  The methamphetamine control provisions of the act are intended to \naddress those precursor chemicals sold without a prescription.\n  I know that Chairman Specter and I agree that exempting \npseudoephedrine products provided via a legitimate prescription is \ncritical. Physicians and other health care providers sometimes \nprescribe pseudoephedrine products in amounts that could violate the \ndaily and monthly limits included in this legislation.\n  Patients who need more pseudoephedrine than the law would allow need \nthe option of getting pseudoephedrine under a prescription, and Senator \nSpecter and I agree that the methamphetamine provisions should not \nimpede the care of legitimate patients. Our new requirements focus on \nproducts purchased outside the current prescription process. We are \nseeking to stop the bad actors from manufacturing and trafficking \nmethamphetamine and have no desire to prevent proper patient care. Many \nStates that have enacted laws to combat the methamphetamine epidemic \nhave also included this type of exemption. It just makes sense.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from Missouri \nthat physicians should not be forced to change what are common and \nappropriate prescribing patterns in an effort to stop the manufacturing \nand trafficking of methamphetamine.\n  The Senator from Missouri is correct. The Combat Methamphetamine Act \nprovisions in the PATRIOT Act are intended to address over-the-counter \nsales, not pseudoephedrine products provided under a valid \nprescription. It is my expectation that these new restrictions apply \nonly to pseudoephedrine products provided to consumers without a \nprescription.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the distinguished chairman for this \nclarification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the course of this week, the Senate \nhas had a series of votes on the PATRIOT Act conference report as well \nas on a bill amending the conference report introduced by Senators \nSununu, Craig, Murkowski, and Hagel.\n  Last December, I voted against cloture on the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization conference report. I did not cast that vote because I \noppose reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act--I supported the PATRIOT Act then \njust as I do now. I voted against cloture on the conference report \nbecause I believed that it did not adequately protect our civil rights \nand liberties. Supporters of the conference report believed that you \nhad to choose between two extremes: taking a tough stand on terror and \nprotecting our fundamental constitutional rights. I thought you could \naccomplish both at the same time.\n  On February 28, 2006, I voted against cloture on the Sununu \ncompromise bill, S. 2271, vote No. 22, because of procedural measures \ntaken by the majority to prevent Senator Feingold--or any other \nSenator--from offering amendments. Senator Feingold's four proposed \namendments would have improved the Sununu compromise and addressed more \nof the concerns I had with the conference report. They would have, No. \n1, ensured that section 215 orders to produce sensitive library, \nmedical, and other business records would be limited to individuals who \nhad some connection to terrorism; No. 2, ensured that judicial review \nof section 215 gag orders and National Security Letter, NSL, gag orders \nis meaningful; No. 3, sunsetted the NSL authorities after 4 years; and \nNo. 4, required notification of sneak-and-peek search warrants within 7 \ndays of the search rather than within 30 days. I believe that each of \nthese amendments would have improved both the Sununu compromise bill \nand the conference report. Regardless of whether my colleagues agree \nwith me on that, I believe the Senate should have been given the \nopportunity to vote on them.\n  On March 1, 2006, the Senate conducted a series of votes, both \nprocedural and substantive on the Sununu compromise bill and the \nPATRIOT Act conference report. I voted to support the Sununu \ncompromise. I also voted to proceed to the motion to reconsider the \nconference report, to proceed to the conference report, and to invoke \ncloture on the conference report because, in my view, the Sununu \ncompromise and the conference report come as a package deal. I support \nthe two taken together, and for that reason, I also voted for the \nconference report today.\n  I support the Sununu compromise bill because it makes some important \nimprovements to the PATRIOT Act. First, it allows judicial review of a \nsection 215 nondisclosure order 1 year after its receipt. Section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act allows the Government to obtain business records, \nincluding library, medical, and gun records among other things. Under \nthe conference report, recipients of these section 215 orders were \nsubject to an automatic permanent nondisclosure order which would have \nprevented them from bringing any court challenge. Under the compromise, \na section 215 nondisclosure order is now subject to judicial review.\n  Second, the conference report would have required recipients of \nNational Security Letters, NSL, to identify their attorneys to the FBI. \nNSLs allow the Government to obtain, without a warrant, subscriber \nrecords and other data from telephone companies and Internet providers. \nThe compromise removes that requirement so that recipients of NSL \norders can seek legal advice without having to inform the FBI.\n  Third, the compromise clarifies that the Government cannot issue NSLs \nto libraries unless the libraries provide ``electronic communications \nservices'' as defined by the statute. Thus, libraries functioning in \ntheir traditional roles, including providing Internet access, are not \ncovered.\n  Even though this legislation does not address all of my concerns with \nthe conference report, these compromise provisions are steps in the \nright direction and will be important components of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I am proud to support this legislative package and am pleased we have \nreauthorized and improved the PATRIOT Act. I believe there is still \nmore work to be done and will work with my colleagues; such as Senator \nFeingold and Senator Specter, on further improvements. For example, in \na perfect world the PATRIOT Act would provide for more meaningful \njudicial review of section 215 gag orders as well as NSL gag orders. \nThere is no reason to have a conclusive presumption against \nrecipients--one that can only be overcome by a showing of Government \nbad faith. Nor is there any reason to prohibit judicial review of those \ngag orders until a full year has passed. They should be immediately \nreviewable, and, if there are any presumptions, they should be in favor \nof the privacy rights being invaded rather than the Government doing \nthe invading.\n  In a perfect world, the Patriot Act would require the subjects of \nsection 215 business record disclosures to have some link to suspected \nterrorists. As I mentioned earlier, section 215 is expansive, and it \nallows the Government to obtain very sensitive, personal records. \nSimply requiring those records to be relevant to an authorized \nintelligence investigation, as the conference report does, is simply \nnot enough. This standard will not prevent Government fishing \nexpeditions.\n  And, in a perfect world, the PATRIOT Act would have required the \nGovernment to notify victims of sneak-and-peek searches--unannounced \nand secret entries into the homes of Americans--within 7 days as the \noriginal Senate bill did. The 30- to 60-day timeframe is simply too \nlong. People have a right to know when the Government has been in their \nhouse, searching through their things.\n  Thus, I understand why some of my colleagues are disappointed with \nthe compromise. They say that it does not go as far as the original \nSenate bill which was passed by unanimous consent, and they are right. \nBut the fact is\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\nthat the compromise does improve the original conference report. I \nbelieve the compromise was the product of good faith negotiations. It \nis not a perfect bill, but it is a step in the right direction. And I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues so that we can create a more \neven balanced PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nconference report on the PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization \nAct of 2005 and the accompanying measure to amend the Reauthorization \nAct. I commend the work of Senator Sununu and others in addressing \nseveral flaws in the measure reported by the conference in December. \nAnd I congratulate the hard work of Senators Specter and Leahy in \nleading the Senate's efforts to extend and improve the PATRIOT Act.\n  I remain disappointed, however, in the process followed by the House-\nSenate conference, which not only excluded Democratic Members from key \nmeetings and deliberations but also excluded the public. Sadly, the \ndeficient process of the PATRIOT Act conference is characteristic of \nthe manner in which too many conferences have been conducted in recent \nyears.\n  Nevertheless, overall, adoption of the conference report, along with \nthe accompanying improvements contained in the Sununu bill, will not \nonly extend the PATRIOT Act but make it a stronger, more balanced tool \nin our fight against terrorists. I was one of the Senate's 10 \nconferees: 6 Republicans and 4 Democrats. We were appointed from the \nleadership and ranks of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees, the two committees with a direct responsibility for \nreauthorizing the PATRIOT Act.\n  The Senate conferees were appointed on July 29, 2005, immediately \nupon the Senate's passage by unanimous consent of the bill that had \nbeen unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I had \nexpected that the conference with the House, which in July had passed a \ndifferent reauthorization bill, would begin promptly on the return of \nthe Congress at the beginning of this past September from last \nsession's August recess. In fact, the House did not name its conferees \nuntil November 9.\n  The conference met the following day, on November 10, for its one and \nonly meeting. That meeting was devoted exclusively to 5-minute opening \nstatements. In my opening statement to the conference, I stressed the \nimportance of how we did our work. I urged that the conference proceed \nopenly, including by considering amendments in public session. I warned \nthat otherwise the Congress would risk losing an indispensable ally in \nthe long-term effort to defend the Nation; namely, a public that has \nconfidence in the necessity for and the balance of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Unfortunately, our opening statements turned out to be our closing \nones, because we never met again as a conference. The flawed process of \nthe conference produced a flawed result. Because it fell short of what \nthe conference could have achieved, I joined my fellow Senate \nDemocratic conferees in not signing the conference report. We then \njoined a bipartisan coalition that opposed cutting off debate in \nDecember and insisted that there be a further effort to improve the \nbill. That additional time has been well spent.\n  From the outset of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization debate, there has \nbeen neither division nor doubt in the Congress that we would unite in \nextending the investigative and information sharing powers that were \nenacted in the wake of September 11. Over this past year, as we have \ndebated the checks and balances that should be added or strengthened, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have been prepared throughout to \nachieve what we have now accomplished, the extension of essential \nnational security authorities.\n  In most cases, those authorities have been made permanent. For a few, \nwe have decided that a further review in 4 years is appropriate before \ndeciding whether to make these authorities permanent as well. The \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization agreement now before us establishes or \naugments some notable checks and balances. We have responded to the \nconcerns of librarians and booksellers by requiring high level F.B.I. \napproval of applications for orders requiring the production of \nrecords. And we also have required that any such applications to \nlibrarians and booksellers be reported to the Congress. The holders of \nother sensitive records B concerning firearm sales, tax returns, \neducation, and medical matters B also have enhanced protection.\n  The Reauthorization Act also places in the law provisions for the \njudicial review of orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt for the production of records. Similarly, it also places \nexplicitly into law something that the courts have already begun to \nrequire; namely, procedures for judicial review of national security \nletters to businesses from the F.B.I. demanding that they produce \nrecords for investigators.\n  I join others in the Senate and House in wishing that some of these \nprovisions had been written in a more balanced way. Specifically, I am \nconcerned that some of the new judicial review procedures tilt in a \none-sided manner toward the Government and may not give the individuals \nand businesses who may seek relief a fair opportunity to make their \ncases. If Congress promises citizens judicial review, it ought to \ndeliver fully on that promise. Some of those imbalances may have to be \naddressed by the courts or in future legislation.\n  The additional time to reach a PATRIOT Act agreement also gave us the \nopportunity to change other objectionable provisions of the original \nconference report. The report had contained a requirement that the \nrecipients of orders for the production of documents from the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court or by a national security letter advise \nthe F.B.I., on its request, of the name of any attorney they contacted.\n  This would have been the first time, to my knowledge, that Congress \nhad empowered the F.B.I. to demand that a citizen, who has been \npresented with a demand by the Government, inform the F.B.I. that he or \nshe has spoken to an attorney and be required to give the F.B.I. the \nlawyer's name. I found that this intrusive provision, which we were \ntold that the Department of Justice had insisted upon, to be \ninconsistent with basic American values. I am especially gratified that \nSenators Sununu, Craig, Murkowski, and Hagel were able to persuade the \nWhite House to strike this misguided provision.\n  Congress has an abiding commitment to provide our law enforcement and \nintelligence personnel with the tools and authorities they require to \nprotect America. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the \nPATRIOT Act are prime examples of that commitment. And it is a \ncommitment that is not just a one time thing. Congress has returned \nrepeatedly to these statutes to add new authorities or enhance existing \nones.\n  In that process, any of us, as individual legislators, may not \nachieve all of what we want, but collectively we fulfill our oversight \nresponsibilities by inquiring, debating, voting, and conducting \noversight concerning the powerful tools that a President, whomever it \nmay be at the time, believes that our law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials need to protect America.\n  This process has not been followed, unfortunately, with respect to \nthe NSA warrantless surveillance program inside the United States \nrecently disclosed and acknowledged by the President. The \nadministration continues to withhold important facts about the NSA \nprogram and, in turn, has prevented Congress from understanding the \nprogram and evaluating whether it is both legally and operationally \nsound. If a President refuses to deal with the Congress as a co-equal \nbranch of Government, then the Congress cannot fulfill its \nresponsibility on behalf of the people to ensure that the executive \nbranch is acting under the rule of law.\n  For the PATRIOT Act, this is not the end of the process. We have an \nobligation to be vigilant in our oversight. And we will be returning to \nthe act no later than 4 years from now when the remaining sunsets \nexpire, in order to consider reauthorization legislation for those \nauthorities.\n  During this time, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, of \nwhich I am vice chairman, will continue monitoring how the authorities \ncontained in the PATRIOT Act are used to ensure that we have struck the \nproper balance\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nbetween empowering our counterterrorism efforts while not infringing \nupon the civil liberties of Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for months, we have been ready to roll up \nour sleeves and get back to work on the PATRIOT Act, but the White \nHouse has continued to block bipartisan efforts to improve the original \nbill and accept oversight of its intrusive surveillance programs. \nAgain, and again, the administration has refused to join in serious \nnegotiations with Republicans and Democrats on matters of national \nsecurity, including the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretaps \nand the FBI's use of national security letters. The latest proposal \noffers improvements and deserves to pass; however, it is unacceptable \nand undemocratic that further amendments could not even be considered.\n  We need to implement these improvements quickly given the \nadministration's disregard of congressional oversight. The proposed \nreauthorization bill requires public reports on the use of two of the \nmost controversial provisions: section 215 and national security \nletters. It also requires the inspector general to audit their use, and \nit mandates a report on any data-mining activities by the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Americans deserve national security laws that protect both our \nsecurity and our constitutional rights, and more changes are clearly \nneeded. One of the most glaring omissions in the proposal is the \nfailure to include a 4-year sunset provision on national security \nletters, even though it would be consistent with the new reporting and \nauditing requirements that will take effect.\n  The latest changes provide some additional protection for libraries, \nbut these safeguards should apply to all of the means used by the \nGovernment to obtain sensitive information, including financial \ndocuments and library records. We also need a report on the \nGovernment's use of computerized searches from all Federal agencies, \nand we will continue to seek such a requirement as part of efforts \ntoward other reforms.\n  We have not yet achieved the 9/11 Commission's goal to maintain \ngovernmental powers that enhance our national security while ensuring \nadequate oversight over their use. With so much at stake, the \nadministration's refusal to work with Congress can only weaken our \nnational security and further undermine the public's trust in their \nGovernment. So this battle will go on, and I regret we could not \naccomplish more in this needed legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe PATRIOT Act conference report.\n  As I have stated in the past, I strongly support giving law \nenforcement the tools they need to aggressively fight terrorism. But I \nalso believe that we must ensure that we adequately protect \nconstitutional rights and properly balance civil liberties with \nnational security concerns.\n  I support reauthorizing many of the expiring provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act, but I believe we need to make some important changes to \nensure that Americans' civil liberties are protected. When the Senate \ndebated this issue last July, I supported the bipartisan compromise, \nwhich unanimously passed the Senate, to reauthorize the expiring \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act. Unfortunately, many of the improvements \nthat were made were later removed at the insistence of the White House \nand the House of Representatives. I cannot in good conscience support a \nreauthorization bill that is fundamentally flawed and lacks basic \nsafeguards with regard to the rights of Americans.\n  The final compromise that was worked out, including the conference \nreport and the bill offered by Senator Sununu, falls short in several \nrespects. First, it does not address the problems with section 215, \nwhich allows the Government to obtain sensitive personal records, such \nas library, medical, or business records, as long as the Government \nsubmits a statement indicating that the documents are relevant to a \nterrorism investigation. I, along with many other Senators, have \npressed to modify this standard to require that the Government show \nthat the documents sought are actually relevant to the activities of a \nterrorism suspect or the activities of a person in contact with the \nsuspect.\n  It is reasonable to require that if the Government is going to look \nat the private records of Americans that the Government demonstrate \nthat the request for records has some actual connection to a terrorist \nand isn't just part of a fishing expedition. The final compromise does \nnot include any significant improvements with regard to the standard \nfor issuing section 215 orders.\n  The conference report also falls short with respect to section 215 \ngag orders. Under the PATRIOT Act, when a section 215 order is \nissued,the receipt of an order, such as a library or doctor, is \nautomatically prohibited from disclosing that the FBI is seeking the \nrecords. In addition, under current law there is no explicit right to \npetition a court to modify or quash a gag order. The conference report \nstill provides for an automatic gag order and prohibits judicial \nreview, but specifies that a recipient of a section 215 gag order may \ndisclose its existence to an attorney to obtain legal advice.\n  Although the Sununu bill the Senate passed earlier this week as part \nof the final compromise technically allows for judicial review of a \nnondisclosure order and permits a recipient to challenge the gag order \nbefore a FISA judge, this is merely an illusionary right and does not \nprovide any meaningful review. A recipient must wait 1 year to \nchallenge the gag order and the judge may overturn the order only if \nthere is no reason to believe the disclosure will endanger national \nsecurity. However, because the Attorney General may certify that the \ndisclosure may endanger national security and a judge must treat this \ncertification as conclusive unless the Government is found to be acting \nin bad faith, it would be almost impossible to ever successfully \nchallenge a gag order.\n  I also have significant concerns with respect to national security \nletters, or NSLs. National security letters are essentially formal \nrequests made by Federal intelligence investigators to communication \nproviders, financial institutions, and credit bureaus to provide \ncertain consumer information relating to a national security \ninvestigation. The issuance of an NSL does not require any judicial \noversight. The laws explicitly permitting NSLs were meant to prevent \nfinancial institutions from being held liable for disclosing private \nfinancial information in contravention of Federal privacy laws. NSLs do \nnot require any court approval, and since 9/11 the Government has \nincreasingly relied on them to obtain information as part of terrorism \ninvestigations. Like recipients of section 215 orders, NSL recipients \nare subject to an automatic gag order. At least two Federal district \ncourts have found that NSL gag order restrictions and the lack of \njudicial review amount to constitutional violations under the fourth \nand first amendments.\n  The conference report attempts to address constitutional problems \nregarding NSLs by authorizing judicial review of NSLs and providing the \nability to challenge a nondisclosure order. However, while recipients \nare technically given the ability to go to court, the right is \nessentially meaningless. The conference report does allow an NSL \nrecipient to challenge the validity of an NSL in a district court, but \nit also stipulates that all of the Government's submissions are secret \nand cannot be shared with the person challenging the order. In \naddition, although the gag order can be challenged in court after 1 \nyear, like section 215 challenges, the only way to prevail is to \ndemonstrate that the Government is acting in bad faith because the \nGovernment's certification that disclosure would harm national security \nis conclusive.\n  The final compromise included in the Sununu bill does not address the \nsignificant problems with the NSL process, but rather makes some minor \nimprovements with regard to NSLs. Under the compromise, it would remove \nthe requirement that a person inform the FBI of the identity of an \nattorney providing advice to a NSL receipt. The compromise also \nclarifies that libraries are not subject to NSLs. Libraries, however, \nwould remain subject to section 215. I believe the compromise fails to \nprovide meaningful judicial review of NSL orders.\n  Finally, I also believe we missed an important opportunity to address \nthe so called sneak-and-peek provision, which allows the Government to \nsearch\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\nhomes without notifying individuals of the search for an extended \nperiod of time after the search.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the Senate floor and stated that \nthey share the same concerns that I do with regard to the shortcomings \nof this current compromise. Senator Sununu, who has been instrumental \nin negotiating this compromise with the White House, and Senator \nSpecter, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have indicated \ntheir intention to push legislation aimed at modifying the PATRIOT Act \nin a manner consistent with the bipartisan bill that the Senate \nunanimously passed in July.\n  Although I support these efforts, and I intend to support legislation \nthat would make these modifications, I am under no illusion that the \nSenate will take up any of these bills in the near future. Having just \nfinished debate on the PATRIOT Act, I do not believe that Congress \nwould have much of an appetite to take up this issue again. We had our \nopportunity, and, unfortunately, we missed it.\n  The changes that I would like to see made have the support of the \nmajority of Senators--indeed, they were included in the bill that \nunanimously passed the Senate. However, because the majority leader \nknew that these sensible changes would garner wide support, he used \nprocedural maneuvers to prevent any Senator from offering an amendment \nto fix the bill. Had these amendments been adopted, which I think it is \nfairly clear they would have, I would have voted for the conference \nreport without hesitation.\n  While I recognize that this bill will make some slight improvements \nwith respect to the PATRIOT Act, we have missed a critical opportunity \nto address the primary issues that have concerned the American public. \nAs I have discussed, the Government can still access the library \nrecords and medical records of Americans without having to show that \nthe documents sought have some connection to a suspected terrorist or \nthe activities of a terrorist. The conference report simply failed to \naddress the core shortcomings of some of the provisions in the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  I supported the improvements in the Sununu bill, but the analogy I \nwould use is this: If you need to fix the broken windows on your house \nand the repairman comes along and paints your house instead--has your \nhouse been improved? I would say yes, but your windows are still \nbroken. It is time for Congress to address the primary problems with \nthe PATRIOT Act, and it is my hope that we can eventually enact \ncommonsense reforms that enable the Government to fight terrorism in a \nmanner consistent with our Nation's historic commitment to upholding \nbasic civil liberties. I truly believe that the American people expect \nmore of Congress with regard to the approach we have taken in ensuring \nour national security while at the same time protecting the liberties \nof Americans.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I discuss the pending reauthorization of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act.\n  We are near the end of what has been a very long process. For the \npast year, Congress has grappled with the need to renew a handful of \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act. As my colleagues know well, this \nlegislation has embodied the debate over how to balance the needs of \nlaw enforcement in the war on terrorism and the paramount importance of \nprotecting Americans' civil liberties.\n  The greatest Americans have always understood our shared \nresponsibility as citizens of this great country to ensure that we get \nthis balance right. And many times over the course of the debate about \nthe PATRIOT Act, I have thought of Benjamin Franklin's words, ``They \nthat can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety \ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.'' I have thought about how Daniel \nWebster reminded us that ``God grants liberty only to those who love \nit, and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' I believe that it is \nworth taking pains to be sure that we produce the very best balance, \nand the very best legislation, we can.\n  Last week, several Senators with whom I have worked closely over the \npast year announced that they had reached an agreement with the White \nHouse on a proposal to renew these controversial provisions.\n  Let me say at the outset that I do not believe this agreement is by \nany means perfect. My colleagues who were involved in negotiating this \ncompromise would be the first to agree with me on that point.\n  But it does contain a number of critical improvements over the \noriginal law. Our ultimate goal was to place reasonable checks on the \nlaw enforcement powers provided by the original PATRIOT Act. Although \nit is not as strong in some areas as I would prefer, the legislation \ntoday accomplishes that goal.\n  This proposal would produce a PATRIOT Act that includes a number of \nspecific improvements over the law that was passed 4 years ago.\n  Section 215 of the original PATRIOT Act allowed the government to \nobtain business, library, and a whole host of other personal records \nsimply by claiming the records were related to a terrorism \ninvestigation. The current proposal provides greater protection for the \nmost sensitive records, by requiring senior level FBI-approval for \norders related to library, book, education, gun, medical or tax \nrecords, and by limiting the retention and dissemination of information \nregarding Americans.\n  The original law did not provide for judicial review of Section 215 \norders, National Security Letters, or for the accompanying gag orders. \nThe current proposal does.\n  The original law did not allow the recipient of a Section 215 order \nor a National Security Letter to consult with an attorney. The current \nproposal does.\n  The original law allowed delayed notification of property searches--\nso-called ``sneak-and-peek'' searches--for undefined ``reasonable'' \nperiods. The current proposal establishes hard limits on those delays, \nwhile continuing to allow extensions when they are warranted.\n  The original law allowed the government to target libraries with \nNational Security Letters. The legislation exempts libraries from NSLs \nunless they meet the statutory definition of an Electronic \nCommunications Service Provider.\n  The original law allowed the use of ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps, \nwhich don't specify the target or the phone or computer. The current \nproposal imposes limits on the use of such wiretaps.\n  Finally, the current proposal once again sunsets the Act's most \ncontroversial provisions--Section 215 and roving wiretaps--in 4 years, \nincreases public reporting requirements about the use of the powers \nauthorized by the Act, and requires the Inspector General in the \nDepartment of Justice to audit the use of Section 215 and National \nSecurity Letters.\n  These safeguards are not simply cosmetic; they make meaningful \nimprovements to the original law, and will go a long way toward \nprotecting Americans' rights and freedoms.\n  In spite of these safeguards, the proposal before us is not perfect. \nI would have preferred a stronger standard for obtaining a search order \nunder Section 215. I would have preferred that the expanded authority \nto issue National Security Letters be sunset. But we will have the \nopportunity to review these provisions--both with the sunsets contained \nin this legislation and its increased reporting and auditing \nrequirements. I am committed to taking advantage of those provisions to \nfight for strong and appropriate civil liberties safeguards, and I know \nmy colleagues are, too.\n  I joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to push for the \nvery best PATRIOT Act we could realistically get. We have come to the \npoint where the very best achievable version of the PATRIOT act is the \none before us.\n  I thank Senators Craig, Durbin, Sununu, Feingold, and Murkowski--my \nfellow SAFE Act cosponsors--for all of their hard work over the past \nseveral years on this critical issue. Without their efforts, we would \nnot have the civil liberties protections contained in this proposal. I \nexpress my sincere gratitude for allowing me to become involved in \nthese efforts.\n  The vote on this agreement by no means marks the end of this process. \nWhether or not we differ on the legislation before us, I know we will \ncontinue to work together to provide law enforcement with the tools \nthey need to fight terrorists, and to protect and preserve Americans' \nbasic rights and freedoms.\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\n  That has been, and will continue to be, a fight that demands our most \nvigorous efforts.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I oppose the conference report for H.R. \n3199, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005. This \nbill does not protect the cherished civil liberties and freedoms of the \nAmerican people.\n  I voted for the PATRIOT Act in 2001. I believed then, as I do now, \nthat we must give our Government the tools it needs to fight, detect, \nand deter terrorist acts. While I had reservations about the PATRIOT \nAct and the possibility that it would allow the Government to infringe \nupon our privacy rights and civil liberties, I supported the bill since \nthe more controversial provisions were not made permanent. Granting the \nGovernment this time-limited authority allowed Congress an opportunity \nto review how these broad new grants of power were being used.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has been less than forthcoming in \ndisclosing how the PATRIOT Act has been used. According to the reports \nwe have received, the Government has used the PATRIOT Act to:\n\n       investigate and prosecute crimes that are not terrorism \n     offenses;\n       investigate individuals without having any cause to believe \n     the person is involved in terrorist activities; and\n       coerce Internet Service Providers, ISP, to turn over \n     information about email activity and web surfing while \n     preventing the ISP from disclosing this abuse to the public. \n     This information is disturbing and may be indicative of other \n     abuses that the Justice Department has not told us about.\n\n  Given these abuses, meaningful checks and balances on the \nGovernment's authority to investigate Americans are essential. Last \nJuly the Senate agreed by unanimous consent to reauthorize the PATRIOT \nAct with substantially stronger protections in place. However, the \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives objected to the Senate \nbill and tried to pass a conference report lacking the protections that \nthe Senate insisted upon. Last month, a compromise bill was introduced, \nS. 2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of \n2006.\n  I voted for S. 2271 because it is an improvement over the PATRIOT \nAct. Any improvement is good. However, S. 2271 does not go far enough \nto correct the flaws in the PATRIOT Act and convince me that the \nchanges made to the underlying bill will preserve our civil liberties. \nS. 2271 will make explicit the right to counsel and the right to \nchallenge in court an order from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nFBI, to turn over records sought in an intelligence investigation, \ncalled section 215 orders, but it does not correct the underlying \nstandard for issuing these orders. As such, the FBI, after going before \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, Court, can demand a \nwide array of personal information--including medical, financial, \nlibrary, and bookstore and gun purchase records--about an individual \nwithout any cause to believe the person is involved in terrorist \nactivities. S. 2271 does provide an express right to challenge the gag \norder that accompanies a Section 215 order, but only after waiting a \nyear. However, if the Government certifies that the disclosure would \nharm national security, the gag order cannot be lifted.\n  S. 2271 would also remove the conference report's language requiring \nrecipients of National Security Letters, NSLs, to inform the FBI of the \nname of any attorney they consult about the demand for financial or \nInternet records. NSLs can be issued without FISA Court review. Again \nthe bill still does not require that there be any connection between \nthe records sought by the FBI and a suspected foreign terrorist or \nperson in contact with such a target. This is especially troubling \nsince news reports show that 30,000 NSLs are issued by the Government \nper year, a hundred-fold annual increase since the PATRIOT Act relaxed \nrequirements on the FBI's use of the power.\n  In 2003, the State legislature in my home State of Hawaii passed a \nresolution reaffirming its commitment to civil liberties and called the \nentire Hawaii congressional delegation to repeal any sections of the \nPATRIOT Act that limit or violate fundamental rights and liberties \nprotected by the Constitution of the United States. In good conscience \nI cannot vote to support the PATRIOT Act because I believe that it \nallows the Government to infringe upon the rights and protections we \nhold most dear.\n  I do not believe that the PATRIOT Act makes our Nation safer. It \nmakes our country weaker by eroding the very freedoms that define us. \nAs Thomas Jefferson said, ``The man who would choose security over \nfreedom deserves neither.'' I am afraid that by passing this \nlegislation today we will in fact have neither a more secure nation nor \nthe freedoms for which we are fighting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for the conference report because \non balance I believe it is necessary legislation to give our law \nenforcement officials the tools they need to protect the American \npeople from terrorist attacks. Before the Patriot Act, various law \nenforcement agencies did not have the ability to share information and \nwork together, and this was a vulnerability that needed to be fixed \nafter\n9/11.\n  But this was a difficult decision. The bill had flaws, and two in \nparticular concern me the most the so-called ``sneak and peek'' and \nlibrary search provisions. Given my concerns about these provisions, I \nvoted for every opportunity to make further improvements to the bill.\n  But ultimately I believe that by voting for the conference report I \nwill be in a stronger position to help improve the Patriot Act in the \nfuture, working with Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter, Ranking \nMember Leahy and Senators Feingold and Sununu.\n  I also wanted to show my support for Senator Dianne Feinstein's anti-\nmethamphetamine bill, which was included in the conference report. Meth \nhas become a terrible scourge across our country and Senator \nFeinstein's bill will go a long way to combat the spread of the drug by \nrestricting access to the ingredients used to make meth.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that this conference \nagreement includes important provisions which will provide critical new \ntools and resources to help combat methamphetamine--one of the \ndeadliest, most powerfully addictive, and rapidly spreading drug \nthreats facing our country. Fighting meth requires a comprehensive \napproach designed to assist States, local law enforcement and \nprosecutors to crack down on cooks and traffickers of meth while \nbolstering community education and awareness and expanding treatment \noptions for those addicted to this dangerous drug. As a cosponsor of \nthe underlying Combat Meth Act that was incorporated in this conference \nagreement, I believe our action today is long overdue.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the meth scourge, especially in rural \nareas, is egregious. Like many States, Illinois faces the daunting \nchallenge of trying to stay one step ahead of those who will go to any \nlength to procure the ingredients to make their drugs.\n  Just a year ago, a law took effect in Illinois which required placing \nadult-strength cold tablets containing ephedrine or as their only \nactive ingredient behind store counters. The law also limited to two \npackages per transaction the purchase of adult-strength cold tablets \ncontaining ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as the sole active ingredient \nand tablets with ephedrine or pseudoephedrine in combination with other \nactive ingredients. Additionally, the law required education and \ntraining for retail sales personnel. At that time, the Illinois law was \namong the toughest in the Nation and the strongest law among our border \nStates.\n  However, after that date, several States passed laws more restrictive \nthan the Illinois law, and reports from law enforcement authorities \nindicated that meth makers from Missouri, Iowa, Kentucky and nearby \nStates were coming to Illinois to purchase products. Incidents such as \nthese led to enactment in November 2005 of the Methamphetamine \nPrecursor Control Act to impose stricter controls on the display and \nsale of cold and sinus products containing meth's key ingredient \npseudoephedrine. The Attorney General of Illinois, Lisa Madigan, has \ninstituted and operates an aggressive anti-meth program in partnership \nwith law enforcement agencies and multi-country drug task forces.\n  The facts and figures about the devastating impact of meth in \nIllinois underscore why our actions today to advance tough new \nprovisions and funding authorization are so vital.\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\n  The number of meth labs seized by law enforcement authorities in \nIllinois grew from 24 labs in 1997, to 403 labs in 2000, to 1,099 labs \nin 2003. Illinois State Police reported 962 lab seizures in 2004 and \nnearly 1000 meth labs in 2005, more than double the number uncovered in \n2000. Since 1997, the quantity of methamphetamines seized annually by \nthe ISP has increased over tenfold.\n  The number of methamphetamine submissions to the Illinois State \nPolice crime laboratories increased from 628 in 1998 to 3,250 in 2003--\nmore than a five-fold increase. The number of counties submitting meth \nalso increased during that period, from 73 in 1998 to 96 in 2003. In \n2004, Byrne grants helped Illinois cops make almost 1,267 meth-related \narrests and seize approximately 348,923 grams of methamphetamines. \nLocal police departments depend on Byrne grant funding to participate \nin meth task forces which tackle the meth problem by coordinating the \nenforcement and interdiction efforts of local agencies within regional \nareas. In fact, over 65 percent of Illinois's Byrne funding in 2004 \nwent to local law enforcement agencies.\n  The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group pays almost half of its \nagents with funding from Byrne grants. In 2004, this regional task \nforce was responsible for more than 27 percent of the State's meth lab \nseizures. In a recent success of Byrne grant funding, Glen Carbon \nPolice coordinated with the Illinois State Police Meth Task Force to \ndiscover the largest lab in the village's history. In this incident, \nlocal authorities raided a meth lab that proved to be capable of \nproducing up to 6,000 grams of finished methamphetamine. Given examples \nsuch as this, it is baffling that this administration seeks to \neliminate these critical funds in its budget proposal.\n  Methamphetamine is the only drug for which rural areas in Illinois \nhave higher rates of drug seizures and treatment admissions than urban \nareas. Meth use, and the number of people behind bars for possessing, \nmaking or selling it, has grown rapidly over the past decade in \nIllinois. Just 5 years ago, 79 inmates entered State prisons on meth \noffenses. Last year, that number was 541. In fiscal year 2003, rural \ncounties accounted for the vast majority, 79 percent, of persons \nsentenced to prison for meth-related offenses. The number of treatment \nadmissions relating to methamphetamine abuse in Illinois jumped from 97 \nin 1994 to 3,582 in 2003.\n  Another disturbing implication is the effect on families. In 2004, \nmore than half of the children entering foster care in some areas of \nrural southeastern Illinois were forced into the program because their \ncaretakers were meth abusers. Officials expect to encounter even more \nchildren in homes where meth labs exist in coming years.\n  When specific regions were examined, findings indicate that rural \ncounties have experienced the greatest impact of methamphetamine. Rural \ncounties have been greatly impacted by the presence and growth of \nmethamphetamine, and are responsible for driving the escalating levels \nof methamphetamine arrests, drug seizures and submissions, clandestine \nlab seizures, methamphetamine commitments to Illinois Department of \nCorrections and methamphetamine treatment admissions.\n  Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority statistics show that \nin 2003, the per capita occurrence of clandestine meth labs in rural \ncounties was over 1700 percent greater than it is in non-rural areas. \nThe per capita presence of meth in rural areas in over 500 percent \ngreater than it is in non-rural areas; more than 73 percent of meth \nlabs found in the State of Illinois were found in rural counties. Of \n366 felony arrests in Edgar County, IL, 145 were for methamphetamine.\n  But urban areas are not immune to the meth crisis. The perception \nthat meth labs are a rural issue ended when a major meth lab was \ndiscovered in a Chicago apartment building last September. The \nchallenge we face is overwhelming and our actions today signal a \ncommitment to support a concerted effort to tackle this urgent criminal \njustice and public health and safety challenge.\n  I commend the tireless and tenacious leadership of Senators Talent \nand Feinstein who have labored long and hard to secure passage of a \nstrong Combat Meth Act. I look forward to working with them to ensure \nthat full funding is provided to implement these new tools and provide \nthe needed resources to localities grappling with this drug crisis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr President, when the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill \nleft the Senate last July, we had a bill with provisions that protected \nboth our security and our liberty. What came back to the Senate from \nthe House-Senate conference committee was a bill that raised \nsignificant concerns for Senators from both sides of the aisle. As a \nresult, the Senate did not vote to end debate in December, as Senators \nwanted more time to address those concerns.\n  The PATRIOT Act conference report which is before us leaves major \nproblems unaddressed. Among the conference report's flaws: Section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act permits the Government to seek court orders, to \ncompel the production of any tangible thing, including library, medical \nand business records, in foreign intelligence investigations, including \nrecords of people who are totally innocent even of any allegation of \nimpropriety. The conference report omits language in the Senate-passed \nbill establishing a reasonable standard for the FBI to obtain these \nsensitive records with Section 215 orders. And to make matters worse, \nthe conference report permits the FBI to include gag orders that \npreclude the recipient from telling anyone they even received the \norder. The conference report does not even permit recipients to \nchallenge those gag orders in court. Also, the conference report \nrequires recipients section 215 orders to tell the FBI, if asked, from \nwhom they have sought legal advice.\n  Since December, there have been a number of efforts to improve the \nconference report. Unfortunately, those have met with limited success. \nThe Sununu bill, if it passes the House of Representatives, would make \nonly minimal improvements to the conference report that the Senate \nconsidered last December.\n  The Sununu bill, if it passes the House, would eliminate the \nrequirement that recipients of 215 court orders tell the FBI, if asked, \nwhom they consulted for legal advice. This would be a worthwhile, if \nminor, improvement. The Sununu bill also provides people the right to \nchallenge gag orders attached to so-called section 215 court orders. \nBut the benefit of that is offset by the fact that the bill severely \nconstrains the court's discretion to modify or set aside those gag \norders.\n  Some argue the conference report is an improvement over the original \nPATRIOT Act. The bill before us does indeed correct some of the flaws \nin the original PATRIOT Act. For example, the PATRIOT Act did not \nrequire that a roving wiretap order identify a specific target--raising \nconcerns that it could authorize so-called John Doe roving wiretaps. I \nam pleased that the conference accepted language that I proposed to \ncorrect that flaw.\n  However, too many flaws remain, the most serious of which is the \nstandard of review section 215 court orders.\n\n  As I said earlier, section 215 of the PATRIOT Act permits the \nGovernment to seek court orders, to compel the production of any \ntangible thing, including library, medical and business records, in \nforeign intelligence investigations. No problem there. However, under \nsection 215, the Government need not describe, much less identify, a \nparticular person to whom the records relate, even in general terms, as \nlinked to a terrorist groups or organization. I believe that we ought \nto apply the same logic to section 215 orders that the conference \nreport applies to roving wiretaps. We ought to require that records \nsought with section 215 orders have some connection to an alleged \nterrorist or terrorist organization. Unfortunately, the standard in the \nconference report does not include that. It fails to narrow the scope \nof records that the Government can subpoena under section 215 to less \nthan the entire universe of records of people who, for instance, \npatronize a library or visit a doctor's office. Instead, fishing \nexpeditions are authorized, which could result in invasions of the \nprivacy of large numbers of innocent Americans.\n  Let's assume the FBI has information that a person, whose identity is \nnot known to the FBI, is using computers at New York public libraries \nto view certain Web sites.\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n  The FBI only knows that the person has knowledge of the particular \nWeb sites. The person is not suspected of wrongdoing himself. The FBI \nwants to find out the person's identity as part of a foreign \nintelligence investigation into those Web sites. The agency believes \nthat they might be able to identify the person if they could review all \nthe computer user records held by public libraries in New York.\n  The conference report would presumably permit the FBI to obtain a \ncourt order compelling the New York Public library to provide the \nrecords of all their patrons. That is truly a fishing expedition. The \nconference report would also allow the FBI to prohibit the library from \ntelling patrons that their names had been handed over to the FBI. While \nthe Sununu bill permits the library to challenge that prohibition in \ncourt, it does not permit meaningful court review because, under its \nterms, if the Attorney General or another specified senior official \ncertifies that disclosure may endanger national security or harm \ndiplomatic relations, the court must find bad faith on the part of the \nGovernment in making such certification for the court to modify or set \naside the nondisclosure requirement. This virtually eliminates the \ncourt's discretion.\n  Another example. Assume the FBI has information that a person, whose \nidentity is not known to the agency, is sending money to charitable \norganizations overseas. They know from a credible source that the \nperson is being treated for HIV at a particular AIDS clinic in New York \nthat has 10,000 patients. The FBI wants to find out the person's \nidentity as part of a foreign intelligence investigation into links \nbetween unspecified overseas charities and terrorist organizations. The \nagency believes that they might be able to identify the person if they \ncould review the AIDS clinic's 10,000 patient files.\n\n  The conference report would permit the FBI to obtain a court order \ncompelling the AIDS clinic to provide the files of all of its patients. \nThe conference report would allow the FBI to prohibit the AIDS clinic \nfrom telling its patients that their names had been handed over to the \nFBI. While the Sununu bill permits the clinic to challenge that \nprohibition in court, as I discussed earlier, it does not permit \nmeaningful court review because the Attorney General's unilateral \ncertification would have to be found by the court to have been made in \nbad faith for the gag order to be lifted.\n  It is argued in response to the fishing expedition argument that the \nGovernment must set forth ``facts'' supporting a section 215 \napplication. But that requirement doesn't fix the fishing expedition \nflaw. I just set forth facts, in two hypotheticals. If those \nhypothetical facts would not support a broad search of the library or \nclinic's records, the supporters should say what language in the \nconference report would preclude a search.\n  When this bill left the Senate, it contained protections against \nfishing expeditions. The Senate bill required a showing that the \nrecords sought were not only relevant to an investigation but also \neither pertained to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, \nwhich term includes terrorist organizations, or were relevant to the \nactivities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject \nof an authorized investigation or pertained to an individual in contact \nwith or known to be a suspected agent. In other words, the order had to \nbe linked to some suspected individual or foreign power. Those \nimportant protections are omitted in the bill before us.\n  Some kind of narrowing language needs to be included in the PATRIOT \nAct for section 215 orders, just as it was when this bill left the \nSenate. Without that language and that linkage, the PATRIOT Act \nauthorizes the rankest kind of fishing expedition.\n  The conference report is also flawed in its treatment of national \nsecurity letters, or NSLs. NSLs compel phone companies and banks, for \nexample, to turn over certain customer records. The Government can \nissue an NSL without going to court. And, like section 215 court \norders, the Government does not have to show any connection between the \nrecords sought and an individual who the Government thinks is a \nterrorist. And like section 215 orders, the Government can impose a gag \norder on the recipient of an NSL. Also, in the case of NSLs, the \nconference report does not permit meaningful judicial review of those \ngag orders.\n\n  Also troubling about the NSL authority is that there is no \nrequirement that the Government destroy records acquired with an NSL \nthat turn out to be irrelevant to the investigation under which they \nhave been gathered. These are records that relate to innocent \nAmericans, and the Government should be required to destroy them if \nthey contain no relevant material.\n  It is argued that while these protections were in the bill that left \nthe Senate, they are not in current law. That is true. But the reason \nwe put sunset provisions in the law is so we could more reliably make \nchanges if experience indicated the need for change. We understandably \nacted quickly after 9/11 to fill some holes in our laws that needed to \nbe filled. We added sunset provisions so we could review the law we \nwrote with the benefit of greater thought, in an atmosphere more \nconducive to protecting our liberties than understandably was the \nsituation immediately after a horrific, wrenching, deadly attack.\n  Finally, I must comment on a tactic used in this debate which runs \nagainst the very grain of the Senate. The majority leader used a \nprocedural tactic to prevent any Senator from offering any amendment \nduring consideration of the Sununu bill, amendments which could have \naddressed some of the flaws I just described. That tactic of stifling \nconsideration of any amendment is contrary to the normal procedures of \nthe Senate and reflects poorly on what is sometimes billed as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. The rules of the Senate were \nwritten with the intent of allowing the consideration of amendments. In \nthis instance, the rules were misused to block any effort to offer \namendments. I voted against ending debate on the Sununu bill and \nagainst proceeding to debate on the PATRIOT Act conference report \nbecause no amendments were allowed to be considered.\n  This conference report still falls short of what the American people \nexpect Congress to achieve in defending their rights while we are \nadvancing their security. As a result, although I support many of its \nprovisions, I must oppose it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the USA PATRIOT \nImprovement and Reauthorization Act conference report. I support the \nconference report and, in particular, the conference report's \namendments to section 215, the FISA business records provision, because \nthose amendments confirm that investigators may use section 215 to \nobtain records and other tangible items that are relevant to any \nauthorized national security investigation other than a threat \nassessment. The conference report appropriately balances privacy \nconcerns and national security needs by amending the method by which \ninvestigators can obtain relevant records but not changing or otherwise \nlimiting the scope of records that can be obtained through a section \n215 order. For example, where appropriate, investigators may still \nobtain sensitive records such as library or bookstore, medical, or tax \nreturn records, but they must obtain very high-level sign-off \ninternally before asking the court to order those records' production. \nSimilarly, the conference report imposes an obligation on the Attorney \nGeneral to develop minimization guidelines for the retention and \ndissemination of U.S. person information obtained through a section 215 \norder, but leaves the Department with flexibility in obtaining the \ninformation in the first instance and in structuring those minimization \nprocedures.\n  My support for the conference report turns on my understanding that \nit codifies our intent not to limit the scope of items and records that \ncan be obtained through section 215. This stands in contrast to the so-\ncalled ``three-part test'' that passed the Senate last year, which \nreally did run the risk of limiting our investigators' ability to \nobtain records relevant to authorized national security investigations. \nThe conference report is clear: we are continuing to provide our \ninvestigators with the tools they need. Along with two of my fellow \nconferees, Senators Roberts and Sessions, I sent a letter to Chairman \nSpecter on the eve of the conference vigorously objecting to the \nSenate's proposed three-\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\npart test. As the three of us expressed in that letter, we believed \nthat requiring use of the three-part test to show relevance would have \nbeen a serious mistake. I am pleased to see that the final conference \nreport does not mandate the use of that test. I will have that letter \nadded to the Record following my remarks.\n  I support the conference report, including its amendments to section \n206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which authorizes ``roving'' wiretap orders \nunder FISA because I believe that the amendments to section 206 do not \nhamper investigators' ability to use this critical tool. In this day \nand age of sophisticated terrorists and spies who are trained to thwart \nsurveillance, allowing investigators to seek a wiretap that follows a \nspecified target--rather than a particular cell phone--is critical. The \nconference report explicitly preserves this ability, while clarifying \nthe level of detail necessary for investigators to obtain this type of \nwiretap. Similarly, I support the conference report's amendments to \nsection 206 because they recognize that there may be some situations \nwhere it will not be practicable for investigators to return to court \nwithin 10 days of directing surveillance at a new phone or place. The \nconference report wisely affords the FISA Court judges discretion to \nextend the period of time investigators will have to keep the court \napprised of how roving wiretaps are being used.\n  I support the conference report, and I support the amendments set out \nin S. 2271, because I think they set out the proper standard for \njudicial review of nondisclosure orders accompanying section 215 FISA \nbusiness records orders and national security letters. We all recognize \nthe need for secrecy in national security investigations--both to avoid \ntipping off targets in a particular case, and to avoid giving our \nenemies a better picture of how we conduct our investigations. Our \nenemies are sophisticated and devote enormous time and energy to \nunderstanding how we operate, all in service of allowing their agents \nto evade our investigations. The conference report recognizes the need \nfor secrecy when the Government obtains a section 215 order from a \ncourt or serves an NSL on a business. But it also responds to concerns \nraised that recipients should have an explicit right to judicial review \nof nondisclosure orders.\n  The standard in the conference report is the appropriate one, both \nconstitutionally and practically, as it recognizes that sensitive \nnational security and diplomatic relations judgments are particularly \nwithin the Executive's expertise. The Constitution has vested these \ndeterminations with the Executive, and courts have long recognized that \njudges are ill-suited to be second-guessing the Executive's national \nsecurity and diplomatic affairs judgments. Disclosures that seem \ninnocuous to a judge who quite naturally must view those disclosures \nwithout being fully aware of the many other data points known to our \nenemies--may nonetheless be quite damaging. The conference report's \nstandard is therefore the correct one. It will be the exceedingly rare \ncase in which a judge will find, contrary to a certification by an \nexecutive branch official, that there is no reason to believe that the \nnondisclosure order should remain in place. It will be even rarer for a \njudge to find that one of the Senate-confirmed officials designated in \nthe conference report has acted in bad faith.\n  I could not have supported the conference report or the explicit \njudicial review of nondisclosure orders if I thought that they would \ngive judges the power to second-guess the informed national security \nand diplomatic relations judgments of our high-level executive branch \nofficials. The conference report makes clear that judges will not have \nsuch discretion, which is why I am voting for this report.\n  Another provision in particular that I support is the new public \nreporting obligations for the FBI's use of national security letters. \nThat reporting will allow Congress to better perform our oversight \nobligations without endangering national security. The reporting \nrequirement is focused on what is the most relevant number to Congress \nand the public--the aggregate number of different U.S., persons about \nwhom information is requested. The reporting requirement does not \nrequire the FBI to break down the aggregate numbers in its report by \nthe different authorities that allowed the national security letters, \nwhich is critical to preventing our enemies from gaining too much \ninformation about the way we investigate threats to the national \nsecurity. And the reporting obligation is limited to information about \nU.S. persons. I support this limited public reporting because I think \nit will provide valuable information for our public debate--but without \nrevealing too much information about the FBI's use of this valuable \ntool and thus compromising its use.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the November 3 letter to Chairman \nSpecter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: We are writing to express our \n     concern about legislative language that we understand that \n     you are considering adding to section 215 of the USA Patriot \n     Act, the business-records provision of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act. We have learned that you have \n     discussed with Chairman Sensenbrenner the possibility of \n     adopting in the final bill a modified version of the three-\n     part test for ``relevance'' that was added to the Senate bill \n     when it was marked up in the Judiciary Committee.\n       We believe that adding the three-part test to the final \n     bill would be a serious mistake. We are deeply troubled by \n     the complications that this language might cause for future \n     anti-terrorism investigations. Given the continuing grave \n     nature of the terrorist threat to the United States, and the \n     complete absence of any verified abuses under the Patriot Act \n     since it was enacted, we believe that congress should be \n     strengthening, not diluting, the investigative powers given \n     to United States intelligence agents. We would have great \n     difficulty supporting a conference report that adds the \n     three-part test to section 215.\n       As you know, Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act allows the FBI to \n     seek an order from the FISA court for ``the production of \n     tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, \n     and other items) for an investigation to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information.'' FISA defines ``foreign \n     intelligence'' as information relating to foreign espionage, \n     foreign sabotage, or international terrorism, or information \n     respecting a foreign power that relates to U.S. national \n     security or foreign policy.\n       Section 215 is basically a form of subpoena authority, \n     albeit one whose use requires pre-approval by a judge. As \n     then-Deputy Attorney General Comey noted, ``orders for \n     records under [Sec. 215] are more closely scrutinized and \n     more difficult to obtain than ordinary grand jury subpoenas, \n     which can require production of the very same records, but \n     without judicial approval.'' Similarly, the Washington Post \n     has noted in an editorial regarding Sec. 215 that similar \n     authority ``existed prior to the Patriot Act; the law extends \n     it to national security investigations, which isn't \n     unreasonable.''\n       Some critics of the Patriot Act have noted that it \n     currently does not require a finding that a Sec. 215 order be \n     relevant to a foreign-intelligence investigation. The Justice \n     Department has conceded in litigation that a subpoena must be \n     relevant to a legitimate investigation, and both the Senate \n     and House bills add an explicit relevance requirement to the \n     Patriot Act.\n       The final Senate bill goes further, however. The night \n     before the committee mark up of the bill, a set of additional \n     changes to the bill was proposed in order to address \n     continuing Justice Department concerns and to appease the \n     Democrats, who had filed in excess of 80 amendments to the \n     bill. This final managers' amendment included, among other \n     things, a three-part test for determining whether a Sec. 215 \n     subpoena is, in fact, relevant to a foreign-intelligence \n     investigation.\n       We appreciate the need to move this bill expeditiously and \n     to avoid an extended debate over amendments in the Judiciary \n     Committee. It had been our understanding, however, that the \n     last-minute changes that were made to the bill in order to \n     speed legislative progress would be re-evaluated in \n     conference. And we believe that the three-part test that was \n     added to Sec. 215 is unsound.\n       The three-part test, as we understand its latest iteration, \n     would require the FBI to show, before a Sec. 215 subpoena may \n     issue, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \n     records that are sought either pertain to, are relevant to \n     the activities of, or pertain to an individual in contact \n     with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power.\n       We have several questions about the language of the three-\n     part test. To begin with the first part, what does it mean \n     for information to ``pertain'' to a foreign power or its \n     agent? How is this standard different from the traditional \n     relevance test? Obviously, all foreign-intelligence \n     information in some way relates to a foreign power--FISA \n     expressly defines ``foreign intelligence'' in terms of \n     foreign powers and their activities. Does all information \n     that is relevant to a foreign-intelligence investigation \n     therefore also ``pertain'' to a foreign power? If it does, \n     what is\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\n     the purpose of the three-part test? And if the two standards \n     are not co-extensive, what investigations are blocked by the \n     three-part test, and are these investigations something that \n     we want to block?\n       Similarly, what is the scope of the ``activities'' of a \n     suspected agent of a foreign power? Does it include \n     activities in which one suspects that a foreign agent might \n     generally be involved, without regard to a specific subset of \n     dates, times, and locations? Also, has the FBI ever \n     subpoenaed records in the course of an intelligence \n     investigation that did not relate to the activities of a \n     suspected foreign agent, but which nevertheless were relevant \n     to a foreign-intelligence investigation? Also, are there \n     likely scenarios that would meet the relevance test but that \n     do not relate to the activities of a foreign power? If so, we \n     should inform ourselves about these past cases and scenarios, \n     and ask whether we would want to preclude an FBI \n     investigation in those circumstances.\n       Finally, what does it mean for a person to be ``in contact \n     with'' or ``known to'' a suspected foreign agent? Does \n     ``contact'' require a showing of communication between the \n     two, or mere association? If association is sufficient, must \n     it be recurring? And if a single instance of association is \n     sufficient, how long must that association last? Also, what \n     is the purpose of the language requiring that the ultimate \n     target of the subpoena be ``known to'' an agent of a foreign \n     power? This language appears to preclude a subpoena if the \n     FBI can show only that the foreign agent is known to the \n     target, but not that the target is known to the foreign \n     agent. Is this distinction intentional? Also, this part \n     appears to bar investigations of targets who are seeking to \n     make contact with a foreign power but have not yet \n     consummated that contact. Do we want to bar the use of \n     Sec. 215 in such circumstances?\n       Although we would hope that the three-part test would be \n     construed broadly by the FISA court, we would expect that \n     court to conclude that the test significantly retracts the \n     permissible scope of FISA subpoenas. First, the court \n     inevitably would assume that congress added the three-part \n     test to the statute because it perceived a need to \n     restrict the use Sec. 215. Further, the canon of statutory \n     of construction that each part of a statute should be \n     interpreted so that it has independent meaning also \n     recommends a narrow interpretation of the three-part test. \n     If each part of the three-part test is to have independent \n     meaning, it must restrict investigations to a greater \n     extent than does the relevance test. It thus seems to us \n     inevitable that if we adopt the three-part test, that test \n     will bar some significant subset of investigations that \n     otherwise would be permitted by current law and the \n     relevance test.\n       Just as important as the substantive limits created by the \n     three-part test, however, are the bureaucratic burdens that \n     it certainly will entail. One of the consistent lessons \n     taught by all of the investigations of the failures that led \n     the 9/11 attacks is that seemingly small or technical \n     barriers can make a critical difference to the success of a \n     terrorism investigation.\n       In two separate instances that we now know of, federal \n     investigators were in close pursuit of 9/11 conspirators \n     prior to the attacks and might have been able to uncover or \n     even disrupt the plot. In each instance, however, these \n     investigations were seriously--perhaps critically--undermined \n     by bureaucratic barriers that few would have thought \n     significant before 9/11. Several weeks before the attacks, \n     federal agents in Minneapolis had arrested Zacarias Moussaoui \n     and sought a FISA warrant to search his belongings, which we \n     now know included the names of two 9/11 hijackers and a high-\n     level organizer of the attacks who later was captured in \n     Pakistan. The FBI was unable to obtain that warrant, however, \n     because at the time FISA required that the target of the \n     warrant be an agent of a foreign power--apparent lone-wolf \n     terrorists such as Moussaoui, even when believed to be \n     involved in international terrorism, could not be the target \n     of a FISA warrant. Similarly, two weeks before the 9/11 \n     attacks, federal agents learned that Khalid Al-Midhar, one of \n     the eventual suicide pilots, was in the United States. Based \n     on his past Al Qaeda associations, these agents understood \n     that Al-Midhar was dangerous and they immediately initiated a \n     search for him. These intelligence agents were barred from \n     seeking assistance from the FBI's Criminal Division, however, \n     because of the legal wall that at that time barred \n     cooperation between intelligence and criminal investigators.\n       We understand that you and Chairman Sensenbrenner are \n     considering adopting the three-part test as a permissive \n     presumption, and that you would also allow the issuance of \n     Sec. 215 orders that meet the relevance test but not the \n     three-part test so long as those orders are subject to \n     minimization procedures. Though such a system apparently \n     would eventually allow any relevant investigation to go \n     forward, its ultimate effect would be to greatly complicate \n     the process of obtaining a Sec. 215 order. Current law simply \n     requires a showing of relevance to an intelligence \n     investigation. The proposed system, in addition to its \n     alternative procedures and presumptions, introduces a host of \n     legal issues discussed earlier. These issues not only will \n     generate litigation, but will also produce considerable legal \n     and operational aversion to the use of Sec. 215.\n       We think that it is inevitable that in some cases, agents \n     will be dissuaded from or delayed in seeking a Sec. 215 \n     subpoena by the burdens created by this proposed system. The \n     risk may appear insignificant that these additional burdens \n     would fatally undermine a critical anti-terrorism \n     investigation. But again, the legal and technical barriers \n     that seriously undercut the pre-9/11 Moussaoui and Al-Midhar \n     investigations also must have seemed minor at that time. When \n     agents are investigating a particular suspect, they typically \n     will have no way of knowing if he is a lead to discovering a \n     major terrorist conspiracy. Even the Moussaoui and Al-Midhar \n     investigators could not have known the importance of their \n     efforts. Thus even when a bureaucratic barrier can be \n     overcome, it is easy to envision how it might cause \n     investigators to abandon pursuit of one target in favor of \n     competing targets, or to give that target a lower priority.\n       We appreciate that Sec. 215 has become controversial in the \n     debate over the Patriot Act--that it is one of the few \n     provisions specifically attacked by so-called civil liberties \n     groups and in newspaper editorials. We understand the appeal \n     of doing something that would appease these parties. \n     Nevertheless, we believe that higher priorities must be given \n     precedence in this case. Absent real evidence of abuse, we \n     should not legislate on the basis of hypothetical scenarios. \n     Our national-security investigators abide by the rules \n     governing their conduct. We should provide them with all of \n     the tools to do their jobs that are constitutionally \n     available--especially when those tools already are available \n     to agents conducting ordinary criminal investigations.\n       Few things would cause us greater regret than if another \n     major terrorist attack were to occur on United States soil, \n     and we were later to discover that procedural roadblocks that \n     we had adopted in this conference report substantially \n     impeded an investigation that might have prevented that \n     attack. Again, we strongly urge you to oppose adding the \n     proposed three-part test to Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act, and \n     we note that we would have great difficulty supporting a \n     conference report that includes such a provision.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jon Kyl,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Pat Roberts,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Jeff Sessions,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, once again, I want to congratulate \nChairman Specter and Chairman Roberts for their extraordinary work in \nforging a conference report on the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT \nAct. I have previously expressed disappointment that many concessions \nwere made during this process which I believe have resulted in a bill \nfar weaker than the original PATRIOT Act which passed overwhelmingly in \nresponse to the terrorist attacks of 9-11 and which represented long-\noverdue modernization of our intelligence and criminal investigative \ntechniques. Similarly, this bill is far weaker than that agreed to \nafter the hard work of the House-Senate conferees.\n  Nevertheless, our failure to pass this important extension would once \nagain relegate America's intelligence and criminal professionals to the \ndark ages of investigative techniques, shackle them with outdated \nconstraints, and prevent them from finding and stopping those who are \nintent on murder, terror, and the ultimate annihilation of Western \ncivilization.\n  Arguments against the PATRIOT Act have been largely, if not wholly, \nwithout factual basis. They are premised upon a misperception of what \nprotects our liberties. For the last 5 years, it has been the PATRIOT \nAct which has, at once, helped to keep us safe and to protect our \nConstitutional rights and liberties. Those liberties have not been \njeopardized by expanded governmental authority, but by violent attacks \nagainst our way of life by terrorists. Those who have systematically \nworked to weaken this important bill, and who, even now oppose it, \nhave, in my view, lost site of that reality, whether intentionally or \nnot.\n  The PATRIOT Act represented long-overdue reforms of both our criminal \nand intelligence investigative laws. It modernized outmoded and \nantiquated law enforcement provisions and provided for commonsense law \nenforcement at its best. The provisions of the PATRIOT Act have been \nresponsibly and appropriately utilized by the dedicated men and women \nof Federal law enforcement and the intelligence community to accomplish \namazing victories in the war on terrorism.\n  In my earlier statement in support of the conference report on \nDecember 19, 2005, I outlined in detail case after case in which \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act had been utilized to identify and \nsuccessfully prosecute terror-criminals and to thwart terrorist plots \ndesigned to harm Americans. I will not recount\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\nthose cases again here, but suffice it to say that the PATRIOT Act has, \nin very tangible ways kept us safe and free.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to vote for this reauthorization, even \nas we work to remove the burdensome restrictions on law enforcement and \nintelligence professionals which have been imposed on them during this \nrenewal process. We owe that much to them and to the future generations \nof the free peoples of the world. We must not shrink from that solemn \nobligation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am confronted with a very difficult \ndecision. There are rarely easy answers in the Senate and today is no \nexception. The healthy debate we have had in this body over the last \nfew days has been vigorous and valuable.\n  Today, we have a solemn obligation to protect our Nation from those \nwho may bring terror into our homes. At the same time, we have a \nresponsibility to respect our rights and honor our privacy. These \nprinciples are not mutually exclusive: we can and must achieve both.\n  This is one of the most significant pieces of legislation shaping our \nability to resist and eliminate terrorist activity on our home front. \nOur actions today will have tremendous consequences in the lives of all \nAmericans in months, years, and decades ahead.\n  I am proud that in the rush and passions surrounding this bill, I \nhave worked with my colleagues to insist on a serious, patient, and \ntransparent debate in the Senate as we strive to find the right balance \nbetween protecting our civil liberties and fighting terrorism.\n  Despite my reservations and after great deliberation, I support \nreauthorization today.\n  I believe that we must not allow the PATRIOT Act to expire. With new \nprovisions and improved meaningful oversight secured at last, empower \nour national leaders and policy makers with the accountability, wisdom, \nand prudence to use this legislation's powers in a way that does not \nundermine the freedoms we seek to protect.\n  Under provisions of this conference report, the Federal Government \nmust now provide public information on its use of intelligence \ngathering tools like national security letters and FISA warrants. What \nis more, this legislation provides for formal audits of these programs. \nWe must play close attention in order to learn lessons of the past and \nprevent abuse in the future.\n  I will join my colleagues in strongly pursuing additional sunset \nprovisions I believe should have been included in this bill, to give \nCongress the opportunity to reassess whether these tools are yielding \nthe intended results in the war on terror.\n  We have already made some critical reforms to implement meaningful \noversight. We have managed to get some of the most controversial \nprovisions to sunset in another 4 years, despite the administration's \ndesire to make them permanent. We have started with sunsets on the \nroving wiretaps and record requests from businesses and libraries. They \nare not enough, but they are a start.\n  Because of an important vote we took yesterday, we have removed \nAmerica's libraries from the purview of national security letters. \nWe're allowing recipients of records requests to challenge the gag \norders on the requests and have removed disclosure requirements for the \nnames of attorneys assisting with those challenges. We are seeing \nimprovements on disclosure for ``sneak and peek'' warrants.\n\n  But I want to be clear, new powers must not be allowed to chip away \nat traditional privacy rights. We must closely watch how law \nenforcement uses these tools and be prepared to confront all abuses.\n  I believe that many provisions of the bill, particularly those \nsections dealing with electronic eavesdropping and computer trespass, \nremain seriously flawed and may infringe on civil liberties. And that \nis why I will continue our work to improve these protections even as we \nimplement them.\n  At a time when we are making permanent broad powers for our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities without the full traditional \nsafeguards of judicial review and congressional oversight my concerns \nhave been exacerbated, truthfully, by the administration's explicit \nattempts to go around both the courts and the Congress with their \nwiretapping and secret listening posts.\n  So as the FBI and other agencies continue to expand and evolve, so \nwill their powers. We will continue to ask who should be watching the \nwatchers in oversight.\n  There is clearly more work to be done--Chairman Arlen Specter and \nRanking Member Pat Leahy have worked together and are introducing \nlegislation that addresses many of my outstanding concerns. I will be \non that bill--we have made meaningful reforms.\n  I also want to thank Senator Feingold for his continued dogged \nsupport for reform of this bill. I want him to know that I stand with \nhim in the battle to gain further reforms.\n  Also included in this conference report is some good news for port \nsecurity. Sadly, there is not the funding that we have repeatedly asked \nfor from this administration--but at least new criminal penalties for \nsmuggling goods through ports. There are tools to help crackdown \nfurther on money laundering overseas by terrorist organizations.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that the conference report includes \nessential and long overdue resources to combat our Nation's surging \nmethamphetamine epidemic.\n  Meth, as a problem in our communities, will not simply disappear on \nits own. We must make it a top priority and work to end it together. \nThat's why I had introduced similar legislation to address meth use, \nmanufacture, and sale, and create a law regulating the commercially \navailable products used to make meth, such as pseudoephedrine.\n  And that's why I am so glad to see the Combat Meth Act included in \ntoday's legislation. I was proud to cosponsor this legislation when \nSenators Talent and Feinstein introduced it, and I am pleased that it \nwill be signed into law, providing comprehensive reforms and critical \nresources. The legislation enforces strict regulations and keeps \nrecords so that meth producers can't get their hands on those key \ningredients. When a similar type of law was enacted in Oklahoma, it \nreduced meth lab busts in the state by 80 percent.\n  This legislation also provides valuable resources to State and local \ngovernments for law enforcement officials investigating and shutting \ndown labs, investigating violent meth-related crimes, educating the \npublic, and caring for children affected by the drug's scourge. The \nbill also confronts international meth trafficking new reporting and \ncertification procedures.\n  My State, Washington, is sixth in the country in meth production. In \n2004, 1337 meth lab sites were discovered in Washington State. That \nsame year, 220 fatalities were linked to the drug. And we are first in \nthe country, when it comes to the number of children found on raided \nsites. It is clear this is neither a small problem not an isolated one.\n  But these aren't just numbers. They are parents and children, \nindividual people with terrible stories of struggle and addiction. \nActing here and now, to fight this epidemic, we can provide the \nresources to and protect our Nation's families and communities.\n  The events of September 11 have changed our country and its people \nforever. We were attacked on our own soil. Thousands have died; \nthousands were injured. Very simply, we must do all that we can to stop \nterrorism by finding and ending terrorist activities here and abroad. \nOur challenge is to do this without compromising the values that make \nAmericans so unique. They are the same values that have allowed our \nNation to become great: respect for personal autonomy and the rights of \nthe individual; and tolerance of all regardless of race or religion.\n  They are the values that have always guided our Nation's leaders. It \nwas Benjamin Franklin who said essentially:\n\n       Make sure we have our liberties. Make sure we protect the \n     people from ourselves. Those who would give up their \n     essential liberties for security deserve neither and get \n     neither.\n\n  We must defend both.\n  We must maintain and take full advantage of meaningful oversight to \nensure power is never abused. While I will\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nvote for this bill, I will also continue to work to improve this bill. \nI will continue to be vigilant and urge those working defend and secure \nour Nation to use these powers wisely and with great deliberation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on section 507 of the \nUSA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act conference report. This \nsection originates in a bill that I introduced earlier in this year, S. \n1088, the Streamlined Procedures Act. Section 507 is based on \nsubsections (b) through (e) of section 9 of S. 1088. My Arizona \ncolleague, Representative Flake, took an interest in this matter and \nsought to offer this provision as an amendment to a court security and \npolice-officer protection bill last November. Mr. Flake's version of \nthe provision is printed in House Report 109-279; it made a number of \nimprovements to the original version in section 9 of my bill. Section \n507 of the present conference report reflects most of Mr. Flake's \nimprovements, such as the simplification of the chapter 154 \nqualification standard, which obviates the need for separate standards \nfor those States that make direct and collateral review into separate \nvehicles and those States with unitary procedures, and Mr. Flake's \nenhanced retroactivity provisions.\n  Mr. Flake already has commented on section 507 in an extension of \nremarks, at 151 Cong. Rec. E2639-40, December 22, 2005. I will not \nrepeat what he said there and will simply associate myself with his \nremarks. Instead, I would like to focus today on why section 507 is \nnecessary.\n  Section 507 expands and improves the special expedited habeas-corpus \nprocedures authorized in chapter 154 of the U.S. Code. These procedures \nare available to States that establish a system for providing legal \nrepresentation to capital defendants on State habeas review. Chapter \n154 sets strict time limits on Federal court action, bars consideration \nof claims that were not adjudicated in State court, and sharply \ncurtails amendments to petitions. The benefits that chapter 154 offers \nto States that opt in to its standards are substantial. Currently, \nhowever, the court that decides whether a State is eligible for chapter \n154 is the same court that would be subject to its time limits. \nUnsurprisingly, these courts have proven resistant to chapter 154. \nSection 507 places the eligibility decision in the hands of a neutral \nparty--the U.S. Attorney General, with review of his decision in the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which does \nnot hear habeas petitions. Section 507 also makes chapter 154's \ndeadlines more practical by extending the time for a district court to \nreview and rule on a chapter 154 petition from 6 months to 15 months.\n  As I mentioned earlier, section 507 of the present conference report \nis based on section 9 of the Streamlined Procedures Act. The SPA and \nhabeas reform have been the subject of multiple hearings in both the \nHouse and Senate during this Congress. In answers to written questions \nfollowing their testimony at a July 13 hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Arizona prosecutors John Todd and Kent Cattani \nprovided detailed evidence of systematic delays in Federal habeas \ncorpus review of State capital cases. Among the information that they \nprovided was a comprehensive study undertaken by the Arizona Attorney \nGeneral's Office of all capital cases in the State. This study examined \nthe appeals of all prisoners currently on Arizona's death row--over 100 \nprisoners. Mr. Todd summarized the findings in his answers to written \nquestions:\n\n       [S]tatistical information based on Arizona's current \n     capital cases in Federal court, and anecdotal information \n     derived from Arizona's current and former capital cases \n     substantiate the significant problem of delay and lack of \n     finality for victims. The AEDPA has not solved this \n     problem.\n       There are 76 Arizona capital cases pending in Federal \n     court. This represents over two thirds of Arizona's pending \n     capital cases. Although some cases were filed within the last \n     few months, over half of the cases have been pending in \n     Federal court five years or more. Of those, thirteen cases \n     have been pending for seven years. Ten cases have been \n     pending for eight years. Five cases have been pending for \n     more than fifteen years.\n       The AEDPA was a major step in making Federal habeas review \n     more reliable and speedy. However, the Supreme Court's \n     reversals of the Ninth Circuit exemplify the unwillingness of \n     some court cultures to obey this Congress' directives if \n     there is any ambiguity in the law.\n\n  Mr. Todd also gave a summary of the extreme delays experienced by the \nState of Arizona on Federal habeas review:\n\n       Only one of the 63 [Arizona death-penalty] cases filed \n     under the AEDPA has moved from the Federal District Court to \n     the Ninth Circuit. That case has been in the Ninth Circuit \n     for over 5 years. Twenty-eight of Arizona's capital cases \n     have been pending in District Court for between six and eight \n     years.\n       [One Arizona death penalty case] has been on Federal habeas \n     review for over 19 years. Two of those cases have been on \n     Federal habeas review for over 18 years, one for over 16 \n     years, another for over 14 years, still another for over 12 \n     years. These cases alone establish a pattern of unreasonable \n     delay. The [Arizona Attorney General's] report shows that \n     these cases are not simply strange aberrations in an \n     otherwise smooth functioning system of habeas review.\n\n  Mr. Todd concluded: ``there is a serious problem of delay and lack of \nfinality currently in Federal habeas review of state-court judgments, \neven after Congress' enactment of the AEDPA almost a decade ago. . . . \nBased on the attached review of the Arizona capital cases since \nenactment of the AEDPA, delay has not been eliminated or even reduced, \nrather it has been prolonged.''\n  Similarly, in his answers to written questions, Kent Cattani, the \nChief Counsel of the Capital Litigation Section of the Arizona Attorney \nGeneral's Office, reviewed the Arizona Attorney General's study of \nArizona capital cases and concluded as follows: ``Federal habeas reform \nis necessary. After 9 years under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (``AEDPA''), it is clear that the Act did not \neliminate or even reduce the problem of delay in the Federal habeas \nprocess.''\n  Interestingly, although the Judicial Conference of the United States \nhas uniformly opposed all Federal habeas reform--it even objected in \nwriting to SPA Section 8(a)'s requirement that circuit courts decide \nhabeas cases within 300 days after briefing is completed--in its \nSeptember 26, 2005 letter to Chairman Specter regarding the SPA, the \nConference itself provides substantial evidence of a growing backlog \nand delays in resolution of capital habeas petitions. The September 26 \nletter notes the following facts: From 1998 to 2002, the number of \nState capital habeas cases pending in the Federal district courts \nincreased from 446 to 721. During the same period, the percentage of \nState capital habeas cases pending in the Federal district courts for \nmore than 3 years rose from 20.2 percent to 46.2 percent; in the \nFederal courts of appeals, the number of pending State capital habeas \ncases rose from 185 to 284; and the median time from filing of a notice \nof appeal to disposition for State capital habeas cases increased from \n10 months to 15 months.\n  It is noteworthy that all of these increases in backlog and delay \nhave taken place after the enactment of the AEDPA in 1996--a law that \nsome critics of habeas reform assert has solved all of the problems \nwith Federal habeas.\n  At the most recent hearing on the Streamlined Procedures Act, before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on November 16, Ron Eisenberg, Deputy \nDistrict Attorney for Philadelphia, summarized the problems and delays \nwith Federal habeas review that he encounters in the course of his \nwork. He stated:\n\n       I have served as a prosecutor for 24 years. I am the \n     supervisor of the Law Division of the Philadelphia District \n     Attorney's Office, a group of 60 lawyers. Many of those \n     lawyers handle regular appeals in the Pennsylvania appellate \n     courts. But more and more of our attorneys must devote \n     themselves full time to Federal habeas corpus litigation. In \n     the last decade, the number of lawyers employed exclusively \n     on habeas work has increased 400%. Despite the limits \n     supposedly imposed by law, the only certain limit on the \n     Federal habeas process as it is currently administered is the \n     expiration of the defendant's sentence.\n       But that leaves ample opportunity and motivation for \n     litigation, because the cases that reach Federal habeas \n     review involve the most dangerous criminals, who receive the \n     most serious sentences--not just death penalties, but non-\n     capital murders, rape, violent robberies and burglaries, \n     brutal beatings, and shootings.\n       Too often, discussion of the proper scope of Federal habeas \n     corpus review is really just a debate about the value of the \n     death penalty, and the justness of imprisonment and \n     punishment generally. To be sure, many Federal courts seem \n     flatly unwilling to affirm capital sentences. In \n     Pennsylvania, for example, almost every single contested \n     death sentence litigated on habeas--over 20 cases in the last\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\n     decade--has been thrown out by Federal judges; only one has \n     been upheld.\n       But the primary problem is one of process, not results. The \n     truth is that, whether or not they end up reversing a \n     conviction, Federal habeas courts drag out litigation for \n     years of utterly unjustifiable delay, creating exorbitant \n     costs for the state and endless pain for the victims.\n\n  This data and testimony confirm what many capital litigators and \njudges have told me is, in their view, an obvious and uncontestable \nfact: the problems with Federal habeas corpus are systematic, they are \nsevere, and they and are growing worse. Yet even this information does \nnot really tell us why this problem matters--why ordinary people, \nrather than just civil servants and judges, should be concerned about \nthe functioning of the Federal habeas system. For that information, it \nis necessary to look at the impact of the current habeas system on the \nsurviving victims of violent crimes. The current system and the delays \nthat it engenders, particularly in capital cases, often are grossly \ncruel to these individuals. The perpetual litigation of Federal habeas \ncases denies the surviving family of a murder victim closure--it forces \nthem to continually relive the crime, rather than be able to put the \nterrible events behind them.\n  Two parents of murder victims testified at hearings in this Congress \nabout how they have been treated by the Federal habeas system. Their \ntestimony makes a compelling case that this system is broken and in \nneed of reform. And it highlights why we should all be concerned. What \nthese individuals and their families--people who had already suffered \nso much--have experienced at the hands of the Federal courts should \noffend every American.\n  The first witness to testify was Carol Fornoff, who addressed the \nHouse Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee on June 7 of last year. \nMrs. Fornoff's 13-year-old daughter, Christy Ann, was murdered in 1984. \nAlmost every Arizonan who lived in the State at the time knows the name \nChristy Ann Fornoff. Christy's murder was an event that shattered \npeople's sense of security, that made them afraid to let their children \nplay outside or go out of their sight. I remember the case vividly. And \nI was stunned when I learned last year that the man who killed Christy, \nalthough sentenced to death by the State of Arizona, still is \nlitigating his conviction and sentence in Federal court. His Federal \nproceedings began in 1992--14 years ago. Just think about how long ago \n1992 is. President Bush's father was the President at the time. Bill \nClinton was the Governor of Arkansas. Saddam Hussein's invasion of \nKuwait is closer in time to that date than the U.S. invasion of Iraq is \nto today. And yet the case of Christy's killer remains in Federal \ncourt.\n  Mrs. Fornoff made a powerful case for why we should find this \nunacceptable. She described the suffering of her family, how this \ndecades-long litigation has denied them closure. I do not think that \nanyone who heard Mrs. Fornoff's testimony would assert that there are \nno problems with the present system. Allow me to quote the main portion \nof Mrs. Fornoff's statement to the House Crime Subcommittee:\n\n       My husband Roger and I are here today to tell you about our \n     daughter, Christy Ann Fornoff. Christy was our youngest \n     daughter. She was a loving child, very gentle. She often \n     seemed to make friends with the kids at school who weren't \n     so popular. She was very dear to us.\n       In 1984, our family was living in Tempe, Arizona, and \n     Christy was 13 years old. Christy and her brother Jason both \n     held jobs as newscarriers for the Phoenix Gazette, a local \n     newspaper. Roger and I believed that jobs like this would \n     teach our children responsibility, while also helping them \n     earn a little money.\n       After dinner on Wednesday evening, May 9, 1984, both \n     Christy and Jason had been invited to go jumping on \n     trampolines. Jason went, but Christy had just had a cast \n     removed from her ankle. Instead, she went to collect on \n     newspaper subscriptions at an apartment complex near our \n     house.\n       Christy delivered papers at this complex every day, it was \n     just two short blocks from our house. Nevertheless, it was \n     getting dusk, so I went with Christy; she rode her brother's \n     bike while I walked alongside with our little dog.\n       At the first apartment that Christy visited, I was stopped \n     by a neighbor who wanted to talk about our cute dog. Christy \n     went on to the next apartment alone, and I followed a few \n     minutes later. When I got there, the bike was outside, but \n     there was no Christy. I started calling her name, but there \n     was no answer. Our dog started to get nervous. After a few \n     minutes, I ran home, and came back with my daughter's \n     boyfriend. I asked the people at the apartment that Christy \n     had gone to if they had seen her, and they said yes, ten \n     minutes ago, and that she had left. I knew that Christy \n     wouldn't just leave her brother's bike there.\n       I ran home again. My husband had just arrived at home and I \n     told him that Christy was missing. He immediately called the \n     police, and then he went to the apartment complex and began \n     knocking on doors. Outside of one apartment, people standing \n     nearby told us don't bother knocking on that door, that is \n     the maintenance man, and he is looking for Christy. Shortly \n     after, the maintenance man joined Roger in the search for \n     Christy.\n       That night, police helicopters with searchlights examined \n     every corner of our neighborhood. Our son drove up and down \n     every alley in the area on his motorcycle. Christy's \n     newspaper-collections book was found over a fence near the \n     apartment complex. But no one found Christy.\n       Two days later, a policeman knocked at our door. Christy's \n     body had been discovered wrapped in a sheet, lying behind a \n     trash dumpster in the apartment complex. We were absolutely \n     devasted. We had been hoping against hope, and couldn't \n     believe that our beautiful daughter was dead.\n       Christy's body was taken to a morgue so that an autopsy \n     could be performed. On Sunday, which was Mother's day, we \n     were finally able to view Christy's body at the funeral home. \n     Mother's Day has never been the same for me since.\n       Ten days after Christy's body was found, the maintenance \n     man at the apartment complex--the same man who supposedly had \n     been looking for her the night that she disappeared--was \n     arrested for her murder. Christy had been sexually assaulted \n     and suffocated. There was blood, semen, and hair on Christy's \n     body that was consistent with that of the maintenance man. \n     Vomit on Christy's face matched vomit in the maintenance \n     man's closet. Fibers on Christy's body matched the carpet and \n     a blanket in the maintenance man's apartment. And police \n     found Christy's hair inside of the apartment. We knew who had \n     killed our daughter.\n       In 1985, the maintenance man was convicted of Christy's \n     murder and sentenced to death. The conviction was upheld in a \n     lengthy opinion by the Arizona Supreme Court. The killer \n     raised many more challenges, but his last state appeals were \n     finally rejected in 1992. By that time, we already felt like \n     the case had been going on a long time--it had been seven \n     years. We couldn't imagine that the killer would have any \n     more challenges to argue.\n       But in 1992, the killer filed another challenge to his \n     conviction in the United States District Court. That \n     challenge then remained in that one court for another 7 \n     years! Finally, in November of 1999, the district court \n     dismissed the case. But then a few years later, the Federal \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sent the case back to \n     the district court for more hearings. Today, the case remains \n     before that same Federal district court.\n       It has now been over 21 years since Christy was murdered. \n     By this fall, the case will have been in the Federal courts \n     for longer than Christy was ever alive.\n       I cannot describe to you how painful our experience with \n     the court system has been. I cannot believe that just one \n     court took over 7 years to decide our case.\n       Some might ask why we can't just move on, and forget about \n     the killer's appeals. But it doesn't work that way. She was \n     our daughter, our beautiful little girl, and he took her \n     away. We want to know if he was properly convicted. We want \n     to know, will his conviction be thrown out? Will there be \n     another trial? I cannot imagine testifying at a trial again. \n     And would they even be able to convict this man again? It has \n     been 21 years. How many witnesses are still here, is all of \n     the evidence even still available? Could this man one day be \n     released? Could I run into him on the street, a free man--the \n     man who assaulted and killed our little daughter? The courts \n     have turned this case into an open wound for our family--a \n     wound that has not been allowed to heal for 21 years.\n       I understand that the Federal government has the right to \n     create such a system. It can let the Federal courts hear any \n     challenge to a state conviction, at any time, with no limits. \n     My question to you, Mr. Chairman, is why would we want such a \n     system? Why would we want a system that forces someone like \n     me to relive my daughter's murder, again and again and again? \n     My daughter's killer already litigated all of the challenges \n     to his case in the state courts. Why should we let him bring \n     all of the same legal claims again, for another round of \n     lawsuits, in the Federal courts? Why should this killer get a \n     second chance? My daughter never had a second chance.\n       I understand that people are concerned about innocent \n     people being behind bars, but that is not what my daughter's \n     killer is suing about. Right now, the issue that is being \n     litigated in the Federal courts is whether the trial court \n     made a mistake by allowing the jury to hear that he told a \n     prison counselor that he ``didn't mean to kill the little \n     Fornoff girl.'' He claims that the counselor was like his \n     doctor, and that the statement is private, even though he \n     said it in front of other prisoners. Earlier this year, a \n     Federal court held a hearing on whether the killer had a \n     right to prevent the jury from hearing about this statement. \n     But the statement is irrelevant. Whether or not he said it, \n     the evidence of his guilt--the hairs, the fibers, the bodily \n     fluids--is overwhelming. The\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\n     issue that the killer is suing about was already resolved \n     before by the Arizona Supreme Court--over 17 years ago. Yet \n     here we are, 21 years after my daughter died, arguing about \n     the same legal technicalities.\n       People might say that it is worth the cost to let the \n     killer sue over every issue like this again and again. I \n     don't think that it is worth the cost. When you and your \n     colleagues are writing laws, Mr. Chairman, please think about \n     people like me. Please think about the fact that every time \n     that there is another appeal, another ruling, another \n     hearing, I am forced to think about my daughter's death. \n     Every time, I am forced to wonder, if only Christy hadn't had \n     the cast on her ankle--if only she could have gone on the \n     trampoline that evening, she would still be alive today. \n     Every time that I hear a helicopter, I am terrified--I think \n     of the police helicopters searching for Christy on the night \n     that she disappeared. Every time that I hear a motorcycle, I \n     think of my son, searching for Christy. Every time that the \n     courts reopen this case, I am forced to wonder, why didn't I \n     follow Christy to that second apartment--why did I let that \n     neighbor stop me to talk? Every time, I am forced to think \n     about how scared my little girl must have been when she died.\n       I urge you, Mr. Chairman, to do what you can to fix this \n     system. My family and I have forgiven our daughter's \n     murderer. But we cannot forgive a justice system that would \n     treat us this way.\n\n  Another witness who testified before Congress last year on the need \nfor Federal habeas reform is Mary Ann Hughes of Chino Hills, CA. Mrs. \nHughes's son Christopher, then 11 years old, was murdered in 1983. As \nin the Fornoff case, the killer was captured, convicted, and sentenced \nto death--and is still litigating his case in Federal court today. Mrs. \nHughes testified before the House Judiciary Committee's Crime \nSubcommittee on November 10, 2005. This is what she said:\n\n       Christopher was a beautiful little boy. He had just \n     completed the fifth grade at a local Catholic school. His \n     classmates later planted a tree in his memory at the school. \n     Chris swam on the swim team and dreamed of swimming for the \n     University of Southern California and being in the Olympics. \n     He loved his younger brother, and in typical brotherly \n     fashion would tease him one minute and be his best friend the \n     next. Chris' younger brother is now 28-years-old. He has \n     missed Chris every day since he was murdered. Our younger son \n     was not yet born when Chris was murdered. I was pregnant \n     during part of Cooper's trial with our third son. When he was \n     born we gave him the middle name Christopher after the \n     brother he never knew. Both boys have only in the last few \n     years been able to face what happened to their brother. As \n     the years have passed, we are reminded that Chris never got \n     to finish grammar school, go to a prom, marry, have children \n     of his own, or pursue his dreams.\n       On Saturday, June 4, 1983, Chris asked me for permission to \n     spend the night at the home of his friend, Josh Ryen. We \n     lived in what was then a very rural neighborhood. Josh was \n     the only boy nearby who was really close to Chris' age and so \n     they formed a bond. We were good friends with Josh's parents, \n     Doug and Peggy Ryen. The Ryens lived just up the road from \n     our home with their 10-year-old daughter Jessica and eight-\n     year-old Josh. The last time I saw Chris alive he and Josh \n     were riding off on their bicycles toward Josh's house. They \n     were excitedly waving because they were so happy I had given \n     Chris permission to spend that night with Josh. The only \n     thing Chris had to remember was to be home Sunday in time for \n     church. The next time I saw Chris was in a photograph on an \n     autopsy table during Cooper's preliminary hearing.\n       Unbeknownst to anyone, Cooper had been hiding in a house in \n     Chino Hills just 126 yards from the Ryen's home. He had \n     escaped two days earlier from a minimum security facility at \n     a nearby prison. When Cooper was arrested for burglary in Los \n     Angeles he used a false identity. His identity and criminal \n     past should have caught up with him before he was wrongly \n     assigned to the minimum security portion of the prison. The \n     prison, however, mishandled the processing of an outstanding \n     warrant for Cooper for escape from custody in \n     Pennsylvania. He was being held pending trial for the \n     kidnap and rape of a teenage girl who interrupted him \n     while he was burglarizing a home. While staying at the \n     hide-out house near the Ryens, Cooper had been calling \n     former girlfriends, trying to get them to help him get out \n     of the area. A manhunt was under way for Cooper, but the \n     rural community surrounding the prison was never notified \n     of the escape.\n       The failure of the California prison-system to protect the \n     surrounding community from a dangerous felon marked the \n     beginning of our family and community's being let down by our \n     government. Within a few hours of Cooper's escape, prison \n     officials realized who Cooper was and how dangerous he was. \n     Nevertheless, they still failed to alert the community that \n     he was at large. Our frustration and disappointment with our \n     government's failings has only grown since that time as \n     Cooper's case continues to wind its way down a seemingly \n     endless path through our judicial system.\n       The morning following the murders, I remember being mad at \n     Chris because he had not arrived home on time as promised so \n     we could attend church. Then my anger turned to worry. I sent \n     my husband Bill up to the Ryen home. He saw that the horses \n     had not been fed, and that the Ryen station wagon was gone.\n       Uncharacteristically, the kitchen door was locked, so my \n     husband walked around the house. He looked inside the sliding \n     glass door of the Ryen's master bedroom. He saw blood \n     everywhere. Peggy and Chris were lying on the ground and Josh \n     was lying next to them, showing signs of life but unable to \n     move. My husband could not open the sliding glass door, so he \n     ran and kicked open the kitchen door. As he went into the \n     master bedroom, he found 10-year-old Jessica lying on the \n     floor in fetal position in the doorway, dead. He saw Doug and \n     Peggy nude, bloodied, and lifeless. When he went to our son \n     Chris, he was cold to the touch. Bill then knew that \n     Christopher was dead.\n       My husband then forced himself to have enough presence of \n     mind to get help for Josh, who miraculously survived despite \n     having his throat slit from ear to ear. Josh, only eight \n     years old, lay next to his dead, naked mother throughout the \n     night, knowing from the silence and from the smell of blood \n     that everyone else was dead. He placed his fingers into his \n     throat, which kept him from bleeding to death during the 12 \n     hours before my husband rescued him.\n       Everyone inside the home had been repeatedly struck by a \n     hatchet and attacked with a knife. Christopher had 25 \n     identifiable wounds made by a hatchet and a knife. Many of \n     them were on his hands, which he must have put against his \n     head to protect himself from Kevin Cooper's blows. Some were \n     made after he was already dead. No one should know this kind \n     of horror. That it happened to a child makes it even worse.\n       The killer had lifted Jessica's nightgown and carved on her \n     chest after she died. The killer also helped himself to a \n     beer from the Ryen's refrigerator. We wondered what kind of \n     monster would attack a father, mother, and three children \n     with a hatchet, and then go have a beer. That question has \n     long since been answered, but 22 years later we are still \n     waiting for justice.\n\n  The escaped prisoner who committed this crime was caught 2 months \nlater. He admitted that he had stayed in the house next door but denied \nany involvement in the murders. According to the California Supreme \nCourt, however, the evidence of defendant's guilt was ``overwhelming.'' \nNot only had the defendant stayed at the vacant house right next door \nat the time of the murders; the hatchet used in the murders was taken \nfrom the vacant house; shoe prints in the Ryen house matched those in \nthe vacant house and were from a type of shoe issued to prisoners; \nbloody items, including a prison-issue button, were found in the vacant \nhouse; prison-issue tobacco was found in the Ryen station wagon, which \nwas recovered in Long Beach; and the defendant's blood type and hair \nmatched that found in the Ryen house. The defendant was convicted of \nthe murders and sentenced to death in 1985, and the California Supreme \nCourt upheld the defendant's conviction and sentence in 1991.\n  The defendant's Federal habeas proceedings began shortly thereafter, \nand they continue to this day--23 years after the murders. In 2000, the \ndefendant asked the courts for DNA testing of a blood spot in the Ryen \nhouse, a t-shirt near the crime scene, and the tobacco found in the \ncar. Despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the courts allowed \nmore testing. All three tests found that the blood and saliva matched \nthe defendant, to a degree of certainty of 1 in 310 billion. Blood on \nthe t-shirt matched both the defendant and one of the victims.\n  Mrs. Hughes went on to describe, in her November 10 testimony, the \nimpact of this crime and the attenuated legal proceedings on her \nfamily:\n\n       ``While I know that Cooper is the one who murdered my son, \n     I will always bear the guilt of having given Chris permission \n     to spend the night at the Ryen's house. I will always feel \n     responsible for sending my husband to find the bodies of our \n     son and the Ryen family. It is a guilt similar to the guilt \n     that Josh feels to this day because he had begged me to let \n     Chris spend the night. He thinks that Chris would still be \n     alive if he had not spent the night. Of course, Cooper is \n     responsible for all the pain and suffering that he inflicted \n     that night and the continued pain that has followed, but it \n     does not help stop the pain and guilt. Kevin Cooper is still \n     here over 22 years later--still proclaiming his innocence and \n     complaining about our judicial system.\n       As Josh explained when he finally got a chance to speak to \n     the Judge about how he has been affected by Cooper's crimes: \n     Cooper never shuts up. We continually get to hear more bogus \n     claims and more comments from Cooper and his attorneys. Over \n     the years I have learned to know when something has happened \n     in Cooper's never-ending legal case: the calls from the media \n     start up again, or, at times, the media trucks just park \n     in\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\n     front of our house. We have no opportunity to put this \n     behind us--to heal or to try to find peace--because \n     everything is about Cooper. Our system is so grotesquely \n     skewed to Cooper's benefit and seemingly incapable of \n     letting California carry out its judgment against him.\n       [The] judicial system so out of balance in favor of the \n     convicted that it literally enables them to victimize their \n     victims and their families all over again through the Federal \n     judicial system. We understood the rights of an accused and \n     that Cooper's rights took precedence over ours as he stood \n     trial. His trial was moved to another County because of the \n     publicity surrounding the horrendous crimes. I had to drive a \n     long distance to another County to watch the trial as it \n     could not take place in our County. Cooper's defense attorney \n     spent an entire year preparing to defend Cooper at trial. \n     Everything was about Cooper's rights and none of our \n     sensibilities or concerns could be dignified because Cooper \n     had to have a fair trial. We understood and we waited for \n     justice. In California, Cooper's appeal was automatic because \n     he had received the death penalty for his crimes. The appeal \n     took six years to conclude. We understood the need for a \n     thorough appeal and we waited for justice.\n       By 1991, Cooper had received a fair trial and his appeal \n     had been concluded. The California Supreme Court aptly \n     observed that the evidence against Cooper, both in volume and \n     consistency, was ``overwhelming''. Since then, we have waited \n     and watched as the United States Supreme Court has denied \n     Cooper's eight petitions for writ of certiorari and two \n     petitions for writ of habeas corpus, and the California \n     Supreme Court has denied Cooper's seven habeas corpus \n     petitions and three motions to reopen Cooper's appeal. The \n     Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of Cooper's first Federal \n     habeas petition, and denied him permission to file a \n     successive petition in 2001, and again in 2003. But then, on \n     Friday night, February 6, 2004, Cooper's attorneys filed an \n     application with the Ninth Circuit requesting permission to \n     file a successive habeas petition.\n       A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit denied Cooper's \n     application to file a successive petition on Sunday, February \n     8, 2004. Cooper was scheduled to be executed at one minute \n     after midnight on Tuesday, February 10, 2004. On Monday, \n     February 9, 2004, my husband and I made the trip to Northern \n     California from our home in Southern California. Relatives of \n     the extended Ryen family flew in from all over the Country. \n     Josh Ryen, now 30, left for dead at the age of eight, his \n     entire immediate family murdered, drove hundreds of miles to \n     reach the prison to witness the execution of Cooper. We all \n     expected that finally, this case would be brought to a close.\n\n  Mrs. Hughes went on to describe, however, how on the eve of the \nexecution, the en banc Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sua sponte \nreviewed the denial of the petitioner's successive petition application \nand reversed the three-judge panel. The en banc decision stayed the \nkiller's execution and permitted him to pursue a second round of \nFederal habeas-corpus litigation. This second round still is going on \ntoday--15 years after the California Supreme Court affirmed the \nconviction and sentence, and 23 years after the murders.\n  Section 2244(b)(3)(E) of title 28 states that ``[t]he grant or denial \nof an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or \nsuccessive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the \nsubject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.'' To \nus lesser lawyers, this provision might seem like it means that there \nshall be no en banc review of the three-judge panel's denial of the \napplication. But the enlightened jurists of the Ninth Circuit have \ndiscovered that although subparagraph (E) bars the habeas petitioner \nfrom appealing the denial, the en banc court remains free to sua sponte \ngrant review. Some might find it strange that Congress would have \nintended to bar the en banc courts of appeals from considering a case \non the basis of a party's appeal and adversarial briefing, but intended \nto allow the same courts to hear the same case without a request for \nreview and with no briefing. Typically, briefing is regarded as aiding \na court's consideration of a case. Of course, the losing habeas \npetitioner typically does seek en banc review of the denial of the \nsuccessive-petition application and file a brief in support of his \nrequest. I suppose that we are to trust that the en banc court of \nappeals does not read that brief, or that if it does so, it puts the \nbrief out of its collective mind so that it might act ``sua sponte'' \nwhen it votes on whether to go en banc, lest its actions otherwise \nappear to violate subparagraph (E)'s clear command that the denial of \nthe application is not ``appealable.''\n  In this case, I am prepared to believe that the judges did not read \nthe briefs. Despite DNA evidence that linked the habeas petitioner to \nthe murder scene to a degree of certainty of 1 in 310 billion, the en \nbanc Ninth Circuit determined that the petitioner met section 2244's \nrequirement that he present ``clear and convincing evidence that . . . \nno reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the \nunderlying offense.'' The Ninth Circuit's theory was that the police \nmight have planted the blood evidence. As Mrs. Hughes noted in her \nNovember 10 testimony, however:\n\n       Of course, Cooper could not explain how or why police would \n     plant a minute amount of blood on the t-shirt only to never \n     use it as evidence against him at trial. Moreover, this \n     evidence had been in police custody since 1984. Apparently, \n     these supposed rogue police officers also anticipated the \n     development of the Nobel Prize-winning science that would \n     enable Cooper to have the blood tested for DNA. Cooper also \n     could not explain how the police could have planted his blood \n     at the crime scene within a few hours of discovering the \n     bodies, while he was still at large.\n\n  The Ninth Circuit first granted sua sponte en banc review of the \ndenial of a successive-petition application in the case of Thompson v. \nCalderon, 120 F.3d 1045, 9th Cir. 1997, a decision with other \nprocedural irregularities so glaring that the Supreme Court did not \neven notice this aspect of the decision when it took it up and \nreversed, Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 1998. The Sixth Circuit \nsubsequently copied Thompson, thus allowing the Ninth Circuit to \nattribute this practice to other circuits when it again applied it in \nthe case of the killer of Mary Ann Hughes's son. Section 8(b) of the \nStreamlined Procedures Act would prevent the Ninth Circuit from doing \nthis in the future. Unfortunately, I was unable to have that provision \nincluded in this conference report. I will try again in the future.\n  This year, it will have been 23 years since Christopher Hughes and \nDoug, Peggy, and Jessica Ryen were murdered. In 2004, after the Ninth \nCircuit authorized another round of litigation, a local newspaper \ndescribed the impact of this crime and the ensuing years of appeals on \nthe surviving family of the victims:\n\n       For nearly 20 years, since convicted murderer Kevin Cooper \n     was sentenced to death for the 1983 slayings of a Chino Hills \n     family and their young houseguest, families of the victims \n     have waited silently for the day the hand of justice would \n     grant them peace.\n       For those families, the last two decades have seemed like \n     an eternity.\n       I lived through a nightmare,'' said Herbert Ryen, whose \n     brother Douglas Ryen was among those killed, along with \n     Douglas' wife Peggy, their 11-year-old daughter Jessica, and \n     her 10-year-old friend Christopher Hughes.\n       [O]n the morning of Feb. 9, [2004,] the day of Cooper's \n     scheduled death by lethal injection, word came down that the \n     9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had decided to block the \n     execution.\n       [T]o the Ryen and Hughes families, the stay just hours \n     before Cooper's scheduled execution at San Quentin State \n     Prison was nearly incomprehensible. The indefinite delay has \n     left them in a sort of emotional limbo, questioning whether \n     the legal system had abandoned them.\n       The bottom line is that this whole issue is not about Kevin \n     Cooper . . . it is about the death penalty,'' said Mary Ann \n     Hughes, the mother of Christoper Hughes. ``We're so mad--mad \n     because we feel as though the courts turned their back on my \n     son.''\n       They (Court of Appeals) are holding us hostage,'' Hughes \n     said.\n       For Herbert Ryen and his wife Sue, waiting for justice has \n     taken an equally destructive toll on their lives. The torment \n     their family experienced following the murders, and the \n     subsequent years lost to depression, could never be replaced, \n     he said from his home in Arizona.\n       Mary Ann Hughes said the pain her family suffers is only \n     amplified by the seemingly continuous bombardment of \n     celebrities campaigning against Cooper's execution. She \n     wonders who will cry out in anger for the victims.\n       One former television star and anti-death penalty activist, \n     Mike Farrell of the popular series MASH, spoke of the case on \n     a recent news program.\n       ``He claimed that we must feel relieved since the stay of \n     execution was granted,'' Hughes said. ``How can (Farrell) \n     have the audacity to say he knows what we are feeling?''\n       Farrell could not be reached for comment.\n       Since Christopher's death, the Hughes family has chosen to \n     remain out of the media spotlight. And until recently, their \n     efforts were successful, due largely to the support of their \n     surviving children, family members and a strong network of \n     close friends, Hughes said.\n       The court's decision Feb. 9 has re-opened the case, forcing \n     the families to re-live the nightmare they have fought so \n     hard to leave behind, they say.\n       Mary Ann Hughes is left wondering about other families who \n     have had loved ones taken from them, about the legal battles \n     they have had to endure in their own quests for justice.\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\n       She thinks of the parents of Samantha Runion, the 5-year-\n     old Orange County girl who was murdered in 2003, and of what \n     her family could face in the next 20 years.\n       For Bill Hughes, the anguish is intensified--he will \n     forever know the pain of walking into the Ryens' home the \n     morning after the murders, and finding his son, dead and \n     covered in blood near the Ryens' bedroom door. He was also \n     the first to discover Joshua Ryen, also drenched in blood, \n     clinging to life.\n       ``It is a memory he will always have to live with,'' Mary \n     Ann Hughes said.\n       Indeed, time has been no friend to the victims' families, \n     as California's recent appellate court ruling has further \n     denied them closure, she added.\n       ``What this decision has done to our legal system in \n     California is unthinkable,'' she said. ``Somewhere along the \n     line, the courts have got to uphold the law, and we will wait \n     it out until they do.'' (Sara Carter, ``Families of Murder \n     Victims Wait for Justice in Cooper Case,'' Inland Valley \n     Daily Bulletin, February 24, 2004.)\n\n  The impact of this litigation on Mary and Bill Hughes and Herbert and \nSue Ryen alone makes the handling of this case indefensible. No one, \nhowever, has borne the weight of our system of Federal collateral \nreview more heavily in this case than has the one surviving victim of \nthe June 4, 1983 attack. Josh Ryen was 8 years old when he was stabbed \nin his parents' bedroom and his parents and sister were murdered. He \nhad been Christopher Hughes's neighbor and best friend. As of last \nyear, however, Mary and Bill Hughes had not seen Josh since he was \nairlifted by helicopter from the scene of the murders to Loma Linda \nUniversity hospital. Then on April 22, 2005, Josh Ryen appeared at the \nlatest Federal habeas corpus hearing for the man who killed his family. \nHe is now 30 years old. Pursuant to the recently enacted Crime Victims' \nRights Act, he gave a brief statement before the court. I will quote \nJosh Ryen's statement in its entirety:\n\n       The first time I met Kevin Cooper I was 8 years old and he \n     slit my throat. He hit me with a hatchet and put a hole in my \n     skull. He stabbed me twice, which broke my ribs and collapsed \n     one lung. I lived only because I stuck four fingers in my \n     neck to slow the bleeding, but I was too weak to move. I laid \n     there 11 hours looking at my mother who was right beside me.\n       I know now he came through the sliding glass door and \n     attacked my dad first. He was lying on the bed and was struck \n     in the dark without warning with the hatchet and knife. He \n     was hit many times because there is a lot of blood on the \n     wall on his side of the bed.\n       My mother screamed and Cooper came around the bed and \n     started hitting her. Somehow my dad was able to struggle \n     between the bed and the closet but Cooper bludgeoned my \n     father to death with the knife and hatchet, stabbing him 26 \n     times and axing him 11. One of the blows severed his finger \n     and it landed in the closet.\n       My mother tried to get away but he caught her at the bottom \n     of the bed and he stabbed her 25 times and axed her 7.\n       All of us kids were drawn to the room by mom's screams. \n     Jessica was killed in the doorway with 5 ax blows and 46 \n     stabs. I won't say how many times my best friend Chris was \n     stabbed and axed, not because it isn't important, but because \n     I don't want to hurt his family in any way, and they are \n     here.\n       After Cooper killed everyone, and thought he had killed me, \n     he went over to my sister and lifted her shirt and drew \n     things on her stomach with the knife. Then he walked down the \n     hallway, opened the refrigerator, and had a beer. I guess \n     killing so many people can make a man thirsty.\n       I don't want to be here. I came because I owe it to my \n     family, who can't speak for themselves. But by coming I am \n     acknowledging and validating the existence of Kevin Cooper, \n     who should have been blotted from the face of the earth a \n     long time ago. By coming here it shows that he still controls \n     me. I will be free, my life will start, the day Kevin Cooper \n     dies. I want to be rid of him, but he won't go away.\n       I've been trying to get away from him since I was 8 years \n     and I can't escape. He haunts me and follows me. For over 20 \n     years all I've heard is Kevin Cooper this and Kevin Cooper \n     that. Kevin Cooper says he is innocent, Kevin Cooper says he \n     was framed, Kevin Cooper says DNA will clear him, Kevin \n     Cooper says blood was planted, Kevin Cooper says the tennis \n     shoes aren't his, Kevin Cooper says three guys did it, Kevin \n     Cooper says police planted evidence, Kevin Cooper gets \n     another stay from another court and sends everyone off on \n     another wild goose chase.\n       The courts say there isn't any harm when Kevin Cooper gets \n     another stay and another hearing. This just shows they don't \n     care about me, because every time he gets another delay I am \n     harmed and have to relive the murders all over again. Every \n     time Kevin Cooper opens his mouth everyone wants to know what \n     I think, what I have to say, how I'm feeling, and the whole \n     nightmare floods all over me again: the barbecue, me begging \n     to let Chris spend the night, me in my bed and him on the \n     floor beside me, my mother's screams, Chris gone, dark house, \n     hallway, bushy hair, everything black, mom cut to pieces \n     saturated in blood, the nauseating smell of blood, eleven \n     hours unable to move, light filtering in, Chris' father at \n     the window, the horror of his face, sound of the front door \n     splintering, my pajamas being cut off, people trying to save \n     me, the whap whap of the helicopter blades, shouted \n     questions, everything fading to black.\n       Every time Cooper claims he's innocent and sends people \n     scurrying off on another wild goose chase, I have to relive \n     the murders all over again. It runs like a horror movie, over \n     and over again and never stops because he never shuts up. He \n     puts PR people on national television who say outrageous \n     things and then the press wants to know what I think. What I \n     think is that I would like to be rid of Kevin Cooper. I would \n     like for him to go away. I would like to never hear from \n     Kevin Cooper again. I would like Kevin Cooper to pay for what \n     he did.\n       I dread happy times like Christmas and Thanksgiving. If I \n     go to a friend's house on holidays I look at all the mothers \n     and fathers and children and grandchildren and get sad \n     because I have no one. Kevin Cooper took them from me.\n       I get terrified when I go into any place dark, like a house \n     before the lights are on. I hear screams and see flashbacks \n     and shadows. Even with lights on I see terrible things. After \n     I was stabbed and axed I was too weak to move and stared at \n     my mother all night. I smelled this overpowering smell of \n     fresh blood and knew everyone had been slaughtered.\n       Every day when I comb my hair I feel the hole where he \n     buried the hatchet in my head, and when I look in the mirror \n     I see the scar where he cut my throat from ear to ear and I \n     put four fingers in it to stop the bleeding which, they say, \n     saved my life. Every year I lose hearing in my left ear where \n     he buried the knife.\n       Helicopters give me flashbacks of life flight and my \n     Incredible Hulks being cut off by paramedics. Bushy hair \n     reminds me of the killer. Silence reminds me of the quiet \n     before the screams. Cooper is everywhere. There is no escape \n     from him.\n       I feel very guilty and responsible to the Hughes family \n     because I begged them to let Chris spend the night. If I \n     hadn't done that he wouldn't have died. I apologize to them \n     and especially to Mr. Hughes for having to find us and see \n     his son cut and stabbed to death.\n       I thank the judge who gave my grandma custody of me because \n     she took good care of me and loves me very much.\n       I'm grateful to the ocean for giving me peace because when \n     I go there I know my mother and father and sister's ashes are \n     sprinkled there.\n       Kevin Cooper has movie stars and Jesse Jackson holding \n     rallies for him, people carrying signs, lighting candles, \n     saying prayers. To them and you I say:\n\n     I was 8 when he slit my throat,\n     It was dark and I couldn't see.\n     Through the night and day I laid there, trying to get up and \n           flee.\n     He killed my mother, father, sister, friend,\n     And started stalking me.\n     I try to run and flee from him but cannot get away,\n     While he demands petitions and claims, some fresh absurdity.\n     Justice has no ear for me nor cares about my plight, while \n           crowds pray for the killer and light candles in the \n           night.\n     To those who long for justice and love truth which sets men \n           free, When you pray your prayers tonight, please \n           remember me.\n\n  Even those who oppose capital punishment--who would like to see it \nabolished--should not support a system that treats the victims of \nviolent crimes in this way. Creating a fair, efficient, and expeditious \nsystem of Federal habeas review should be a bipartisan cause. Indeed, \nit was President Clinton who noted after the enactment of the 1996 \nAEDPA reforms that ``it should not take eight or nine years and three \ntrips to the Supreme Court to finalize whether a person in fact was \nproperly convicted or not.''\n  I believe that section 507 of the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act, by \nextending the benefits of chapter 154 to States that provide counsel to \ncapital defendants on postconviction review, will help to achieve that \ngoal. In Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 1989, the Supreme Court held \nthat States are not constitutionally required to provide counsel in \nState postconviction proceedings, even in capital cases. In AEDPA, \nCongress added chapter 154 to title 28 of the United States Code, \noffering the States an incentive to provide qualified counsel in such \nproceedings. Among the incentives was an expedited process, with time \nlimits on both the district courts and the courts of appeals.\n  AEDPA left the decision of whether a State qualified for the \nincentive to the same courts that were impacted by the time limits. \nThis has proved to be a mistake. Chapter 154 has received an extremely \ncramped interpretation, denying the benefits of qualification to States \nthat do provide qualified counsel and eliminating the incentive for \nother States to provide counsel. In\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nAshmus v. Woodford, 202 F.3d 1160, 2000, the Ninth Circuit held that \nCalifornia did not qualify because its competency standards were in the \nState's Standards of Judicial Administration rather than its Rules of \nCourt, a hypertechnical reading of the statute. In Spears v. Stewart, \n283 F.3d 992, 1018, 2001, the Ninth Circuit held that even though \nArizona had established a qualifying system and even though the State \ncourt had appointed counsel under that system, the Federal court could \nstill deny the State the benefit of qualification because of a delay in \nappointing counsel.\n  Section 507 of this bill abrogates both of these holdings and removes \nthe qualification decision to a neutral forum. Under new section 2265, \nthe Attorney General of the United States will decide if a State has \nestablished a qualifying mechanism, and that decision will be reviewed \nby the D.C. Circuit, the only Federal circuit that does not handle \nState-prisoner habeas cases and therefore is not impacted by the \nqualification decision. The requirements for certification are removed \nfrom section 2261(b) and placed in the new section 2265(a). The \n``statute or rule of court'' language construed so severely by Ashmus \nis removed, allowing the States flexibility on how to establish the \nmechanism within the State's judicial structure. There is no longer any \nrequirement, express or implied, that any particular organ of \ngovernment establish the mechanism for appointing and paying counsel or \nproviding standards of competency--States may act through their \nlegislatures, their courts, through agencies such as judicial councils, \nor even through local governments.\n  Once a State is certified as having a qualifying mechanism, chapter \n154 applies to all cases in which counsel was appointed pursuant to \nthat mechanism, and to cases where counsel was not appointed because \nthe defendant waived counsel, retained his own, or had the means to \nretain his own. ``Pursuant'' is intended to mean only that the State's \nqualifying mechanism was invoked to appoint counsel, not to empower the \nFederal courts to supervise the State courts' administration of their \nappointment systems. Paragraph (a)(3) of new section 2265 forbids \ncreation of additional requirements not expressly stated in the \nchapter, as was done in the Spears case.\n\n  When section 507 was being finalized, I and others were presented \nwith arguments that some mechanism should be created for \n``decertifying'' a State that has opted in to chapter 154 but that \nallegedly has fallen out of compliance with its standards. I ultimately \nconcluded that such a mechanism was unnecessary, and that it would \nlikely impose substantial litigation burdens on the opt-in States that \nwould outweigh any justification for the further review. The States are \nentitled to a presumption that once they have been certified as \nchapter-154 compliant, they will substantially maintain their counsel \nmechanisms. After all, to this day, both California and Arizona have \nkept up their postconviction counsel mechanisms and standards since the \nlate 1980s and the mid-1990s, respectively, even though neither State \nhas ever received any benefits under chapter 154. This history alone \nsuggests that it is unnecessary to provide a mechanism for \n``decertification'' of States that have opted in. Moreover, if such a \nmeans of post-opt-in review were created, it inevitably would be \noverused and abused. In my home State of Arizona, defense attorneys in \nthe past have boycotted the 154 system. The Ninth Circuit later used \nthe delays in appointing chapter 154 counsel stemming from this boycott \nas grounds for denying Arizona the benefits of chapter 154 in the \nSpears case. In light of this history, I thought it best to create a \nsystem of one-time certification, with no avenues to challenge or \nattempt to repeal the State's continuing chapter-154 eligibility. The \nconsequences of opting in to chapter 154 should not be perpetual \nlitigation over the State's continuing eligibility. Even if defense \nlawyers in Arizona do boycott the State's system again, the resultant \ndelays in appointing counsel are unlikely to prejudice their clients, \nwho typically want delay in the resolution of their cases. And the \noccasional case where such delay might prejudice a petitioner simply is \nnot worth the cost of creating opportunities to force the State to \ncontinually litigate its chapter 154 eligibility. Therefore, under \nsection 507, once a State is certified for chapter 154, that \ncertification is final. There is no provision for ``decertification'' \nor ``compliance review'' after the State has been made subject to \nchapter 154.\n  The incentive for a State to try to satisfy chapter 154's counsel \nrequirement is the array of procedural benefits that 154 provides to \nStates defending capital convictions and sentences on Federal habeas. \nSection 2266 applies a series of deadlines for court action on chapter \n154 applications: district courts will be required to rule on such \napplications 15 months after they are filed.\n  Allow me as an aside to describe some of the back history of this \nparticular deadline. Current pre-conference-report law gives district \ncourts only 180 days to rule on a 154 petition. This probably is not \nenough time for district courts to rule on these cases, even with the \nstreamlining provided by the rest of chapter 154. Nor was this reality \nobscure to Congress in 1996. I worked on developing this provision in \nmy first year in the Senate, in cooperation with the Arizona Attorney \nGeneral's Office and then-California Attorney General Dan Lungren, \namong others. The bill's managers initially adopted a 180-day deadline \nas a bargaining position, but had always intended to extend this limit \nto 1 year. Unfortunately, at a certain point in the legislative \nprocess, other participants decided that they would object to making \nany change whatsoever to the AEDPA, even to correct scrivener's or \ngrammatical errors--or to liberalize this deadline. Thus we ended up \nwith 180 days. In order to avoid imposing impossible burdens on the \ndistrict courts, I proposed extending this deadline to 15 months in the \nSPA, and this extension has been included in section 507. I likely \nwould receive a cool reception from Chief Judge McNamee upon my next \nvisit to the Phoenix Federal courthouse had section 507 given Arizona \naccess to chapter 154 without at least somewhat liberalizing this \nparticular deadline.\n\n  Other relevant deadlines imposed by section 2263 are that the court \nof appeals must rule on a case 120 days after briefing has been \ncompleted. That court also must rule on a petition for rehearing and \nsuggestion for rehearing en banc within 30 days of the filing of the \npetition and any reply. And if the court grants rehearing or goes en \nbanc, it must decide the case within 120 days of doing so.\n  These deadlines are created by chapter 154 for a reason. In too many \ncases, Federal courts' resolution of capital habeas petitions has been \nunreasonably slow. In the Fornoff case, for example, the petition \nremained before the Federal district court from 1992 to 1999, and that \ncourt did not even hold an evidentiary hearing in the case during that \ntime. And this is far from the most extreme example of habeas delay. At \nthe end of her written testimony before the House Crime Subcommittee, \nMrs. Fornoff included several examples of other cases involving habeas \npetitioners who had murdered children and whose Federal habeas \nproceedings have been unconscionably delayed. All of these examples \ninvolved delays in the district courts much longer than the 7-year \ndelay in the case of the man who killed Christy Ann Fornoff: the \nseveral cases that Mrs. Fornoff described had remained before one \nFederal district court for periods of 10 years, 12 years, 13 years, and \nin one case, for 15 years. I quote the portion of Mrs. Fornoff's \ntestimony describing these cases:\n\n       Benjamin Brenneman [was] 12 years old [when he was killed \n     in] 1981. This case is surprisingly similar to my daughter's \n     case. Benjamin also was a newspaper carrier, and also was \n     kidnaped, sexually assaulted, and killed while delivering \n     newspapers at an apartment complex. Benjamin's killer tied \n     him up in a way that strangled him when he moved. Police \n     began by questioning a man in the building who was a prior \n     sex offender. They found Benjamin's special orthopedic \n     sandals in his apartment. When they interviewed him, he \n     admitted that he kidnaped Benjamin, but claimed that ``he was \n     alive when I left him.'' Police found Benjamin's body in a \n     nearby rural area the next day. (More information about the \n     case is available in the court opinion for the State appeal, \n     People v. Thompson, 785 P.2d 857.)\n       Benjamin's killer was convicted and sentenced to death. \n     After the State courts finished their review of the case, the \n     killer filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District \n     Court in 1990. Today, 15 years later, the\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n     case is still before that same court. In 15 years, the \n     district court still has not ruled on the case! To put the \n     matter in perspective, so far, and with no end in sight, the \n     litigation before that one district court has outlived \n     Benjamin by three years. This is simply unconscionable.\n       Michelle and Melissa Davis [were] ages 7 and 2 [when they \n     were murdered in] 1982. An ex-boyfriend of the sister of \n     Kathy Davis took revenge on the sister for breaking off their \n     relationship by killing Kathy's husband and her two young \n     daughters, Michelle and Melissa. The killer confessed to the \n     crime. The State courts finished their review of the case in \n     1991. (People v. Deere, 808 P.2d 1181.) The next year, the \n     defendant went to the Federal District Court. He remained \n     there for the rest of the decade, until 2001. When he lost \n     there, he appealed, and in 2003, the Federal Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit sent the case back to the district \n     court for another hearing. Today, 14 years after State \n     appeals were completed, and 23 years after Michelle and \n     Melissa were taken from their mother, the case remains before \n     the same district court.\n       Vanessa Iberri [was] 12 years old [when she was killed in] \n     1981. Vanessa and her friend Kelly, also 12 years old, were \n     both shot in the head while walking through a campground in \n     1981. Kelly survived, but Vanessa did not. The killer did not \n     dispute that he shot the two girls. (The case is described in \n     People v. Edwards, 819 P.2d 436.) The State courts finished \n     their review of the case in 1991--already a long time. The \n     killer then went to Federal court in 1993. The Federal \n     District Court finally held an evidentiary hearing in \n     December 2004, and dismissed the case in March of this year. \n     Just now, 12 years after the case entered the Federal courts, \n     and 24 years after the murders occurred, the appeal to the \n     Federal Court of Appeals is just beginning.\n       Michelle Melander [was] 5 months old [when she was murdered \n     in] 1981. Michelle, who was just a five-month-old baby, and \n     her brother Michael, then 5 years old, were kidnaped in \n     Parker, Arizona, in July 1981. The killer dropped off Michael \n     along the road. Michelle's body was discovered six days later \n     at a garbage dump several miles down the same road. She had \n     been severely beaten and sexually mutilated. The State court \n     opinion describes the many injuries that this helpless baby \n     suffered. The man who committed this horrific crime later \n     attempted to kidnap and rape a 10-year-old girl.\n       State courts finished their review of his case in 1991. \n     (People v. Pensinger, 805 P.2d 899.) The case then went to \n     Federal District Court in 1992. The defendant raised new \n     claims that he had never argued in state court, so the \n     Federal court sent the case back to state court. Five years \n     later, the case returned to Federal court. Today, the case \n     remains before the same Federal District Court where the \n     Federal appeals began in 1992. Baby Michelle would be 24 \n     years old now if she had lived, and there is no end in \n     sight for her killer's appeals.\n\n  Other examples of extreme delays on Federal habeas have been provided \nto me by State prosecutors. Clarence Ray Allen, who was executed by the \nState of California earlier this year, had begun his Federal habeas \nproceedings in 1988--they lasted for over 17 years. Lawrence Bittaker \nwas convicted of four murders, four kidnappings, and nine rapes by the \nState of California in 1981. He filed a habeas petition in the Federal \ndistrict court in 1991. That petition still is pending before the same \nFederal district court today. Alejandro Ruiz was convicted and \nsentenced to death for three murders in 1980. He initiated Federal \nhabeas proceedings in 1989. Those proceedings still are pending before \nthe same Federal district court today.\n  I do not mean to single out the Federal district courts for \ncriticism. Inexplicable delays in Federal habeas review of State \nconvictions appear throughout the Federal system. Section 2263's \ndeadlines for issuing court-of-appeals decisions and resolving \nappellate rehearing petitions also are manifestly necessary. In Morales \nv. Woodford, 336 F.3d 1136, 9th Cir. 2003, for example, the Ninth \nCircuit took 3 years to decide the case after briefing was completed. \nAnd after issuing its decision, the court took another 16 months to \nreject a petition for rehearing. Similarly, in Williams v. Woodford, \n306 F.3d 665, 9th Cir. 2002, the court waited 25 months to decide the \ncase after briefing was finished--and then waited another 27 months to \nreject a petition for rehearing, for a total delay of almost 4\\1/2\\ \nyears after appellate briefing had been completed. Section 2263 would \nhave sharply reduced these delays.\n  Chapter 154 also creates uniform, clear rules for addressing \ndefaulted and unexhausted claims. It bars all review of any claim that \nhas not been addressed on the merits when the Federal petition is \nfiled, unless the claim meets one of three narrow exceptions. Section \n2264, by not extending the chapter 153 exhaustion requirement to \nchapter 154, allows Federal courts to treat defaulted and unexhausted \nclaims the same way, rather than distinguishing between them and only \ndismissing the former unless they meet an exception, but returning the \nlatter to State court for further exhaustion. Chapter 154 eliminates \nthe need to ever send a claim to State court for further exhaustion.\n  As those familiar with the history of chapter 154 are aware, the \nchapter has its origins in the 1989 Powell Committee Report. See \nJudicial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Committee on Federal \nHabeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Committee Report and Proposal, August \n23, 1989. Then-Chief Justice Rehnquist had appointed former Justice \nLewis Powell to chair this committee, which was charged with studying \nproblems with Federal habeas corpus review of capital cases. The report \nidentified a lack of finality and unnecessary delays in Federal \ncollateral review of State capital cases, and recommended specific \nreforms. With a few significant changes, such as a more restrictive \nstandard for holding evidentiary hearings and accommodation of the rule \nof Teague v. Lane, not to mention the changes that are about to be made \nby section 507, the Powell Committee Report's recommendations are what \nis now chapter 154. The Powell Report is thus a very useful guide to \nunderstanding chapter 154.\n\n  The Powell Committee Report explains, for example, why section 2264 \neliminates the exhaustion rule and treats unexhausted claims the same \nway as defaulted claims. As the Report notes:\n\n       The Committee identified serious problems with the present \n     system of collateral review. These may be broadly \n     characterized under the heading of unnecessary delay and \n     repetition. The lack of coordination between the Federal and \n     state legal systems often results in inefficient and \n     unnecessary steps in the course of litigation. Prisoners, for \n     example, often spend significant time moving back and forth \n     between the Federal and state systems in the process of \n     exhausting state remedies.\n\n  The Powell Committee Report then describes its proposed approach to \nunexhausted claims:\n\n       Federal habeas proceedings under the proposal will \n     encompass only claims that have been exhausted in state \n     court. With the counsel provided by the statute, there should \n     be no excuse for failure to raise claims in state court. The \n     statute departs from current statutory exhaustion practice by \n     allowing for immediate presentation of new claims in Federal \n     court in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n  The Powell Committee Report further elaborates on this change to the \nexhaustion requirement in its comment following the presentation of the \nlanguage that became section 2264:\n\n       If a petitioner asserts a claim not previously presented to \n     the state courts, the district court can consider the claim \n     only if one of three exceptions to the general rule listed in \n     [section 2264(a)] is applicable. . . .\n       As far as new or ``unexhausted'' claims are concerned, \n     section [2264] represents a change in the exhaustion doctrine \n     as articulated in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982). Section \n     [2264] bars such claims from consideration unless one of the \n     [subsection (a)] exceptions is applicable. The prisoner \n     cannot return to state court to exhaust even if he would like \n     to do so. On the other hand, if a [subsection (a)] exception \n     is applicable, the district court is directed to conduct an \n     evidentiary hearing [note that this aspect of the Powell \n     Committee recommendation is superseded by section 2254(e)] \n     and to rule on the new claim without first exhausting state \n     remedies as Rose v. Lundy now requires. Because of the \n     existence of state procedural default rules, exhaustion is \n     futile in the great majority of cases. It serves the state \n     interest of comity in theory, but in practice it results in \n     delay and undermines the state interest in the finality of \n     its criminal convictions. The Committee believes that the \n     States would prefer to see post-conviction litigation go \n     forward in capital cases, even if that entails a \n     minor subordination of their interest in comity as it is \n     expressed in the exhaustion doctrine.\n\n  Section 2264 implemented the Powell Committee's approach by limiting \nFederal habeas review under chapter 154 to ``claims that have been \nraised and decided on merits in the State courts,'' and, in subsection \n(b), by declining to extend the exhaustion principles of section \n2254(b) and (c) to chapter 154. This system shifts the focus away from \nand eliminates the need to exhaust State remedies for every claim. \nSection 2264 does not require exhaustion, but, rather, adjudication on \nthe merits in State court or satisfaction of one of subsection (a)'s \nexceptions. If an unexhausted or otherwise not-adjudicated-on-the-\nmerits claim can meet\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\none of those subsection (a) exceptions, then it can go forward, because \nthe exhaustion requirement does not apply. And in any event, even if a \nchapter 154 prisoner, for whatever reason, still wanted to exhaust \nState remedies for a new claim after he has filed his Federal petition, \nhe would not be able to do so and then return to Federal court: unlike \nchapter 153, chapter 154 sharply curtails amendments to petitions and \nthus would make it all but impossible to amend the newly exhausted \nclaim back into the Federal petition. Under chapter 153's stay-and-abey \nregime, ``a district court may, in its discretion, allow a petitioner \nto amend a mixed petition by deleting the unexhausted claims, hold the \nexhausted petition claims in abeyance until the unexhausted claims are \nexhausted, and then allow the petitioner to amend the stayed petition \nto add the now-exhausted claims.'' James v. Pliler, 269 F.3d 1124, 9th \nCir. 2001. As the courts have explained, chapter-153 habeas petitioners \nare permitted to ``stay and abey'' and then come back to Federal court \nbecause chapter 153 petitions are subject to the relatively liberal \namendment standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. See Anthony \nv. Cambra, 263 F.3d 568, 576-578 (9th Cir. 2000). This system would not \nbe possible under chapter 154's section 2266(b)(3)(B), however. That \nsubparagraph would bar the post-exhaustion amendment that restores the \nnewly exhausted claims unless the amendment could meet the exacting \nstandards of the successive-petition bar.\n  Instead of staying and abeying and further exhausting, the chapter \n154 petitioner will go forward: his claims in the Federal petition will \nhave either been raised and adjudicated on the merits in State court, \nthey will satisfy one of the section 2264(a) exceptions, or they will \nbe dismissed, and Federal adjudication of the merits of the claims that \nremain before the court will commence immediately. This streamlined \napproach is what makes chapter 154's deadlines for district court \nadjudication possible. Obviously, if applicants were expected to use \nthe stay-and-abeyance system, and proceedings were put on hold so that \nanother round of State-court review could be completed, district courts \nwould not be able to resolve chapter 154 petitions within 15-month \nlimit, much less the 180 days required prior to 2006, that is imposed \nby section 2266.\n  Section 2264's abolition of stay-and-abey would have made a real \ndifference in some of the cases that I have described. For example, in \nthe case of the man who killed Mary Ann Hughes's son, eliminating the \nneed to return to State court to exhaust new claims would have reduced \nthe delay in the Federal proceedings by nearly 3 years. And in the case \nof Michelle Melander, the baby girl who was killed in 1981 whose case \nis described in Carol Fornoff's testimony, the section 2264 system \nwould have eliminated 5 years of delay from the ongoing Federal \nproceedings in that case.\n\n  By requiring that chapter 154 courts only consider claims adjudicated \non the merits in the State courts, and limiting the exceptions to that \nrule to those enumerated in section 2264(a), chapter 154 also \neffectively eliminates use of several other exceptions to the \nprocedural-default doctrine that I believe have proven problematic. The \nchapter 153 procedural-default doctrine derives from the Supreme \nCourt's own rules for allowing review of a State court judgment when \nrespondent asserts the presence of an adequate and independent State \nbar to review of the Federal question. These exceptions are numerous, \ncomplex, and in some cases they are overly broad and simply do not \nprovide an adequate justification for ignoring State procedural rules. \nIt generally is not a significant burden on the States that the U.S. \nSupreme Court has granted itself such broad and amorphous authority to \noverride State procedural requirements. The Supreme Court only decides \na limited number of cases every year. But on Federal habeas, where \nevery State criminal conviction effectively is subject to ``appeal of \nright'' in Federal court, application of the full panoply of the U.S. \nSupreme Court's exceptions to the adequate-and-independent State \ngrounds rule has become burdensome and unwieldy.\n  One exception to the adequate-and-independent State grounds doctrine \nthat has proved particularly problematic in the habeas context is the \nrule that a State procedural bar is not adequate to preclude further \nFederal review if the procedural requirement is ``inconsistently \napplied'' by the State courts. Viewed literally and without regard to \nthe policies underlying the procedural default doctrine, the \n``inconsistently applied'' standard can have a disturbingly broad \nsweep. This standard can be understood to void any State procedural \nrule that has been altered in any way or that is not strictly enforced \nin absolutely every case.\n  Unfortunately, some lower Federal courts have adopted this draconian \ninterpretation. For example, the Ninth Circuit has held that if a \nState's highest court clarifies a State procedural rule or reconciles \ncompeting interpretations of that rule, then that rule was \n``inconsistently applied'' prior to such clarification. As a result, \nthe Ninth Circuit deems the State rule ``inadequate'' to be enforced on \nFederal habeas review prior to that point.\n  Another problematic area of chapter-153 procedural-default \njurisprudence is particular Federal courts' interpretation of the \n``independence'' requirement. A State procedural decision cannot serve \nas a bar to further review on the merits if it is not truly \nprocedural--i.e., if it is in reality a decision on the merits of the \nFederal claim. Many State courts have incorporated into their \nprocedural rules--particularly their deadlines for filing claims--an \n``ends of justice,'' ``plain error,'' or ``manifest injustice'' \nexception that allows State courts to hear the occasional egregious but \nuntimely or otherwise improper claim. Presumably, in applying such an \nexception, these State courts perform at least a cursory review of the \nmerits of every petition, even those that clearly are untimely. \nTechnically, because these State courts conduct such review, their \ndeadlines are not purely ``procedural''--they involve some review, \nhowever fleeting, of the merits--and therefore these deadlines are not \n``adequate'' for habeas purposes. The Ninth Circuit has adopted this \nrather extreme interpretation of the adequacy requirement.\n  It is difficult to understate the perverse consequences of the more \nextreme interpretations of the exceptions to the chapter-153 procedural \ndefault doctrine. By punishing State courts for ever departing from or \neven clarifying their procedural rules, or for exercising discretion to \nhear egregious cases, these interpretations deter State courts from \nmaking the kind of commonsense decisions that are essential to \npreventing a miscarriage of justice. No system of procedure will ever \nbe perfect; every system will always require some exceptions in order \nto operate fairly and efficiently. Yet under some Federal courts' \ninterpretations of procedural default, unless the State court adopts a \nzero-tolerance approach to all untimely claims, no matter how worthy of \nan exception, the State procedural rule is at risk of being voided for \nall Federal habeas cases.\n  In Arizona, litigants have seen the inevitable consequences of the \nNinth Circuit's no-good-deed-goes-unpunished rule: when liberality \ntowards criminal defendants is held against the State on Federal \nhabeas, the State will outlaw such liberality. In his August 19, 2005, \nanswers to written questions submitted to him by Senator Leahy, Arizona \nprosecutor John Todd described the effect of the Ninth Circuit's \napplication of an extreme ``independence'' requirement:\n\n     as a result of Federal court rulings, the Arizona Legislature \n     repealed the requirement that all criminal cases be reviewed \n     by the state appellate courts for fundamental error. When an \n     appellate court in Arizona reviewed the entire record for \n     fundamental error, it did not matter that the defendant \n     procedurally defaulted the issue. If the error were serious \n     enough, even if it was only an error of state law, a \n     defendant would receive relief in state court through this \n     fundamental error review. Fearing that the Ninth Circuit's \n     decision in Beam v. Paskett, 3 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir. \n     1993), would open Arizona criminal cases to endless \n     litigation, the Arizona Legislature repealed Ariz. Rev. Stat. \n     Ann. Sec. 13-4035 in 1995.\n\n  This is not a result that anyone should want. States should not be \ndiscouraged from affording broad review to a prisoner's claims in State \ncourt or exercising flexibility in their application of procedural \nrules. Yet in the Ninth Circuit, State executives would be ill advised \nto adopt any procedural rule that affords courts any discretion\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\nor includes any plain-error type exceptions.\n  The Ninth Circuit has accounted for a disproportionate share of all \nFederal court of appeals decisions identifying exceptions to the \nchapter-153 procedural default doctrine, and has issued several \nparticularly extreme interpretations of the doctrine. The States in \nthat circuit effectively are subject to a different habeas regime. The \nNinth Circuit has now voided State procedural rules in six of the \nStates under its jurisdiction. It has found State procedures either \ninadequate or insufficiently independent to limit Federal review in \nCalifornia, Oregon, Arizona, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada.\n  Section 2264 eliminates these problems. Rather than incorporating the \nprocedural-default doctrine and all of its baggage, it starts fresh; it \nbars all claims not raised and decided on the merits unless one of \nthree narrow exceptions applies. It does not matter under chapter 154 \nthat a Federal court thinks that the State's rules are not ``adequate'' \nor are not sufficiently ``independent,'' because the adequacy and \nindependence of the State rule no longer are the basis for barring \nreview of the claim in Federal court. Under chapter 154, that basis \nwill be section 2264, which employs its own standard and exceptions. \nAnd under that section, no longer will the labyrinthine body of caselaw \ngoverning the Supreme Court's certiorari jurisdiction over cases \ndecided on State-law grounds be applied to every State capital \nconviction on Federal collateral review.\n\n  Section 2264 also eliminates the overused ``ineffective assistance \ngateway'' that is a frequent feature of chapter 153 litigation. Under \nchapter 153, litigants often seek to recast claims that they know are \ndefaulted as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. They argue \nthat the default should be excused because State trial or appellate \ncounsel was ineffective. Chapter 154 does not include this exception. \nIf a claim of ineffective assistance of trial or appellate counsel \nitself was raised and decided on the merits in State court, that same \nclaim can be raised in Federal court. But otherwise, chapter 154 \ncharges petitioners with the acts of their attorneys. The whole point \nof chapter 154 is to persuade States to establish mechanisms for \nproviding defendants with qualified postconviction counsel. If a State \nhas opted in to chapter 154, the petitioner presumptively received \nqualified counsel at all stages of his State proceedings, and \nopportunities to litigate issues of counsel competency should be scaled \nback. If the factual predicate of a claim could have been discovered \nthrough the exercise of due diligence, then per paragraph (3) of \nsection 2264(a), regardless of what the attorney did or did not do, \nthat claim does not qualify for an exception to the main rule of \n2264(a) and it cannot be raised in Federal court.\n  It also bears mention that section 507 includes a retroactivity \nprovision that my Arizona colleague, Congressman Flake, thought \nparticularly important. New section 2265(a)(2) provides that the date \nthat a State established the mechanism by which it qualifies for \nchapter 154 ``shall be the effective date of the certification under \nthis subsection.'' This was intended to ensure that if a State \nestablished a mechanism for providing qualified counsel to capital \ndefendants on postconviction review prior to the formal designation of \na State as chapter-154 eligible--or even prior to the enactment of \nchapter 154--then all capital defendants who received counsel after the \nestablishment of that mechanism shall be subject to chapter 154, even \nif they filed a Federal petition before the State is certified as \nchapter-154 eligible.\n  I had originally thought this provision sufficient to ensure that a \nState would receive the full benefits of chapter 154 even for Federal \npetitions filed before the State is certified as chapter-154 compliant. \nBut questions of retroactivity often prove more complicated than they \nfirst appear. Representative Flake raised with me the question of \nwhether even if a Federal petition filed precertification is deemed \nsubject to chapter 154, Federal courts could still find that the \nprocedural benefits of chapter 154 only apply to that case on a going-\nforward basis. In other words, the effective-date provision guarantees \nthat even a prefiling petition is now governed by chapter 154, but \nchapter 154's procedural restrictions might be construed to not apply \nto what is already in that petition. For States such as Arizona, this \nwould mean--assuming, of course, that I am correct in predicting that \nthe U.S. Attorney General will find Arizona 154-eligible--that section \n507 does not completely undo the damage done by the Spears case. It is \npossible, for example, that in Spears itself or in subsequent cases \nthat should have been subject to chapter 154, additional claims have \nbeen amended into the petition that would not satisfy 2266(b)(3)(B), or \nunexhausted claims already may have been returned to State court for \nfurther exhaustion and the Federal petition stayed.\n\n  Given that stay-and-abey sometimes adds 5 years to the time that it \ntakes to address a Federal petition, Mr. Flake and I decided that it \nshould be made clear that the whole petition would be subject to \nchapter 154, not just new claims and amendments added after the State \nis certified as 154 eligible. To that end, subsection (d) was inserted \ninto the middle of section 507 to ensure that the 154 changes--\nincluding the effective-date provision--would operate against pending \ncases. In effect, this provision guarantees the even for a pending \ncase, the effective date provision applies retroactively and the case \nis regarded as always having been subject to chapter 154. Thus once a \nState is certified as 154-eligible and a particular petition falls \nwithin that chapter's sweep, the courts should review the whole \npetition and treat it as if chapter 154 had been applicable since \nbefore the petition was filed. Claims added via post-answer amendments \nshould be reviewed for consistency with section 2266(b)(3)(B). If they \ndo not qualify, they should be struck, just as they would have been if \nthe petition had been governed by chapter 154 at the time when the \namendment was filed. And most importantly, no unexhausted claim in a \nchapter-154 petition may be permitted to serve as a basis for ``stay \nand abey.'' Either that claim will satisfy one of the 2264(a) \nexceptions, and review of that claim and ``raised and decided'' claims \nin the petition will go forward immediately, or the claim will not meet \nthe exception, it will be dismissed, and review of the rest of the \nproper claims in that petition will go forward immediately. In either \nevent, review of all Federal petitions made subject to chapter 154 will \ngo forward immediately, though the petitioner may, of course, continue \nto simultaneously pursue State review of the unexhausted claim, and the \nchapter 154 time deadlines will start running. Per paragraph (d)(2), \nthat deadline does not run until section 507 is enacted with regard to \na particular State--meaning that it does not run until the State is \ncertified as chapter-154 eligible pursuant to section 507. Under \nsection 507, once a petition is made subject to chapter 154, it can no \nlonger be held in abeyance so that the petitioner can pursue State \nexhaustion of unexhausted claims.\n  Finally, I would like to thank those individuals who have been \nimportant to the enactment of section 507. This group includes Mike \nO'Neill and Brett Tolman of Chairman Specter's staff, Mike Volkov of \nChairman Sensenbrenner's staff, and Brian Clifford of Congressman \nFlake's staff. I also thank Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice \nLegal Foundation, who came up with the idea that became section 507. \nFinally, I also thank Chairman Specter, who was willing to accommodate \nme on a matter of importance to prosecutors and crime victims in the \nState of Arizona by including section 507 in this conference report.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will \nconclude a process that began over a year ago by reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act. I will have a few closing remarks, but first I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank the extraordinary staff who have worked \non this bill for so long. These men and women, on both sides of the \naisle, have worked extremely hard, and\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nthey deserve to be recognized. Before I yield the floor, I will \nrecognize the staff by name.\n  Mr. President, beginning in November, when we first saw a draft of \nthe conference report, I have spoken at length about the substance of \nthis bill. I hoped that when we started the task of reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act at the beginning of last year, the end product would be \nsomething the whole Senate could support. We had a real chance to pass \na bill that would both reauthorize the tools to prevent terrorism and \nfix the provisions that threaten the rights and freedoms of innocent \nAmericans.\n  This conference report, even as amended by the bill incorporating the \nWhite House deal that we passed yesterday, falls well short of that \ngoal. And so, of course, I will vote no.\n  Protecting the country from terrorism while also protecting our \nrights is a challenge for every one of us, particularly in the current \npolitical climate, and it is a challenge we all take seriously. I know \nmany Senators who will vote for this reauthorization bill in a few \nminutes would have preferred to enact the bill we actually passed, \nwithout a single objection, in the Senate in July of last year.\n  I appreciate that so many of my colleagues came to recognize the need \nto take the opportunity presented by the sunset provisions included in \nthe original PATRIOT Act to make changes that would better protect \ncivil liberties than did the law we enacted in haste in October 2001. \nNevertheless, I am deeply disappointed we have largely wasted this \nopportunity to fix the obvious problems with the PATRIOT Act.\n  The reason I spent so much time in the past few days talking about \nhow the public views the PATRIOT Act was to make it clear that this \nfight was not about one Senator arguing about the details of the law. \nThis fight was about trying to restore the public's trust in our \nGovernment. That trust has been severely shaken as the public learned \nmore and more about the PATRIOT Act which we passed with so little \ndebate in 2001 and as the administration resisted congressional \noversight efforts and repeatedly politicized the reauthorization \nprocess. The revelations about secret, warrantless surveillance last \nyear only confirmed the suspicions of many in our country that the \nGovernment is, unfortunately, willing to trample the rule of law and \nconstitutional guarantees in the fight against terrorism.\n  The truth is, the negative reaction to the PATRIOT Act has been \noverwhelming. Over 400 State and local government bodies passed \nresolutions pleading with Congress to change the law. Citizens have \nsigned petitions, library associations and campus groups have organized \nto petition the Congress to act. Numerous editorials have been written \nurging Congress not to reauthorize the law without adequate protections \nfor civil liberties.\n  These things occurred because Americans across the country recognize \nthat the PATRIOT Act includes provisions that pose a threat to their \nprivacy and to their liberty. These are values--values--that are at the \nvery core of what this country represents and of who we are as a \npeople.\n  In 2001, we were viciously attacked by terrorists who care nothing \nfor American freedoms and American values. We, as a people, came \ntogether to fight back, and we are prepared to make great sacrifices to \ndefeat those who would destroy us. But what we will not do, and what we \ncannot do, is destroy our own freedoms in the process.\n  Without freedom, we are not America. If we do not preserve our \nliberties, we cannot win this war, no matter how many terrorists we \ncapture or kill. That is why the several Senators who have said, at one \ntime or another during this debate, things such as, ``Civil liberties \ndo not mean much when you are dead,'' are wrong about America at the \nmost basic level. It seems they do not understand what America is all \nabout. Theirs is a vision that the Founders of this Nation, who risked \neverything for freedom, would categorically reject, and so do the \nAmerican people.\n  Americans want to defeat terrorism, and they want the basic character \nof this country to survive and prosper. They want to empower the \nGovernment to protect the Nation from terrorists, and they want \nprotections against Government overreaching and Government \noverreacting. They know it might not be easy, but they expect the \nCongress to figure out how to do it. They do not want defeatism--\ndefeatism--on either score. They want both security and liberty. And \nunless we give them both--and we can, if we try--then we have failed.\n  This fight is not over. The vote today will not assuage the deep and \nlegitimate concerns the public has about the PATRIOT Act. I am \nconvinced that in the end the Government will respond to the people, as \nit should. We will defeat the terrorists, and we will preserve the \nfreedom and liberty that make this the greatest country on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  It has been a particular privilege to work for so long and so closely \nwith the bipartisan group that developed the SAFE Act. Each Senator is \nsupported by dedicated and talented staff, and let me mention a few of \nthem now. For Senator Sununu, Dave Cuzzi. Joe Zogby for Senator Durbin; \nBrooke Roberts and Lisa McGrath for Senator Craig; Sam Mitchell with \nSenator Salazar; and Isaac Edwards with Senator Murkowski. Let me also \nrecognize Bruce Cohen, Julie Katzman, and Tara Magner with Senator \nLeahy; and Chairman Specter's hardworking team--Mike O'Neill, Brett \nTolman, and Nick Rossi. Other key staff on the Judiciary Committee \ninclude Joe Matal with Senator Kyl; Christine Leonard with Senator \nKennedy; Steve Cash for Senator Feinstein; Paul Thompson with Senator \nDeWine; Reed O'Connor with Senator Cornyn; and Bruce Artim with Senator \nHatch; Cindy Hayden with Senator Sessions; Preet Bharara with Senator \nSchumer; Chad Groover with Senator Grassley; Eric Rosen with Senator \nBiden; Ajit Pai with Senator Brownback; Mary Chesser with Senator \nCoburn; Nate Jones with Senator Kohl; and James Galyean with Senator \nGraham.\n  Staff for a number of Senators not on the committee worked very hard \non this bill as well. Let me recognize Brandon Milhorn and Jack \nLivingston for Senator Roberts; Mike Davidson, who works for Senator \nRockefeller; Joe Bryan with Senator Levin; Alex Perkins and John Dickas \nwith Senator Wyden; Steve Taylor with Senator Hagel; Ruchi Bhowmik with \nSenator Obama; Mirah Horowitz with Senator Kerry; Caryn Compton with \nSenator Byrd; Eric Buehlmann with Senator Jeffords; and Alan Hicks with \nSenator Frist. And thanks also to Senator Reid's staffers, Ron Weich \nand Serena Hoy, and to our Democratic floor staff--Marty Paone, Lula \nDavis, Gary Myrick, Chris Kang, and Mike Spahn for their help over the \npast several weeks of this debate.\n  Finally, let me sincerely thank my own tireless and dedicated staff: \nMary Irvine, Paul Weinberger, Sumner Slichter, Chuck Stertz, Bob \nSchiff, Lara Flint, Farhana Khera, Alex Busansky, Sarah Preis, Margaret \nWhiting, Molly Askin, John Haffner, Bharat Ramamurti, Avery Wentzel, \nTracy Jacobson, and Molly McNab.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. In more than 4 years since the September 11, 2001, attack \non the United States, the PATRIOT Act has helped to protect our \nhomeland from subsequent terrorist attack. Reauthorizing this effective \npiece of legislation is an important victory in the\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\ncontinued war on terror. The PATRIOT Act safeguards freedoms of \nAmerican citizens while aggressively curtailing the opportunities \nterrorists have to strike. We have added many provisions designed to \nensure that our civil liberties remain unaffected despite the fact that \ncivil libertarians were completely unable to point to one incident or \nprovide any example of abuses under the original PATRIOT Act.\n  As everybody knows, that act was negotiated in the Judiciary \nCommittee when I was chairman, and I had a lot to do with it, along \nwith Senator Leahy and others. We found that the original PATRIOT Act \nfunctioned very well in the protection of our country.\n  The PATRIOT Act has enjoyed robust public support in Utah since its \ninception. According to Dan Jones and Associates, our leading pollster \nin Utah, every time the firm has polled Utahns in the last 4 years, 60 \npercent or more have voiced approval of the antiterrorism measure. A \npoll of U.S. citizens reported that more than 60 percent of Americans \nbelieved that the Government should do more to protect this country \nfrom attack. Reauthorizing this act is definitely the right thing to do \nfor our country at a time when we tend to forget that there are people \nand governments out there and in here that are committed to wiping the \nUnited States of America off the face of the Earth. I, for one, will \nstand up and say: Not on my watch.\n  We have held hearing after hearing listening to all sides' robust \ndebate about how to change the PATRIOT Act. We have had some ridiculous \nsuggestions, we have had some good suggestions, and we have had some \nthat we have had to take on this bill that really are not very good. My \nprayer is that the terrorists will be foiled by our intelligence and \nlaw enforcement agencies before another attack. But we have to give \nthose agencies the tools to do that. I have a lot of faith in the \nability of law enforcement men and women to do the job effectively. My \nhope is that those who have agreed that we can take away some of the \ntools afforded these men and women are wrong, that we can prevent \nanother attack and reduce the ability of law enforcement to prevent \nthose attacks at the same time.\n\n  The additional language that has been demanded in this bill does \nexactly that. It has reduced our ability to be able to protect the \nNation under the guise that we had to protect civil liberties that were \nnever infringed upon in the 4 years that the PATRIOT Act has been in \nexistence. I particularly commend Senators Specter and Leahy for the \nwork they have done, Congressman Sensenbrenner in the House, and other \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee in the House. They have worked long \nand hard. There have been some provisions that we had to take in order \nto get this bill reauthorized to protect the American people that we \nwish we didn't have to take. I just hope this bill will work as well as \nthe original PATRIOT Act which has done so well in keeping us free of \nterror ever since 9/11.\n  I don't think anybody can doubt that. We held some 24 hearings over \nthe years when I was chairman on the PATRIOT Act. I demanded that every \nhearing show us where the act has not acted properly, show us where \nthere has been a violation, show us where there has been a violation of \ncivil liberties, show us where somebody who is a noncriminal has been \nhurt by the PATRIOT Act. The fact is, not one time in all those \nhearings have they been able to come up with one illustration that \npeople's civil liberties have been interfered with.\n  We passed a bill that was the Hatch-Dole bill back in, I believe it \nwas 1996. It was the antiterrorism effective death penalty bill. That \nbill took care of domestic terrorism, but our laws were not up to speed \nwith regard to international terrorism. So the PATRIOT Act was the way \nthat we got our laws up to speed so that we could work against \ninternational terrorism. All of these provisions in the original \nPATRIOT Act we basically have in our anticrime laws. So what we did is, \nwe had these laws that would enable law enforcement to do a lot of \nthings to protect us against the Mafia, against child molesters, \nagainst pornographers. We brought the PATRIOT Act up to the level of \nthose law enforcement tools. That is what the original PATRIOT Act did. \nThat wasn't good enough for some of our colleagues. So there has been a \nlot of screaming and shouting about the PATRIOT Act, even though not \none illustration has been given in the last, really, 5 years that would \nindicate that the original PATRIOT Act had interfered with anybody's \njust civil liberties.\n  We need to pass this bill such as it is. We need to pass it and enact \nit into law and give our law enforcement the tools they need to be able \nto protect us. I just wish we could have reenacted the original PATRIOT \nAct. But be that as it may, I compliment the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, for the \nwork they have done. I don't think it could have happened without them \nand without Chairman Sensenbrenner and others in the House. I express \nmy regard for them and my regard for this bill and hope everybody will \nvote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know some time has been specifically \nretained to the Senator from Vermont. Would the Chair be good enough to \ntell me how much time that is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my good friend.\n  Today's vote marks another stage in reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT \nAct. Our goal has always been to mend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. \nTo that end we passed a bipartisan bill with better provisions last \nJuly after it was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. I \nappreciate the kind words of the Senator from Utah. He voted for that \nbill. I voted for that bill. The distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Specter, voted for the bill. We have all been \nchairman of that committee. The bill came here to the floor of the \nSenate, and the Senate voted it out unanimously. That was a good bill.\n  Then the House-Senate conference was hijacked. Democratic conferees \nwere excluded at the request of the Bush-Cheney administration, and \ncongressional Republicans wrote the bill. I worked to get that process \nand the bill back on track and, working with Chairman Specter, we were \nable to make some progress and get some helpful additions and changes. \nBut the conference report that was insisted upon by the Bush-Cheney \nadministration and passed by Republican leaders through the House was \nstill flawed.\n  Last December, I worked with a bipartisan coalition of Senators to \noppose final passage of that conference report and create some \nadditional opportunities for improvements. That led to the Sununu bill \nwhich is in essence an amendment to the conference report. I supported \nSenator Sununu's efforts and praised him for it and those who worked \nwith him. I voted for that bill. It contained some of the improvements \nI had pushed for. Our efforts to protect libraries from national \nsecurity letters was very important to me. That is why I supported \nSenator Sununu's bill in spite of the worsening of the gag rule \nprovisions insisted upon by the Bush-Cheney administration.\n  Now we turn to the conference report. Even with the Sununu bill, \nwhich I support, the conference report has not been improved \nsufficiently for me to support it. Just as I opposed it last December, \nI continue to oppose it. The bill that the Senate will adopt today \nfalls far too short and impinges too greatly on the liberties of \nAmericans.\n\n  The Founders made a profound choice when they framed the fourth \namendment to our Constitution as a measure to ensure the right of the \npeople to be secure. The word they used was ``secure.'' The fourth \namendment is, of course, about guaranteeing our privacy rights and the \nrequirement of the judicial check on the Government invading our homes, \nour papers, and our effects. The Founders saw that as the right to be \nsecure. As the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written so \ncarefully, every single word holds meaning. They saw a right to be \nsecure, and so do I. I believe that Americans' security includes our \nnational security, our security from terrorism, and also our right to \nbe secure as Americans. That means exercising the liberties and rights \nand freedoms that define us across the world uniquely as Americans.\n  I do not believe this bill achieves the balance that we could have \nand should\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nhave achieved. The final product would have been better had the Bush-\nCheney administration and congressional Republicans not insisted on \nlocking Democrats out of the negotiations throughout the process.\n  Still this bill, through our efforts, in some ways represents an \nimprovement. It has better sunshine and reporting provisions. I worked \nhard to include these new provisions because sunshine, coupled with \nsunset provisions, adds up to more accountability in the use of these \nGovernment powers. But some key provisions remain significantly flawed.\n  I respect those who conclude that on balance the bill's virtues \noutweigh its vices. And it has both. But I believe we can and should do \nbetter. I believe America can do better.\n  I am one who worked diligently on the original PATRIOT Act in the \ndays following the attacks of 9/11. I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We moved it through in record time. I also voted to \nreauthorize and improve a bipartisan version of the act back in July of \n2005. I joined with Senator Sununu in leading the effort to ensure that \nthe provisions did not expire when we reached an impasse last fall.\n  In the PATRIOT Act, we provided important and valuable tools for the \nprotection of Americans from terrorism, and I have worked and voted to \npreserve them. But I am disappointed that this conference report \nrepresents a missed opportunity to get it right, to recalibrate the \nbalance better, to respect the liberties and rights of Americans while \nprotecting us from those who threaten harm.\n  I am concerned, as all Americans are, with our security. The \nPresiding Officer and I and thousands of others come to work every day \nin a building that was targeted for destruction by al-Qaida. I cannot \nthink of anything I will do in my life that makes me more proud than to \nbe in the Senate and come in this building every day. But I want this \nbuilding secure for you, for me, and for everybody who works here. I \nknow what it means to be targeted. I was a target of a letter laced \nwith deadly anthrax. I was supposed to open it. A couple of innocent \npostal workers who touched the outside of the envelope died before it \nreached me, and it was stopped before it got to my desk. It doesn't hit \nmuch closer to home than that.\n  Many of us recall Benjamin Franklin's wise counsel. He was a man \ninvolved in a revolution against King George III. Had that revolution \nfailed, he and his compatriots would have been hanged. When he was \nworking to form a government that would respect liberty and protect \npeople, he cautioned that those who would give up essential liberties \nfor temporary security deserve neither liberty or security.\n  More than 200 years later, we should listen to Benjamin Franklin. We \nhave to preserve our essential liberties or we do not preserve what \nmakes us Americans.\n  The seriously bad parts of this bill are made unacceptable because we \ncurrently have an administration that does not believe in checks and \nbalances and prefers to do so many things in secret. We now see the \nBush-Cheney administration seeking to twist the authorization for use \nof military force against al-Qaida into a justification for the secret, \nwarrantless wiretapping of Americans' e-mails and telephone calls. We \nsee them claiming that they need not fulfill their constitutional \nresponsibility to faithfully execute the laws but can pick and choose \namong the laws they decide to recognize. Even the Attorney General \nwrites to the Judiciary Committee saying their position on the law \nevolves. I did not realize there were such legislative Darwinists in \nthis administration that they believe so strongly in evolution when it \nsuits their purpose.\n  Legislative action should be the clear and unambiguous legal footing \nfor any Government powers. These matters should be governed by law, not \nby whim or some shifting conception of the President's inherent \nauthority that is exercised in secret. Confronted with this \nadministration's unique claims of inherent and unchecked powers, I do \nnot believe the restraints we have been able to include in this \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act are sufficient.\n  I will continue to work to provide the tools that we need to protect \nthe American people. I trust that Vermonters will understand that while \nI have repeatedly voted to extend and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, this \npermanent measure falls short of what they deserve.\n  I will continue to work to provide the oversight and checks needed on \nthe use of Government power. I know the Senate is going to adopt this \nmeasure now, but it is a pale shadow of what it could have been had the \nadministration not stepped in and told the leadership in the House and \nthe Senate that they had to get in line and do what the administration \nwanted, not what an independent Congress should do. It is not the best \nthat the greatest democracy on Earth deserves. I will keep fighting for \nus to do better.\n  I will continue to work to improve the PATRIOT Act, and I will work \nto provide better oversight over the use of national security letters \nand to remove the un-American restraints on meaningful judicial review. \nI will seek to monitor how sensitive personal information from medical \nfiles, gun stores, and libraries is obtained and used. I will join \nSenators Specter, Sununu, Craig, and others in introducing a bill to \nimprove the PATRIOT Act and reauthorization legislation in several \nimportant respects. Much is left to be done.\n  If Senators work together, much can be accomplished. We will be a \nmore secure Nation if we do, and also our liberties will be more \nsecure. Certainly, we owe that to the next generation, to protect the \nliberties so many other generations have fought to provide for us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be passing the \nPATRIOT Act. By passing it, we will make America safer, while \nsafeguarding our civil liberties and privacy. America will be safer \nbecause law enforcement will have the tools to track suspected \nterrorists and break up terrorist cells before harm is done to innocent \nAmericans. America will be safer because the conference report goes \nbeyond the original PATRIOT Act to combat terrorist financing and money \nlaundering, protect our mass-transportation systems and the railways, \nsecure our seaports, and fight methamphetamine drug abuse--what has \ngrown to become the No. 1 drug problem in America--and it does so by \nrestricting access to the ingredients that make that poisonous drug.\n  Today we are making a statement that we cannot return to a pre-9/11 \nstructure that could cost innocent Americans their lives. We will not \nreturn to the days of the pre-9/11 bureaucratic wall that blocked \ninformation sharing between law enforcement and intelligence. We cannot \ngo back. We must go forward.\n  Due to persistent delays and obstruction by some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, it has taken far too long to get to today's \nvote. By remaining focused on our goals, focused on governing with \nmeaningful solutions, to act on principles and to make America safer \nand security our No. 1 priority, we will prevail today.\n  I am proud to cast my vote to support the PATRIOT Act, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 3 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to vote on the \nadoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3199.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2320) to make available funds included in the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 for the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program for fiscal year 2006 and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is to be recognized. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. COBURN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the pending bill, S. 2320, offered by the \nSenator from Maine, increases direct spending in excess of the \nallocation to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the bill, pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable points \nof order. I move to waive the point of order under the applicable \nprovisions of the rules and statutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable. There is 30 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to do the \nright thing and to oppose this budget point of order brought up against \nthis legislation that will provide emergency funding for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program.\n  I thank the majority leader for his assistance in advancing this \nlegislation. It is the culmination of his considerable efforts over the \nlast few months to bring forward this legislation. I thank the minority \nleader as well for recognizing the importance and vitality of this \nissue, and promoting this amendment forward as well.\n  Mr. President, I know you are sitting in the chair, but you have been \none of the leaders on this issue, trying to get additional commitment \nfor funding for low-income fuel assistance, particularly for this \nwinter, along with my colleague, Senator Collins of Maine. This \nlegislation addresses a nationwide crisis by bipartisan consensus and \nfiscal responsibility. This legislation shifts the fiscal year for \nLIHEAP funding into the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which was \nalready signed into law, from 2007 to 2006. This will provide an \nadditional $1 billion for all those Americans who simply cannot wait \nany longer for relief from home heating fuel costs that have \nskyrocketed over last year's heating bill.\n  The vote we will be taking this afternoon is on the budget point of \norder against this bill. I would like to elaborate on why this \nlegislation is absolutely vital to increasing the funding for low-\nincome fuel assistance for all parts of the country that depend upon \nthis program.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation with respect to exactly what \nthis bill is all about. First of all, it is budget neutral. Don't take \nmy word for it; it is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. All of the funds under this bill have already been appropriated \nand accounted for within the budget. All this measure will do is shift \nthe funds from fiscal year 2007 to 2006. There is no additional, there \nis no new spending.\n  This approach is not only fiscally sound and budget neutral, but, \ncritically, it will allow States the flexibility to allocate funds to \nthe residents who are struggling to pay for energy bills this year. The \nWhite House and our Senate leadership recognize this is the fiscally \nresponsible solution to resolve this crisis.\n  I know some have said essentially we believe the LIHEAP program \nshould be funded through contingency measures such as this legislation. \nThat is what this legislation does, it utilizes the existing formula. \nIt is not only cold weather States but also warm weather States that \nwill benefit under this legislation.\n  I regret some of the misinformation that has been circulated with \nrespect to LIHEAP as to who will benefit, which States will benefit \nunder this legislation. I submit that in a year of high energy costs--\nand it has been a year of high energy costs, anywhere from 30 percent \nto 50 percent--it has devastated our State of Maine, Minnesota, and all \nparts of the country that have had to rely on home heating oil or \nnatural gas or whatever the alternative. But the fact remains, the \nprices have increased 30 percent to 50 percent over last year's, and \nlast year's prices went up 20 percent to 30 percent. That factor is not \nin dispute.\n  The additional factor is that we are using the same distribution \nformula. I believe that needs to be understood because I have seen some \nof the papers distributed as to which States will benefit. It is \ntotally inaccurate. Nothing has changed with respect to that formula.\n\n  On the issues that are important to know about this increase in \nLIHEAP funding, No. 1, it is budget neutral; No. 2, it will not \nincrease spending; and No. 3, the distribution formula remains the \nsame. I regret that we have seen so much misinformation and \nmischaracterization with respect to the funding formula under this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, we have heard: Well, it is a mild winter. I would like you \nto come to Maine, if you think it is a mild winter, and you ask all \nthose people about the 30 percent to 50 percent increases. The current \nlow-income fuel assistance program has not had an increase in real \ndollar terms since 1983. I happened to be in the House of \nRepresentatives when we created this program. It has not increased in \nreal terms. If anything, it has been reduced. I regret that we have \nreached this point in time with respect to this vital program that so \nmany low-income individuals depend upon who can barely make ends meet \ngiven the extent of the costs this winter with respect to home heating \noil.\n  We are now talking about a program that has not increased in net \nterms\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nsince 1983, when oil was $29 a barrel. Today it is more than $60 a \nbarrel. Eighty-four percent of the people qualified for LIHEAP funds--\nand 80 percent of my State--are dependent upon home heating oil. It is \na crushing financial burden.\n  Let there be no mistake about the fact that this program is vital. It \nis significant. It is essential to so many of the families in my State \nand across the country. The urgency of this legislation has escalated \nto an emergency. Last year, Americans struggled because of the high \ncost of energy. This year, they continue to struggle. We know the \npersonal terms in which people have been devastated by the increased \ncosts of energy.\n  I hope the Senate would waive the budget point of order because this \namendment, this legislation, is budget neutral, and it does depend upon \nthe existing distribution formula. Both cold weather States and warm \nweather States stand to benefit. There has also been a \nmischaracterization and misinterpretation about the distribution of \nthis funding under this legislation. In fact, it was the agreement that \nwe reached before Christmas. That was essentially the agreement we \nreached before Christmas. The very distribution formula we agreed to, \nthe one which has been the status quo, the one which we agreed to with \nthose who represent warm weather States, is exactly what this \nlegislation before us is all about. Nothing has changed. I deeply \nregret to see what has been distributed and circulated that would \nsuggest otherwise because it simply is not true.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Maine has made a very passionate plea \nand one with which I tend to agree. I am a supporter of this program \nand a supporter of making the formula even more fair for the Southern \nStates that have very high energy costs as well--different but high. \nBut would the Senator agree that another way to bring down prices of \noil and gas would be to increase the supply of oil and gas into our \ncountry? Would the Senator at least acknowledge that is another way to \nhelp people?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to reclaim my time because I \ndon't think we ought to debate the question here today. I don't think \nthere is any question about that.\n  But in the meantime, we have to address an emergency, and that \nemergency exists in my State and many other States across the country, \nincluding the Senator's State. I think it is a matter of fairness and \nit is a matter of equity and it is a matter of balance.\n  I think indisputable about why we need this legislation and why we \nneed this funding now. I hope Members of the Senate will recognize \nthat. This is fairly distributed for warm and cold weather States. I \nhope we can increase the supply. But right now we have to deal with the \nemergency that is presented in my State and many other States across \nthe country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I don't want to take any more \ntime. I am going to support bringing this bill up because I believe, as \nthe Senator outlined, it is an emergency and something we need to do.\n  But I want to say for the Record that there are other ways we can \nlower the price. Louisiana and the gulf coast is prepared to do that. I \nhope, as we move on with this debate, we can get to that issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first of all, I was in the meeting with \nSenator Snowe before Christmas. This is not the formula that we had \nagreed on in those meetings.\n  Second of all, the formula that she says will benefit the warmer \nStates is not accurate. It is not historically accurate. It is not \naccurate with regards to the contingency funding. Contingency funds \nwere released in January. There are 29 States that will be worse off \nunder the Snowe proposal, if this money is put through the regular \nformula, the warmer States benefit. The whole formula was set up so \nthat mostly colder States would benefit from the first dollars, and \nthen if dollars are added, the warmer States would benefit.\n  But the way this amendment is set up that is, in fact, not what \nhappens.\n  We have a budget point of order. People have to know that we are not \nvoting on cloture on the bill or cloture on a motion to proceed to the \nbill, but we are actually voting on a budget point of order.\n  This has been described as a mild winter. There is plenty of evidence \nfor that, especially on the east coast. I think the only two States \nthat could arguably say it has been a harsher winter than normal are \nOregon and Washington. And most of the rest of the country has had a \nfairly mild winter.\n  The point that somehow the Northeast needs this more because they \nhave more higher heating expenses isn't true. Electricity in most of \nthe country now is generated by natural gas. Because of the \nenvironmental concerns plants have switched over to natural gas. Air \nconditioning in the Southern States is just as critical as heat in \nNorthern States. When it gets hot enough, people die from heat.\n  The LIHEAP formula was set up to be able to help warmer States and \nhelp low-income people in those warmer States. Frankly, this proposal \ndoes not do that. It does not do that fairly. If this money were all \nput through the regular formula this would be a fair proposal.\n  That is why the Senator from Louisiana's State would lose around $18 \nmillion if this formula were done differently, as she would like to see \nit done, versus the way Senator Snowe has this drafted.\n  I didn't think this is the time for us to be waiving budget points of \norder. We are facing difficult fiscal times, and we need to show some \nfiscal restraint around here. Hopefully, we can sustain this budget \npoint of order.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, frankly, \nI think the Senator from Louisiana made a very good point coming up and \nsaying this makes sense. I had an amendment that would allow us to go \ninto BLM lands to extract natural gas and for LNG plants. That was \ntaken out in the highway bill up in Massachusetts.\n  It doesn't seem at all reasonable to me that you would support \nsomething such as this for electricity and at the same time turn around \nand oppose every effort we have to try to get more natural gas to bring \nto these homes.\n  I certainly agree. I had an amendment to do that. It doesn't look \nlike there will be an opportunity to entertain that amendment. Without \nthat, I think it is unreasonable to expect that we would be able to do \nthis.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, there is no question that one of the \nreasons this was even in the bill--in the Defense bill--was because \nANWR was in there to help pay for extra money for LIHEAP. One of the \nreasons they say this is paid for is because they are taking money out \nof 2007 and moving it into 2006. We know this is a phony argument. We \nhave seen it done around here time and time again. They are budget \ngames that are played so they can say things are budget neutral. How do \nyou spend $1 billion and call it budget neutral? You are not taking \nsomething else and cutting spending someplace else. You are only \nshifting to the next year.\n  This budget point of order is real, and this budget point of order I \nthink should be sustained.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 5 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield to my colleague, Senator Collins, 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend you and Senator Snowe for \nworking so hard on this very vital issue.\n  I want my colleagues to understand exactly what is at stake here.\n  Early Tuesday morning, my State suffered a terrible tragedy--three \npeople, including a woman and her 10-year-old son, died when their \nhouse caught fire and burned to the ground. There was the most deadly \nfire in Maine in 6 years. They lived in Limestone, ME, a town in \nnorthern Maine. On the night of the fire, temperatures were below zero. \nThe family had run out of heating\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\noil, and as a result, was using wood stoves to provide the heat. \nAccording to the firefighters, the fire started near one of the wood \nstoves in the kitchen.\n  This is literally a matter of life and death.\n  At Christmastime, when I was home in my hometown of Caribou, ME, two \nelderly women were hospitalized with hypothermia.\n  This is not theoretical. It is not theoretical when there is ice in \nthe toilet and when our elderly and low-income are at risk of illness, \ndisease, and, yes, even death because they cannot afford the high cost \nof home heating oil.\n  The least we can do in a country as wealthy as ours is to provide \nsome modest assistance. And those who say that the winter is almost \nover, come to where I am from in northern Maine. Believe me, there is a \nlot more winter to come.\n  Maine has run out of its LIHEAP funding. It is time for us to provide \nthis modest help.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I agree with both Senators from Maine. Our \ngoal is not to have additional LIHEAP funding. Our goal is to make sure \nwe don't steal it from our grandchildren, robbing from the unborn and \nthe young in this country to do something in the name of good. It is \nnot moral at all.\n  What we are saying is pay for it. To say it is paid for, to say you \nare paying for it, there is $1 billion allocated for next year, we are \ngoing to take that away and that is going to have to be paid for by \nsomebody. You know who is going to pay for it? Our grandchildren.\n  If we want to help the people of Maine, there are a couple of things \nwe can do. No. 1, you can use your TANF money for LIHEAP right now. \nThat is allowed under Federal law. There is no reason anybody in Maine \ndoesn't have the LIHEAP funds. You have money in your TANF account \nright now that you can transfer to solve that problem in terms of the \nacute problem.\n  The second thing you ought to know is that there is $11.2 billion in \nunobligated funds in Health and Human Services right now that the \nadministration could release for LIHEAP. We don't have to be doing \nthis. If it truly is an emergency, the administration has the money \nright now to send to Maine to do that. Your Governor has the ability to \ntake TANF money right now and support LIHEAP in Maine.\n  But it is unconscionable for us to steal from the next generation and \nsteal from the next budget cycle saying that we have paid for it. We \nhaven't paid for anything. What we are doing is sacrificing the \nstandard of living for future generations in this country through this \ntype of process.\n  If you want to bring the bill to the floor, which we have offered the \nSenator from Maine, come to the floor, offer to spend $1 billion and \ngive us the cuts to pay for it. Let us make the hard decisions that we \nwere charged with to make among priorities in this country.\n  The other point I would make is there was an offer by the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee last year to put an additional $1 billion in this \nfund. The Senator from New Hampshire offered to put another $1 billion \nby taking a small percentage across the board from Health and Human \nServices. This body voted that down. This body said we don't want to \ntake a little bit from everybody else to pay for additional LIHEAP. We \nwouldn't even vote for it.\n  Now, when we are going to steal it from our children--the people who \ncan't defend themselves, the future taxpayers of this country--then we \nare going to say it is OK, I believe it is morally wrong.\n  The people who need help today can get it. They can get it from the \nTANF funds in the State of Maine and the Northeast. They can get it \nfrom Health and Human Services, unallocated and unspent money that is \nsitting there right now.\n  We are not for not helping people, and it is not true to characterize \nit that way. We want to help anybody who truly needs our help.\n  The distribution under this formula, if you were to divide the money \nby everybody who could be eligible under LIHEAP, comes to $35 a house.\n  The other point I would make, since LIHEAP started, we have averaged \n$160 million a year in weatherization. That is $3.2 billion in \nweatherization. There are some people who would suggest that multiple \nhomes have been winterized multiple times. There has been no oversight \non weatherization. There has been no oversight on how the money has \nbeen spent. We have not done our job in terms of oversight to make sure \nthe money that goes for LIHEAP is spent in the proper way.\n  I believe it very noble that the Senators from Maine want to help \ntheir constituency. Let us help you help your constituency but let us \nnot steal it from the next generation.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have an \nadditional 10 minutes on each side so we can make sure that everyone \nwho wants to speak has a chance to speak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we have a \nlot of requests from folks who are trying to get out. I guess there are \nplanes leaving. How about 2 minutes for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I want to add my voice to this. This is \nnot about theoretical discussions. I understand we have debates about \noversight.\n  I held a hearing on this in Minnesota a couple of months ago.\n  By the way, winter is still there. And it is not just a matter of \nwinter still being there. In Minnesota, we have some programs that \nallow heat not to be turned off and people have to pay that back \nthrough the course of the summer.\n  I had a mom come forward who has three kids, who is working and going \nto school, who is talking about having to give up going to school so \nshe can pay the heating bill. I had a senior woman come forward who is \npaying 50 percent of her income for heat and medicine.\n  This is not a theoretical debate. This is about life and death. This \nis about suffering.\n  Clearly, we have an opportunity and an obligation. I hope we do it \nand simply do the right thing. This is a rich country. Those who need \nto be heard, those who are raising their voices and asking us to do the \nright thing in a way that is being paid for, we can debate that all we \nwant. But the bottom line is we have the opportunity to do what is \nright.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I want to reiterate a little about what \nSenator Coburn talked about, whether this bill is paid for; if people \nwant to truly pay for this legislation then we must cut other areas of \nspending. This is about priorities. If this is a priority--and a lot of \npeople think it is, the Senator from Minnesota and the Senators from \nMaine and others from around the country believe it is a priority--then \nother sacrifices must be made to meet this priority. We need to set \npriorities in this country.\n  There are those of us who believe that deficits are real. They are \nabsolutely real. People get up and talk about them all the time. But \nwhen it comes right down to whether you are willing to make tough \nchoices instead of just increasing the spending and passing that debt \non to the next generation, they aren't willing to offer other spending \ncuts so that we are not increasing the deficit.\n  That is the point that Senator Coburn and myself are trying to make. \nIt is time to start being fiscally responsible around here instead of \njust passing this debt on to the next generation.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are here because people are suffering \nthroughout the country, most particularly the coldest States.\n  Americans throughout this country--in the southland and in the \nnorthwest--understand that in Maine in the winter and in Washington \nState in the winter, people are freezing.\n  Senator Collins' very poignant and very telling story about what \nhappens when people are desperately cold should be remembered by all of \nus.\n  I think it is astounding that we talk about poor people, trying to \nhelp them with a little bit of money for their heat and suggest that we \ntake it from other poor people who use TANF money to feed their \nchildren so the other people can have heat. We talk of being \nresponsible and say: Now we have to cut the deficit. I didn't hear that \nmessage weeks ago when we were talking about huge tax cuts to benefit \nthe wealthiest Americans. That was not being responsible.\n\n  We have a chance to help people, a last chance to help people this \nyear who are literally freezing. It we do not take it, shame on us.\n  Mr. COBURN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 3 minutes, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma has 7 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the budget point of order is not a \ntechnical budget point of order. It was a technical point of order with \nregard to the asbestos bill. This bill would provide $1 billion more in \n2006 than the budget authorized. If we are going to spend $1 billion \nmore than the budget authorized, how can that not be in violation of \nthe budget?\n  There are two aspects: first, you say it is paid for in the future. \nThat is irrelevant to whether the Budget Act is violated, even if it \nwere paid for. Second, we have been around here long enough to know we \nare not going to cut LIHEAP next year by $1 billion. We know that.\n  As much as we would like to accommodate this spending--I can \nunderstand the desire of the Senators to do so--we should not do it \nbecause it violates the budget in a very fundamental way.\n  It clearly is an unfair allocation of funds compared to my State, \nwhich receives $17 million less if it were distributed according to the \ndiscretionary plan, as opposed to the fundamental formula.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me add to the words spoken by others. \nWith all due respect, we hear people talking about deficit financing, \nand I could not agree more. Twenty years ago I offered a pay-as-you-go \nbill that got 12 votes in the Senate. We ought to be doing that.\n  With all due respect, we have people in deep trouble, people not in a \nposition to have resources to take care of themselves. Those here who \nlive in the Northeast or the Midwest and the upper tier States \nunderstand this problem.\n  I cannot say how many times I have voted when matters affected the \nSouth or the West or when other parts of the country were devastated. I \ndo so proudly. I tell my constituents in Connecticut that they are \nAmericans, they are hurting, they need our help, and I give them my \nvote when they are in trouble.\n  I find it astounding when I listen to Members who say my constituents \ncannot get help in their time of need. That is what we are asking. It \nis cold where we live. We have a month and a half of winter left.\n  The Senators from Maine are asking for little consideration. The next \ntime some Senator from some part of the country says they have a \nproblem in the gulf States, we will not hear the Senators from Maine \nsaying: I am sorry, we cannot deficit finance that. We will take care \nof our people.\n  That is what we are asking you to do today: Help us take care of our \npeople. Support this, please.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding.\n  Mr. President, I have sort of a long history with this program. Years \nago on my watch we started this temporary program, this emergency \nprogram called LIHEAP, energy assistance. Well, here we are, 10 years \nlater, almost 10, it is still here, and it is growing.\n  I guess one thing that shocked me, and this is an admission against \nmy interests, when I realized it went from being ``heating'' assistance \nto being ``heating and air-conditioning'' assistance, I began to think: \nHow far will this go?\n  I was in the ninth grade before we had air-conditioning, and we \nsurvived. We did not suffocate. It was damn hot down there on the \nMississippi gulf coast. You could not open your windows because \nmosquitos would come in because we did not have screens on the windows.\n  So, now, millions is going into air-conditioning. And then we have \nheat. What is it we are not going to give people for free? Is there any \nlimit? Is there any limit to the amount of money? I thought we were \nhaving global warming. I thought it was a mild winter.\n  Yes, my bills have gone up. Mine have gone up astronomically in my \nState because of the disaster.\n  I thank the Senators from Maine, particularly Senator Snowe, for this \nnot being connected to the flood insurance proposal. Flood insurance is \na completely different issue, and because people paid for this \ncoverage, it has already been paid for, they paid the Government for \ntheir flood insurance, and now they are going to say: Gee, because the \nSenate once again does not do its job and is playing games with us, we \nare not going to get the checks for the coverage we already paid for? I \ndon't understand that.\n  Second, Senator Coburn and others who are opposed to this LIHEAP \nproposal have acted responsibly. They could have been obstructionist, \nthe way they have been on other bills around here, to insist on a vote \non a motion to proceed. The Senators from Maine are going to make their \ncase. Those who are opposed to it will make our case. We will have a \nvote. One side or the other will win, and then I recommend we go \nforward at that point.\n  I do think if we are going to have this program, we at least need a \nformula that is a national formula. I do not like the program. I would \nprefer not a nickel of it go to my State, but I would not be doing my \njob if I did not insist on a formula that is fair to all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Just to make a few final points because, again, there has \nbeen a lot of misunderstanding, mischaracterizations, \nmisinterpretations of the facts. The facts are, this program has not \ngrown. That is indisputable.\n  Look at this chart and see where we are. The level of funding for \nLIHEAP is equivalent to 1983 buying power, when oil per barrel costs \nwere at $29. Today it is more than $60. The buying power for any \nhousehold that depends on low-income fuel assistance has decreased from \n50 percent in 2001 down to 19.5 percent. Look at the cost of home \nheating oil. That is where we are today.\n  I go unchallenged when it comes to matching fiscal responsibility. \nThere are a number of issues I have offered in the Senate to accomplish \nthat. That has not occurred. I agree we have to do much more. But the \nfact is, this $1 billion was included in the Deficit Reduction Act that \nmost Members voted for in this Senate last year that included this \nfunding and included this formula. Those are the facts. The $1 billion \nand the formula were already included in the Deficit Reduction Act. \nThis is not increasing spending. It is budget neutral. It is the same \nfunding formula that everyone agreed to that would help both cold \nweather and warm weather States. That is indisputable.\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\n  I hope at least we could debate the true and accurate facts. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  This is a national issue. It is not a regional issue, it is a \nnational issue. It is a national crisis. I hope the Senate will vote to \nwaive the budget point of order so we can provide the $1 billion that \nwas allocated in 2007 and advance it to 2006.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, the Senator from Connecticut \nmakes a great point. This is not about regionalization. This is about \npaying for something.\n  The Senator from Maine is absolutely right. It was in the act we \npassed this last fall. But it was in there for next year. It was \nadvance funding so we would pay for the money for next year.\n  So if in fact we take this money now and move it out of next year, we \nare going to have to come up with another $1 billion. You can play the \ngames with the numbers all you want, but the fact is, we are going to \nhave to come up with another $1 billion.\n  The other thing I point out, we are not in great financial shape. We \nadded half a trillion dollars. I was one of the few Republicans who did \nnot vote with the rest of my side in terms of the tax cuts this last \ntime through. I have been straightforward in addressing the financial \nproblems our country had.\n  I ask Members to look at this chart put out by NOAA that says, in \nfact, for every area seeking today, they are either above normal or \nmuch above normal in terms of their temperatures this year. My poor \nState, Oklahoma, is red hot. It was 92 degrees yesterday in Oklahoma. \nWe set an all-time record. We had 20 or 30 days over 100 this past \nsummer.\n  I am not debating whether we should help people. I am debating can we \nhelp people without killing our children. The offer was made several \ntimes to the people offering this amendment: We will help you find \noffsets to pay for this so we do not take it from future generations. \nThat was rejected, straightforward.\n  The fact is, we have to be responsible. We are going to have to come \nto a point in time where we will have to make a hard choice. If we do \nnot, here is what will happen. The international financial community is \ngoing to do it for us. Interest rates are going to go sky high. The \nvalue of the dollar will fall through the floor. Talk about leaving a \nheritage to our children. We will leave a heritage of poverty to our \nchildren.\n  It is time for us to make the hard decision. Let's support this point \nof order because it is right. If we do not support this point of order, \nthe budget does not mean anything, nor do the budget rules mean \nanything, nor do the appropriations categories mean anything.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time, and I call for a vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 2899.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make available funds included in the Deficit Reduction Act \n    of 2005 for allotments to States for the Low-Income Home Energy \n                Assistance Program for fiscal year 2006)\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     1. FUNDS FOR LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 9001 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``for a 1-time only obligation and \n     expenditure--'' and all that follows through ``2007'' the \n     first place it appears and inserting ``$1,000,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2006'';\n       (B) by striking ``; and''; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (2);\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c);\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b) Limitation.--None of the funds made available under \n     this section may be used for the planning and administering \n     described in section 2605(b)(9) of the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8624(b)(9)).''; and\n       (4) in subsection (c) (as redesignated by paragraph (2)), \n     by striking ``September 30, 2007'' and inserting ``September \n     30, 2006''.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what the amendment \ndoes. I appreciate the fact that most of my colleagues are leaving, and \nwe will have to have the debate next week. Since the budget point of \norder was not sustained, we are going to proceed to the consideration \nof the addition of $1 billion to the LIHEAP funding for low-income \nenergy assistance. Of course, in the colder States, that generally \ntakes the form of assistance in the heating oil bills to heat their \nhomes. We have, however, in other States a crisis in the middle of the \nsummer when it is so hot that folks have a hard time paying the air \nconditioner bills. The issue is essentially the same.\n  It has been pointed out by one individual that more people actually \ndie as a result of heat than cold. In any event, we are pleased to see \n$2 billion already having been spent for the low-income energy \nassistance program in those colder States.\n  What we are talking about here is the addition of another $1 billion. \nWe are saying, as to this other $1 billion, it should be spent pursuant \nto the formula in the law. What our amendment does is to say take this \nadditional $1 billion, spend it pursuant to the formula under the law.\n  That formula is broken into two parts. The first is $250 million and \nthe second is $750 million. The formula for the first $250 million \ndisburses it a certain way, and for the last $750 million, it disburses \nit somewhat differently. That formula actually ends up getting money to \nall of the States but in a different mix than the first $2 billion, \nwhich is so-called contingency funding, which was almost all given to \nsupport folks in the Northeast part of the United States, in the colder \npart of the country.\n  The problem is that by the time we get to the summertime, almost all \nof the money is used, and anybody who\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nneeds it for air-conditioning assistance, of course, has nowhere to \nturn. Last summer, when we had the record-high temperatures in Arizona, \nwe found that there was no money. We finally located about $183 \nmillion, if memory serves me, and by the time we located that funding, \nit was virtually too late to do very much good.\n  That is the reason, at this point in the year, if we are going to \nspend an additional billion dollars, we need to spend it pursuant to a \nformula under which all States can receive funding, that it is \ndistributed fairly and spread out evenly so that the States that have \nair-conditioning problems will receive the benefit from it just as \nthose States that have problems with the cold.\n  Mr. President, I suspect there is little point to further debating \nthis amendment at this time. I hope that when Members return, we will \nbe able to vote on this amendment. If we are going to add the \nadditional billion dollars, at least let's do it in a way that is more \nfair. I think something like 38 States lose under the proposal of the \nSenator from Maine, and they would actually be made more whole if my \namendment is adopted. I hope at that time we will act favorably on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposal \nSenator Kyl has offered. I do believe it represents a step toward \nfairness. But I do reiterate that I believe the budget point of order \nshould not have been waived, and that we actually spent, under this \nproposal that has been cleared so far, another billion dollars this \nyear than we had within our budget. That is a bad thing. It is those \nkinds of steps that get us into real trouble in spending.\n  We have my colleagues who say they care about spending; oh, they care \nabout spending. But time and time again, when a vote comes up that \nactually has something to do with our deficit, they are AWOL. I thought \nit was amusing that not long ago, a Senator referred to a vote he cast \n15 years ago as if that is going to prove he is frugal. We have a vote \nright now. This was the vote. This was a clear vote. It had to do with \nwhether we had any intention to be disciplined in the way we handle \nmoney. They say: Well, we need this money. But the truth is we have had \nthe warmest January on record. This has been a very mild winter. For \nthat, we can be most thankful.\n  Is this an emergency? Well, what happens next year if it really is an \naverage or cold year and we don't have this billion dollars? It has \nalready been spent this year. And they say the heating oil prices don't \nfall, they go up. They say the heating oil prices will go up again next \nyear. Where are we going to come up with that billion dollars? We don't \neven have a proposal here to offset it.\n  With regard to the funding formula we have seen, if we can fund this \nbillion dollars in the way that has been proposed, my State, which \nsuffers from a lot of hot days--and in small houses and in mobile homes \nthat are not cooled, people do die. That is a tough time. If we are \ngoing to have this fund, it is only fair that the poor people in my \nState have a chance to participate in it, not just a select group.\n  So I just return to the fundamental principle. We are indeed moving a \npiece of legislation that spends $1 billion more this year than we \nauthorized in spending. The fact that it came from next year's money \ndoesn't answer the question. We are spending a billion dollars more \nthan we were authorized to spend under our budget. What good is a \nbudget if we don't adhere to it?\n  What we have is some tax-and-spend people here. They vote against tax \ncut extensions, they vote to raise taxes, and they vote to raise \nspending. That is what it is about. They say they are frugal. They say \nthey are responsible. Those of us who are trying to contain spending \nand maintain a low tax rate for the American people, they say somehow \nwe don't care about our people. That is not correct.\n  We are at a point in time when our Federal budget is allowing for an \nincrease in spending every year, and we will see again this year a very \nsizable increase. We will have before the Budget Committee an effort to \ncontain just a little bit the growth of entitlements. Do you know what \nI am hearing, Mr. President? I am hearing we don't have the votes in \nthe Budget Committee to even have a modest containment of spending on \nentitlement programs, which is where the growth is--about $870 billion \nfor discretionary spending and $1.2 trillion for entitlements. The \ndiscretionary budget this year will come in almost flat this year, with \nlittle increase. But entitlement spending is going up at about a rate \nof 7 percent or so. It is just driving our deficits. We cannot even \nbegin to discuss that, apparently, because people want to raise taxes \nand spend. They want to tax and spend. It is not the right way to go. \nThat is not what this country was founded on.\n  When you look at the Europeans who have done tax and spend--look at \nGermany, with 11.5 percent unemployment, and France has 9.5 percent \nunemployment. That is what the statist Socialist economies produce. How \ndid they get there? Because their congresses could not resist the \ndemand to fund every feel-good program that comes along the pike. That \nis why. Then when you meet with a businessman from Germany, he says: I \nknow we have to do something, Senator. Maybe we can cut back on this, \nbut people are so dependent on these government programs, so used to \nthem in Germany, that we cannot quite get the votes to stop it. We know \nif we don't do it, it can wreck our economy, but we cannot get the \nvotes because people become addicted to it, they like it. They feel \nlike anything they once received, if it is not received the next year, \nthe demagogues say it is a big cut and you have been denied something \nyou are entitled to.\n  So I just say that if I seem a bit frustrated, you can know that I \nam. We have had a lot of good discussion about how to contain the \ngrowth of entitlements--and I am not a bit sure that is going to bear \nfruit this year--just to maintain the current tax level and keep taxes \nfrom being increased next year. Now we come along on top of a generous \nLIHEAP program and add $1 billion more, in violation of the budget \nagreement. We just voted to waive the Budget Act and do it anyway with \n66 votes. I am telling you, this is not the way to get spending under \ncontrol in this country. It is the way to move our country to a statist \neconomy. That is not our strength.\n  Our unemployment is not 11.5. Our unemployment is not 9.5. Ours is \n4.7. In my State of Alabama, it is 3.5. We didn't get there by taxing \nand spending; we got there by reducing the burden of government on the \nprivate sector and allowing the private sector to flourish. Tax \nrevenues are up in every city in the State, I do believe. I traveled 26 \ncounties last week. Every mayor and county commissioner I talked to is \nseeing increases in sales tax revenues. Many are telling me they have a \n14-, 15-, to 18-percent increase in taxes. Why? Because the economy is \nbooming. Companies are hiring people. They are bidding up the wages. \nThey cannot find people, and they have to pay higher wages. People are \nmaking more money, and they pay taxes on that. So revenue to the \nFederal Government is up. Yes, we have a deficit, but revenue is up.\n  People don't pay taxes to Uncle Sam if they don't make money. They \nare paying more taxes because they are making more money. We have a \nfree market economy that allows growth and vitality. So I think this \nvote is an important vote for us as a people. It is a sad vote to me to \nsee many people who claim to be frugal, claim to care about spending, \nbut when the chips are down and we have a clearly dangerous bill like \nthis one, a bill that we ought to be able to vote down overwhelmingly, \nwe could not even get 40 votes to say no. We could not find 40 votes to \nsay no to this plan. I don't blame Senators for trying to do this. They \nsay that you in the South want help. Well, scrutinize the help we are \nasking for. If we are asking for something that is unfair, say so, vote \nagainst it. Don't come in here and vote for everything this one wants, \neverything that one wants, and everything that one wants, and then walk \nin here and say the deficit is too big and now we have to raise taxes. \nThat is where we are headed. I think everybody here knows that. There \nare a lot on the other side of the aisle, and apparently some on this \nside, for whom that is a strategy. That is a strategy. The strategy is \nto increase spending and then say you cannot have lower\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\ntaxes and we have to have higher taxes and we have to raise taxes. They \ndon't want to say it publicly and openly, but that is what they are \nworking toward.\n  That is a big divide in the Congress, as I see it. I hate that we \nhave a dispute over this spending, but apparently we have. It is \ndiscouraging to see the vote. But I think, as we continue to talk about \nit, perhaps the American people will talk to their Senators and \nCongressmen. When I travel around, they talk to me about spending. Of \ncourse, they want their projects. They say: Oh, don't cut that. But \noverall, they want constraint.\n  I believe the American people fundamentally will respect us if we \nmaintain some discipline. That means, on the discretionary account, \nstaying within our budget figure, which is basically flat spending. \nWhen we are in a crisis, we try to keep our spending level. We have a \ndeficit. We ought to stay level. We are not slashing anything. We have \nto stop going for more and more red ink, more and more new spending \nprograms that we have not had before to fund heating oil in the warmest \nwinter on record.\n  We are going to keep talking about it. There will be more votes in \nthis Congress and in this Senate. We did pretty well last year. We did \ndo some reduction--modest reduction in entitlements with the Medicaid \nProgram. We limited the growth of Medicaid, and we were proud of \nourselves. Over 5 years, it was going up 41 percent before we passed \nthe cost-saving bill, and now it is going up 40 percent. We thought we \nwere quite proud of ourselves to save a little money that way. If we \nwould do that on the other accounts, like Medicaid and Medicare and \nsome other accounts--just a little bit--we would have big numbers as we \ngo along and make a real difference in what we are doing. But it looks \nlike that may not happen.\n  So we are going to have to, I guess, reengage the American people, \nreengage the Members of Congress, and they are going to be asked by \nconstituents: How did you vote? How did you vote on LIHEAP? Did you \nvote to spend another $1 billion? Maybe we can begin to have the \nAmerican people talk some sense into those of us in Congress.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to the \nservice of the 155th Separate Armored Brigade of the State of \nMississippi. The 155th has a rich history of extraordinary military \nservice to our Nation. It has participated in the War of 1812, the \nAmerican Civil War, the Spanish-American War, both World Wars, Desert \nShield and Desert Storm, and operations in Bosnia.\n  Recently, the 155th completed a year-long tour in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. The 4,000-member brigade combat team was \nattached to the II Marine Expeditionary Force and deployed to the Al \nAnbar Province of Iraq. They conducted operations that included \nrebuilding infrastructure, hunting down insurgents, and supporting \nelections. Each of these activities made an indelible impact on the \npeople of this fledgling democracy and improved their chances of \nsurviving and prospering in a much safer and secure environment.\n  It is truly remarkable what our soldiers have accomplished. They \nserved in a combat environment where they thwarted continuing attacks \nfrom a determined insurgency. They endured the hardships of being away \nfrom their families. They suffered the loss and injury of their fellow \ncomrades. They had to endure the worry for their families' well-being \nas Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the gulf coast. Through it \nall, they remained dedicated and determined to carry out their mission.\n  As Mississippians have done for centuries, these soldiers left their \nfamilies and the comforts of home to answer the call of duty. This was \nnot done without cost. During its deployment, the 155th lost 24 \nsoldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice. These soldiers left behind \nwives, children, and loved ones. They answered the call of duty and \ngave their lives for America's freedom and security. This wasn't done \nfor fame or fortune. It was done out of a commitment to duty and \nservice to our great country. They are true heroes.\n  The 155th is the modern-day ``Mississippi Rifles'' that has carried \non the proud traditions of Mississippi and our Nation.\n  As we honor these brave men and women, it is appropriate for us to \nalso honor their families. No one understands the hardships of war and \nsacrifice more than a soldier's family. For 18 months, these \nMississippians sacrificed as their loved ones answered our Nation's \ncall. Although their lives were disrupted, they assumed the role of \nboth mother and father. Their resilience and courage during Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita continue to be admired by us all.\n  Of course, they did not accomplish all of this alone. Our Mississippi \ncommunities came together to provide support which ranged from \ncountless letters and packages, to daily support at home that included \nclearing storm debris and ensuring shelter for their loved ones, to \nsupport for the families of fallen comrades and those who were \nseriously wounded.\n  As we pay tribute to the accomplishments of the 155th and give thanks \nto their sacrifice and service, it is important we remember our country \nis still at war. The State of Mississippi has over 500 of its citizens \ndeployed in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan continuing to fight the \nglobal war on terrorism. In addition, we have citizen-soldiers in \nvarious stages of mobilization preparing to answer our Nation's call. \nOur country's military is the most committed and powerful in the world, \nand they are well prepared to serve in our hometowns and across the \nglobe. We will keep them in our prayers as they continue their great \nlegacy of sacrifice and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1638-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1638-S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BOULDER CITY 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 75th \nanniversary of Boulder City, NV.\n  Boulder City lies 24 miles east of Las Vegas, and 40 miles from \nSearchlight near Lake Mead. It's very close to my hometown, \nSearchlight, and it is a city dear to my heart. Boulder City is a \nNevada treasure, and I am proud to honor them today.\n  Boulder City was created by the Federal Government on March 11, 1931, \nto provide housing to the thousands of people who built the Hoover Dam. \nBecause Boulder City was operated as a Government reservation, the \nresidents could not buy homes and unlike its neighboring cities, liquor \nand gambling were prohibited. In fact, gambling is prohibited in \nBoulder City to this day.\n  As the first planned community built in the United States, Boulder \nCity has gone to great lengths to maintain its small town feel. Boulder \nCity only sees about 400 new residents each year due to a growth \ncontrol ordinance that was enacted in 1979.\n  Boulder City is most widely known as the home of the Hoover Dam. \nTwenty-one thousand men worked for 5 years and poured more than 5 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nbarrels of cement to complete the work on the $49 million dam. Forty-\nnine million dollars adjusted for inflation equals $676 million. Named \nafter President Herbert Hoover, the dam is located in the Black Canyon \nof the Colorado River. It sits on the border between Nevada and Arizona \nand sees 13,000 to 16,000 people cross it each day.\n  Mr. President, it is important that everyone understand that Boulder \nCity is more than just the home of the Hoover Dam, more than just a \ntourist attraction. It is a city whose people exemplify what being a \nNevadan is all about. I invite all my colleagues here in the Senate and \nall the people of this great country to experience a part of Nevada \nthat I love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1639-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     staff sergeant gregson gourley\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my solemn duty to rise before the \nSenate to pay tribute to one of the great sons of Utah, SSG Gregson \nGourley.\n  Sergeant Gourley, who grew up in Sandy and Midvale, UT was killed \nlast week with three other members of the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry \nRegiment, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) near Hawijah, Iraq.\n  As I sat down to learn more about Sergeant Gourley's life, I was \nstruck by his dedication to service. He first served as a missionary in \nPennsylvania for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, then \nspent 16 years as a member of our Armed Forces. His aspiration for the \nfuture was to begin a career in law enforcement.\n  According to what his comrades have said, Sergeant Gourley's service \nsurpassed the motto of his battalion: ``Above the Rest.'' Not \nsurprisingly, he had previously been decorated for meritorious service.\n  I believe that his grandmother, Adena Gourley, said it best, when \nreflecting on the sergeant's life:\n\n       He was a very gentle person. He has a great desire to be an \n     outstanding soldier and an outstanding man.\n\n  Mrs. Gourley, I can say that, by all accounts, he achieved those \ngoals.\n  Sergeant Gourley's passing is a further tragedy because he leaves \nbehind a wife, three sons under the age of 10, and a newborn daughter.\n  To his boys, and especially little Alexa, over the years you will \nlearn more about your father and that he was a remarkable man. But you \nshould always remember that your father was a hero, a man anyone would \nbe proud to call father, and our country will forever owe a debt of \ngreat gratitude to him for his unselfish service to our country.\n  I hope my colleagues will all join me in saluting the bravery of \nSergeant Gourley, and in sending our condolences, prayers, and best \nwishes to his family during their time of sorrow.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Rickey E. Jones\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo. \nSergeant Rickey Jones, 22 years old, was one of four soldiers who died \non February 22 when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb during a \npatrol near Hawijah, 150 miles north of Baghdad. With his entire life \nbefore him, Rickey risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2002 graduate of Kokomo High School, Rickey joined the Army because \nof concerns about a tight local job market at the time. After his first \ntour in Iraq, he returned with a new world view and volunteered for a \nsecond tour of duty. His mother told local media that the change in her \nson was unmistakable and that during his time in the Army, Rickey had \nmatured into a man and a true soldier. Rickey's brother, Michael, spoke \nof his admiration for Rickey's patriotism, saying, ``Rickey was proud \nof what he did and proud to serve his country. He died proud.'' Other \nfamily members fondly recalled that Rickey was a loving person and the \npride of his family, who simply wanted to help ensure a better quality \nof life for Iraqi children.\n  Rickey was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, \n101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, KY. Today, I join \nRickey's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to \nbear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example \nhe set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his \ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Rickey, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Rickey was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Rickey will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Rickey's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Rickey's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Rickey Jones in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Rickey's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Rickey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1639-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \none of the greatest foreign athletes to play in my home State of Utah--\nKresmir Cosic.\n  My dear friend from Yugoslavia fell victim to cancer in 1995, but \nthis Saturday, Brigham Young University will officially retire \nKresmir's No. 11 jersey during a ceremony at BYU's final home game this \nseason. It is a fitting tribute to a four-time Olympian and two-time \nall-American already enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n  Kresmir--or Kresh, as I called him--is a legend at BYU, but he will \nmost likely be remembered for opening the door for foreign athletes in \nAmerican colleges and the NBA. He truly had a global influence--Drazen \nPetrovic, Toni Kukoc, Dino Radja, and Vlade Divac are just a few \nplayers who owe their success in America to their former coach from \nYugoslavia.\n  When I visited Yugoslavia one time, Kresh heard that I would be in \nZagreb and drove up from Zadar so he could introduce me to one of his \nformer players, who was a leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints in the area. He arrived in a VW bug, and to see Kresh \nunwind out of that little car was a humorous experience.\n  I considered Kresh to be a tremendous friend. When he became the \ndeputy ambassador for his country, he went out of his way to see me, \nand I was more than pleased to be an advisor and help him. He \ntirelessly walked the halls on Capitol Hill, trying to dispel \nmisunderstandings about Croatia and Bosnia and the Serbian war waging \nin his native land.\n  The last time I saw Kresh was at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The \ndoctors thought he was in a coma, but when I spoke to him, tears came \nto his eyes, and a warm look of caring showed he understood my words of \nconsolation.\n  After his death, when once again I was in his native land, I was \npleased to see his wife, the person he loved so much.\n  Mr. President, I have only mentioned just a few highlights from the \nlife of this great man. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a touching article from the Deseret Morning News that summarizes \nwhy so many of us in Utah are looking forward to finally seeing his \njersey hang from the Marriott Center's rafters this weekend.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Deseret Morning News]\n\n         Late Cougar Cosic's Talent, Fun Couldn't Be Contained\n\n                            (By Dick Harmon)\n\n       Kresimir Cosic could barely fit into my '63 Volkswagen that \n     day. But who'd have guessed this world, as well, could hardly \n     contain him and, at the age of 46, gave him back to God.\n       I was just 17, puttering around in my Bug when I saw the 6-\n     foot-11 Cosic walking down the sidewalk of a street in Provo \n     on his way to basketball practice. I stopped and asked if he \n     wanted a ride. He said he did and he crammed himself into the \n     car. It was like putting a praying mantis in a thimble.\n       The first thing Cosic did was reach over and turn on the \n     radio. He broke out in a big smile, turned his face to mine \n     and said: ``I love the music.''\n       In a nutshell, that epitomized all you need to know about \n     Cosic, the Yugoslavian. He loved life. He loved basketball, \n     and he loved playing to the largest crowds in the college \n     game when they hatched out the Marriott Center back in 1972.\n       To Cosic, music played when he had a basketball in ``his \n     hands. He may have been one of the most entertaining players \n     who ever lived. Certainly he was the most gifted passing \n     center to play the game. As they say in Europe, Cosic was \n     Magic Johnson before Magic Johnson.\n       On Saturday, folks at BYU will officially retire Cosic's \n     No. 11 jersey during a ceremony at the final home game this \n     season, against New Mexico. There is a generation of BYU fans \n     who never saw Cosic play. They got robbed.\n       ``When we toured Europe a couple of summers ago, everywhere \n     we went, they knew BYU basketball because of Cosic,'' BYU \n     coach Dave Rose said.\n       Cosic's resume reads like he invented basketball. In \n     Europe, and in his native Yugoslavia, he just about did. A \n     four-time Olympian and two-time all-American, Cosic is \n     enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, \n     Mass.\n       Cosic died in May 1995 of lymphatic cancer. The week before \n     he passed, he was distraught when he talked to his former \n     coach, Glenn Potter, because he felt he'd defeated the \n     cancer, but in the process, he'd contracted hepatitis and was \n     going to get a liver transplant. ``The next thing I knew, he \n     died,'' Potter said.\n       Cosic's passion for the game overwhelmed his approach to \n     play. Cosic took more pleasure in passing the ball and \n     setting up teammates than shooting. Still he could be heard \n     yelling ``Opa, Opa'' (I'm open, I'm open). He thought himself \n     a point guard, but he was a devastating inside player, a \n     master of the hook, fade-away, running jumper, set shot and \n     long bomb. He was a showman, a Globetrotter-type star who \n     oozed charisma on the court in an era absent of freshman \n     varsity players, dunks and 3-point lines.\n       Imagine, if he played today.\n       ``This was before the 3-point shot, and you weren't allowed \n     to dunk the ball,'' remembered guard Belmont Anderson, now a \n     podiatrist in Las Vegas. ``He had a Larry Bird range with his \n     outside shot. When he'd take it, the coaches would yell, `no, \n     no, no . . . good shot, Kresh.' They frowned on taking the \n     long shot because you weren't rewarded for it. Imagine what \n     he'd have done if the 3-point shot was in back then or if he \n     was allowed to dunk.''\n       Cosic was famous for leading the fast break, making a \n     pinpoint pass or doing a jackknife lay-up, tucking in his \n     knees, going airborne, looking like a camel in flight. He \n     once took off against UCLA's Sidney Wicks, and the Bruin big \n     man looked perplexed--he'd never seen a 6-11 guy playing \n     point guard.\n       ``He loved to dribble the ball up court,'' Potter said. ``I \n     remember one day in scrimmage he took off with the ball \n     leading the break, and our point guard, Bernie Fryer, ran up \n     behind him and stole the ball. He was upset. They were on the \n     same team.''\n       Said Anderson: ``If you were cutting for the basket and he \n     had the ball, you had to be alert because Cosic could hit you \n     with a pass, and if you weren't ready, it would hit you in \n     the head,''\n       Cosic was a master of behind-the-back and between-the-leg \n     deliveries, Potter added. ``I remember one game in the Smith \n     Fieldhouse, Moni Sarkalahti cut for the basket and Cosic \n     passed the ball between his own legs, between the legs of the \n     center guarding him, and hit Moni in the hands for a lay-\n     in.''\n       Former BYU assistant coach Pete Witbeck called Cosic the \n     best center in the college game, better than Bill Walton.\n       Joe Watts, now executive director of the Utah Golf \n     Association, was a sportswriter covering Cosic's final home \n     game in Provo when he penned: ``The thought leaves me with an \n     empty feeling, a loneliness, a sadness, like I'll be losing a \n     friend. Something really good will be leaving my life. \n     Kresimir Cosic has brought me, and many others, some of our \n     most enjoyable moments in basketball. He is without any \n     question the greatest passing center I have ever seen in the \n     game. That alone has been thrilling.''\n       UTEP's Don Haskins, on whom Hollywood based the movie \n     ``Glory Road,'' called Cosic the best center in the Olympics. \n     It was a Cosic long bomb at UTEP that handed Haskins his \n     first defeat on the Miner home court since joining the WAC, a \n     five-year perfect league home record.\n       Cosic could have had a solid NBA career. He would have sold \n     tickets and helped TV ratings. Instead, he chose to return \n     home to Yugoslavia and help develop others and play for the \n     Yugoslavian Olympic team. He later became the Croatian \n     ambassador to the United States.\n       ``That tells you a lot about Cosic when compared to players \n     today who won't even play in the Olympics,'' Anderson said. \n     ``Cosic cared about the game, his country, more than money \n     and fame.''\n       Potter remembers Cosic's late return from playing in the \n     Olympics before his senior year. He missed several deadlines \n     to return to Provo. Potter called Cosic twice and asked when \n     he'd come back.\n       ``Coach, I'll be there,'' Cosic said twice.\n       Finally, when he showed up in Provo, Potter asked Cosic why \n     he'd been delayed so long, for nearly a month. Cosic told him \n     when he was touring Yugoslavia with a national club team, he \n     once told an audience in a gym he had a film for them to see \n     later. It was ``Man's Search for Happiness,'' an LDS Church \n     film explaining the plan of salvation. After that, Cosic \n     said, his phone was bugged and his passport was confiscated.\n       Potter recalls an exhausted Cosic leaning against the \n     basketball standard at practices\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\n     that year. Potter asked him what was up and Cosic told him he \n     was tired, he'd gone to bed about 3 or 4 in the morning the \n     past few weeks. Potter asked him why.\n       Unknown to Potter, Cosic stayed up translating the Book of \n     Mormon into Croatian. ``It's something he thought was \n     worthwhile and he had to do.''\n       Potter remembers Cosic coming in his BYU office and \n     debating tactics of the game, arguing strategy.\n       The bottom line was to give him the ball.\n       He was such a good passer you wanted him to have the ball \n     in his hands.\n       When Cosic returned to Zadar, Yugoslavia, to coach, he \n     invited Potter to visit him three times. One day Cosic called \n     Potter and asked him to come to Zadar and help him with a \n     coaching problem.\n       ``What is it?'' Potter asked.\n       ``Coach, I don't know what to tell the guards to do.''\n       Potter about keeled over laughing. ``All those times in my \n     office, arguing.''\n       Cosic ended up a European hero, opening the door for \n     foreign athletes in American colleges and the NBA. Aside from \n     filling the new Marriott Center night after night in the \n     early '70s, his influence was global. Those who learned at \n     his hand or were influenced by Cosic include Drazen Petrovic, \n     Toni Kukoc, Dino Radja and Vlade Divac--all players on \n     Yugoslavia's 1984 Olympic team coached and handpicked by \n     Cosic.\n       In his final years, working in Washington, D.C., as \n     ambassador, Cosic worked to dispel misunderstandings about \n     Croatia and Bosnia and the Serbian war waging in his native \n     country.\n       Cosic told then Deseret News Washington correspondent Lee \n     Davidson he'd like to get back into coaching basketball \n     someday but wasn't sure if it was in the cards, with the \n     cancer and all.\n       ``But it is what I would like to do, not necessarily what I \n     will do. You never know what will happen. My country may need \n     me to do something more. Or maybe God will have other \n     ideas.''\n       He was right. Within six months of that interview, he died.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1641-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    A TRIBUTE TO VERMONT'S OLYMPIANS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding accomplishments of the Vermonters participating in the \nrecent Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. These Olympians proudly follow \na long line of Vermonters competing at the highest levels of winter \nsports.\n  Three Vermonters made particularly extraordinary impressions in \nTurin: Hannah Teter, Bud Keene, and Lindsey Jacobellis.\n  Hannah Teter, of Belmont, VT, was the first Vermonter to medal in \nTurin when she earned the gold in the women's halfpipe competition. \nHannah is very much a product of Vermont, growing up amidst the beauty \nof the Green Mountains in a family that embraced the outdoors. More \nimportantly, Hannah was raised on homemade maple syrup, one of \nVermont's most treasured products.\n  In her halfpipe competition in Turin, despite already holding a \ncomfortable lead, Hannah won the gold medal with a bold and inspired \nfinal run. Though I will not pretend to perfectly understand terms like \nfront-side 900, I can tell you that Hannah's snowboarding acrobatics \nwere some of the most impressive athletic sights I have ever seen.\n  Coaching Hannah to her success was Bud Keene of Moscow, VT, the U.S. \nOlympic snowboard team's halfpipe coach. Bud was an avid snowboarder \nlong before the sport was included in the Olympics. Bud coached at \nMount Mansfield before becoming an assistant snowboarding coach during \nthe 2002 Olympics. Bud was named the head halfpipe coach for the 2006 \nOlympics and he led the team to a remarkable performance: the U.S. won \nan amazing two gold medals and two silver medals in the men's and \nwomen's halfpipe competitions. Bud deserves a lot of credit for the \nunparalleled success of the American snowboarding team at this year's \ngames.\n  Vermont's second Olympic medal also came in snowboarding when Lindsey \nJacobellis of Stratton, VT, earned the silver medal in the women's \nsnowboardcross. As many know, snowboardcross is a dangerous and \ndifficult event that requires snowboarders to navigate a narrow 1,000-\nyard course while avoiding the three other competitors trying to \nnavigate the terrain at the same time. Lindsey survived two of these \nincredible races just to qualify for the final medal heat, where she \nemerged with a silver medal in a race so challenging that two of her \ncompetitors crashed and one left the course on a stretcher.\n  In addition to Hannah, Lindsey, and Bud, I would like to commend the \nother Vermonters who traveled to Turin for the Olympics. These \naccomplished men and women include snowboarder Kelly Clark of Mount \nSnow, cross-country skier Andrew Johnson of Greensboro, freestyle skier \nHannah Kearney of Norwich, alpine skier Chip Knight of Stowe, cross-\ncountry skier Andrew Newell of Shaftsbury, honorary Vermonter Jimmy \nCochran of the famed Olympic ski family in Richmond, and countless \nother athletes who have trained, studied, or lived in Vermont and \ncompeted in Turin.\n  I would also like to acknowledge two Olympians who are currently \nserving our country in the Vermont National Guard: SP Jeremy Teela and \nSGT Tuffield ``Tuffy'' Latour. An Alaskan, Jeremy competed in the \nbiathlon in Turin, while Tuffy coached the U.S. Men's bobsled team.\n  We are very lucky in Vermont to have the privilege of watching and \nfollowing such an impressive group of athletes. There are many reasons \nwhy our small State has so many top-tier competitors but, to steal a \nline from Hannah Teter, I bet one of those reasons is Vermont's great \nmaple syrup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1641-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1641-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1641-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with an amendment:\n\n       S. 1777.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the coverage gap in prescription drug coverage under part D of \nsuch title based on savings to the Medicare program resulting from the \nnegotiation of prescription drug prices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague and cosponsor Senator Susan Collins as we introduce the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act of 2006.\n  For years now, I have advocated for providing seniors with meaningful \nprescription drug coverage. Seniors in this country should never have \nto choose between their meals and their medications.\n  Unfortunately, Congress created a Medicare prescription drug plan \nthat is confusing and contains a huge coverage gap. These are some of \nthe reasons that I did not support the legislation that created this \nprogram. But this flawed plan is what passed. Our job now is to help \nseniors by fixing the underlying law. I have spoken with Medicare \nbeneficiaries across Florida and they are understandably concerned \nabout the new prescription drug benefit. One issue of great concern to \nFloridians is the large gap in coverage called the ``doughnut hole.''\n  The Medicare drug benefit contains a large coverage gap during which \nbeneficiaries continue to pay premiums but get no drug coverage at all. \nFor most plans, Medicare will pay 75 percent of initial drug costs up \nto $2,250 after a $250 deductible. But then the program pays nothing \nuntil drug expenses reach $5,100. This lack of coverage for drug \nspending is often called Medicare's doughnut hole.\n  More than one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries are projected to \nhave drug spending that falls in the doughnut hole's range, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Millions of beneficiaries \nwill pay premiums yet receive no coverage during this time. This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  In response, we are introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug Gap \nReduction Act of 2006 which will reduce the impact of the doughnut hole \non Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Our bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \nnegotiate on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries for lower drug prices. \nUnfortunately, the law that created the new Medicare drug program \nactually prohibits the Secretary from using the purchasing power of \nover 40 million seniors to negotiate for lowers prescription drug \nprices. The savings generated from allowing negotiations would then be \napplied towards reducing the doughnut hole, providing more drug \ncoverage for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  A recent analysis was conducted by researchers at the Johns Hopkins \nCenter for Hospital Finance and Management on the Medicare doughnut \nhole. They concluded that ``the gap in coverage could be completely \neliminated if Medicare paid the same prices as the Veterans' \nAdministration, or Department of Defense and 75 percent of the gap \ncould be eliminated if Medicare paid the same prices as the Federal \nCeiling Price.'' Our bill gives the Secretary authority similar to \nentities like the Veterans' Administration and the Department of \nDefense, to negotiate contracts and obtain the lowest possible \nprescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Allowing the Federal Government to utilize market forces to negotiate \nfor lower prescription drug prices and using these savings to alleviate \nthe impact of the doughnut hole is a common-sense approach to providing \nMedicare beneficiaries with affordable prescription drugs.\n  This issue boils down to just one goal--helping seniors. We urge all \nof our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, to join us in this \neffort to help lower prescription drug costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 27 of title 18, United States Code, \nto prohibit the unauthorized construction, financing, or reckless \npermitting (on one's land) the construction or use of a tunnel or \nsubterranean passageway between the United States and another country; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, our borders are our Nation's first \nline of defense. They are the key to our homeland, and ensuring their \nintegrity is vital to our national security.\n  But there are some who seek to create a means of entering our country \nillegally. For years, they've tried to go around the border \ncheckpoints. Now they are trying to go under them through sophisticated \nborder tunnels.\n  In fact, there have been 40 border tunnels financed and constructed \nsince 9/11--to move humans, drugs, and weapons under the border. \nTwenty-one of these were on the California-Mexico border--eight since \nJanuary of this year.\n  This is a serious issue not just for San Diego and California, but \nfor the entire country.\n  Surprisingly, there is no law on the books now that makes it a crime \nto construct, finance, build, or use a tunnel into the United States.\n  Last week, I toured a recently discovered tunnel in San Diego with \nSan Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, Police Chief Bill Lansdowne, Sheriff \nBill Kolender and various Federal Government officials from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  This tunnel is the largest, most sophisticated underground passageway \never discovered; approximately half a mile long (8 football fields); at \nits deepest point, more than nine stories below ground; equipped with a \ndrainage system, cement flooring for traction, lighting, and a pulley \nsystem; disguised as a produce distribution company known as ``V & F \nDistributors, LLC''; and accessible only through a small office inside \nthis warehouse, covered by four square tiles.\n  The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement began investigating \nthe case two years ago, and raided the tunnel last month from the \nMexican side not knowing if or where an opening on the U.S. would be \nfound. They discovered over 2,000 pounds of marijuana on the Mexican \nside of the border and approximately 300 on the U.S. side.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today--joined by Senator Kyl \nas the Republican lead, as well as Senators Frist, Cantwell, Boxer, \nHutchison, McCain, Bingaman and Domenici--throws the book at those who \nbuild these tunnels and subterranean passageways into the United \nStates.\n  It would: criminalize the construction or financing of an \nunauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international \nborder into the United States with a term of imprisonment up to 20 \nyears; punish those who recklessly permit others to construct or use an \nunauthorized tunnel on their land with a term of imprisonment of up to \n10 years; punish those who use a tunnel to smuggle aliens, weapons, \ndrugs, terrorists, or illegal goods by doubling the sentence for the \nunderlying offense; in addition to imprisonment, ensure that assets \ninvolved in the offense, or any property traceable to the offense, may \nbe subject to forfeiture; and instruct the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nto promulgate or amend sentencing guidelines to provide for criminal \npenalties for persons convicted under this bill, and to take into \naccount the gravity of this crime when considering the base offense \nlevels.\n  The legislation is critical. We must secure every aspect of our \nborders.\n  Since 9/11: forty border tunnels have been discovered in the United \nStates; all but one have been on the southern border; twenty-one of the \ntunnels were along the California-Mexico border; eight of the tunnels \nwere discovered in San Diego since the beginning of the year; these \ntunnels range in complexity from simple ``gopher holes'' a few feet \nlong at the border to massive drug-cartel built mega-tunnels, costing \nhundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to construct.\n  The need for this legislation is urgent. We must secure every aspect \nof our borders, including those we can't always see. And it is in our \nnational security interest that we find these tunnels and prosecute \nthose who construct, finance or recklessly permit the use of these \ntunnels on their land or property to the fullest extent of the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit profiteering and fraud relating to \nmilitary action, relief, and reconstruction efforts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``War \nProfiteering Prevention Act of 2006.'' This bill creates criminal \npenalties for war profiteers and cheats who, for ill-gotten gain, would \nexploit the United States Government's taxpayer-funded war and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. I am \npleased that Senator Dorgan has also included this legislation in the \n``Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2006'' \nthat is also being introduced today.\n  I previously introduced this legislation in 2003. It came to be \ncosponsored by 21 Senators, including Senators Clinton, Dodd, \nFeinstein, Johnson, Kerry, Landrieu, Bill Nelson, Wyden, Dayton, \nDurbin, Feingold, Harkin, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kohl, Lieberman and Reid. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously accepted these \nprovisions during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup of the $87 \nbillion appropriations bill for Iraq and Afghanistan for Fiscal Year \n2004, and it passed the Senate. It was the right thing to do then, and \nit is the right thing to do now.\n  Regrettably, the Republican leadership in the House stripped this \nlegislation out of that appropriations bill, and we regrettably have \nbeen witnessing the results in the meantime. Billions appropriated for \nthe continuing war efforts and for reconstruction are unaccounted for, \nand fraud has been rampant. The recent report of the special inspector \ngeneral confirms that U.S. taxpayer funds appropriated for \nreconstruction have been lost and diverted.\n  There are, of course, anti-fraud laws to protect against waste of tax \ndollars at home. But none expressly prohibits war profiteering, and \nnone expressly confers jurisdiction for fraud overseas. This bill would \ncriminalize ``war profiteering''--overcharging taxpayers in order to \ndefraud and to profit excessively from a war, military action, or \nreconstruction efforts. It would prohibit any fraud against the United \nStates involving a contract for the provision of goods or services in \nconnection with a war, military action, or for relief or reconstruction \nactivities. This new crime would be a felony, subject to criminal \npenalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million or \ntwice the illegal gross profits of the crime.\n  The bill also prohibits false statements connected with the provision \nof goods or services in connection with a war or reconstruction effort. \nThis crime would also be a felony, subject to criminal penalties of up \nto 10 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million or twice the \nillegal gross profits of the crime. These are strong and focused \nsanctions that are narrowly tailored to punish and deter fraud or \nexcessive profiteering in contracts, here and abroad, related to the \nUnited States Government's war or reconstruction efforts.\n  Congress has sent more than a quarter of a trillion dollars to Iraq \nwith too little accountability and too few financial controls. \nDisturbingly, there are widespread reports of waste, fraud and war \nprofiteering in Iraq, and the special inspector general examining the \nuse of reconstruction funds in Iraq recently found that billions of \ntaxpayer dollars remain unaccounted for.\n\n  For example, a recent report on 60 Minutes revealed that more than \n$50 billion of U.S. taxpayer funds have gone to private contractors \nhired to guard bases, drive trucks, feed and shelter the troops and \nrebuild in Iraq. This is more than the entire annual budget of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  In addition, just this week, the New York Times, reported that the \nArmy has decided to reimburse a Halliburton subsidiary--Kellogg Brown & \nRoot--for nearly all of its disputed costs on a $2.41 billion no-bid \ncontract to deliver fuel and repair oil equipment in Iraq, even though \nthe Pentagon's own auditors had identified more than $250 million in \ncharges as potentially excessive or unjustified. That article further \nnotes that the Army's decision to pay all but 3.8 percent of these \nquestionable charges lies well outside the normal practice of the \nmilitary.\n  The recent revelations about contract fraud and abuse in Iraq make \nclear that the approach to reconstruction in Iraq has been a formula \nfor mischief. We need strong disincentives for those who would take \nadvantage of the chaos of war to defraud American taxpayers.\n  We also need to strengthen the tools available to federal prosecutors \nto combat war profiteering. Despite well-publicized allegations of \nfraud and war profiteering in Iraq, so far the Government has brought \nonly one case to recover these funds--a civil lawsuit brought under the \nFalse Claims Act. That case involves a contractor accused of \novercharging the Government millions of dollars under a contract to \nhelp distribute new Iraqi currency during the first months after the \ncollapse of the Hussein government. The Government's ability to recover \nfunds in that case is being questioned by the defendant, however, who \nargues that legal technicalities may constrain current law from \nreaching all of the conduct of contractors working in Iraq or elsewhere \noverseas. This bill would address this problem by providing clear \nauthority for the Government to seek criminal penalties and to recover \nexcessive profits for war profiteering overseas. It should already be \nlaw, but three years ago the House Republican leadership rejected it.\n  Every penny of our taxpayers' money must be expended carefully and \npurposefully and protected from waste. The message sent by this bill is \nthat any act taken to financially exploit the crisis situation in Iraq \nor elsewhere overseas for exorbitant financial gain is unacceptable, \nreprehensible--and criminal. Such deceit demeans and exploits the \nsacrifices that our military personnel and National Guard are making in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  When U.S. taxpayers have been called upon to bear the burden of \nreconstruction contracts--where contracts are awarded in a system that \noffers little competition and even less accountability--concerns about \nwartime profiteering are a grave matter. Historical efforts to stem \nsuch profiteering have been successful: Congress implemented excessive-\nprofits taxes and contract renegotiation laws after both World Wars, \nand again after the Korean War. Advocating exactly such an approach, \nPresident Roosevelt once declared it our duty to ensure that ``ar few \ndo not gain from the sacrifices of the many.'' Then, as now, our \nGovernment cannot in good faith ask its people to sacrifice for \nreconstruction efforts that allow so many others to profit unfairly.\n  There is urgency to this important measure because criminal statutes \ncannot be applied retroactively. These controls should have been put in \nplace at least three years ago; they need to be in place now. I urge \nthat the Senate make prompt passage of this legislation a high \npriority. I hope that this time the House Republican leadership will \nhave learned the hard lessons of the last three years and that, this \ntime, they will allow this bill's enactment, on behalf of the Nation's \ntaxpayers. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2356\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for economic security and prosperity; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, these have not been easy times for vast \nnumbers of Americans. In many ways, the American dream is in peril for \nmillions of our fellow citizens as global forces have caused the \neconomy to shift against them.\n  Complacency is not the answer. Few things more affect the way we live \nthan our shrinking and rapidly changing world. Unless we begin to \naddress this immense challenge more effectively, the Nation will pay a \nhigh price for years and years to come. Now is the right time to \nreinvest in America's future, which is why I am today introducing the \nRight TRACK Act.\n  American families across the Nation know the problem. It is measured \nin jobs moving overseas, stagnant or even falling wages and benefits, \nour schools losing ground compared to other nations, and fewer \nopportunities to attain the American dream. Indeed, the course we are \non today is a course that will make the American dream the impossible \ndream.\n  America cannot move forward if we cut back on investments in \neducation, invention, and innovation, as the administration has \nproposed. We cannot compete in the world if our companies and our \nworkers are saddled with soaring costs for health care. We cannot \nadvance if we fail to invest in our own employees by paying them a \ndecent wage, by taking steps to enable companies to keep jobs here at \nhome, and by investing wisely in our own economic growth.\n  The 20th century was widely hailed as the American century, but the \n21st century is up for grabs. No nation is guaranteed a future of \nlasting prosperity. We have to work for it. We have to sacrifice for \nit.\n  We have a choice. We can continue to be buffeted by the harsh winds \nof the global economy or we can think anew and guide the currents of \nglobalization with a new progressive vision that strengthens America \nand equips our citizens to move confidently to the future.\n  Competing better in a race to the bottom is not the answer. Equality \nof opportunity--a bedrock principle of our democracy--is suffering \nalready. Today, children born of parents in the bottom 20 percent of \nincome have only a 1 in 15 chance of reaching the top 20 percent in \ntheir lifetimes. Also disturbing is the fact that those born in the \nmiddle are more likely to sink to the bottom than to rise to the top. \nAnd those born at the top are likely to stay at the top.\n  We cannot and should not compete by lowering wages. Instead, we must \nopen new doors and new avenues for all Americans to make the most of \ntheir God-given talents and rekindle the fires of innovation in our \nsociety. By doing so, we can turn this era of globalization into a new \nera of opportunity for America.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said, ``Every generation needs a new \nrevolution.'' And I believe the revolution for this generation is to \nmaster our own destiny in the new global economy.\n  What is most required is a new vision for America's future in the \nglobal community. Our goal is to rekindle the American Dream, so that \nif people work hard and play by the rules, they can succeed in life, be \nbetter off than their parents, live in good neighborhoods, raise strong \nfamilies in safe surroundings, work in decent jobs with decent pay and \ndecent benefits and a decent retirement.\n  To do all that, we must make a commitment to lifelong education, to \nprepare every man, woman, and child for the new world of intensifying \ncompetition and increasingly sophisticated technologies.\n  We must create high-quality jobs for the years ahead by investing in \nresearch and development, encouraging innovation, and modernizing all \naspects of our infrastructure.\n  We must level the playing field for American businesses and \nemployees, to ensure fair worldwide competition and preserve good jobs \nin the United States.\n  And we must make a fair commitment to assist and care for workers and \ncommunities harmed by the forces of globalization.\n  We can do all that, but only if we make the right choices, and the \ntime to start is now.\n  I strongly believe that our highest priority must be a world class \neducation for every American. We must seek a future where America \ncompetes with other nations, not by reducing our employees' pay and \noutsourcing their jobs but by raising their skills.\n  As a Nation, we must invest in Americans by ensuring access to the \nhighest quality educational opportunities. We must make the American \nworker and manager the best educated, best trained, and most capable in \nthe world. We need to nourish the capacities of every person in the \nnation.\n  To do that, we must begin in the earliest years. Research proves \nconclusively that what we do for children's early education and \ndevelopment does more to ensure their later success in school than any \nother investment we can make. It is far less costly to society to spend \nmillions to put young children on the right track from the start, \ninstead of spending billions to rescue them from the wrong track later. \nIn fact, one study concludes that in the long run, we save $13 for \nevery dollar invested in the early education of our youngest citizens. \nPrevention works in health care, and it can work in education too.\n  For generations, we have treated education as a three-legged stool--\nelementary and middle school, high school, and college. To create a \nsolid foundation for the future, we have to add a fourth leg--early \nchildhood education.\n  In elementary and secondary education, the No Child Left Behind Act \nwas a pioneering reform that held great promise when it was signed into \nlaw by President Bush 4 years ago.\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\n  No Child Left Behind was not just an abstract goal. It was a moral \ncommitment to every parent and every child and every school in America, \nand I was proud to stand with President Bush when he signed it. It soon \nbecame clear, however, that to the administration, it was more a slogan \nthan a promise. Too many parents, too many children, too many schools \nare still waiting for the help we pledged.\n  We can't reform education without the resources needed to pay for the \nreforms. Promises alone won't provide the qualified teachers, high \nstandards in every classroom, good afterschool activities, and the \nrange of supplemental services that every good school needs if it is to \nprovide the right help for students who need it.\n  No Child Left Behind was also a promise that every child counts--\nBlack or White or Brown, rich or poor. It was a promise that disabled \nchildren too will have the qualified teachers and individual support \nthey need to succeed in school and in life.\n  We must also do more to help students prepare for college, afford \ncollege, be admitted to college and complete college. In 1950, when I \ngraduated from school, only 15 percent of jobs required some \npostsecondary training. Today, the number is over 60 percent and rising \nrapidly.\n  However, we are witnessing a growing gulf in college attendance \nbetween the rich and poor. The gap is shameful. Each year, 400,000 \ncollege-ready students don't attend a 4-year college because they can't \nafford it. Never before has the financial challenge of attending \ncollege been greater for young students.\n  It is time for America to agree that cost must never be a barrier to \ncollege education. Every child in America should be offered a contract, \nwhen they reach eighth grade, making clear that if they work hard, \nfinish high school, and are accepted for college, we will guarantee \nthem the cost of earning a degree. The Right TRACK Act authorizes \nFederal grants to States to support the creation of ``Contract for \nEducational Opportunity'' grants to cover students' unmet need up to \nthe cost of attendance at 2-year and 4-year public colleges in that \nState.\n  Perhaps nowhere is it more obvious that we are falling behind than in \nmath and science. For a nation that prides itself on innovation and \ndiscovery, the downward slide is shocking. In recent years, we have \ndropped to 28th in the industrial world in math education. Each year, \nChina graduates three times as many engineers as we do. Other nations \nare gaining on us because they give higher priority to education.\n  The last time America was shocked into realizing we were unacceptably \nbehind in math and science was in 1958, when the Soviet Union launched \nSputnik. Republican President Eisenhower and a Democratic Congress \nresponded by passing the National Defense Education Act, and almost \novernight we doubled the Federal investment in education.\n  In fact, throughout our history, we have remade American education to \nconquer the challenges of each time. In the mid-1800s, with the \nIndustrial Revolution in full swing, we created free and mandatory \npublic schools before most other nations did. And to stay ahead, we \nrapidly established public high schools at the start of the last \ncentury to keep pace with a growing economy.\n  Once again, we did something comparable at the end of World War II. \nWe passed the GI Bill of Rights and gave every returning veteran the \nchance for a college education. The Nation reaped a $7 return for every \ndollar it invested in their education. The result was the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' and it would never have happened without the GI bill.\n  That is the kind of initiative we need today, because the need is \njust as great. We need a new Education Bill of Rights, a new National \nDefense Education Act, for our own day and generation in science and \nmath.\n  Let's make college free for students training to become math or \nscience teachers.\n  Let's make college and graduate school free for low- and middle-\nincome math and science students.\n  Let's see that our standards are internationally competitive, so that \nour high school graduates can succeed in this new economy. Let's offer \nincentives and other support for schools to develop and implement \nrigorous standards and courses in math and science.\n  The Right TRACK Act responds to each of these challenges. The \nlegislation provides grants to low- and middle-income students studying \nin science, technology, engineering, and math fields, as well as \ncritical-need foreign languages. The bill provides larger grants to \nstudents studying to become teachers in these fields who agree to work \nin a high poverty school for at least 4 years. It also provides \nteachers with tax credits, increased loan forgiveness as additional \nincentives to continue to teach where they are needed the most and \ninvests in teacher training programs supporting their continuing \neducation.\n\n  The Right TRACK Act also provides resources to states to create P-16 \nPreparedness Councils to help States with their efforts to improve \nState standards and ensure that they are aligned with the expectations \nof colleges, employers, and the armed services. The bill also provides \nfunding to States working in collaboration to establish common \nstandards and assessments.\n  The bill also directs resources to high need schools so they can \ninvest in math, science, engineering, and technology textbooks and \nlaboratories to ensure their students have equal access to a curriculum \nthat will provide them with the skills they need to be successful in \nthe 21st century global economy.\n  It is becoming increasingly important for students to become exposed \nto and immersed in other languages and cultures. In recent years, \nforeign language needs have significantly increased throughout the \npublic and private sector due to the presence of a wider range of \nsecurity threats, the emergence of new nation states, and the \nglobalization of the U.S. economy. American businesses increasingly \nneed employees experienced in foreign languages and international \ncultures to manage a culturally diverse workforce. Foreign language \nproficiency is a consideration in 44 percent of hiring decisions and 66 \npercent of retention decisions. Currently, the U.S. Government requires \n34,000 employees with foreign language skills in 100 languages across \nmore than 80 Federal agencies.\n  The Right TRACK Act responds to these needs by providing grants for \nelementary and secondary critical-need language programs, summer \ninstitutes to improve teachers' knowledge and instruction of foreign \nlanguages and international content, and study abroad and foreign \nlanguage study opportunities for high school students, undergraduate, \nand graduate students.\n  We must also continue to invest in our current workforce. The Right \nTRACK Act builds on existing formula funds for job training with \ncompetitive grants to support innovative strategies to meet emerging \nlabor market needs.\n  From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the engine of \nthe American dream. Our country is home to the greatest universities in \nthe world, and our education system has produced the world's leading \nscientists, writers, musicians, and inventors. We cannot let these \nachievements stall now. Slogans aren't strong enough. We have to put \nfirst things first and give children, parents, schools, communities and \nStates the support they need to refuel the amazing engine of education \nand keep our country great in the years ahead.\n  Beyond education, we must recognize that the foundation of our \nprosperity in this global world is to remain on the cutting edge of \ntechnology and medical and scientific breakthroughs in the years ahead \nand translate those advances into reliable products and services. A \nstrong and fully developed infrastructure will provide the backbone for \nthat success.\n  America has always been a world leader in research and development, \nbut we can no longer take our success for granted. Even in highly \nskilled industries, where our technology and infrastructure have \npreserved our competitive advantage we are increasingly at risk today. \nRapidly growing economies in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America \nare now formidable competitors, developing their economies into engines \nof growth based not just on low wages but on well-educated citizens, \nadvanced infrastructure, and well-run businesses.\n  In Bangalore, India, a G.E. center employs more than 2,200 Ph.D.s. \nThese workers are not sewing buttons on\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nshirts; they are carrying out advanced research on jet engines and \ndeveloping mathematical models for investment. An Intel research and \ndevelopment center in the same city employs 3,000 engineers designing \nthe next generation of computer chips.\n  However, despite increasing international competition, the Federal \ncommitment to research outside the defense arena has declined under the \nBush administration. Of particular concern is the drop in funding for \nbasic research. Much of the research conducted by private companies is \nfocused on getting a product quickly to market. That is not the basic \nresearch that lays new foundations for new discoveries. Funding for \nbasic research has declined in the past few years at the National \nInstitutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department \nof Energy, and other key scientific agencies. And overall the Federal \ninvestment in research which once exceeded one percent of our GDP is \nnow less than half a percent.\n  We cannot allow this trend to continue. The Right TRACK Act will help \nAmerica maintain its position as the leader in innovation. The Right \nTRACK Act will not only make the R credit permanent but expand it to \nencourage small businesses, universities, and Federal laboratories to \ncollaborate on research. And it will increase R funding for major \nFederal research agencies by 10 percent that we double it in 7 years.\n  Innovation is important for its own sake, but it is also what creates \njobs. We are currently seeing our investment in R paying dividends in \nhigh growth, high technology industries such as nanotechnology. We need \nto help usher these new technologies out of the laboratory and into the \nmarketplace. The Right TRACK Act would encourage investment in \nnanotechnology businesses and increase support for critical programs at \nthe Department of Commerce that help manufacturers adopt and \ncommercialize new technologies.\n  We also must invest in innovation and infrastructure--highways, mass \ntransit, new sources of clean energy, health I.T., and more. The Right \nTRACK Act will authorize funds for capital improvements to Amtrak and \nexpands and increases tax credits for school renovation and \nconstruction that will equip schools with 21st century technology.\n  These investments not only improve the quality of our lives, but they \nalso create the quality jobs that drive our economy forward.\n  Broadband infrastructure is a perfect example. Two years ago, \nPresident Bush declared that every American should have access to \naffordable broadband technology by the year 2007. But the \nadministration still has no plan to get us there. In the meantime, we \nhave fallen to 16th in the world in broadband access behind countries \nsuch as Japan and the Netherlands that have broadband speeds four and \nfive times faster than ours.\n  Widespread use of basic broadband would add $500 billion to our \neconomy and create 1.2 million jobs. Clearly, this is the kind of \ninfrastructure we should invest in to produce good jobs and economic \ngrowth in the future. The Right TRACK Act also puts us on the ``right \ntrack'' to take full advantage of that economic opportunity.\n  We also live in an age exploding with medical miracles. A generation \nago, few could possibly have imagined the advances in science and \nbiology that have revolutionized the practice of medicine. No one today \ncan predict how new discoveries in the life sciences will improve our \nlives and change the world, but we can be certain the effects will be \nprofound.\n  Thanks to the genius and dedication of scientists, doctors, and \nbusiness leaders, the potential of medical research is virtually \nlimitless. Diagnosing a faulty heart valve or blocked artery once meant \nrisky and traumatic exploratory surgery. Today, doctors make the \ndiagnosis with a miniature camera and fiber optic cable, and the \npatient can walk out of the office moments later.\n  A few years ago, it seemed inconceivable that anyone could decipher \nthe entire genetic code--the very blueprint of life. But today, doctors \nacross the globe can read that sequence on their computer screens and \nuse the information to search for new ways to treat cancer, diabetes, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and other major illnesses.\n  Continuing at the forefront of the life sciences may well be the most \nimportant way for America to retain its leadership in the world economy \nin the coming years.\n  Another of the fundamental challenges of the global economy is that \nour companies are losing business and our people are losing jobs \nbecause they are not competing on a level playing field.\n  Foreign governments manipulate their currencies to give their \nproducts an unfair advantage. They refuse to enforce basic labor \nprotections like a minimum wage. They use abhorrent practices like \nchild labor and forced labor. As a result, these countries can produce \ngoods much more cheaply and dominate the global marketplace.\n  Our own trade deficit is skyrocketing because we are producing less \nat home and buying more from other nations. Last year, we imported a \nrecord $726 billion more than we exported--an alltime high.\n  We can't continue down this reckless path. It is too damaging to our \neconomy. Over $2.2 trillion of our national debt today is owed to \nforeign investors and foreign governments. America has always \ncontrolled its own destiny but when foreigners are bankrolling our \nGovernment, our destiny is no longer in our hands.\n  It is not just our companies that suffer--our workers are also \nstruggling because the playing field is so uneven. More and more of our \ncompanies are shipping U.S. jobs overseas. Fifty-four percent of \nAmerica's top companies have already done so. Even governments are part \nof the offshoring bandwagon. In my home State of Massachusetts, the \nState government has hired contractors that used workers from India to \nprocess Medicaid data and answer questions about food stamps.\n  The Nation as a whole has lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs \nsince 2001. The pain is widespread--48 States have lost manufacturing \njobs under President Bush. These are not just blue-collar jobs. \nMillions of high-paying, white-collar jobs are also at risk of being \nshipped overseas, especially in the fields of medicine and computers.\n  The disappearance of these good jobs is reducing our standard of \nliving and threatening the very existence of the American middle class. \nPresident Bush's so-called economic recovery has the worst job creation \nrecord of any recovery since World War II.\n  Those fortunate enough to have jobs are finding that their wages are \nstagnant even though other costs are soaring. College tuition is up 46 \npercent since 2001. Housing costs are up 49 percent. Health insurance \nis up 58 percent. Gasoline is $2.33 a gallon--40 percent higher than it \nwas 5 years ago.\n  The foundation of the America dream is weakening. That is because \nmore of what our economy produces in this recovery now goes to business \nprofits and executive suite salaries, and less to employees, than at \nany time since such records began in 1929. Wages are down, but profits \nare up by more than 60 percent.\n  There is a better way. We need policies that reject the Walmart-\nization of the American workforce.\n  We must level the playing field in the competition for good jobs and \ndemonstrate leadership in promoting fair wages for workers around \nthe world. This is not just an economic issue--it is a moral issue. The \nRight TRACK Act will help raise living standards worldwide by \nprioritizing the elimination of forced labor and child labor in U.S. \ntrade agreements and providing incentives for multinational \ncorporations to treat their foreign workers with respect. It will also \nlevel the playing field for American businesses by ensuring that \ncountries cannot manipulate their currencies to give their goods an \nunfair advantage in the global market.\n\n  Rejecting the race to the bottom also means reaffirming our \ncommitment to workers here at home. We must stop rewarding companies by \ngiving them favorable tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. The Right \nTRACK Act corrects this nonsensical policy by eliminating the tax \nloophole that allows companies to avoid paying taxes on money they have \nearned overseas. The act also addresses the offshoring epidemic by \nrequiring companies to give workers better notice when their jobs could \nbe offshored to other countries\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nand ensuring that the Government does not use hard-earned tax dollars \nto ship jobs overseas.\n  Our commitment to workers at home also demands that we give them \ntheir fair share of the economic growth that globalization brings. In \nthis century, just as in the last, we must ensure that workers can \norganize and have a voice at work. The Right TRACK Act preserves the \nbasic rights of American workers by protecting employees who try to \norganize from employer intimidation, supporting the democratic right of \na majority of workers to choose a representative through fair and \nneutral card-check procedures, and requiring employers to come to the \ntable and negotiate a first contract.\n  We owe a particular duty to those Americans who lose their jobs due \nto the effects of trade or economic downturns. When workers lose their \njobs in the global economy, we should help in the difficult and painful \ntransition to new employment with top-notch job training and income \nassistance for their families until they get another paycheck. The \nRight TRACK Act gives workers and communities harmed by trade the \nsupport they deserve. It expands the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram to include service workers and workers who lose their jobs due \nto increased trade with countries like China and India. It also \nimproves funding levels for training programs, provides wage insurance \nfor older workers who lose their jobs, and helps workers to retain \ntheir health care coverage during times of transition.\n  And it is a scandal that the minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an \nhour for the past 9 years, below the poverty line for a family of \nthree. It is the lowest the minimum wage has been in real value in more \nthan 50 years. How can so many Republicans in Congress keep voting \nagainst any increase? Why can't we all at least agree that no one who \nworks for a living in America should have to live in poverty? The Right \nTRACK Act gives these hardworking Americans a long overdue raise by \nincreasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in three steps.\n  America has to rise to each and every dimension of this challenge. We \ncan do it by creating a new culture of innovation and creativity that \nkeeps our Nation in the lead in the global market place--by equipping \nevery American to compete and win in the new global economy. Only then \nwill our economy continue to grow and prosper. Only then will the good \njobs of the future be made in the U.S.A.\n  The same can-do spirit of innovation, invention, and progress that \nbrought us the automobile, the airplane, and the computer can do it \nagain. Those advances brought the American dream closer for all, and we \ncan't afford to let it slip away now.\n  The essence of the American dream is the ability to provide a better \nlife for yourself and your family. At its very heart are a good job, \nfirst-class education, good health care, and a secure retirement. Some \nsay the dream is out of reach in today's global economy. But I am here \ntoday to tell you it doesn't have to be that way. We can revitalize the \nAmerican dream.\n  I have full confidence in our ability to meet these challenges and \nreach new heights of discovery prosperity, and progress. Passing the \nRight TRACK Act that I've introduced today is an important step towards \nensuring that the American dream remains attainable for generations to \ncome, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 2358. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \nHospital Quality Report Card Initiative to report on health care \nquality in Veterans Affairs hospitals; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 2359. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative under the Medicare \nprogram to assess and report on health care quality in hospitals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould expand and improve quality reporting for our Nation's hospitals \nthrough the establishment of a national Hospital Quality Report Card \nInitiative.\n  Study after study has documented that health care quality in the \nUnited States is inconsistent and inadequate. The landmark 2003 RAND \nreport by Beth McGlynn found that the chance of Americans getting \nrecommended care is not much greater than the flip of coin. For many \nconditions, the chances are even worse--only about a third of diabetics \nand a quarter of patients with atrial fibrillation and hip fractures \nreceive the right treatment, as do only about 10 percent of patients \nwith alcohol dependence. Patients are suffering, and the financial \ncosts of poor care are staggering. We can and must do more to ensure \nthat every patient gets the right care, at the right time, in the right \nway.\n  One way to help improve health care quality is to measure and report \nthe quality of care in our nation's hospitals. Hospital quality reports \ncan help patients and consumers choose the hospital that will best \nserve their health needs. Purchasers and payers can use hospital \nquality information to help their decision-making about where employees \nand members can go for care. Hospitals and health care professionals \nwould similarly benefit from identification of areas of need, and \nopportunities for quality improvement and cost containment. And \nfinally, with greater quality reporting and transparency, we can begin \nto have an honest dialogue about health care quality and how to reform \nour health care system.\n  Several States have already developed and implemented hospital report \ncard initiatives, and I am proud to say that Illinois began its own \nreport card initiative in January of this year--an initiative that I \nspearheaded when I served in the Illinois State Senate.\n  On the national level, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(CMS) and the Hospital Quality Alliance have partnered to identify and \nencourage submission of quality measures for several health conditions, \non a voluntary basis, in exchange for greater federal reimbursement. \nThe Deficit Reduction Act codified this initiative earlier this year.\n  The Hospital Report Card Act, which I am introducing today, takes \nquality measurement one step further, by mandating that the Secretary \nexpand and improve upon current quality reporting for hospitals. Within \n18 months, the Secretary would establish a formal Hospital Report Card \nInitiative, and publish reports on individual hospital quality using \ndata submitted for the value based purchasing program at CMS, but also \nincluding other data available to the Secretary. The report cards would \nreport quality measures that align with those used in the National \nHealthcare Quality Report, including measures of effectiveness, safety, \ntimeliness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, and equity. In addition, \nthe report cards would provide information on other quality priorities \nfor patients, such as staffing levels of nurses, rates of infections \nacquired in hospitals, volume of procedures performed, and availability \nof specialized care. The Secretary would also report measures of \nrelevance to a number of priority populations, including women, \nchildren and minorities.\n  The bill requires the Secretary to take steps to ensure that all \nreported data is accurate and fairly represents hospital quality, and \nthat hospitals have an opportunity to participate in the development of \nthe report card initiative. I also want to make sure that sick patients \nhave full access to the best hospitals, and so the report cards will \nrisk-adjust quality data, so that hospitals are not inadvertently \npenalized for caring for more challenging patient populations.\n  We are hearing a lot of rhetoric about patient empowerment and \nconsumer-driven health plans. However, we can't expect patients to make \nthe best choices for their health care in the absence of accurate \ninformation on quality and costs. Similarly, we can't expect hospitals \nto recognize their areas of deficiencies or strengths without a \ncritical look inwards. Finally, we can't expect the Nation at large to \nsupport and embrace healthcare reform without greater awareness of \nquality problems.\n  The Hospital Quality Report Card Act will help the Nation take one \nstep closer to improving health care quality and containing costs, and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in passing this critical legislation.\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2360. A bill to ensure and promote a free and open Internet for \nall Americans; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a headline in today's Wall Street Journal \nwarns consumers that they will soon face a ``pay to play'' Internet \nwhere those businesses and consumers who want to continue to see equal \ncontent get equal treatment will have to pay more. Rather than let them \ncontinue to have the freedom to choose whatever content, applications \nand services they want, the big network operators want to control the \ncontent consumers can access. Allowing the big network operators to \ndiscriminate on the Net is bad news for consumers, small businesses, \nschools, libraries, nonprofits and any other user who enjoys their \nfreedom of access.\n  That is why today I am proposing legislation that will codify the \nprinciple of network neutrality. I want consumers, small businesses and \nevery other Internet user to continue to enjoy tomorrow the full array \nof content, service and applications they enjoy today.\n  My legislation, the Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006, will \nestablish the principle of network neutrality by requiring the \noperators of the network to treat all content on the Internet equally. \nIt will ensure transparency so that everyone can easily determine all \nrates, terms and conditions for the provision of any communications. \nTransparency coupled with a complaint process before the Federal \nCommunications Commission will encourage compliance.\n  This legislation has been developed in consultation with a number of \nconsumer groups and businesses, and I ask unanimous consent the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Non-Discrimination \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n     the Internet has grown robustly. Today, Americans are \n     changing how they access the Internet, moving from dial-up to \n     broadband for their home connections. According to the Pew \n     Internet and American Life Project, 72 percent of Americans \n     use the Internet and 59 percent of Americans with home \n     Internet have a high-speed Internet connection.\n       (2) Americans use the Internet for many daily activities. \n     Over 17 percent of Americans have sold something over the \n     Internet. Everyday, approximately 60,000,000 Americans use \n     search engines to get access to information. 80 percent of \n     Americans have looked online for health care information. In \n     growing numbers, Americans are using the Internet to place \n     phone calls, watch their favorite televisions shows or \n     movies, and play games.\n       (3) The growth of the Internet and its success are due in \n     large part to the freedom that has always existed on the \n     content and applications layer of the Internet. Innovation \n     has thrived on this layer, as anyone with a good idea has the \n     ability to access consumers. The continuation of this freedom \n     is essential for future innovation.\n       (4) Freedom on the content and applications layer has also \n     led to robust competition for retail goods for consumers. \n     Consumers can shop at thousands upon thousands of retailers \n     from their home computers, including small businesses located \n     miles away in other towns, States, and even countries.\n       (5) Such freedom is leading to the development of important \n     new entertainment offerings, on-demand video and movie \n     purchases, Internet Protocol television, and enhanced gaming \n     options. The entertainment options available in the future \n     will only be limited by the bandwidth that can be used and \n     the innovation of people all over the world.\n       (6) Despite the growth of the Internet and increased access \n     to the Internet for Americans, there is very little choice in \n     who provides them high-speed Internet access. According to an \n     April 2005 White Paper by Harold Feld and Gregory Rose, et. \n     al., entitled, ``Connecting the Public: The Truth About \n     Municipal Broadband'' only 2 percent of Americans get high-\n     speed Internet access from someone other than their local \n     phone company or cable provider. According to the Federal \n     Communications Commission, approximately 20 percent of \n     Americans do not have a high-speed Internet access provider \n     that offers them service.\n       (7) As more and more Americans get high-speed access to the \n     Internet without having much choice of who their provider \n     will be, it is important that Congress protect the freedom on \n     the Internet to ensure its continued success.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the National Commission on Surveillance \nActivities and the Rights of Americans; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the Presidents Day recess, I spoke \nabout recent egregious examples of domestic surveillance by the \nexecutive branch, and I announced my intention to introduce legislation \nto establish a commission to investigate the instances of warrantless \nwiretapping and spying on U.S. citizens by the National Security Agency \nand other departments of Government.\n  I am not the lone voice raising questions about the legality of this \nprogram and its effect on the rights of law-abiding American citizens. \nI am only one--only one--in a growing chorus--a growing chorus--of \nconcerned individuals. Since the New York Times broke the story of the \nNSA's wiretapping program, many in this Chamber on both sides of the \naisle have questioned the legality of the warrantless wiretapping and \nhave called for investigations into possible violations of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, as well as other transgressions against \nthe spirit or the letter of our revered Constitution.\n  Many of our country's foremost constitutional scholars and professors \nof law have expressed their categorical opposition to the NSA's \nprogram, citing possible violations of both the Constitution and the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They agree that ``the program \nappears on its face''--on its face--``to violate existing law.''\n  These concerns have, of course, been dismissed by the same branch of \nGovernment that hatched the domestic spying program. Did you hear that? \nI will say it again. These concerns have been dismissed by the same \nbranch of Government that hatched the domestic spying program. But this \nstonewalling--yes, that is stonewalling--this stonewalling is only part \nof the story. Important questions about NSA's program have been \nanswered with strained and tenuous justifications or claims of the dire \nneed for secrecy and, as a result, Congress's access to information has \nbeen severely--severely, severely--curtailed, by whom? By whom? Guess \nwhat, by the administration; by the administration.\n  There are some things we do know. We know that top officials in the \nDepartment of Justice who were concerned about questions of legality \nand lack of oversight of the program refused to endorse continued use \nof the NSA's wiretapping. That isn't all. We also know because of these \nconcerns this secret program was suspended. Do you get that? This \nsecret program was suspended temporarily due to questions about its \nlegality.\n  What most Americans don't know is that FBI agents complained about \nthe utility of the wiretapping program. Voluminous amounts of \ninformation and records that were gleaned from this secret \neavesdropping program were sent from the National Security Agency to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FBI officials repeatedly \ncomplained that they were being drowned by a river of useless \ninformation that\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\ndiverted their resources from pursuing important counterterrorism work. \nSuch complaints raise the question of whether the domestic wiretapping \nprogram may have backfired by sending our top counterterrorism agencies \non wild-goose chases, thus making our country less secure instead of \nmaking our country more secure.\n  We know that one member of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt, Judge James Robertson, resigned--yes, resigned--4 days after the \nNew York Times first detailed the NSA's warrantless--warrantless--\ndomestic surveillance. We know that only the chief judge of the FISA \nCourt, the secret court charged with approving requests to conduct \ndomestic surveillance, had any knowledge of this clandestine \nwiretapping program. The other judges, who are sworn to strict secrecy, \nlearned of the program just as many of our citizens did--through \nreports in the press. Yes, thank God for a free press.\n\n  We know that although most of the judges of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court were kept in the dark about the program, at least \none of the judges was tipped off by an attorney within the Department \nof Justice that some of the information being presented to the court to \nsecure warrants was improperly obtained, meaning the Government had \napparently circumvented a court-ordered screening process to eliminate \ntainted evidence.\n  We know that in a February 28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee \nChairman Arlen Specter, Attorney General Gonzales admitted that the \nJustice Department's legal justification for the wiretaps has ``evolved \nover time.''\n  What does that mean? Does it mean that there actually was no legal \nbasis for the NSA to spy on American citizens when it first began the \nsurveillance? Does it mean the Department had to gin up some legal \nbasis for the spying once the program became public? Does it mean the \nadministration's reliance on the use-of-force resolution to justify its \nsnooping was simply a ploy--just a ploy--an ``after the fact'' face-\nsaving device meant to give the administration cover for having \nviolated the civil liberties of Americans?\n  We know that earlier this week, 18 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives sent a letter to President Bush requesting that he \nappoint a special counsel to investigate the NSA's warrantless \nsurveillance of our citizens. In their letter, the House Members noted \nthat with no clear information coming from the administration, they and \nall of America have been forced to rely primarily on press reports to \ndetermine the scope of the NSA's activities.\n  With so many questions unanswered by the administration, it is \nabsolutely imperative that there be an objective investigation of this \nprogram and any violations of law that may have occurred.\n  We are in a supercharged political year--we know that, you know that, \neverybody knows that--an election year for one-third of the Senate, \nincluding this Senator from West Virginia, and for the entire House of \nRepresentatives. And the Senate Intelligence Committee as of today has \nrefused to initiate a serious investigation into this matter. But an \ninvestigation has to go forward. The efficacy of our laws and our \nConstitution is at stake. That is why I am proposing legislation to \nestablish a nonpartisan commission to review and investigate domestic \nsurveillance in America, along with serious allegations of abuse. In \nthis way, we will be sure to safeguard our first and fourth amendment \nrights as enumerated in this Constitution, as well as evaluate the \nactual effectiveness of such programs in combating terrorist threats.\n  James Madison wrote in his essay, ``Political Reflections,'' that \n``[t]he fetters''--the fetters, f-e-t-t-e-r-s--``[t]he fetters imposed \non liberty at home have ever been forged out of the weapons provided \nfor defense against real, pretended, or imaginary dangers from abroad.\n  No one is suggesting that the threat of terrorist attacks is anything \nbut a real threat, and one that must be of the Congress's utmost \npriority. But the suggestion that the American people would be safer in \ntheir homes if they just forego their constitutionally protected rights \nis a deliberately deceptive assertion that may forge the fetters that \nbind law-abiding citizens. Make no mistake about it: It is these ill-\nconceived strictures that may ultimately destroy precious liberties.\n  In fact, it is because our forefathers were fearful of re-creating \nthe same tyrannous form of government from which many of them had fled, \nthat the Bill of Rights--the Bill of Rights, those first 10 \namendments--the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution to better \nsecure for all time--all time--the freedom from oppression that ever \nlooms from an overly powerful executive. Get that. Get that. Let me say \nthat again. It was because our forefathers, thank God, were fearful of \nre-creating the same tyrannous, the same tyrannical form of government \nfrom which many of them had fled that the Bill of Rights was added to \nthe Constitution to better secure, for all time, the freedom from \noppression that ever looms from an overly powerful executive. And you \nbetter believe it. You better believe it. Hear me. Hear me now. I will \nalways speak out against an all-powerful executive, under either party.\n  In a climate of fear, liberties have been sacrificed time and again \nunder the guise of keeping the Nation from harm. Fear. Yes, fear is a \npowerful tool for manipulation; useful for easing the American people \nout of their liberties and into submission. Fear. When the public is \nconfronted with a situation, real or imagined, that inspires fear, the \npublic rightfully look to their leaders--look to their leaders, Mr. \nPresident--for protection from foreboding consequences. The claim of \nwartime necessity always strengthens the hands of a President. Let me \nsay that again. The claim of wartime necessity always strengthens a \nPresident, any President, Republican or Democrat. And often facts are \nsealed from the prying eyes of Congress by a purported need for \nsecrecy.\n  But Senators, and that includes this Senator from West Virginia, \nSenators have a sworn duty--a sworn duty, a sworn duty--sworn right up \nthere at that desk with their hand on the Bible--the holy Bible, the \nholy Bible, the holy Bible--with their hand on the Bible to check \nexecutive power. We have to be on guard every moment of every day. The \nexecutive branch, whether it be Democratic or Republican, is always \nreaching--always reaching, always reaching--always grabbing more power, \nmore power, more power, and we have to be on guard. We have a sworn \nduty to check executive power and, as long as I live, I am going to \nstand for the checking of the executive power; I don't care whether it \nis a Democrat or Republican in the White House or an Independent. It \nmakes no difference. We have a sworn duty. We swear. We put our hand on \nthe Bible before God and man, and we swear to check executive power at \nall times--at all times--in times of crisis or otherwise. Each of us \nhere, and there are 100 here, and each of this 100, 100 Senators, we \nare each bound to defend the Constitution and each bound to defend the \nliberties that the Constitution gives to all Americans, at all times, \nin times of peace and in times of war.\n  History has shown us many times that a climate of fear can take a \nhefty toll on our freedoms. That is your freedoms. That is your \nfreedoms. That is your freedoms. Worse still are liberties surrendered \nin vain, resulting in little added security.\n  There is no doubt that constitutional freedoms will never be \nabolished in one fell swoop--never--for the American people cherish \ntheir freedoms, and they would not tolerate such a loss if they could \nperceive it; if they could see it coming, if they could hear it, if \nthey could feel it, if they could perceive it. But the erosion of \nfreedom rarely comes as an all-out frontal assault; rather, it is \ngradual, noxious, creeping, cloaked in secrecy and glossed over by \nreassurances of greater security.\n  The American people are a people born of sacrifice, and the \nsacrifices that the American people are willing to endure speak well of \nthe tenacity and the strength that makes the United States of America \nwhat it is. Some may be tempted to accept on blind faith the \nadministration's--any administration's, any administration's--promise \nof increased security, and they may see it as a duty to capitulate \ntheir rights for that flimsy promise. May we all pause to reflect on \nthe hard-won liberties--the hard-won liberties--for which earlier \ngenerations fought and\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\ndied. Remember Nathan Hale. He died. He regretted that he had but one \nlife to give, to lose, one life to lose for his country. Remember \nPatrick Henry: ``Give me liberty or give me death,'' he said. John Paul \nJones: ``We have only begun to fight.''\n  So may we all pause to reflect, as we have just done, on the hard-won \nliberties for which earlier generations fought and died before we \neasily accept convincing rhetoric. Rhetoric is cheap. Talk is cheap. To \nsuggest that innocent Americans surrender rights to preserve freedom is \na false choice. It is also a slippery slope, one that is fraught with \never more secrecy and the certainty of egregious abuses of our Bill of \nRights and of our laws over time.\n  The commission that I propose would determine how to best protect the \nhomeland, as well as the most effective ways of gathering needed \nintelligence. It will examine the procedures for the NSA's use and \nretention of intelligence obtained without warrants, and the method and \nscope of dissemination of such information to other agencies. It will \ninvestigate any questions raised by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court concerning the legality of the domestic spying \nprogram. It will examine the obligation of the President--do you get \nthat? Do you hear that, Mr. President? Republican or Democrat. It will \nexamine the obligation of the President to brief Members of Congress--\nnot just one or two or three or four--on warrantless surveillance of \nAmerican citizens. It will lift the fog--lift the fog--of secrecy and \nclandestine government activity misaimed at law-abiding citizens and \nperhaps, most importantly, it will shed much needed sunshine--let the \nsunshine in--much needed sunshine on any unlawful or unconstitutional \nexecutive--executive, executive intrusions into the lives of ordinary \nAmericans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2364. A bill to provide lasting protection for inventoried \nroadless areas within the National Forest System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise along with Senators Bingaman, \nHarkin, Lautenberg, Boxer, Lieberman, Clinton, Menendez, Akaka, Dodd \nand Kerry to introduce the Roadless Conservation Act of 2006.\n  Since Teddy Roosevelt established the national forest system 100 \nyears ago, we have cherished these amazing public lands. They have \nprovided both timber for our economy, and quiet solace for our souls. \nHowever, only a fraction of the vast natural forests that once covered \nour nation remain. I believe it is our duty to protect these lands \nbefore we have no natural forest legacy to pass on to our children.\n  Simply put, the Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2006 represents a \nbalanced and reasoned approach to forest management on untouched public \nlands. This legislation reasserts safeguards in place in 2001 to \nprotect our nation's the last remaining pristine forest lands, 58.5 \nmillion acres, from logging, road-building, and other environmentally \ndamaging development. In Washington State alone there are 2,015,000 \nacres of National Forest system lands that qualify for protection as \nRoadless areas under the legislation.\n  The bill would prohibit new road construction or reconstruction in \ninventoried roadless areas while maintaining opportunities for hunting, \nfishing, hiking, mountain-biking, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing \nand other forms of outdoor recreation in our National Forests.\n  The legislation also includes a number of important exemptions to \nallow new road construction for human health and safety, oil and gas \ndevelopment, and other previously approved economic activities, such as \nski trails.\n  What is more, it allows for hazardous fuels reduction, forest \nstewardship projects, and targeted economic activities. This \nlegislation also helps address the serious fiscal challenge presented \nby the more than $8.6 billion dollar maintenance and reconstruction \nbacklog on the 386,000 miles of existing U.S. Forest Service roads.\n  Of course, this might not sound new. And you'd be right. In many \nways, we've travelled these roads before. The Clinton Administration \nfinalized the Roadless Area Conservation Rule in January 2001, \nfollowing three years of official review and public participation, over \n600 public meetings--45 public meetings in Washington state alone--and \nhearings on each National Forest and in each Forest Service region.\n  During his confirmation hearing I asked Attorney General John \nAshcroft if the administration would uphold the Roadless regulation. He \npledged that he would. In May 2001, then-USDA Secretary Ann Venemen \nalso pledged that the administration would stand by the Rule.\n  But that's not what happened. Through a series of subtle yet \nunmistakable steps the administration has allowed these protections to \nbe undermined steadily. They've rolled over for logging companies and \ndevelopers. They've cooked up loopholes for State-based petitions or \nsettlements that could weaken or eliminate the protections afforded to \nthese unique lands. And finally, in May of 2005, they dropped the \npretense altogether when the U.S.D.A. Forest Service repealed the 2001 \nRoadless Area Conservation Rule, eliminating these vital roadless \nforest land protections.\n  The need for action today is more urgent than ever. These are \nnational forest lands that provide unmatched outdoor recreation \nopportunities, critical fish and wildlife habitats, and promote clean \ndrinking water for millions of Americans. This bill would not apply or \neffect state, tribal, county, municipal, or private lands and does not \nimpact existing U.S. Forest Service roads, trails, or activities on \nthose roads and trails.\n  The 2001 Roadless Rule has received unprecedented public support, \nincluding over four million comments submitted to the U.S. Forest \nService asking that it not be overturned. Most recently, over 250,000 \nAmericans, including over 100 current and former Olympic athletes, have \nfiled a formal petition under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) \nto reverse the Bush Administration's decision to eliminate the 2001 \nRule. This legislation enjoys the support and endorsement of such \ngroups as National Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the Heritage \nForests Campaign, the Wilderness Society, and the Sierra Club.\n  I've worked to protect these pristine forest lands since the day I \ncame into office, and I'll keep fighting to make sure this bill gets \nsigned into law. We've heard it loud and clear: Americans don't want to \nsee their hunting, fishing, and hiking areas turned into a reckless \npatchwork of road-building, logging, and mining.\n  Let's act today and pass the Roadless Conservation Act of 2006. The \nAmerican people and future Americans deserve nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Roadless Area Conservation \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is a compelling need to establish national \n     protection for inventoried roadless areas of the National \n     Forest System in order to protect the unique social and \n     ecological values of those irreplaceable resources;\n       (2) roadless areas protect healthy watersheds and their \n     numerous benefits including--\n       (A) protecting downstream communities from floods and \n     tempering the effects of drought;\n       (B) ensuring a supply of clean water for domestic, \n     agricultural, and industrial uses;\n       (C) helping maintain abundant and healthy fish and wildlife \n     populations and habitats;\n       (D) providing the setting for many forms of outdoor \n     recreation; and\n       (E) providing drinking water to millions of citizens from \n     the more than 354 municipal watersheds found on roadless \n     areas;\n       (3) maintaining roadless areas in a relatively undisturbed \n     condition--\n       (A) saves downstream communities millions of dollars in \n     water filtration costs; and\n       (B) is crucial to preserve the flow of affordable, clean \n     water to a growing population;\n       (4) the protection of roadless areas can maintain \n     biological strongholds and refuges for many imperiled species \n     by halting the\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n     ongoing fragmentation of the landscape into smaller and \n     smaller parcels of land divided by road corridors;\n       (5) roadless areas conserve native biodiversity by serving \n     as a bulwark against the spread of nonnative invasive \n     species;\n       (6) roadless areas provide unparalleled opportunities for \n     hiking, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting, \n     fishing, cross-country skiing, canoeing, mountain-biking, and \n     similar activities;\n       (7) while roadless areas may have many wilderness-like \n     attributes, unlike wilderness areas, the use of mechanized \n     means of travel is allowed in many roadless areas;\n       (8) roadless areas contain many sites sacred to Native \n     Americans and other groups that use roadless areas for \n     spiritual and religious retreats;\n       (9) from the inception of Federal land management, it has \n     been the mission of the Forest Service and other agencies to \n     manage the National Forest System for the dual purposes of \n     resource extraction and conservation;\n       (10) consistent with that dual mission, this Act--\n       (A) protects social and ecological values, while allowing \n     for many multiple uses of inventoried roadless areas; and\n       (B) does not impose any limitations on the use of, or \n     access to Nation Forest System, State, or private land \n     outside inventoried roadless areas;\n       (11) establishing a consistent national policy for the \n     protection of inventoried roadless areas--\n       (A) ensures that the considerable long-term ecological and \n     economic benefits of protecting roadless areas for future \n     generations are properly considered;\n       (B) diminishes the likelihood of controversy at the project \n     level; and\n       (C) enables the Chief of the Forest Service to focus on the \n     economic and environmental benefits of reducing hazardous \n     fuel buildups in portions of the landscape that already have \n     roads;\n       (12) the National Fire Plan indicates that fires are almost \n     twice as likely to occur in roaded areas as in roadless \n     areas, because roadless areas are generally located further \n     away from communities and are harder to access;\n       (13) the report entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining \n     Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' \n     (65 Fed. Reg. 67480) advocates a higher priority for fuel \n     reduction on land that is near communities and readily \n     accessible municipal watersheds;\n       (14) the Forest Service has an enormous backlog of \n     maintenance needs for the existing 386,000 mile road system \n     of the Forest Service that will cost millions of dollars to \n     eliminate;\n       (15) no State or private land owner would continue to build \n     new roads in the face of such an enormous backlog;\n       (16) failure to maintain forest roads--\n       (A) limits public access; and\n       (B) causes degradation of water quality and wildlife and \n     fish habitat; and\n       (17) protection of roadless areas--\n       (A) will impact less than 0.5 percent of the national \n     timber supply; and\n       (B) will have a negligible impact on oil and gas production \n     because--\n       (i) the entire National Forest System provides only \n     approximately 0.4 percent of the quantity of oil and gas that \n     is produced in the United States; and\n       (ii) roadless areas provide only a fraction of the quantity \n     of oil and gas that is produced in the National Forest \n     System.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide, within \n     the context of multiple-use management, lasting protection \n     for inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest \n     System.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 388\n\n       Whereas the people of Sudan have been devastated by war for \n     all but 10 years since Sudan gained its independence in 1956;\n       Whereas the second civil war in Sudan between the \n     Government of Sudan in the north and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement in the south lasted for more than 20 \n     years;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 people died and more than \n     4,000,000 people were internally displaced or became refugees \n     as a direct or indirect result of the civil war in Sudan;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement signed the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended Sudan's 21-year \n     civil war;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for a \n     new constitution, new arrangements for power sharing and \n     wealth sharing, and a 6-year interim period to be followed by \n     a referendum in Southern Sudan so that the people of Southern \n     Sudan can decide their political future;\n       Whereas the parties have implemented parts of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement, such as the ratification of \n     the new constitution and the formation of the Government of \n     National Unity and the Government of Southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the overall pace of implementation of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement has been slow and insufficient;\n       Whereas the recommendations of many of the commissions \n     established by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement have yet to \n     be implemented;\n       Whereas 1 of the keys to a lasting and durable peace in \n     Sudan is the full and timely implementation of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement by all sides, wholly consistent \n     with the letter, spirit, and intent of the agreement;\n       Whereas, despite the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement and an end to the civil war, there has been little \n     progress made in ending the genocide in Sudan's western \n     region of Darfur;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have \n     died in Darfur as a result of violence, disease, and \n     malnutrition, and millions more have been internally \n     displaced or sought refuge in refugee camps in neighboring \n     Chad;\n       Whereas millions of the people across Sudan continue to \n     suffer from the effects of war, including displacement and \n     war-related disease, hunger, and malnutrition;\n       Whereas the United States and the international community \n     must not neglect the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of \n     the people of Southern Sudan;\n       Whereas, according to the World Food Program, more than \n     2,900,000 people in Southern Sudan have been severely \n     affected by the civil war;\n       Whereas the people of Southern Sudan are in desperate need \n     of reconstruction assistance to build and improve vital \n     infrastructure components, such as an education system, a \n     health care system, and a transportation system, that are \n     nearly nonexistent in Southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the current humanitarian crisis in Southern Sudan \n     is considered 1 of the worst in decades; and\n       Whereas the reconstruction process in Southern Sudan is \n     vital to delivering the benefits of peace to the people of \n     Southern Sudan and stability to the region: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly urges the new Government of National Unity of \n     Sudan to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in \n     a timely manner consistent with the letter, spirit, and \n     intent of the agreement;\n       (2) calls on the Government of National Unity to meet the \n     terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to achieve an \n     equitable distribution of wealth and resources between the \n     North and the South and to provide a full and transparent \n     accounting of Sudan's oil revenues;\n       (3) urges the United States Government--\n       (A) to maintain appropriate pressure on the Government of \n     National Unity to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement;\n       (B) to maintain sanctions and pressure on the Government of \n     National Unity until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement has \n     been fully implemented and the crisis in Darfur has been \n     resolved; and\n       (C) to address, as appropriate, any legal barriers which \n     prevent humanitarian and reconstruction operations in \n     Southern Sudan;\n       (4) supports the continued provision of humanitarian and \n     reconstruction assistance from the United States to the \n     people of Southern Sudan, in addition to the assistance \n     allocated for the people of Darfur, so that the people of \n     Sudan may experience and appreciate the benefits of peace;\n       (5) strongly urges the Government of National Unity to use \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the basis for \n     negotiation of a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in \n     Darfur and other areas of Sudan; and\n       (6) strongly urges all countries in the region and the \n     international community to support actively the full \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1658-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n  SA 2899.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of S. Res. 388, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 388) urging the Government of the \n     National Unity of Sudan and the Government of Southern Sudan \n     to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that was \n     signed on January 9, 2005.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I applaud my Senate colleagues for \nsupporting this resolution urging all parties in Sudan to implement \nfully the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan's decades-long \ncivil war.\n  For more than 50 years, Sudan has been plagued by war and violence. \nIn fact, since gaining independence in 1956, the people of Sudan have \nknown only 10 years of peace. But, last January, following painstaking \nnegotiations and numerous unsuccessful attempts at peace, the \nGovernment of Sudan in the north and the Sudan People's Liberation \nMovement in the south signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, \nbringing an end to Sudan's second civil war that lasted more than 20 \nyears.\n  This second civil war led to the deaths of more than 2 million \npeople, and an additional 4 million were internally displaced or became \nrefugees. I have visited Sudan on a number of occasions, and I have met \nwith the victims and survivors of this tragedy. The CPA offers the \nSudanese people a chance at a peaceful and secure life. It is time for \nthe agreement to be fully implemented.\n  In the past year, the government of Sudan and the SPLM have taken \nconcrete steps to implement certain parts of the CPA. For example, the \ntwo sides have ratified a new national constitution and have formed a \ngovernment of National Unity in Khartoum and a Government of Southern \nSudan based in Juba in the south.\n  However, the overall pace of implementation has been slow and \ninsufficient, and both parties have failed to meet certain benchmarks \nor adopt the recommendations of the commissions established to monitor \nthe CPA's implementation. These include the formation of Joint \nIntegrated Units, which aim to integrate forces from both the north and \nthe south, a more equitable distribution of resources between the north \nand the south, and a full and transparent accounting of Sudan's oil \nrevenues.\n  The implementation of the CPA is particularly urgent for the people \nof Southern Sudan. In this region alone, the World Food Program \nestimates that more than 2.9 million people were severely and adversely \naffected by the civil war.\n  Last month, I met with Mrs. Rebecca Garang. She currently serves as \nthe Minister for Roads and Transport for the Government of Southern \nSudan. She is also the wife of the late John Garang, the long-time \nleader of the SPLM who successfully negotiated the CPA but died \ntragically in a helicopter crash last summer.\n  During our talks, Mrs. Garang stressed the humanitarian and \nreconstruction needs of the Southern Sudanese people. They are in \ndesperate need of assistance to build and improve vital infrastructure \ncomponents such as an education system, a health care system, and a \ntransportation system that are virtually non-existent in Southern \nSudan.\n  At the end of the current six-year interim period, the CPA provides \nfor the people of Southern Sudan to decide their own political future \nin a referendum. But in order to achieve John Garang's vision of a new, \nunited Sudan, the people of Southern Sudan must see the tangible \nbenefits of peace.\n  Implementing the CPA can also have a positive impact on ending the \ngenocide in Sudan's western region of Darfur. Unfortunately, since the \nsigning of the agreement, little progress has been made in ending this \ngenocide. Hundreds of thousands have already died as a result of \nviolence, disease, and malnutrition. And, millions more have been \ninternally displaced or continue to languish in refugee camps in \nneighboring Chad.\n  However, the CPA can serve as a basis for a peacefully negotiated end \nto the genocide in Darfur. For this reason, it is even more vital for \nthe full and complete implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement.\n  Until that time, the United States should continue to apply pressure \non the Government of National Unity in Khartoum to fully implement the \nCPA. This includes maintaining the sanctions that are currently in \nplace.\n  In addition, we need to continue to expand our humanitarian and \nreconstruction assistance to the people of Southern Sudan. Delivering \nto them the real benefits of peace will strengthen their support of the \nCPA and for a united Sudan.\n  During my travels to Sudan, I have heard first-hand accounts of the \nviolence, suffering, and insecurity endured by so many in Sudan. Much \nof the Sudanese population has never known or experienced any sustained \nperiod of peace, stability, or security. This needs to change.\n  Those in leadership in Sudan need to proceed with full implementation \nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

Res. 388\n\n       Whereas the people of Sudan have been devastated by war for \n     all but 10 years since Sudan gained its independence in 1956;\n       Whereas the second civil war in Sudan between the \n     Government of Sudan in the north and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement in the south lasted for more than 20 \n     years;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 people died and more than \n     4,000,000 people were internally displaced or became refugees \n     as a direct or indirect result of the civil war in Sudan;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement signed the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended Sudan's 21-year \n     civil war;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for a \n     new constitution, new arrangements for power sharing and \n     wealth sharing, and a 6-year interim period to be followed by \n     a referendum in Southern Sudan so that the people of Southern \n     Sudan can decide their political future;\n       Whereas the parties have implemented parts of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement, such as the ratification of \n     the new constitution and the formation of the Government of \n     National Unity and the Government of Southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the overall pace of implementation of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement has been slow and insufficient;\n       Whereas the recommendations of many of the commissions \n     established by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement have yet to \n     be implemented;\n       Whereas 1 of the keys to a lasting and durable peace in \n     Sudan is the full and timely implementation of the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement by all sides, wholly consistent \n     with the letter, spirit, and intent of the agreement;\n       Whereas, despite the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement and an end to the civil war, there has been little \n     progress made in ending the genocide in Sudan's western \n     region of Darfur;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have \n     died in Darfur as a result of violence, disease, and \n     malnutrition, and millions more have been internally \n     displaced or sought refuge in refugee camps in neighboring \n     Chad;\n       Whereas millions of the people across Sudan continue to \n     suffer from the effects of war, including displacement and \n     war-related disease, hunger, and malnutrition;\n       Whereas the United States and the international community \n     must not neglect the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of \n     the people of Southern Sudan;\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the World Food Program, more than \n     2,900,000 people in Southern Sudan have been severely \n     affected by the civil war;\n       Whereas the people of Southern Sudan are in desperate need \n     of reconstruction assistance to build and improve vital \n     infrastructure components, such as an education system, a \n     health care system, and a transportation system, that are \n     nearly nonexistent in Southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the current humanitarian crisis in Southern Sudan \n     is considered 1 of the worst in decades; and\n       Whereas the reconstruction process in Southern Sudan is \n     vital to delivering the benefits of peace to the people of \n     Southern Sudan and stability to the region: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly urges the new Government of National Unity of \n     Sudan to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in \n     a timely manner consistent with the letter, spirit, and \n     intent of the agreement;\n       (2) calls on the Government of National Unity to meet the \n     terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to achieve an \n     equitable distribution of wealth and resources between the \n     North and the South and to provide a full and transparent \n     accounting of Sudan's oil revenues;\n       (3) urges the United States Government--\n       (A) to maintain appropriate pressure on the Government of \n     National Unity to implement fully the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement;\n       (B) to maintain sanctions and pressure on the Government of \n     National Unity until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement has \n     been fully implemented and the crisis in Darfur has been \n     resolved; and\n       (C) to address, as appropriate, any legal barriers which \n     prevent humanitarian and reconstruction operations in \n     Southern Sudan;\n       (4) supports the continued provision of humanitarian and \n     reconstruction assistance from the United States to the \n     people of Southern Sudan, in addition to the assistance \n     allocated for the people of Darfur, so that the people of \n     Sudan may experience and appreciate the benefits of peace;\n       (5) strongly urges the Government of National Unity to use \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the basis for \n     negotiation of a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in \n     Darfur and other areas of Sudan;

Res. 383\n\n       Whereas, the April 8, 2004, N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement, \n     calling for an end to hostilities in Darfur, Sudan, has been \n     flagrantly violated by all parties to the agreement;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to commit crimes \n     against humanity and engage in genocidal acts in Darfur;\n       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \n     between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/\n     SPLA) on January 9, 2005, has not resulted in an improvement \n     of the security situation in Darfur;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \n     indicated that, ``People in many parts of Darfur continue to \n     be killed, raped, and driven from their homes by the \n     thousands.'';\n       Whereas United Nations officials have stated that at least \n     70,000 people have died due to violence and insecurity in \n     Darfur, but that the total may be as high as 400,000 people;\n       Whereas nearly 2,000,000 people have been internally \n     displaced, 3,000,000 people are dependant on international \n     assistance to survive, and over 200,000 people are refugees \n     in neighboring Chad due to the conflict in Darfur;\n       Whereas escalating tensions along the border between Chad \n     and Sudan have increased instability in Darfur;\n       Whereas neither the mandate nor the troop strength of the \n     African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) is adequate to protect \n     civilians in Darfur;\n       Whereas the United States has demonstrated leadership on \n     the Sudan issue by having United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations John Bolton, in his \n     first action as President of the United Nations Security \n     Council, request in February 2006 that Secretary-General \n     Annan initiate contingency planning for a transition from \n     AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation;\n       Whereas, although the United Nations Security Council has \n     concurred with this recommendation and taken steps toward \n     establishing a United Nations peacekeeping mission for \n     Darfur, it could take up to a year for such a mission to \n     deploy fully;\n       Whereas, as the deteriorating security situation in Darfur \n     indicates, the people of Darfur cannot wait that long for \n     security to be reestablished;\n       Whereas the international community currently has no plan \n     to address the immediate security needs of the people of \n     Darfur; and\n       Whereas all members of the international community must \n     participate in efforts to stop genocide, war crimes, and \n     crimes against humanity in Darfur: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly condemns--\n       (A) the continued attacks on civilians in Darfur by the \n     Government of Sudan and Government-sponsored militias; and\n       (B) the continued violations of the N'Djamena Ceasefire \n     Agreement by the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur, \n     particularly the Sudan Liberation Army;\n       (2) commends the Africa Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) for \n     its actions in monitoring the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement \n     in Darfur and its role in diminishing some acts of violence;\n       (3) calls upon all parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire \n     Agreement--\n       (A) to abide by the terms of the N'Djamena Ceasefire \n     Agreement; and\n       (B) to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the \n     conflict in Darfur;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan immediately--\n       (A) to withdraw all military aircraft from the region;\n       (B) to cease all support for the Janjaweed militia and \n     rebels from Chad; and\n       (C) to disarm the Janjaweed;\n       (5) calls on the African Union to request assistance from \n     the United Nations and NATO to strengthen its capacity to \n     deter violence and instability until a United Nations \n     peacekeeping force is fully deployed in Darfur;\n       (6) calls upon the United Nations Security Council to \n     approve as soon as possible, pursuant to Chapter VII of the \n     Charter of the United Nations, a peacekeeping force for \n     Darfur that is well trained and equipped and has an adequate \n     troop strength;\n       (7) urges the President to take steps immediately to help \n     improve the security situation in Darfur, including by--\n       (A) proposing that NATO--\n       (i) consider how to implement and enforce a declared no-fly \n     zone in Darfur; and\n       (ii) deploy troops to Darfur to support the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan (AMIS) until a United Nations peacekeeping \n     mission is fully deployed in the region; and\n       (B) requesting supplemental funding to support a NATO \n     mission in Darfur and the African Union Mission in Sudan \n     (AMIS);\n       (8) calls upon NATO allies, led by the United States, to \n     support such a mission; and\n       (9) calls upon NATO headquarters staff to begin prudent \n     planning in advance of such a mission.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, both of these resolutions have to do with \nthe Sudan, a country where for the last really 23 years there has been \nreal turmoil in terms of a civil war underway that is addressed in part \nunder S. Res. 388, the Sudan Peace Agreement, and then, more recently, \nover the last 3 years, in a western part of Sudan, the Darfur region, \nwhere we have seen genocide underway, as we have spelled out on the \nfloor over the last year and talked about.\n  Both of these resolutions address a human tragedy that has played out \nover the last several years. The first, the Sudan Peace Agreement, is a \nreaffirmation of a peace agreement which has been made that we need to \nsupport. And it is probably the only way we can reverse what has been a \ntragedy that has killed about 2 million people and caused 5 million \npeople to be displaced from their homes throughout Sudan over the last \n23, 24 years.\n  The Darfur crisis is one that we have described on this floor many \ntimes. And as we have followed it, since February a year and a half \nago, things have gotten better and worse and better and worse. Right \nnow they are not going very well. So I appreciate Senators Biden and \nLugar putting forth that resolution.\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1661-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1661-S1662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY SITUATION IN DARFUR, SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2363, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2363) to extend the educational flexibility \n     program under section 4 of the Education Flexibility \n     Partnership Act of 1999.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the extension we are passing tonight of the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act.\n  I authored the original legislation to create Ed-Flex, as it is more \ncommonly known, back in 1999 after learning through my chairmanship of \nthe Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education about the excessive \nred tape attached to Federal education funding.\n  I listened to school administrators and education leaders who told me \nagain and again about the bureaucratic challenges they faced when \ntrying to improve education.\n  After seeing how a demonstration project involving 12 States achieved \nsuch impressive results in improving student performance, I wrote \nlegislation to expand the program to all 50 States.\n  The Ed-Flex program gives greater flexibility to States in using \nFederal funds in exchange for greater accountability for student \nachievement.\n  The program does not change the amount of funding available--but it \neliminates some of the strings attached. Schools must still use the \nFederal funds for the purposes for which they were designed, and \nhealth, safety, civil rights, and disabled requirements cannot be \nwaived.\n  Ed-Flex was an early attempt at education reform aimed at improving \nstudent achievement, and paved the way for the No Child Left Behind Act \njust 2 years later.\n  It allows educators to find new ways of improving the quality of \neducation for every child, and it set the stage for acknowledging the \nconnection between flexibility and accountability in improving student \nperformance.\n  Ed-Flex encourages innovation within America's schools and allows our \nstudents the opportunity to succeed academically and globally.\n  I thank Senator Burr for his leadership on this extension of Ed-Flex, \nand for the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir recognition of this important tool for America's students.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2363) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today the Senate overwhelmingly, finally \nadopted the PATRIOT Act conference report with a vote of 89 to 10. We \nspent a great deal of time considering this bill, and I am pleased and \nrelieved that we reached a final conclusion on this important \nlegislation. It has a very careful balance of civil liberties and at \nthe same time guarantees elimination of that barrier between law \nenforcement and our intelligence community to make sure that men and \nwomen and children and families are protected here in our homeland. It \nhas been tough to get to this point with a lot of negotiation and a lot \nof delay and postponement, but finally we have completed that important \nbill.\n  We are now considering the LIHEAP bill, and we hope to complete \naction on that bill early next week. Also, next week we will begin work \non the lobbying reform measure. We made progress on the whole effort of \nlobbying reform both in the Government Affairs Committee today, as well \nas in the Rules Committee earlier in the week.\n  Next week we will be busy with votes each day as we work through \ninitially LIHEAP and then the lobbying bill. Tomorrow I will have more \nto say on both the sequencing and timing of the lobbying bill and \nLIHEAP. The next votes will occur on Monday at 5:30 in the evening on \nthe confirmation of three district judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/02/senate-section/article/S1662-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
